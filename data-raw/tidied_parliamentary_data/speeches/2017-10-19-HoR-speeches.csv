Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources and Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


On 1 July 2016, the coalition government delivered reforms to country-of-origin labelling to provide a clearer, simpler system that enables Australians to clearly see where their food comes from and the proportion that comes from our nation.


Surveys have shown that consumers want this information at their fingertips. Seventy-four per cent of Australians think it's important to be able to identify the country of origin of their food, and 73 per cent agreed that changes to food labelling were required.


We were very proud to bring forward these changes. We've listened and acted. As a result of the work we've already done, everyday Aussie brands like Sanitarium, KR Castlemaine, COON and Cracker Barrel cheese, Beechworth Honey and Carman's muesli are proudly displaying their home-grown products with their new country-of-origin labelling.


The Imported Food Control Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2017 is an important final step in implementing these reforms for the Agriculture and Water Resources portfolio.


From 1 July 2018, all applicable food must comply with the labelling requirements set out in the Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016. This standard was made under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and provides a more consumer-focused regulatory framework.


The standard will replace the existing country-of-origin labelling, which many found very confusing, for food in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, which will be repealed on 1 July 2018.


This bill will amend the Imported Food Control Act 1992to incorporate the standard made under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.


Incorporating the standard will ensure authorised officers can continue to enforce the country-of-origin labelling requirements for imported food products. It will also ensure that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources can continue its role in enforcing country-of-origin labelling at the border.


The amendments will ensure that it will be business as usual for imported food inspected at the border.


Debate adjourned.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Minister for Small Business) (10:20):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Australian War Memorial, Treloar E Large Technology Objects Store Project, Mitchell, ACT.


As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the Australian War Memorial is proposing to construct a single-level storage facility on the Commonwealth-owned site at Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory, to accommodate the planned acquisition of large technology objects. The Treloar collection's storage facility at Mitchell is an essential asset and the Australian War Memorial's conservation facility and store for large pieces of military equipment, including aircraft, vehicles, boats, missiles and guns. There is an immediate requirement for increased collection storage, as there is a significant planned handover of collections from the Department of Defence once additional storage capacity is available. These include a P3C Orion, an FA18 Classic Hornet, and Seahawk and Squirrel naval helicopters, which are due to be retired in the coming decade. 


The project will provide approximately 5,288 square metres of total floor space. No internal fit-out is proposed. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $16.1 million, excluding GST. This includes a provision for contingencies, cost escalation and associated professional fees. The committee has conducted an inquiry and it is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth, and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I'd like to thank the committee for, once again, undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in January 2018 and is expected to be completed by December 2018. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: HMAS Cerberus Redevelopment, Western Port Bay, Victoria.


As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the Department of Defence is proposing to remediate and upgrade facilities and infrastructure at HMAS Cerberus to better support Navy and Australian Defence Force training operations and base-support services functions. HMAS Cerberus, located at Western Port Bay in Victoria, is the principal and largest training establishment of the Royal Australian Navy, with approximately 6,000 training places annually, over 300 courses, with an average of 1,100 trainees on courses at any one time throughout the year. The project will provide opportunities to improve current site environmental conditions by addressing inefficiencies in engineering services. The project will have a positive social and economic benefit for the region, with the total number of personnel engaged by the project estimated at 1,100 over the proposed delivery time frame.


The estimated cost to deliver the project is $463.1 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs, management and design fees, information communication technology, fittings and equipment, contingencies and allowance for escalation. The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for, yet again, undertaking a timely inquiry.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (10:33):  As I started to say in my speech yesterday, Labor does not support mandatory minimums. We know that they can lead to fewer prosecutions and convictions, sometimes leading juries to acquit rather than sentence, and can conflict with the role of the judiciary. People will not have an incentive to plead guilty or inform the police on others' actions if they know they face a mandatory sentence. It builds in the incentive to fight and appeal against convictions. Even former Prime Minister John Howard has previously commented:


… as a matter of principle I don't agree with mandatory sentencing … in the end I do think these matters ought to be determined by judges and magistrates.


It's a shame Mr Howard isn't getting rolled out for his opinion on mandatory sentencing.


The Law Council of Australia has urged the Senate to reject mandatory sentencing in bills, because of the real risk of unintended consequences with potentially life-shattering outcomes. There is no evidence that mandatory sentencing has the effect of reducing crime rates. Dangerously, this particular piece of legislation will have the unintended consequence of the proposed mandatory minimums possibly applying to teenagers. Examples of this provided in the Law Council of Australia's submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee included: an 18-year-old sexting a 15-year-old would lead to a mandatory sentence of five years for the 18-year-old; an 18-year-old sending an intimate image to a 15-year-old would lead to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for the 18-year-old; and where a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old might be sharing sexual images with each other in a consensual relationship, the day the older partner turns 18, the 18-year-old would be looking at an automatic five-year sentence. I agree these things may be criminal and, in accordance with the law, those people should be punished, but I'm not sure that the punishment of a five-year minimum sentence would serve that particular crime. We want responsible use of the internet and mobile messaging by our kids and teenagers—I have three children: a 15-year-old, an 11 year-old and a nine-year-old—and I would not find one person who disagrees with that. I hope that our kids are sensible and don't engage in such behaviour, but, if they do, I don't want them to go to jail for a mandatory minimum term of five years.


The financial impact of this bill is stated as being largely limited to the costs associated with housing federal prisoners, and its overall financial impact on the states and territories will be negligible. This is yet another example of the Turnbull government fudging the figures on this. They have cut $184 million from the Australian Federal Police funding in the 2017-18 budget. This significantly reduces our federal law enforcement's capacity to hunt down perpetrators of this crime. The AFP needs funding to fight the paedophile rings that operate on our doorstep. This is a global challenge for our law enforcement agencies and the AFP; it reaches far beyond our borders. Children are being enslaved by paedophile rings with links to Australia, and sexual acts with adults are being live-streamed over the internet. These crimes are horrendous. Children are being held as sex slaves known as 'pay-per-view'. The children are routinely raped and that is streamed live via encrypted online video. The Australian reported that last year the AFP assessment centre received more than 8,000 reports of child exploitation. As of 21 September, it has already received more than 6,776 reports of child exploitation for this calendar year. These criminals are producing thousands and thousands of sexually explicit materials, depicting children being abused and brutalised. We must stop the online exploitation of children, and we must stop it within our communities.


Labor always has and always will fight to protect children here and overseas from exploitation, abuse and sexual crimes. We are proud of our record under the Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments, and our achievements include—some of them we are all incredibly proud of—in 1994 introducing world-leading offences targeting Australians who engage in the sexual abuse of children overseas; bringing federal, state and territory governments together in 2009 to implement the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, which includes a funding commitment of $63.6 million over four years from the Commonwealth government; introducing new child abuse offences and protection measures in 2010; and establishing the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse—the first inquiry of this type at a national level. The royal commission, among other things, inquired into how systems have failed to protect children. It made many recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to sexual abuse in institutions. I look forward to the Redress Scheme. Labor's achievements also include appointing Australia's first National Children's Commissioner in 2013 to advocate for the rights of Australia's young people in and introducing the vulnerable witness act in 2013.


We can always do more to protect our kids. I am a parent raising the first generation of social media users. We all have a responsibility to keep our kids safe whilst using the internet. We need to be aware of how much time our kids are on the internet and educate them about the possible dangers of chatting with people on the internet. We can sit with the kids and explore the internet together and monitor the sites they use. We can lock certain sites down and have software that monitors our children's email and social media. We can also check with our kids' schools and other schools in our communities as to what safety measures are in place to make sure our kids can talk with us about what is happening online. They need to be cybersafe. We will be voting for this bill but we will be seeking to amend it in the Senate, as I have pointed out. We need to make this something that we do together, make it tougher and not use it as political pointscoring. We need to make it more effective, because we know this is the best way to stop sexual offenders. 


I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work done by a community group in my community, called the Queen of Hearts Foundation, and the founder and director of that organisation, Michelle Ellery. In 2014 the Queen of Hearts Foundation was established in my community to run a community based resource centre that supports men, women and children. Their mission is to protect kids and support survivors of child sexual abuse and domestic violence on their journey for justice and healing. I would like to take this opportunity to read into Hansard how incredible the work is that they are doing for those vulnerable children who have been victims of sexual abuse. I must admit that, when I first learned of the incredible work that was being done, I had to remind myself we were still in Australia and these things still happen, irrespective of how much we all want them not to. So I thank them for their work and I put on record my thanks and gratitude for all that they do.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2017-10-19,"



Mr IRONS

 (
Swan
) (
10:40
):  I rise to speak in support of the measures contained in this bill, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017, which is the greatest crackdown on paedophiles in a generation. I have to agree with the member for Lindsay that we shouldn't do any political pointscoring on this issue. This is something that should be bipartisan. I have spoken about child sex abuse in this place many times, as someone who has family members who experienced it and because of my involvement with the apology to the 'forgotten Australians' and getting up the royal commission into sexual abuse and my continued ongoing patronage of CLAN and other organisations that support people who are no longer called the 'forgotten Australians' but referred to as survivors and also people who have experienced the horror of sexual abuse in institutions under the care of governments, churches and also private institutions.


I have had a number of different jobs in my time. To this day being a dad to my son, Jarrod, is probably the most important job I have ever had in my life. I am sure that all members would agree with me when I say that to victimise and abuse a child is one of the lowest forms of human behaviour. The only other thing I could think of that would be worse, maybe, is murder. The welfare of the children in our society is paramount. I am proud to have been Jarrod's father. As parents we go to extreme lengths to ensure the safety of our children. From the day they enter our lives, we become their most fierce protectors and we do our very best to keep our little ones safe and secure.


But in this job, as members of parliament, we have the capacity to extend these lengths to ensure the protection of every Australian child who doesn't have that protection, safety and security from their parents in their own homes and in our society. In my time as the member for Swan, child abuse is something that I have actively campaigned on. In my maiden speech I said I wanted to bring focus to the national issue of institutional child sex abuse and I shared the story of Shellay Ward, the seven-year-old girl who died in 2007 of starvation after years of abuse and being seriously neglected by her parents. What sort of society do we live in where a seven-year-old girl can starve to death under the nose of neighbours and the bodies that are set up by governments to protect children? Over the following 10 years, I have met with countless victims of child sex abuse—victims who bravely gave evidence during the royal commission, victims who suffered at the hands of those who they trusted and victims who have spent their lives recovering from the trauma of their childhoods. This is why it is so important to support this legislation. I have seen adults who were abused as children collapse under the trauma of their abuse. They have been broken by their childhoods and many have had long battles with depression or addiction and have required ongoing medical assistance. Many of them have chronic health issues that they deal with on a daily basis. Others have tried to move forward with their lives but have shared with me the struggles they have endured, noting difficulties in all aspects of their lives—in their work, in their relationships and when they have had children of their own.


Child abuse hasn't just happened in institutions. It happens in children's own homes. It happens at the hands of guardians. It happens at the hands of strangers and online, as we have heard from other members who have contributed to this debate. It is not exclusive to any demographic, nor is it exclusive to any neighbourhood or region of our country. We have an entrenched system that is failing the children of Australia.


I would like to share with the House a couple of stories. I refer first to a story not in our country but in New Zealand with the story of two half-sisters, Saliel Aplin and Olympia Jetson, of Masterton, New Zealand. They were two beautiful girls who fell victim to the broken system that existed. Their story spans 10 years. There were 10 years where they could have been removed from the physical and sexual abuse they faced, but instead they were returned to their abusers again and again. Saliel was born in February 1989 and was the second child of Charlene Aplin. In November 1990, Charlene had Olympia Jetson, who was followed by two more children in the following two years.


In 1992, Charlene Aplin applied for a nonviolence order and spent time in a women's refuge. By 1993, Charlene had reconciled with her husband, but after further domestic violence and court involvement the marriage ended. At the end of the year, Charlene Aplin contacted police, concerned that the girls may have been suffering from sexual abuse. Evidence was inconclusive, and the girls received counselling. In 1994, Saliel and Olympia's elder sister repeated the sexual abuse allegations. Police were once more called, but no evidence was found. The counselling was continued. I saw a program on CI which featured this particular episode. These girls were submitted to a situation where they had to give evidence to the police in front of their abuser. Of course, they weren't going to reveal the details in front of their abuser. This is how ridiculous the system is.


Soon after, Charlene Aplin began a relationship with Bruce Howse. In March 1994, Charlene Aplin contacted Child, Youth and Family—CYF—and the police after a dispute between her and Howse. It is alleged Saliel and Olympia, at the ages of five and three respectively, had suffered injuries inflicted by Howse. In an interview the following month with CYF, the children reported physical abuse by Howse again. By the middle of May 1994, all Charlene's children were removed and placed with her parents. By the end of the year, Charlene reported to CYF that she was concerned that her parents were not caring adequately for her children. This woman complained her parents weren't looking after their grandchildren and she wanted to return them to an abusive situation. This is how silly our systems are.


On 1 August 1996, the court ruled that Saliel, Olympia and their brother could return to their mother and the abuser, Howse. By November, their eldest sisters returned to live with them and, by Christmas, Howse's five other children were also living with them. In April 1997, Charlene Aplin again took legal steps to protect herself from Howse, but soon the couple reconciled again. In October 1999, Charlene Aplin and Howse had a daughter. Domestic violence was reported to the authorities on several occasions and eventually Charlene left Howse and took all the children to her parents' home again, the home where she thought they weren't being looked after.


In 2000, after living with her parents for six months, Charlene Aplin moved the family to Ashhurst, and Howse attempted to take the baby from the house. The police were called. A separate violent incident saw police called again. The family moved to Woodville briefly, before returning to Masterton, where Aplin again reconciled with Howse. At the end of September, Howse left home after a violent incident. Soon after, he returned home and abducted the baby. Charlene Aplin retrieved the child and further fights ensued before another reconciliation.


In 2001, Charlene Aplin was pregnant again. She and Howse briefly separated but again reconciled. The pregnancy wasn't easy, and Olympia and Saliel were often left on their own in the care of Howse and their elder sister whilst their mother spent time in hospital. In July, another baby girl was born. After the following three months, on 3 August, Olympia's school contacted Charlene Aplin to say that Olympia had made an accusation of sexual abuse. By the following Monday, she had withdrawn that accusation.


On 20 November, a fight erupted between Howse and Charlene Aplin. The police were called and Howse was taken to his son's address. He phoned Charlene Aplin several times that night threatening to kill them all. He returned to the home the next day and was asked to leave permanently. Howse said Aplin had no legal right to keep him out of the house. On 1 September, Saliel had an argument with Howse and told him she was going to nark on him. Two days later, on 3 December 2001, Saliel and her little sister Olympia were stabbed. Each received a single knife wound. They both died in the early hours of 4 December, having bled to death, stabbed by their abuser, their stepfather. This followed a decade of physical and sexual abuse not by one but by two men. The system had failed them, and it fails so many children around Australia and in other countries around the world. This is why this legislation is what's needed to defeat these people, to put them away and to never let them have contact with children again. If I had my way, I would bring back capital punishment for people like that. This man got 28 years in jail. Hopefully he'll rot and die in jail, because that's what he deserves. 


Child sexual abuse is one of the most heinous crimes. To rob a child of their childhood—to abuse those too young to understand or those too afraid to say no—is monstrous. I have another example. I met a woman who, from the age of eight to 14, was raped by her stepfather continually for six years. The only way they found out was the fact that she fell pregnant. This is back in the late seventies in Victoria. She was taken to court. It was one of the first ever sexual abuse court cases in Victoria. The stepfather got 2½ years jail. That is not satisfactory; that is not protection for children. 


For too long our laws have been inadequate. The bill introduces reforms which criminalise emerging forms of child sexual abuse and strengthen community protections from child sex offenders. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 targets all aspects of the child sex offender cycle by strengthening measures at the time of charging, bail, sentencing and upon release. Under the new laws, child sex offenders will spend longer in jail and will be less likely to be granted bail and parole. There has been some discussion that there shouldn't be mandatory sentencing. My support for mandatory sentencing for these people is absolute. They will face mandatory minimum sentences and be closely supervised following their release. They shouldn't be released. 


The advancement of technology has seen emerging forms of child sexual abuse. These laws are adding an offence of providing electronic services to facilitate dealings with child abuse material. As it currently stands the code doesn't specifically criminalise the provision of electronic services—for example, website or chat fora, often hosted on the dark web—to facilitate online dealings with child abuse material. This amendment bill will make it an offence for a person to provide an electronic service with the intention that the service be used for access to child abuse material. 


We have heard some doubts in this area, in that teenagers might end up in jail. I can tell you a story about a young Aboriginal child in the north of Western Australia who lived in a community where his abusers were his own peers. He was seven and his abusers were 10, 11 and 12, and he was repeatedly raped by these abusers. It is in the environment where these kids live and grow up that we need to take hold of these situations and address these issues. This kid eventually became involved in a system that taught him self-respect, and the abuse stopped; he was so proud, and he wore a special T-shirt. Then the government withdrew funding for that program. It amazes me that as a society we can see something that is working successfully to protect children and then we withdraw funding that assists in those areas. If it takes emotion and the necessary hard line to protect children in our society, that is what we need. 


The amendments in this bill also add an offence of grooming third parties using the post or a carriage service to procure children for sexual activity. These measures also clarify that live-streamed child abuse is captured in existing Criminal Code offences. Recently in the UK there was a story about people grooming children online. When the authorities got into the system, they found that over 3,000 children not only had been groomed online but had been blackmailed to take photos performing sexual acts for the people who put themselves up as their peers and friends online, and then they abused them. These men were all from the Middle East, aged from 21. This is the type of stuff we need to stop. The new offences will criminalise the transmission of communications using these services to a third party who is not the child victim, with the intention of making it easier to procure a specific child for sexual activity. 


The coalition's new laws ensure the sentencing of child sex offenders is reflective of the gravity of this type of offending. For too long we've read news stories of paedophiles being released on parole after a menial sentence that in no way represents the years of damage their actions have caused—and there is a stat regarding the time they spend in jail. These new laws also increase penalties for certain offences, including grooming offences and offences for using a carriage service to engage in sexual activity. 


Since 2012, only 58.7 per cent of those convicted of Commonwealth child sex offences have received a term of imprisonment. This will stop that. That 58.7 per cent of child sex offenders will go to jail. They need to go to jail. That's over half of those sentenced walking free after committing these types of crimes.


In closing I'd like to thank the minister for bringing this legislation on a subject that is dear to my heart. My sister suffered sexual abuse and in the process died, when she was very young, at the age of 12. This is the type of thing we need. We need stronger laws and we need to be far more specific about what we are going to do with these people. I would like to thank those on the other side of the chamber who have supported this for the speeches and contributions they've made on this legislation as well. This is something that we can do as a parliament and as individuals.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (10:55):  I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017. There is no-one in this chamber who wouldn't agree that the changes we're seeing in society, the changes we're seeing with the internet around child sex abuse and in making it easier for a lot of things to happen that have never happened before because the internet didn't exist—that all of this is really frightening. When my two children were young there was no access to the internet for them. There was no social media. In a very short time the online world has, sadly, made our children more vulnerable.


There is huge growth in the number of people who are viewing and sharing child abuse images. The volume is so large that the Australian Federal Police can't investigate and prosecute more than a very small proportion of the crimes. The AFP receive more than 10,000 reports of child sexual exploitation every year. That's the known number, but it would appear that children often do not report disturbing online activity, even when the offender attempts to contact them outside the internet. If we just look at online grooming, sexual solicitation incidents: in a significant US study, only one-quarter of the children who had encountered a sexual approach reported it to a parent, and only 10 per cent of approaches were reported to the police, to the internet service provider or to any other authorities, such as a teacher. Very little research has been undertaken on the impact on children of these attempted solicitations. The same study indicates that approximately a quarter of the children who had been solicited for sexual purposes reported being extremely upset or afraid, with younger children—those 10 to 13 years—reporting a greater adverse impact. In spite of that, they're not necessarily reporting what we all know is a crime.


Similar findings have been reported in the small Australian survey of adolescent students. Only one-quarter of the children who had been sexually solicited told a parent. No reports were made to police. One-third of the children didn't disclose the solicitation at all. These studies, known as the Finkelhor and NAPCAN studies, provide support for the view that children often keep cyberfriendships—that's the name they're given—a secret from parents and sometimes friends.


We know there is a crime happening there. We have a real problem. Sexual predators are making use of technology on apps that the rest of us use every day, like Snapchat, FaceTime and Skype. Not just Australian children, but children in countries all over the world, are victims of cyber sex abuse. The modern day patterns of behaviour and the use of technology that enable 21st century paedophiles and criminals to harm our children are a frightening evolution of these disgusting people. So reforms that target and punish the offenders are welcome in this bill. We will vote for this bill and wholeheartedly support the object of keeping children safe. There are many things we support in this bill, including the new grooming offences that are contained in it, and the clarification that this bill provides on the scope of some of the child sex offences that are contained in the Criminal Code.


I particularly support the change in terminology. As a former journalist I know words are not something that you take lightly. They have meaning and implications for people. I support the change in words to describe the material in question. 'Child abuse materials' is a much stronger phrase than 'child pornography', which doesn't recognise the seriousness and exploitation of these images. Children are harmed in their creation, but the abuse is repeated every time someone else views those photos, and each of those people should be punished.


In their efforts to be tough on the sexual predators of children, though, I think the government have failed to take the really tough steps that should be put in place for the sake of children everywhere. That's why we will move amendments in the Senate to ensure that the punishment fits the crime. We want to see higher maximum sentences. We believe courts should be able to lock up the worst offenders for life. Predators who go overseas to prey on vulnerable children should face tougher penalties. We want to see the laws better recognise and respond to the technological ability offenders have to watch child abuse remotely through webcams and live streaming, and are sure that this is as much a crime as being in the same room as a child who is being sexually abused. We want to see the people who incite or direct the production of child abuse material—for instance, in online chat rooms—face severe penalties for encouraging people to do hideous things to children. 


We want to see these people punished, we want them off the streets and we also want policies that work. Sadly, mandatory sentencing doesn't work, and I'm going to speak about that in a little bit more detail. There are a number of other amendments that we will move. As an example, we think that the defence based on a valid and genuine marriage, which currently exists for child sex offences, should be removed. Both the Law Council of Australia and Anti-Slavery Australia have called for this. 


I add that, if you're serious about protecting children—which I believe everybody in this place is—why would you slash the Australian Federal Police budget? They are already unable to investigate the reports that they get. The AFP suffered a $184 million cut in the last budget, and 151 AFP officers have been let go this year. Seriously, a bill won't make up for the fact that the capacity to enforce the law has been weakened by this government. 


I turn to the issue of mandatory sentencing. We do reject the mandatory minimum sentences in this bill because they won't work and they lead to fewer convictions. And that's not something any of us want to see; we want to see more convictions. The government's own Attorney-General's Department says that mandatory minimums should be avoided, as they can create an incentive for defendants to fight the charges, even in clear-cut cases. What that means is that victims are more likely to need to go to court—to go through a torturous court process—simply because of the application of mandatory minimum sentences. 


Mandatory minimum sentences also mean that there is less incentive for people to plead guilty or to provide information to the police. We need the people who are identified and caught to spill their guts about the other people who are involved in these heinous crimes. We need to have leverage to be able to get information out of them. This is not just me, the member for Macquarie, having an opinion. This is looking at the facts and the evidence, and what that evidence shows us is that mandatory sentencing does not provide that opportunity. Mandatory sentencing means there's less incentive for people to plead guilty, and the other side of it is that juries are less willing to convict. We see, time and time again, that juries are much happier to make a conviction. That's what the evidence shows. You need only talk to the Law Council of Australia to see that evidence. 


Lest there be any doubt about Labor's record in this area—and I would really urge the government to consider these things closely, not have some knee-jerk political reaction to them—Labor always has and always will fight to protect children here and overseas from exploitation and abuse.  


We're proud of our record under Prime Ministers Keating, Rudd and Gillard, which included introducing world-leading offence categories targeting Australians who engage in sexual abuse of children. That was in 1994. We brought federal, state and territory governments together in 2009 to implement the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, which included a funding commitment of $63.6 million over four years from the Commonwealth government. We introduced new child abuse preparatory offences and other protection measures in 2010. We established the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the first inquiry of its kind at a national level. The royal commission, among other things, has inquired into how systems have failed to protect children and made recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to child sexual abuse that occurs in institutions. We appointed Australia's first National Children's Commissioner in 2013 to advocate for the rights of Australia's young people, and we introduced the vulnerable witnesses act in 2013. We are committed to doing everything that can be done to protect children from harm and abuse, and we wholeheartedly support the object of this bill. We have no tolerance for child sexual abuse.


In the time that remains, I would like for a moment to put aside the fact that mandatory minimum sentencing is an easy, populist, but costly and discriminatory, criminal justice policy that has never actually worked and look at the fact that mandatory minimum sentencing also ignores judicial discretion. Judicial discretion is at the heart of our criminal justice system. It allows the law to be applied to the immeasurable ways in which a crime presents itself. If we remove judicial discretion, we may as well give the gavel to a robot—and yes, we're talking about child sex offenders. Unless those opposite have a crystal ball that allows them to know every way in which a crime will present itself, I think it is safer for us to look at the history of mandatory minimum sentencing and take our lessons from that.


There has been case after case where mandatory minimum sentencing has not worked. The impact of introducing mandatory sentencing for property offences in the Northern Territory in 1997 is an example of how vital judicial discretion is. I'm going to give you one example that unfortunately speaks volumes—that of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy, Johnno, who stole pencils. He was taken from his remote community in the Northern Territory and imprisoned 800 kilometres away in Darwin. His mum had passed away when he was a baby, his father had been killed in a motor accident a few years prior, and at the time of his trial and sentencing his grandmother, who was his primary carer, was in hospital. But, in the hands of the jurisdiction with mandatory minimum sentencing, none of that could be taken into account. Johnno didn't need jail time to pull him into line. As it turned out, jail time in fact was the worst answer to this question. Five days out from the end of his sentence, Johnno hung himself with his bed sheet in his cell.


This isn't the same, and I know that those on the other side will say, 'Yeah, but that was pencils,' but this is a principle that runs through our legal system. Without the subjective guidance and discretion of judges we find ourselves in situations where kids are sentenced to jail for stealing pencils. The Law Council of Australia told the Senate committee inquiry that there would be similar unintended consequences. For instance, there could be conduct in a relationship between a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old where images are exchanged and sexual stories shared, yet the day the older partner turns 18 they could be liable for mandatory prison time. That is a potential unintended consequence of this legislation and a key example of why the Law Council opposes mandatory sentencing in all forms.


I point out that the government's own Attorney-General's Department says mandatory minimums should be avoided. This is not political. Prominent Liberals, including former Prime Minister John Howard, members opposite and Senator Marise Payne, have expressed concern about mandatory minimum sentencing in the past. I urge the government not to play politics with this issue. We are on the same side. We all want to see harsher penalties. In fact, as our amendments that will be moved in the Senate will show, we want harsher penalties than those opposite want. Children are too important for there to be word games around this issue. The Labor Party is serious about justice for the victims of sex crimes and appropriate punishment for those who commit these crimes. Like those opposite, we have no tolerance for the sexual abuse of children. That is why each of us is standing here today proposing that this bill go further, that this bill be harder, because these crimes should be met with the harshest of sentences, and it is best that we leave the judges to do the judging.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (11:10):  It's with a heavy heart that I rise today—not because I don't support this bill, but because we need to enact legislation to try to prevent child sexual abuse. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 represents tough new laws. It represents the greatest crackdown on paedophilia in a generation. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but I also say it takes a village to protect a child. I want to thank the member for Swan, and the previous speaker, for their contributions. The member for Swan's contribution was heartfelt and a significant contribution to the debate.


Before I address the House in relation to the specifics of this bill, I would like to recognise a campaign that is being run by YGAP. We held a morning tea for it in my office yesterday. YGAP promotes a campaign called Polished Man, which seeks to raise awareness of sexual and physical violence against children. We had a number of people from this House come to my office yesterday to support the Polished Man campaign, and I would like to point them out specifically. They were: the Chief Government Whip, Nola Merino; the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, Angus Taylor; the member for Wide Bay, Llew O'Brien; the member for Bonner, Ross Vasta; the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson; the member for Dunkley, Chris Crewther; and the member for Mackellar, Jason Falinski. This is not just a 'this side of the House' thing. It was also supported by members opposite, for which I'm very grateful: the member for Burt, Matt Keogh, and the member for Macarthur, Dr Mike Freelander. Importantly, the Minister for the Environment and Energy was there, and, most importantly, the Prime Minister also came and showed his support. The Prime Minister said, 'As we know, not all acts of disrespecting women or children lead to violence, but that's where it begins.' This is about respecting the women and children in our lives and showing them love. That is when we are closest to being our very best and when we are closest to God—when we are showing love. All of us have a vested interest and a duty to look after all of our children.


This event yesterday in my parliamentary office followed a similar morning tea that we had in my own electorate in Fisher, where I had prominent sporting men and businessmen attend the event, such as: Chris Flannery, the CEO of Sunshine Coast Falcons; Matt Soper-Lawler, the winger and top try scorer for the Sunshine Coast Falcons; Jack Hansen, the head coach of Alexandra Headland Surf Club; Ashley Robinson, the general manager of Alexandra Headland Surf Club and the chairman of the Sunshine Coast Falcons; Clayton Williams, a local businessman; and Peppi Bueti, a local businessman. The media got behind us as well, as they did yesterday. People like Danielle Ford, Dan Toney, Charles Hodgson and Hailey Francis painted nails to support the cause of Polished Man.


People might ask: 'Why polish a nail? What's that got to do with sexual assault against children?' I think it would be fair to say that most men don't walk around with a polished nail. The purpose of the Polished Man campaign is to engender a conversation, particularly amongst men, so that we can start to drive a culture in our country that speaks up against violence against children—that we as men, in particular, say, 'Enough is enough.' It is utterly unacceptable for men to disrespect women and children by committing acts of violence against them and even more so when those acts of violence involve acts of sexual violence. For a person to have an instant moment of sexual gratification which will leave a child scarred for life, physically and mentally, is abhorrent and almost beyond words. What is it particularly about some men that they would rather put their own sexual gratification for a short moment above the life of a child who will carry that event with them for the rest of their lives? It's a rhetorical question, but I will never understand that attitude.


According to the World Health Organization, 150 million girls and 73 million boys worldwide under the age of 18 have experienced sexual violence. Just ponder on this: one child dies every five minutes around the world at the hands of an adult. That is part of the significance of Polished Man. We wear a polished nail on one out of our five fingers as one child dies every five minutes. All funds raised in the Polished Man campaign go to trauma recovery and trauma prevention programs for children who've suffered or who are at risk of suffering from violence and sexual violence around the world.


I turn now to the bill. This bill provides a comprehensive re-examination of the way in which we deal with those who commit the most heinous of crimes against our children. It amends various provisions that we currently have in our Criminal Code. It amends vulnerable witness protection measures to prevent children and other vulnerable witnesses from being cross-examined at a committal proceeding. We all know—well, some may not, but, as barrister of 16 years, I can tell you—this is an experience that many children find harrowing.


The bill also seeks to introduce a presumption against bail for certain Commonwealth child sexual offences. If a person is charged with an offence against a person, there should be a presumption against bail. They should be in a show-cause position where they have to show cause for why it is that they should get bail. It is not a landmark concept. Offences of violence in Queensland put an accused person in a show-cause position.


These provisions include additional factors which must be taken into account when sentencing federal offenders to ensure they are appropriate, given the nature of the offending. They create a presumption in favour of an actual term of imprisonment. This amendment will ensure that, unless exceptional circumstances exist, all child sex offenders serve an actual term of imprisonment, rather than receiving sentences that are wholly or partially suspended. It requires that when a court is making a recognisance release order for a child sexual offender the offender be put under supervision, and it sets rehabilitation treatment as a condition unless it's otherwise inappropriate.


The provisions include a presumption in favour of cumulative sentences. Many in this place who aren't legally trained perhaps wouldn't understand that. For example, in the United States we hear about people serving multiple life sentences. In Australia, generally sentences are handed down concurrently—it doesn't matter how many offences you commit; you generally get a sentence which reflects the one sentence. So, if you've committed five offences, you would generally only get a penalty as though it was one. That will not be the case under these provisions, and I think that that's a very good thing. Why do I say that? It is because, if an offender has committed an offence against, say, five or six children, and is sentenced as though it was one person, what does that say to the other four or five kids? What does that say to them? It really demeans the experience that they've been through. This amendment will provide greater disincentive, greater deterrence, for those committing similar offences.


These provisions will list community safety as a factor that can be taken into account to revoke a federal offender's parole without notice. They will require a period of time to be served in custody if parole is revoked.


These provisions will also introduce mandatory sentencing for certain Commonwealth child sex offences. The office of the Commonwealth DPP has advised that it appeals a high number of child sex offence cases due to manifestly inadequate sentences imposed by judges at first instance and for repeat offences. Mandatory minimum sentences will apply to the most serious child sex offences. Mandatory minimum sentences reflect the heinous nature of child sexual abuse. The provisions introduce mandatory sentencing for repeat offenders. Mandatory sentencing schemes will also apply to child sex offenders who have previously been convicted of a child sex offence, including state and territory offences.


Since 2012, only 58.7 per cent of convicted Commonwealth child sex offenders have received a term of imprisonment, and the average for those who do get a term of imprisonment is six months. This issue was raised, interestingly, by a very significant retired District Court judge, Judge Wall QC, who just last week criticised the recent sentences that were being handed down. He mentioned the case not of a child sexual assault but of a physical assault which led to the death of a child. He called them 'manifestly inadequate'. He also said that many of the judges of first instance—trial judges and sentencing judges—are concerned that, if they hand down too harsh a sentence, they'll be slapped down by the Court of Appeal. Whilst I am not a huge fan of mandatory sentencing in all cases, in this case it is called for. In this case, where we have the most heinous of crimes, we need to set a floor. We need to set a minimum so that judges can't go underneath that minimum. The Labor Party has itself supported mandatory minimum sentences in relation to child- and people-smuggling laws.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2017-10-19,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (11:26):  I thank all the members of this House who have contributed to this debate, and also colleagues on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who scrutinised the bill and recommended that it be passed. In particular I want to thank members who shared their personal stories and convictions—they have expressed a commitment to act against the scourge of child sex offending. However, it's important, if we're going to take action and if we believe that people who commit these crimes need to be appropriately punished, that all of this bill be passed. I genuinely thought that the parliament would come together and pass the totality of this bill in a bipartisan way. That was my expectation. That was what had happened when we announced that we were cracking down on child sex tourists and taking away their passports. Within two hours of our making that announcement, the Leader of the Opposition got up and pledged the Labor Party's support of that measure.


Unfortunately, after a month of prevarication, apparently the Labor Party is going to move to amend this bill in the Senate. By doing so they will cut out the heart of this bill, which is to make sure that people who are committing horrendous acts against children actually serve time in prison. I think most Australians would be pretty shocked to know that only 58½ per cent of those convicted of Commonwealth child sex offences spend any time in prison at all. That means over 40 per cent of Commonwealth child sex offenders never spend one day in prison. There's no such thing as a minor Commonwealth child sex offender. They are all horrendous offences. To deal with that and to make sure that people are getting appropriate punishments for the harm that they have caused, we will insist that the courts apply mandatory minimum sentences that reflect the gravity of the crime that has been committed. We don't believe that having over 40 per cent of convicted paedophiles spend not even a day in prison is acceptable. We don't believe that having the most common length of time served by those that actually serve a prison sentence be just six months is remotely acceptable. I'm surprised anyone in this chamber does, quite frankly.


We already know that there's a problem with sentencing. It was confirmed by the High Court just last week in relation to a Victorian sentence, where they found that a sentence of three years and six months imprisonment for unprotected sex with a 13-year-old, which was based on other similarly low existing sentences for such crimes, was manifestly inadequate—confirming, I might say, some of the criticism of lenient sentencing that has been made by members of the government. The opposition knows this. They know that mandatory sentencing—I endorse what the member for Fisher was saying earlier—is not an option we will use in all cases. We use it for crimes which the parliament thinks are particularly serious and where we need to send a signal that people committing these crimes must serve time in prison.


We've done it in this parliament in relation to people-smuggling. The opposition did it, when they were in government, in relation to people-smuggling. Astonishingly, members of the opposition who spoke in that debate in favour of mandatory sentencing are now speaking in this debate against it. This just shows that their opposition to mandatory sentencing is fickle and hypocritical. They introduced mandatory sentencing for people-smuggling when they were in office. We have mandatory sentencing for Commonwealth offences in relation to people-smuggling and we have mandatory sentencing in relation to terrorism offences. The opposition apparently has an ideological objection to mandatory sentencing. If they win next year's election, will they repeal mandatory sentencing for people-smuggling? Will they repeal mandatory sentencing for terrorism offenders? Apparently they've got some objection to mandatory sentencing in principle. Some quite extraordinary claims have been made in this debate that I want to particularly address to show you the furphy of this absurd ideological proposition against mandatory sentencing for paedophiles. It is an absolute nonsense.


We've heard in this debate that mandatory minimum sentences might make juries feel sorry for paedophiles who they think are guilty of crimes and then move to acquit. Well, I have a lot more faith than that in the common sense of the Australian people who sit on juries. I don't believe they'll be moved to feel sorry for people who have abused kids and therefore ensure that they don't serve time in prison. I think that is a ridiculous proposition, quite frankly. We have also heard that if mandatory sentencing were to be approved by the parliament it would be a disincentive for people to plead guilty. But that completely ignores the reality that we have inserted provisions within this bill that would give an incentive for an offender to plead guilty by an appropriate reduction in their sentence. And we've heard that the bill will reduce incentives to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, which again completely ignores the fact that there are provisions within this bill for an appropriate discount for the sentence when offenders have cooperated with law enforcement—a discount of 25 per cent in both the cases I have just raised.


We've also heard—and this has been repeated ad nauseam by members—about this hypothetical case of an 18-year-old who apparently might go overseas and have sex with a 15-year-old, which completely ignores the fact that that is currently a crime. We're not changing the offences here; we're changing the way they are sentenced. Under current law it is, of course, a crime to have sex with somebody who's under the age of consent, which in most states is 16 years. Not only does this bill not apply to those under the age of 18 but the argument completely fails to take into account the safeguard that currently exists within the system that means we haven't seen cases like this prosecuted where it hasn't been predatory behaviour. It is that the AFP must make a judgement that it's in the public interest to investigate and prosecute a crime, and then the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions must do the same. They need to work out whether it's in the public interest for a prosecution to move forward. On a daily basis, they will make a judgement that a particular crime might not meet that threshold. The CDPP and the Australian Federal Police apply these discretions every day. So, regarding this hypothetical example, it's not a new offence. These offences could be prosecuted now. It's never happened before, because there's this discretion within the system. So, why would it happen moving forward? It is a complete red herring.


This government is taking the global lead in making sure that in Australia tough penalties apply to people who prey on children. In a world's first, we have made sure that Australians who are registered sex offenders can't go overseas to prey on children, particularly here in our region. The opposition—to their credit, as I said in my opening remarks—within two hours of our making that announcement pledged their support for that very important measure. These are world's-first changes, and the parliament, because we've got bipartisan support from the opposition, will pass them.


Unfortunately, in relation to this bill, there seems to have been a month of prevarication in which, apparently, the Labor Party, the opposition, were deciding on what they were going to do. Now they have come out on the side of some crazy left-wing ideology against mandatory sentencing, as opposed to joining with the government to send the message that the parliament finds these crimes abhorrent and, if you commit them, you're going to go to prison—something that is not happening now, because more than 40 per cent of convicted paedophiles don't spend a day in prison. That is unacceptable. Why do the opposition think that is acceptable? Why won't they join with us and support mandatory sentencing? 


We are not going to tolerate people preying on our kids. The parliament has to send an appropriate message that the parliament won't tolerate it. I think we will be able to negotiate with the crossbench in the Senate to get this bill passed, because the crossbench is showing a lot more common sense than the Labor Party have been able to show. Apparently, what they are going to do when this bill reaches the floor of the other place is join with the Greens to gut it. They are going to join with the Greens to stop paedophiles from going to prison when they commit these horrendous crimes. I am astonished by that. The Labor Party should hang their heads in shame.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (10:33):  As I started to say in my speech yesterday, Labor does not support mandatory minimums. We know that they can lead to fewer prosecutions and convictions, sometimes leading juries to acquit rather than sentence, and can conflict with the role of the judiciary. People will not have an incentive to plead guilty or inform the police on others' actions if they know they face a mandatory sentence. It builds in the incentive to fight and appeal against convictions. Even former Prime Minister John Howard has previously commented:


… as a matter of principle I don't agree with mandatory sentencing … in the end I do think these matters ought to be determined by judges and magistrates.


It's a shame Mr Howard isn't getting rolled out for his opinion on mandatory sentencing.


The Law Council of Australia has urged the Senate to reject mandatory sentencing in bills, because of the real risk of unintended consequences with potentially life-shattering outcomes. There is no evidence that mandatory sentencing has the effect of reducing crime rates. Dangerously, this particular piece of legislation will have the unintended consequence of the proposed mandatory minimums possibly applying to teenagers. Examples of this provided in the Law Council of Australia's submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee included: an 18-year-old sexting a 15-year-old would lead to a mandatory sentence of five years for the 18-year-old; an 18-year-old sending an intimate image to a 15-year-old would lead to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for the 18-year-old; and where a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old might be sharing sexual images with each other in a consensual relationship, the day the older partner turns 18, the 18-year-old would be looking at an automatic five-year sentence. I agree these things may be criminal and, in accordance with the law, those people should be punished, but I'm not sure that the punishment of a five-year minimum sentence would serve that particular crime. We want responsible use of the internet and mobile messaging by our kids and teenagers—I have three children: a 15-year-old, an 11 year-old and a nine-year-old—and I would not find one person who disagrees with that. I hope that our kids are sensible and don't engage in such behaviour, but, if they do, I don't want them to go to jail for a mandatory minimum term of five years.


The financial impact of this bill is stated as being largely limited to the costs associated with housing federal prisoners, and its overall financial impact on the states and territories will be negligible. This is yet another example of the Turnbull government fudging the figures on this. They have cut $184 million from the Australian Federal Police funding in the 2017-18 budget. This significantly reduces our federal law enforcement's capacity to hunt down perpetrators of this crime. The AFP needs funding to fight the paedophile rings that operate on our doorstep. This is a global challenge for our law enforcement agencies and the AFP; it reaches far beyond our borders. Children are being enslaved by paedophile rings with links to Australia, and sexual acts with adults are being live-streamed over the internet. These crimes are horrendous. Children are being held as sex slaves known as 'pay-per-view'. The children are routinely raped and that is streamed live via encrypted online video. The Australian reported that last year the AFP assessment centre received more than 8,000 reports of child exploitation. As of 21 September, it has already received more than 6,776 reports of child exploitation for this calendar year. These criminals are producing thousands and thousands of sexually explicit materials, depicting children being abused and brutalised. We must stop the online exploitation of children, and we must stop it within our communities.


Labor always has and always will fight to protect children here and overseas from exploitation, abuse and sexual crimes. We are proud of our record under the Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments, and our achievements include—some of them we are all incredibly proud of—in 1994 introducing world-leading offences targeting Australians who engage in the sexual abuse of children overseas; bringing federal, state and territory governments together in 2009 to implement the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, which includes a funding commitment of $63.6 million over four years from the Commonwealth government; introducing new child abuse offences and protection measures in 2010; and establishing the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse—the first inquiry of this type at a national level. The royal commission, among other things, inquired into how systems have failed to protect children. It made many recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to sexual abuse in institutions. I look forward to the Redress Scheme. Labor's achievements also include appointing Australia's first National Children's Commissioner in 2013 to advocate for the rights of Australia's young people in and introducing the vulnerable witness act in 2013.


We can always do more to protect our kids. I am a parent raising the first generation of social media users. We all have a responsibility to keep our kids safe whilst using the internet. We need to be aware of how much time our kids are on the internet and educate them about the possible dangers of chatting with people on the internet. We can sit with the kids and explore the internet together and monitor the sites they use. We can lock certain sites down and have software that monitors our children's email and social media. We can also check with our kids' schools and other schools in our communities as to what safety measures are in place to make sure our kids can talk with us about what is happening online. They need to be cybersafe. We will be voting for this bill but we will be seeking to amend it in the Senate, as I have pointed out. We need to make this something that we do together, make it tougher and not use it as political pointscoring. We need to make it more effective, because we know this is the best way to stop sexual offenders. 


I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work done by a community group in my community, called the Queen of Hearts Foundation, and the founder and director of that organisation, Michelle Ellery. In 2014 the Queen of Hearts Foundation was established in my community to run a community based resource centre that supports men, women and children. Their mission is to protect kids and support survivors of child sexual abuse and domestic violence on their journey for justice and healing. I would like to take this opportunity to read into Hansard how incredible the work is that they are doing for those vulnerable children who have been victims of sexual abuse. I must admit that, when I first learned of the incredible work that was being done, I had to remind myself we were still in Australia and these things still happen, irrespective of how much we all want them not to. So I thank them for their work and I put on record my thanks and gratitude for all that they do.

Mr IRONS

 (
Swan
) (
10:40
):  I rise to speak in support of the measures contained in this bill, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017, which is the greatest crackdown on paedophiles in a generation. I have to agree with the member for Lindsay that we shouldn't do any political pointscoring on this issue. This is something that should be bipartisan. I have spoken about child sex abuse in this place many times, as someone who has family members who experienced it and because of my involvement with the apology to the 'forgotten Australians' and getting up the royal commission into sexual abuse and my continued ongoing patronage of CLAN and other organisations that support people who are no longer called the 'forgotten Australians' but referred to as survivors and also people who have experienced the horror of sexual abuse in institutions under the care of governments, churches and also private institutions.


I have had a number of different jobs in my time. To this day being a dad to my son, Jarrod, is probably the most important job I have ever had in my life. I am sure that all members would agree with me when I say that to victimise and abuse a child is one of the lowest forms of human behaviour. The only other thing I could think of that would be worse, maybe, is murder. The welfare of the children in our society is paramount. I am proud to have been Jarrod's father. As parents we go to extreme lengths to ensure the safety of our children. From the day they enter our lives, we become their most fierce protectors and we do our very best to keep our little ones safe and secure.


But in this job, as members of parliament, we have the capacity to extend these lengths to ensure the protection of every Australian child who doesn't have that protection, safety and security from their parents in their own homes and in our society. In my time as the member for Swan, child abuse is something that I have actively campaigned on. In my maiden speech I said I wanted to bring focus to the national issue of institutional child sex abuse and I shared the story of Shellay Ward, the seven-year-old girl who died in 2007 of starvation after years of abuse and being seriously neglected by her parents. What sort of society do we live in where a seven-year-old girl can starve to death under the nose of neighbours and the bodies that are set up by governments to protect children? Over the following 10 years, I have met with countless victims of child sex abuse—victims who bravely gave evidence during the royal commission, victims who suffered at the hands of those who they trusted and victims who have spent their lives recovering from the trauma of their childhoods. This is why it is so important to support this legislation. I have seen adults who were abused as children collapse under the trauma of their abuse. They have been broken by their childhoods and many have had long battles with depression or addiction and have required ongoing medical assistance. Many of them have chronic health issues that they deal with on a daily basis. Others have tried to move forward with their lives but have shared with me the struggles they have endured, noting difficulties in all aspects of their lives—in their work, in their relationships and when they have had children of their own.


Child abuse hasn't just happened in institutions. It happens in children's own homes. It happens at the hands of guardians. It happens at the hands of strangers and online, as we have heard from other members who have contributed to this debate. It is not exclusive to any demographic, nor is it exclusive to any neighbourhood or region of our country. We have an entrenched system that is failing the children of Australia.


I would like to share with the House a couple of stories. I refer first to a story not in our country but in New Zealand with the story of two half-sisters, Saliel Aplin and Olympia Jetson, of Masterton, New Zealand. They were two beautiful girls who fell victim to the broken system that existed. Their story spans 10 years. There were 10 years where they could have been removed from the physical and sexual abuse they faced, but instead they were returned to their abusers again and again. Saliel was born in February 1989 and was the second child of Charlene Aplin. In November 1990, Charlene had Olympia Jetson, who was followed by two more children in the following two years.


In 1992, Charlene Aplin applied for a nonviolence order and spent time in a women's refuge. By 1993, Charlene had reconciled with her husband, but after further domestic violence and court involvement the marriage ended. At the end of the year, Charlene Aplin contacted police, concerned that the girls may have been suffering from sexual abuse. Evidence was inconclusive, and the girls received counselling. In 1994, Saliel and Olympia's elder sister repeated the sexual abuse allegations. Police were once more called, but no evidence was found. The counselling was continued. I saw a program on CI which featured this particular episode. These girls were submitted to a situation where they had to give evidence to the police in front of their abuser. Of course, they weren't going to reveal the details in front of their abuser. This is how ridiculous the system is.


Soon after, Charlene Aplin began a relationship with Bruce Howse. In March 1994, Charlene Aplin contacted Child, Youth and Family—CYF—and the police after a dispute between her and Howse. It is alleged Saliel and Olympia, at the ages of five and three respectively, had suffered injuries inflicted by Howse. In an interview the following month with CYF, the children reported physical abuse by Howse again. By the middle of May 1994, all Charlene's children were removed and placed with her parents. By the end of the year, Charlene reported to CYF that she was concerned that her parents were not caring adequately for her children. This woman complained her parents weren't looking after their grandchildren and she wanted to return them to an abusive situation. This is how silly our systems are.


On 1 August 1996, the court ruled that Saliel, Olympia and their brother could return to their mother and the abuser, Howse. By November, their eldest sisters returned to live with them and, by Christmas, Howse's five other children were also living with them. In April 1997, Charlene Aplin again took legal steps to protect herself from Howse, but soon the couple reconciled again. In October 1999, Charlene Aplin and Howse had a daughter. Domestic violence was reported to the authorities on several occasions and eventually Charlene left Howse and took all the children to her parents' home again, the home where she thought they weren't being looked after.


In 2000, after living with her parents for six months, Charlene Aplin moved the family to Ashhurst, and Howse attempted to take the baby from the house. The police were called. A separate violent incident saw police called again. The family moved to Woodville briefly, before returning to Masterton, where Aplin again reconciled with Howse. At the end of September, Howse left home after a violent incident. Soon after, he returned home and abducted the baby. Charlene Aplin retrieved the child and further fights ensued before another reconciliation.


In 2001, Charlene Aplin was pregnant again. She and Howse briefly separated but again reconciled. The pregnancy wasn't easy, and Olympia and Saliel were often left on their own in the care of Howse and their elder sister whilst their mother spent time in hospital. In July, another baby girl was born. After the following three months, on 3 August, Olympia's school contacted Charlene Aplin to say that Olympia had made an accusation of sexual abuse. By the following Monday, she had withdrawn that accusation.


On 20 November, a fight erupted between Howse and Charlene Aplin. The police were called and Howse was taken to his son's address. He phoned Charlene Aplin several times that night threatening to kill them all. He returned to the home the next day and was asked to leave permanently. Howse said Aplin had no legal right to keep him out of the house. On 1 September, Saliel had an argument with Howse and told him she was going to nark on him. Two days later, on 3 December 2001, Saliel and her little sister Olympia were stabbed. Each received a single knife wound. They both died in the early hours of 4 December, having bled to death, stabbed by their abuser, their stepfather. This followed a decade of physical and sexual abuse not by one but by two men. The system had failed them, and it fails so many children around Australia and in other countries around the world. This is why this legislation is what's needed to defeat these people, to put them away and to never let them have contact with children again. If I had my way, I would bring back capital punishment for people like that. This man got 28 years in jail. Hopefully he'll rot and die in jail, because that's what he deserves. 


Child sexual abuse is one of the most heinous crimes. To rob a child of their childhood—to abuse those too young to understand or those too afraid to say no—is monstrous. I have another example. I met a woman who, from the age of eight to 14, was raped by her stepfather continually for six years. The only way they found out was the fact that she fell pregnant. This is back in the late seventies in Victoria. She was taken to court. It was one of the first ever sexual abuse court cases in Victoria. The stepfather got 2½ years jail. That is not satisfactory; that is not protection for children. 


For too long our laws have been inadequate. The bill introduces reforms which criminalise emerging forms of child sexual abuse and strengthen community protections from child sex offenders. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 targets all aspects of the child sex offender cycle by strengthening measures at the time of charging, bail, sentencing and upon release. Under the new laws, child sex offenders will spend longer in jail and will be less likely to be granted bail and parole. There has been some discussion that there shouldn't be mandatory sentencing. My support for mandatory sentencing for these people is absolute. They will face mandatory minimum sentences and be closely supervised following their release. They shouldn't be released. 


The advancement of technology has seen emerging forms of child sexual abuse. These laws are adding an offence of providing electronic services to facilitate dealings with child abuse material. As it currently stands the code doesn't specifically criminalise the provision of electronic services—for example, website or chat fora, often hosted on the dark web—to facilitate online dealings with child abuse material. This amendment bill will make it an offence for a person to provide an electronic service with the intention that the service be used for access to child abuse material. 


We have heard some doubts in this area, in that teenagers might end up in jail. I can tell you a story about a young Aboriginal child in the north of Western Australia who lived in a community where his abusers were his own peers. He was seven and his abusers were 10, 11 and 12, and he was repeatedly raped by these abusers. It is in the environment where these kids live and grow up that we need to take hold of these situations and address these issues. This kid eventually became involved in a system that taught him self-respect, and the abuse stopped; he was so proud, and he wore a special T-shirt. Then the government withdrew funding for that program. It amazes me that as a society we can see something that is working successfully to protect children and then we withdraw funding that assists in those areas. If it takes emotion and the necessary hard line to protect children in our society, that is what we need. 


The amendments in this bill also add an offence of grooming third parties using the post or a carriage service to procure children for sexual activity. These measures also clarify that live-streamed child abuse is captured in existing Criminal Code offences. Recently in the UK there was a story about people grooming children online. When the authorities got into the system, they found that over 3,000 children not only had been groomed online but had been blackmailed to take photos performing sexual acts for the people who put themselves up as their peers and friends online, and then they abused them. These men were all from the Middle East, aged from 21. This is the type of stuff we need to stop. The new offences will criminalise the transmission of communications using these services to a third party who is not the child victim, with the intention of making it easier to procure a specific child for sexual activity. 


The coalition's new laws ensure the sentencing of child sex offenders is reflective of the gravity of this type of offending. For too long we've read news stories of paedophiles being released on parole after a menial sentence that in no way represents the years of damage their actions have caused—and there is a stat regarding the time they spend in jail. These new laws also increase penalties for certain offences, including grooming offences and offences for using a carriage service to engage in sexual activity. 


Since 2012, only 58.7 per cent of those convicted of Commonwealth child sex offences have received a term of imprisonment. This will stop that. That 58.7 per cent of child sex offenders will go to jail. They need to go to jail. That's over half of those sentenced walking free after committing these types of crimes.


In closing I'd like to thank the minister for bringing this legislation on a subject that is dear to my heart. My sister suffered sexual abuse and in the process died, when she was very young, at the age of 12. This is the type of thing we need. We need stronger laws and we need to be far more specific about what we are going to do with these people. I would like to thank those on the other side of the chamber who have supported this for the speeches and contributions they've made on this legislation as well. This is something that we can do as a parliament and as individuals.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (10:55):  I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017. There is no-one in this chamber who wouldn't agree that the changes we're seeing in society, the changes we're seeing with the internet around child sex abuse and in making it easier for a lot of things to happen that have never happened before because the internet didn't exist—that all of this is really frightening. When my two children were young there was no access to the internet for them. There was no social media. In a very short time the online world has, sadly, made our children more vulnerable.


There is huge growth in the number of people who are viewing and sharing child abuse images. The volume is so large that the Australian Federal Police can't investigate and prosecute more than a very small proportion of the crimes. The AFP receive more than 10,000 reports of child sexual exploitation every year. That's the known number, but it would appear that children often do not report disturbing online activity, even when the offender attempts to contact them outside the internet. If we just look at online grooming, sexual solicitation incidents: in a significant US study, only one-quarter of the children who had encountered a sexual approach reported it to a parent, and only 10 per cent of approaches were reported to the police, to the internet service provider or to any other authorities, such as a teacher. Very little research has been undertaken on the impact on children of these attempted solicitations. The same study indicates that approximately a quarter of the children who had been solicited for sexual purposes reported being extremely upset or afraid, with younger children—those 10 to 13 years—reporting a greater adverse impact. In spite of that, they're not necessarily reporting what we all know is a crime.


Similar findings have been reported in the small Australian survey of adolescent students. Only one-quarter of the children who had been sexually solicited told a parent. No reports were made to police. One-third of the children didn't disclose the solicitation at all. These studies, known as the Finkelhor and NAPCAN studies, provide support for the view that children often keep cyberfriendships—that's the name they're given—a secret from parents and sometimes friends.


We know there is a crime happening there. We have a real problem. Sexual predators are making use of technology on apps that the rest of us use every day, like Snapchat, FaceTime and Skype. Not just Australian children, but children in countries all over the world, are victims of cyber sex abuse. The modern day patterns of behaviour and the use of technology that enable 21st century paedophiles and criminals to harm our children are a frightening evolution of these disgusting people. So reforms that target and punish the offenders are welcome in this bill. We will vote for this bill and wholeheartedly support the object of keeping children safe. There are many things we support in this bill, including the new grooming offences that are contained in it, and the clarification that this bill provides on the scope of some of the child sex offences that are contained in the Criminal Code.


I particularly support the change in terminology. As a former journalist I know words are not something that you take lightly. They have meaning and implications for people. I support the change in words to describe the material in question. 'Child abuse materials' is a much stronger phrase than 'child pornography', which doesn't recognise the seriousness and exploitation of these images. Children are harmed in their creation, but the abuse is repeated every time someone else views those photos, and each of those people should be punished.


In their efforts to be tough on the sexual predators of children, though, I think the government have failed to take the really tough steps that should be put in place for the sake of children everywhere. That's why we will move amendments in the Senate to ensure that the punishment fits the crime. We want to see higher maximum sentences. We believe courts should be able to lock up the worst offenders for life. Predators who go overseas to prey on vulnerable children should face tougher penalties. We want to see the laws better recognise and respond to the technological ability offenders have to watch child abuse remotely through webcams and live streaming, and are sure that this is as much a crime as being in the same room as a child who is being sexually abused. We want to see the people who incite or direct the production of child abuse material—for instance, in online chat rooms—face severe penalties for encouraging people to do hideous things to children. 


We want to see these people punished, we want them off the streets and we also want policies that work. Sadly, mandatory sentencing doesn't work, and I'm going to speak about that in a little bit more detail. There are a number of other amendments that we will move. As an example, we think that the defence based on a valid and genuine marriage, which currently exists for child sex offences, should be removed. Both the Law Council of Australia and Anti-Slavery Australia have called for this. 


I add that, if you're serious about protecting children—which I believe everybody in this place is—why would you slash the Australian Federal Police budget? They are already unable to investigate the reports that they get. The AFP suffered a $184 million cut in the last budget, and 151 AFP officers have been let go this year. Seriously, a bill won't make up for the fact that the capacity to enforce the law has been weakened by this government. 


I turn to the issue of mandatory sentencing. We do reject the mandatory minimum sentences in this bill because they won't work and they lead to fewer convictions. And that's not something any of us want to see; we want to see more convictions. The government's own Attorney-General's Department says that mandatory minimums should be avoided, as they can create an incentive for defendants to fight the charges, even in clear-cut cases. What that means is that victims are more likely to need to go to court—to go through a torturous court process—simply because of the application of mandatory minimum sentences. 


Mandatory minimum sentences also mean that there is less incentive for people to plead guilty or to provide information to the police. We need the people who are identified and caught to spill their guts about the other people who are involved in these heinous crimes. We need to have leverage to be able to get information out of them. This is not just me, the member for Macquarie, having an opinion. This is looking at the facts and the evidence, and what that evidence shows us is that mandatory sentencing does not provide that opportunity. Mandatory sentencing means there's less incentive for people to plead guilty, and the other side of it is that juries are less willing to convict. We see, time and time again, that juries are much happier to make a conviction. That's what the evidence shows. You need only talk to the Law Council of Australia to see that evidence. 


Lest there be any doubt about Labor's record in this area—and I would really urge the government to consider these things closely, not have some knee-jerk political reaction to them—Labor always has and always will fight to protect children here and overseas from exploitation and abuse.  


We're proud of our record under Prime Ministers Keating, Rudd and Gillard, which included introducing world-leading offence categories targeting Australians who engage in sexual abuse of children. That was in 1994. We brought federal, state and territory governments together in 2009 to implement the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children, which included a funding commitment of $63.6 million over four years from the Commonwealth government. We introduced new child abuse preparatory offences and other protection measures in 2010. We established the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the first inquiry of its kind at a national level. The royal commission, among other things, has inquired into how systems have failed to protect children and made recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to child sexual abuse that occurs in institutions. We appointed Australia's first National Children's Commissioner in 2013 to advocate for the rights of Australia's young people, and we introduced the vulnerable witnesses act in 2013. We are committed to doing everything that can be done to protect children from harm and abuse, and we wholeheartedly support the object of this bill. We have no tolerance for child sexual abuse.


In the time that remains, I would like for a moment to put aside the fact that mandatory minimum sentencing is an easy, populist, but costly and discriminatory, criminal justice policy that has never actually worked and look at the fact that mandatory minimum sentencing also ignores judicial discretion. Judicial discretion is at the heart of our criminal justice system. It allows the law to be applied to the immeasurable ways in which a crime presents itself. If we remove judicial discretion, we may as well give the gavel to a robot—and yes, we're talking about child sex offenders. Unless those opposite have a crystal ball that allows them to know every way in which a crime will present itself, I think it is safer for us to look at the history of mandatory minimum sentencing and take our lessons from that.


There has been case after case where mandatory minimum sentencing has not worked. The impact of introducing mandatory sentencing for property offences in the Northern Territory in 1997 is an example of how vital judicial discretion is. I'm going to give you one example that unfortunately speaks volumes—that of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy, Johnno, who stole pencils. He was taken from his remote community in the Northern Territory and imprisoned 800 kilometres away in Darwin. His mum had passed away when he was a baby, his father had been killed in a motor accident a few years prior, and at the time of his trial and sentencing his grandmother, who was his primary carer, was in hospital. But, in the hands of the jurisdiction with mandatory minimum sentencing, none of that could be taken into account. Johnno didn't need jail time to pull him into line. As it turned out, jail time in fact was the worst answer to this question. Five days out from the end of his sentence, Johnno hung himself with his bed sheet in his cell.


This isn't the same, and I know that those on the other side will say, 'Yeah, but that was pencils,' but this is a principle that runs through our legal system. Without the subjective guidance and discretion of judges we find ourselves in situations where kids are sentenced to jail for stealing pencils. The Law Council of Australia told the Senate committee inquiry that there would be similar unintended consequences. For instance, there could be conduct in a relationship between a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old where images are exchanged and sexual stories shared, yet the day the older partner turns 18 they could be liable for mandatory prison time. That is a potential unintended consequence of this legislation and a key example of why the Law Council opposes mandatory sentencing in all forms.


I point out that the government's own Attorney-General's Department says mandatory minimums should be avoided. This is not political. Prominent Liberals, including former Prime Minister John Howard, members opposite and Senator Marise Payne, have expressed concern about mandatory minimum sentencing in the past. I urge the government not to play politics with this issue. We are on the same side. We all want to see harsher penalties. In fact, as our amendments that will be moved in the Senate will show, we want harsher penalties than those opposite want. Children are too important for there to be word games around this issue. The Labor Party is serious about justice for the victims of sex crimes and appropriate punishment for those who commit these crimes. Like those opposite, we have no tolerance for the sexual abuse of children. That is why each of us is standing here today proposing that this bill go further, that this bill be harder, because these crimes should be met with the harshest of sentences, and it is best that we leave the judges to do the judging.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2017-10-19,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (11:10):  It's with a heavy heart that I rise today—not because I don't support this bill, but because we need to enact legislation to try to prevent child sexual abuse. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017 represents tough new laws. It represents the greatest crackdown on paedophilia in a generation. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but I also say it takes a village to protect a child. I want to thank the member for Swan, and the previous speaker, for their contributions. The member for Swan's contribution was heartfelt and a significant contribution to the debate.


Before I address the House in relation to the specifics of this bill, I would like to recognise a campaign that is being run by YGAP. We held a morning tea for it in my office yesterday. YGAP promotes a campaign called Polished Man, which seeks to raise awareness of sexual and physical violence against children. We had a number of people from this House come to my office yesterday to support the Polished Man campaign, and I would like to point them out specifically. They were: the Chief Government Whip, Nola Merino; the Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation, Angus Taylor; the member for Wide Bay, Llew O'Brien; the member for Bonner, Ross Vasta; the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson; the member for Dunkley, Chris Crewther; and the member for Mackellar, Jason Falinski. This is not just a 'this side of the House' thing. It was also supported by members opposite, for which I'm very grateful: the member for Burt, Matt Keogh, and the member for Macarthur, Dr Mike Freelander. Importantly, the Minister for the Environment and Energy was there, and, most importantly, the Prime Minister also came and showed his support. The Prime Minister said, 'As we know, not all acts of disrespecting women or children lead to violence, but that's where it begins.' This is about respecting the women and children in our lives and showing them love. That is when we are closest to being our very best and when we are closest to God—when we are showing love. All of us have a vested interest and a duty to look after all of our children.


This event yesterday in my parliamentary office followed a similar morning tea that we had in my own electorate in Fisher, where I had prominent sporting men and businessmen attend the event, such as: Chris Flannery, the CEO of Sunshine Coast Falcons; Matt Soper-Lawler, the winger and top try scorer for the Sunshine Coast Falcons; Jack Hansen, the head coach of Alexandra Headland Surf Club; Ashley Robinson, the general manager of Alexandra Headland Surf Club and the chairman of the Sunshine Coast Falcons; Clayton Williams, a local businessman; and Peppi Bueti, a local businessman. The media got behind us as well, as they did yesterday. People like Danielle Ford, Dan Toney, Charles Hodgson and Hailey Francis painted nails to support the cause of Polished Man.


People might ask: 'Why polish a nail? What's that got to do with sexual assault against children?' I think it would be fair to say that most men don't walk around with a polished nail. The purpose of the Polished Man campaign is to engender a conversation, particularly amongst men, so that we can start to drive a culture in our country that speaks up against violence against children—that we as men, in particular, say, 'Enough is enough.' It is utterly unacceptable for men to disrespect women and children by committing acts of violence against them and even more so when those acts of violence involve acts of sexual violence. For a person to have an instant moment of sexual gratification which will leave a child scarred for life, physically and mentally, is abhorrent and almost beyond words. What is it particularly about some men that they would rather put their own sexual gratification for a short moment above the life of a child who will carry that event with them for the rest of their lives? It's a rhetorical question, but I will never understand that attitude.


According to the World Health Organization, 150 million girls and 73 million boys worldwide under the age of 18 have experienced sexual violence. Just ponder on this: one child dies every five minutes around the world at the hands of an adult. That is part of the significance of Polished Man. We wear a polished nail on one out of our five fingers as one child dies every five minutes. All funds raised in the Polished Man campaign go to trauma recovery and trauma prevention programs for children who've suffered or who are at risk of suffering from violence and sexual violence around the world.


I turn now to the bill. This bill provides a comprehensive re-examination of the way in which we deal with those who commit the most heinous of crimes against our children. It amends various provisions that we currently have in our Criminal Code. It amends vulnerable witness protection measures to prevent children and other vulnerable witnesses from being cross-examined at a committal proceeding. We all know—well, some may not, but, as barrister of 16 years, I can tell you—this is an experience that many children find harrowing.


The bill also seeks to introduce a presumption against bail for certain Commonwealth child sexual offences. If a person is charged with an offence against a person, there should be a presumption against bail. They should be in a show-cause position where they have to show cause for why it is that they should get bail. It is not a landmark concept. Offences of violence in Queensland put an accused person in a show-cause position.


These provisions include additional factors which must be taken into account when sentencing federal offenders to ensure they are appropriate, given the nature of the offending. They create a presumption in favour of an actual term of imprisonment. This amendment will ensure that, unless exceptional circumstances exist, all child sex offenders serve an actual term of imprisonment, rather than receiving sentences that are wholly or partially suspended. It requires that when a court is making a recognisance release order for a child sexual offender the offender be put under supervision, and it sets rehabilitation treatment as a condition unless it's otherwise inappropriate.


The provisions include a presumption in favour of cumulative sentences. Many in this place who aren't legally trained perhaps wouldn't understand that. For example, in the United States we hear about people serving multiple life sentences. In Australia, generally sentences are handed down concurrently—it doesn't matter how many offences you commit; you generally get a sentence which reflects the one sentence. So, if you've committed five offences, you would generally only get a penalty as though it was one. That will not be the case under these provisions, and I think that that's a very good thing. Why do I say that? It is because, if an offender has committed an offence against, say, five or six children, and is sentenced as though it was one person, what does that say to the other four or five kids? What does that say to them? It really demeans the experience that they've been through. This amendment will provide greater disincentive, greater deterrence, for those committing similar offences.


These provisions will list community safety as a factor that can be taken into account to revoke a federal offender's parole without notice. They will require a period of time to be served in custody if parole is revoked.


These provisions will also introduce mandatory sentencing for certain Commonwealth child sex offences. The office of the Commonwealth DPP has advised that it appeals a high number of child sex offence cases due to manifestly inadequate sentences imposed by judges at first instance and for repeat offences. Mandatory minimum sentences will apply to the most serious child sex offences. Mandatory minimum sentences reflect the heinous nature of child sexual abuse. The provisions introduce mandatory sentencing for repeat offenders. Mandatory sentencing schemes will also apply to child sex offenders who have previously been convicted of a child sex offence, including state and territory offences.


Since 2012, only 58.7 per cent of convicted Commonwealth child sex offenders have received a term of imprisonment, and the average for those who do get a term of imprisonment is six months. This issue was raised, interestingly, by a very significant retired District Court judge, Judge Wall QC, who just last week criticised the recent sentences that were being handed down. He mentioned the case not of a child sexual assault but of a physical assault which led to the death of a child. He called them 'manifestly inadequate'. He also said that many of the judges of first instance—trial judges and sentencing judges—are concerned that, if they hand down too harsh a sentence, they'll be slapped down by the Court of Appeal. Whilst I am not a huge fan of mandatory sentencing in all cases, in this case it is called for. In this case, where we have the most heinous of crimes, we need to set a floor. We need to set a minimum so that judges can't go underneath that minimum. The Labor Party has itself supported mandatory minimum sentences in relation to child- and people-smuggling laws.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2017-10-19,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling—Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism) (11:26):  I thank all the members of this House who have contributed to this debate, and also colleagues on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who scrutinised the bill and recommended that it be passed. In particular I want to thank members who shared their personal stories and convictions—they have expressed a commitment to act against the scourge of child sex offending. However, it's important, if we're going to take action and if we believe that people who commit these crimes need to be appropriately punished, that all of this bill be passed. I genuinely thought that the parliament would come together and pass the totality of this bill in a bipartisan way. That was my expectation. That was what had happened when we announced that we were cracking down on child sex tourists and taking away their passports. Within two hours of our making that announcement, the Leader of the Opposition got up and pledged the Labor Party's support of that measure.


Unfortunately, after a month of prevarication, apparently the Labor Party is going to move to amend this bill in the Senate. By doing so they will cut out the heart of this bill, which is to make sure that people who are committing horrendous acts against children actually serve time in prison. I think most Australians would be pretty shocked to know that only 58½ per cent of those convicted of Commonwealth child sex offences spend any time in prison at all. That means over 40 per cent of Commonwealth child sex offenders never spend one day in prison. There's no such thing as a minor Commonwealth child sex offender. They are all horrendous offences. To deal with that and to make sure that people are getting appropriate punishments for the harm that they have caused, we will insist that the courts apply mandatory minimum sentences that reflect the gravity of the crime that has been committed. We don't believe that having over 40 per cent of convicted paedophiles spend not even a day in prison is acceptable. We don't believe that having the most common length of time served by those that actually serve a prison sentence be just six months is remotely acceptable. I'm surprised anyone in this chamber does, quite frankly.


We already know that there's a problem with sentencing. It was confirmed by the High Court just last week in relation to a Victorian sentence, where they found that a sentence of three years and six months imprisonment for unprotected sex with a 13-year-old, which was based on other similarly low existing sentences for such crimes, was manifestly inadequate—confirming, I might say, some of the criticism of lenient sentencing that has been made by members of the government. The opposition knows this. They know that mandatory sentencing—I endorse what the member for Fisher was saying earlier—is not an option we will use in all cases. We use it for crimes which the parliament thinks are particularly serious and where we need to send a signal that people committing these crimes must serve time in prison.


We've done it in this parliament in relation to people-smuggling. The opposition did it, when they were in government, in relation to people-smuggling. Astonishingly, members of the opposition who spoke in that debate in favour of mandatory sentencing are now speaking in this debate against it. This just shows that their opposition to mandatory sentencing is fickle and hypocritical. They introduced mandatory sentencing for people-smuggling when they were in office. We have mandatory sentencing for Commonwealth offences in relation to people-smuggling and we have mandatory sentencing in relation to terrorism offences. The opposition apparently has an ideological objection to mandatory sentencing. If they win next year's election, will they repeal mandatory sentencing for people-smuggling? Will they repeal mandatory sentencing for terrorism offenders? Apparently they've got some objection to mandatory sentencing in principle. Some quite extraordinary claims have been made in this debate that I want to particularly address to show you the furphy of this absurd ideological proposition against mandatory sentencing for paedophiles. It is an absolute nonsense.


We've heard in this debate that mandatory minimum sentences might make juries feel sorry for paedophiles who they think are guilty of crimes and then move to acquit. Well, I have a lot more faith than that in the common sense of the Australian people who sit on juries. I don't believe they'll be moved to feel sorry for people who have abused kids and therefore ensure that they don't serve time in prison. I think that is a ridiculous proposition, quite frankly. We have also heard that if mandatory sentencing were to be approved by the parliament it would be a disincentive for people to plead guilty. But that completely ignores the reality that we have inserted provisions within this bill that would give an incentive for an offender to plead guilty by an appropriate reduction in their sentence. And we've heard that the bill will reduce incentives to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, which again completely ignores the fact that there are provisions within this bill for an appropriate discount for the sentence when offenders have cooperated with law enforcement—a discount of 25 per cent in both the cases I have just raised.


We've also heard—and this has been repeated ad nauseam by members—about this hypothetical case of an 18-year-old who apparently might go overseas and have sex with a 15-year-old, which completely ignores the fact that that is currently a crime. We're not changing the offences here; we're changing the way they are sentenced. Under current law it is, of course, a crime to have sex with somebody who's under the age of consent, which in most states is 16 years. Not only does this bill not apply to those under the age of 18 but the argument completely fails to take into account the safeguard that currently exists within the system that means we haven't seen cases like this prosecuted where it hasn't been predatory behaviour. It is that the AFP must make a judgement that it's in the public interest to investigate and prosecute a crime, and then the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions must do the same. They need to work out whether it's in the public interest for a prosecution to move forward. On a daily basis, they will make a judgement that a particular crime might not meet that threshold. The CDPP and the Australian Federal Police apply these discretions every day. So, regarding this hypothetical example, it's not a new offence. These offences could be prosecuted now. It's never happened before, because there's this discretion within the system. So, why would it happen moving forward? It is a complete red herring.


This government is taking the global lead in making sure that in Australia tough penalties apply to people who prey on children. In a world's first, we have made sure that Australians who are registered sex offenders can't go overseas to prey on children, particularly here in our region. The opposition—to their credit, as I said in my opening remarks—within two hours of our making that announcement pledged their support for that very important measure. These are world's-first changes, and the parliament, because we've got bipartisan support from the opposition, will pass them.


Unfortunately, in relation to this bill, there seems to have been a month of prevarication in which, apparently, the Labor Party, the opposition, were deciding on what they were going to do. Now they have come out on the side of some crazy left-wing ideology against mandatory sentencing, as opposed to joining with the government to send the message that the parliament finds these crimes abhorrent and, if you commit them, you're going to go to prison—something that is not happening now, because more than 40 per cent of convicted paedophiles don't spend a day in prison. That is unacceptable. Why do the opposition think that is acceptable? Why won't they join with us and support mandatory sentencing? 


We are not going to tolerate people preying on our kids. The parliament has to send an appropriate message that the parliament won't tolerate it. I think we will be able to negotiate with the crossbench in the Senate to get this bill passed, because the crossbench is showing a lot more common sense than the Labor Party have been able to show. Apparently, what they are going to do when this bill reaches the floor of the other place is join with the Greens to gut it. They are going to join with the Greens to stop paedophiles from going to prison when they commit these horrendous crimes. I am astonished by that. The Labor Party should hang their heads in shame.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (13:30):  I rise today to express my anger at the ongoing human rights abuses occurring in Cambodia and the unwillingness of the current government to do or say anything about this fast-escalating political crisis. I do so on behalf of thousands of Cambodian Australians who I have the great privilege of representing in this chamber. In May I spoke about the anniversary of the murder of Dr Kem Ley, a leading light for the democracy movement and the Cambodian government's most ardent critic. He was shot dead in broad daylight in the streets of Phnom Penh. Since then, the situation has deteriorated further. The Cambodian opposition leader, Kem Sokha, has been arrested on treason charges. The Cambodian government is now attempting to dissolve the opposition party and this week passed a law to redistribute opposition seats back to the government. Extreme violence has been perpetrated to suppress free and fair elections, members of parliament have been beaten and protesters have been shot dead. 


How bad does this situation have to get before the foreign minister says something about it? Australia has a special responsibility to the Cambodian people because of our unique role in the Paris peace accords signed 26 years ago next week. These flagrant and violent abuses of human rights are unacceptable to my Cambodian-Australian constituents and they are unacceptable to me. I ask that the Australian government take a stand on this issue. We need to use our power in the region to properly represent my constituents and their family and friends who remain back home in Cambodia.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:17):  It is a sad duty to have to address the House on this MPI. I would rather not have done it. I would rather have not seen the closure of this great industry, the car industry. We remember the history that lies behind this industry. In November 1948, as the Leader of the Opposition says, Ben Chifley watched the first car line off the line at Fishermans Bend, the 48-215—or, as it's known, the FX Holden. Every Prime Minister, from Chifley to Rudd, respected that industry—knew it was important for our national identity, our research and development, our industrial capacity and Australian jobs. Even you, Mr Speaker, know how important Holden was to the psyche of communities and to the identity of our country, because we all had a Holden and we all had relatives who worked in Holden factories or in car component factories. 


This industry was in the fabric of our country. It was important to our postwar identity, as important as the Snowy scheme, as important as all of the things we have done—the science, the progress, the development, the industrial capacity. There were 50,000 direct jobs and 200,000 indirect jobs, not just in South Australia, not just in Elizabeth, but in the southern suburbs in Adelaide, in the western suburbs of Adelaide, in western Sydney, in Victoria—thousands and thousands of jobs in components, in research and development, blue collar and white collar, and the thousands of indirect jobs that hung off it.


This was a critically important industry. What have we had post the Rudd government? I will tell you what we have had. We have had a government determined not just to be cavalier about this industry, not just to be indifferent about this industry. We have had a government that bragged about it amongst its cabinet ministers. The then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, and the then Treasurer, Mr Hockey, bragged off the record about who put the torpedo in the water. I remember reading about that in a Phil Coorey article. We know when the day of judgement came that the car industry did not receive support; rather, they were dared to leave. Who can forget the front page of the Australian Financial Review: 'Hockey dares GM to leave'? The opening line of that article by Phil Coorey and Ben Potter stated:


The federal government has accused General Motors Holden of ingratitude and effectively issued the company its marching orders, making it likely the auto maker’s departure is a formality.


A formality—50,000 jobs wiped. Now we see the consequences of that. Time and time again, we have seen closure after closure, job after job gone, and the slow winding down of this industry. Tomorrow, in my electorate, the last car will come off the line, a VF Commodore—a red line. It is the best car that Holden has ever produced. It is a great car. With the dollar where it is now, it would have been exported to the United States. The Chevy SS would have been exported. The Caprice would have been exported to the US police car market. With the dollar where it is now, this industry, instead of closing down, would have been thriving—not just surviving but thriving—if they had had a government that backed them in, but they didn't have that. Abbott didn't back them in. Hockey didn't back them in. Turnbull didn't back them in.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Order! I remind the member for Wakefield to use correct titles for members.




Mr CHAMPION:
  The Prime Minister, the member for Wentworth—




Mr Bowen:
  The current Prime Minister.




Mr CHAMPION:
  The current Prime Minister, as the shadow Treasurer reminds me. We know when Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, was asked what he thought about this industry, he said, 'Oh well, they have to work on their productivity.' That is what he said to workers at the time. These are the workers who carved $20 million in costs out of enterprise bargaining agreements and other work practices. They were doing their bit to secure a billion dollars worth of assistance. They were doing their bit to keep these high-wage, high-skilled jobs in the country. What was the attitude of the Prime Minister to these workers? It was not only one of ignoring them—it's galling that this government wants to pretend that this industry is not closing, that it doesn't even exist—but that the Prime Minister went kayaking on Friday. He went kayaking in some social media stunt. He went down and took a tram somewhere. This is what is supposed to be industrial policy in this country? Rather than defending high-skill, high-wage jobs, the government—which is full of guilty people—have put this industry to the sword and have done so much damage, as they have done in so many other areas, with anaemic wage growth, entry level jobs basically being carved out of the system and attack after attack on the unemployed. What are they doing for jobs in this country? They are closing the one big industry in South Australia—50,000 jobs. This will reverberate across the country—make absolutely no mistake about it. 


What would a Prime Minister do if this happened on their watch? Normally, when there are tough conditions, when there are economic winds buffeting, a Prime Minister would show up. Prime Minister Rudd showed up. He showed up at Holden. Gillard—she showed up. But what has Turnbull done? What we just heard from the minister at the table and what we heard in question time was bragging about jobs growth.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order, Member for Wakefield. I have reminded you about using the correct title.




Mr CHAMPION:
  I did. I called him the minister.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I called you to order 20 seconds ago; you didn't hear me.




Mr CHAMPION:
  I should have called him the assistant minister at the table.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Member for Wakefield, it wasn't that occasion, it was referring to the current Prime Minister 20 seconds ago but you didn't hear me.




Mr CHAMPION:
  I appreciate your intervention, Deputy Speaker. But what do we have? We have the government bragging during question time about their performance, when they have anaemic wage growth and when they have got people under pressure. What will this closure do? What will this unnecessary, violent closure of an entire industry do? It's 13 per cent of our research and development spend alone, with thousands of jobs, but what will they do? They'll say, 'Oh well, things are good. Let's just ignore it.'




Ms Rishworth:
  Military patrol boats, that's it!




Mr CHAMPION:
  We know what is happening in shipbuilding. I hear my colleague, the member for Kingston, talking about shipbuilding. There are thousands of jobs going in ASC as well. Let's not pretend—as the government wants to do and will no doubt do in a second when they get up and brag about jobs growth—as if that's some sort of camouflage for their performance. There could be more jobs in the economy. Imagine if you didn't close the car industry, you could really get up and brag. We have a gutless Prime Minister. We have a Prime Minister who is guilty of the destruction of this industry and who won't go down to Holden Elizabeth as Chifley did. He won't go down there and make a comment about the last car coming off the line. He won't show up in SA and give us some idea about how our economy might transition.


This is a violent act by this government. Make no mistake about it, it will do immense damage. Unemployment is the key indicator of poverty. I have already met workers, I already know workers, who, without Holden, are in desperate straits. They face losing their homes. What does this government say? They say, 'Go out there and get another job.' That's difficult to do if you're a mature-age worker, that's difficult to do if you have been on WorkCover and that's difficult to do if you don't have easily translatable skills.


This government is terribly guilty, and that's why they won't say anything about the last car coming off the line. I have a little printout—a little picture—of that car. It's a beautiful car, but it doesn't have a Prime Minister next to it. It doesn't have a government minister taking responsibility for this. They just sit there, stone-facedly ignoring the problem, pretending it is not happening and pretending that this violent destruction of Australian jobs—of high-skill, high-wage, important jobs in an iconic industry—is not happening. They want to pretend that this is not happening.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2017-10-19,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne—Assistant Minister for Health) (15:27):  I don't know what the member for Wakefield was thinking. He even said before he spoke that he was sorry to bring this issue up. I can see why, because this week we have got the best employment growth figures and the best unemployment figures for many, many years. Even the ABC—one of the biggest promoters of the coalition!—lauded the phenomenal jobs growth in the last figures. Manufacturing in South Australia, in the smart manufacturing sector, has produced 3,700 jobs in the last year alone. Since the coalition came to office in 2013, there are 825,000 new jobs circulating in the Australian economy. In the last 12 months alone there have been 371,000 new jobs, of which 80 per cent are full-time jobs. Employment has increased very strongly this year, rising by 3.1 per cent, well above the average rate of only 1.6 per cent over the decade. In fact, it's the highest jobs growth rate since 2008 and it's the longest run of growth and employment that we have had since 2004. That's why I can see why the member for Wakefield was sorry he brought this up as an MPI. Normally, they are meant to be bagging us about bad figures and bad outcomes, but we have got these fantastic employment growth figures.


Labor has failed working Australians. They abandoned the blue-collar workers that depend on a reliable energy scheme and guaranteed dispatchable energy. Under six years of Labor, unemployment grew by 203,000. When the member for Maribyrnong was the Minister for Workplace Relations, unemployment numbers grew by 77,000. Labor made it hard for businesses to employ people because of the $9 billion carbon tax impost. They abolished the Building and Construction Commission, so lawlessness, intimidation and rorts re-entered the construction industry.


As opposed to that, we have really got some great outcomes. As I said, in South Australia they are transitioning to a new manufacturing base, with 3,700 new advanced manufacturing jobs in the last year. Those opposite go on about Holden closing, but who was in charge when Mitsubishi closed in 2008? The other side was. There were 1,000 people put out of work. That's not even factoring in the $66 billion impost that their energy system would impose on businesses in Australia.


We have addressed the fundamentals. We have got the biggest infrastructure build going on in Australian federal history—$75 billion worth of infrastructure. We have put tax cuts in place for small businesses, down to 27½ per cent. Those opposite said that was going to lose money, but company tax revenue shot up in the last budgetary figures. Now the deficit has been reduced by $4.4 billion, mainly on the back of increased company tax income.


On threats to employment, I think the biggest threat to employment is the people on the other side. They are proposing a $66 billion tax on the energy bills that everyone, including businesses, has to pay. The only thing that's worse than expensive energy is no energy, and their systems have delivered exactly that in South Australia. We have people and large businesses with incredible fears and concerns about proposed blackouts in this coming summer. The Energy Guarantee and the changes to the energy market will stop that happening because there will be a guarantee that energy is supplied 99.98 per cent of the time. As I said, the only thing worse than unaffordable energy is no energy, and that's what the country's going to get if the other side are running the country.


We are putting in other forms of infrastructure. In my electorate we've seen 990 direct jobs and over 2,000 indirect jobs out of the Pacific Highway construction boom between the Oxley Highway and Kempsey. We've had an absolute boom in aged-care construction. We have had over 750 construction jobs created as a result of the expansion in aged-care facilities in Gloucester, Taree, Forster and Hawks Nest in my own electorate. That's been echoed and mirrored around the whole country. Through Minister Wyatt's aged-care expansion, growth is exponentially being improved. With that growth in aged-care facilities comes long-term employment. In my electorate of Lyne, that amounts to 400 long-term local, reliable jobs in the aged-care industry.


We have particular programs for unemployed youth aged 15 to 24. Our Youth Jobs PaTH: Prepare, Trial, Hire program is delivering major dividends for young unemployed. At the moment there are 711 interns engaged in this. There are 643 that have recently been appointed to long-term employment as a result of it, and another 11,600 young people have been employed through the youth bonus wage subsidy. So infrastructure and tax cuts are delivering growth in the economy, and that's why our company tax returns are up and unemployment figures are down.


Other infrastructure is delivering dividends. We've got our National Rail Program. The Inland Rail is going to deliver more growth and more transport efficiencies and allow the hinterland of New South Wales, Victoria and up into South-East Queensland grow because it will be connected to an avenue of commerce. We have the Western Sydney Airport Corporation delivering the Western Sydney Airport. That's going to create another 20,000 jobs by the early 2030s. And there will be 60,000 new jobs from the economic opportunities that will flourish with the $5.3 billion in equity and the development of the Western Sydney Airport. There is our Regional Growth Fund, with $472 million to promote regional infrastructure growth, and the Building Better Regions Fund, which is another $200 million. The biggest infrastructure program is Inland Rail. That is really going to be a structural change that will allow inland Australia to flourish, just as the development of rail across the nation opened up areas north and south during the John Howard government.


We realised we need more skilled tradespeople, so we have a Skilling Australia Fund which is delivering $1½ billion to state and territory governments over the first four years. It will prioritise development of apprenticeships and traineeships. With matched state and territory funding, we think there will be support for 300,000 apprenticeships, pre-apprenticeships and trainees. We will get more skilled Australians.


We're trying to get young parents who have dropped out of the labour market back into it with our $263 million investment in the ParentsNext Fund. We have particular packages in place for Indigenous employment. We've got a new career transition assistance program and we've got a better jobseeker compliance network. But it is the fundamentals that are driving the growth in jobs. We are trying to deliver efficiencies and we are helping small business. We've given them a tax cut and they get a better return on investment, which gives them the confidence to employ people. By simplifying all their reporting requirements, we are trying to help small businesses get ahead.


In the building and construction industry, we are bringing the rule of law back so that building is more cost-efficient, prices are lower and we can get much better growth in the construction industry, which, in the North Coast, is probably the biggest growth area of employment, along with disability care. The digital economy is also booming, courtesy of all the initiatives that we have put in place. It is embarrassing that the member for Wakefield chose to make an MPI about unemployment—or, rather, growth of employment—when we've got the best figures we've had in more than a decade.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:37):  I just listened to the assistant minister. He bragged about job figures, but did not say one word of consolation to the workers who are losing their jobs tomorrow. Not one word of consolation did he offer them and their families about the jobs they've lost. Indeed, he argued this issue shouldn't be brought to the floor of the parliament. Well, I am proud to support the member for Wakefield, who has been doing an enormous job over many years supporting those workers at Holden as they face an unknown future. It is disingenuous of this assistance minister to come in and not even say, 'I'm sorry you're losing your jobs, and I'm sorry your future is uncertain now.' And now he runs out of the chamber—that is what we expect.


But tomorrow is an incredibly sad day. It's a sad day for those in Elizabeth, it's a sad day for Adelaide and it's a sad day for this nation. It is the loss of an iconic brand, the loss of an innovative industry and the loss of skills and expertise. Looking at how it all sums up, Julia Gillard described the potential of car manufacturing: 


…Chifley wasn't just launching a car, he was building a nation—taking Australia into a future beyond wool and wheat.


And the industry lasted for seven decades, producing high-quality cars made by highly skilled workers at the forefront of innovation. These workers are casualties of this government. 


Maybe I could stomach it if it were just indifference by this government—if it were just their not being active players and just letting this important industry go by the wayside. But it was not indifference that led to this. It was not incompetence—although I could raise many examples of where this government is incompetent. But it wasn't incompetence; it was pure, evil ideology that did not want to support an industry in Australia. I am not sure why; I am not sure whether they thought it was too unionised—I wouldn't put it past them—or whether they don't like building things and prefer to just take minerals out of the ground. Whatever the reason, it was an active decision by this government, the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, and also the current Prime Minister and the then Treasurer and the current Treasurer. They all sat around that cabinet table and made the decision. They might argue now that they had nothing to do with it, that it wasn't actually their decision. But we know. I was in this parliament when Joe Hockey, the then Treasurer, told Holden to 'put up or pack up'. That was the message he sent: put up or pack up.


I will read to you from an article back in 2013:


Holden remains unconvinced that the federal government intends providing any further assistance to the industry after 2016 …


This was at a critical moment in time, when Holden were deciding their future, and they went to the government and said, 'Please, we need some assistance for a long-term future,' and the government said no. The government said, 'We will not support you.' It was an outrageous decision that has led to the position we are in today. And of course the casualty is not just those Holden workers; it is components manufacturing right across South Australia, and in my own electorate it is being affected as well. Over the past few months we have seen job losses at Walker's Tenneco and 70 job losses at Monroe. This is just the start. We're looking at close to 12,000 jobs in total. The assistant minister who spoke previously said that perhaps these workers will take the Pathways program and get an internship while they're on the dole. That's a great option for them! Maybe they'll just work casually in aged care? What the assistant minister failed to recognise is that these workers who are losing their jobs are highly skilled and have a huge amount of technical ability. They need to be deployed in a way that is useful and productive for this country. Instead, their jobs have been ripped away by this government.


We all remember the respect this government has for South Australian workers. We remember when the then defence minister said that ASC workers 'couldn't even build a canoe'. That is the respect that this government gives to blue-collar workers in South Australia, workers who have a huge amount of technicality: they ignore them. (Time expired)

Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (15:42):  Talk about leading with the chin! The topic for today's matter of public importance is an absolute cracker—an absolute cracker. Here we have a situation where Australia is experiencing the strongest growth in full-time jobs in its history. Never has it recorded this strength in full-time jobs growth. We've now had 12 consecutive months of jobs growth. We have not seen that in 23 years. The unemployment rate is now 5.5 per cent. And some very smart person in the opposition decided that they want to have a crack at the Australian government, the Turnbull government, on jobs? It's bizarre—but we welcome it.


I was wondering who in their right mind, from the Labor Party, would actually want to debate the topic of jobs with the Turnbull government, which has such a demonstrable track record. And I see here that it was actually the member for Wakefield. I believe the member for Wakefield is a member in South Australia. It is quite possible that, as a South Australian, he wrote this topic in the dark. It is quite possible that the lights weren't on. The lights may not have been on when he tried to pen this topic, because as we know South Australia, as an economy, and therefore its workers, has been damaged time and time again by their Labor state government. It is quite possible therefore that the member for Wakefield, in putting this topic forward today, is in fact talking about not the Australian government but the South Australian state Labor government—a government that has totally misused the energy system and has nearly destroyed that economy. That, indeed, is worth criticising.


People are looking for work, people just can't find work and, indeed, many are now losing their jobs—and it happens every day across the world. Members opposite have mentioned the car industry, but it is a tough, tough time for anybody. It's not just a financial problem; there are a whole mix of social issues and of personal relationship issues that often come to into play when one is faced with unemployment. That is when you need government to ensure that it is the enabler for economic growth. For those who are wondering about their future employment, particularly in South Australia, despite having such a disastrous state government rest assured that the coalition government is fighting for you. We have the largest recapitalisation program in the history of the Australian Defence Force—$200 billion to be spent over a 10-year period. A big share of that will be going to South Australia. It will be home to a shipbuilding program delivering 8,000 local jobs. Rest assured that this government is delivering.


There's a reason why we have results on the scoreboard. We now have created 825,500 jobs. Let me correct what I just said—the stat is right, but the government hasn't created the jobs; the coalition government has created the environment for 825,500 extra jobs. Under the Labor Party's six years in office, do you know how many they created or enabled to be created? It was the opposite. There were over 200,000 extra people in the job queue. It is time that the members opposite turned on the lights, looked at the scoreboard and understood that there's only one side of this parliament that enables economic growth and job creation, and that's the coalition.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:48):  It's my great pleasure and honour to speak on this matter of public importance on employment, proposed by the member for Wakefield. The member for Wakefield, over a number of years now, has given extraordinary voice to the shock, the dislocation, the distress and also the dignity of the community of northern Adelaide, particularly his community around Elizabeth, which is going to be so enormously impacted by the closure of the Holden factory tomorrow. Also impacted will be those supply companies that have grown up and operated for so many decades in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, also in the western suburbs of Adelaide that I represent, in the southern suburbs that are represented by the member for Kingston and in the north-eastern suburbs represented by the member for Makin. Holden really has been the outstanding icon of the South Australian economy, stretching back many, many decades. I want to be able to pay tribute to that icon and, most importantly, to the thousands and thousands of South Australians who, over the decades, have worked for Holden and who have worked for the supply companies that have supplied Holden and the other car manufacturing factories like Chrysler and Mitsubishi that have, over the decades, operated in South Australia.


Many people don't know that Holden is a 160-year-old company. It has been operating in South Australia since the middle part of the 19th century. It started as a saddlery business but took the decision in the early 20th century to shift into automotive manufacturing. It didn't build its own iconic Australian car until 1948, as the member for Wakefield has pointed out, but for decades it had the contract to build and assemble cars from American manufacturers, particularly General Motors. In 1924 it built a factory in Woodville—the suburb where I live, in the western suburbs of Adelaide—that operated until the 1980s, building GM cars and then building the Holden. Down at Old Parliament House this morning we had one of the 1952 Holdens that was built at the Woodville plant. A cluster of supply companies built up at the same time and have continued operating in the decades since in the western suburbs—some of them around the corner from my house, one still on the Woodville site, just behind the Bunnings factory, aiAutomotive, and many others as well. Before the war they also built a plant in Birkenhead, Port Adelaide, again in my electorate, employing many thousands of members of the western suburbs community.


In the 1930s Holden had signed a contract to shift their entire South Australian operation to Fishermans Bend, which would've been devastating for a South Australia that was trying to industrialise at the time. They were convinced to keep their operations in South Australia, and the rest has been history. For eight decades this has been, along with the steel blast furnace at Whyalla, one of the twin pillars of the South Australian postwar economy, around which so much research and skills development has grown. Most importantly, so many families' lives have been built around the opportunity to work at the Holden plant at Woodville, at Birkenhead and, since the fifties, out at Elizabeth in the member for Wakefield's electorate. It has been an extraordinary part not only of economy but also of our culture. We always supported the Holden car against the Ford car at Mount Panorama. It was always a big part of our pride, and tomorrow all of that ends.


Tomorrow will be a tragedy for the community in South Australia, particularly in the northern suburbs of Adelaide but also in other parts of Adelaide where those supply companies are such an important part of the manufacturing economy. The University of Adelaide says that the closure of the automotive industry will cost 24,000 jobs. In a small state like South Australia, that will have a devastating impact not just on the economy but on families. School principals in my electorate have for a couple of years now been talking about the distress that their children are evincing because they're worried about what Mum and Dad are going to do after this closure. This was an avoidable decision. As my colleagues have said, this was an act of massive economic self-harm by this government, for which the current Prime Minister also owns part-responsibility as a member of the cabinet at the time. At this time I pay tribute particularly to the work of Holden's workforce now, putting out the highest quality cars, I'm told by the member for Wakefield, of any factory GM runs across the planet. This has been an extraordinary part of South Australia's history; I wish it were part of its future. (Time expired)

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2017-10-19,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (15:53):  I would hope that the local member representing the electorate where the job losses are to be faced tomorrow has been working closely with the union, Centrelink and financial advisers. Some of those losing work with this change will find a new direction. Others will move to compatible and technical employment. It's a tough time, but Aussies are tough. The change is stressful and emotional. But I find sometimes that Labor would rather the Australian nation spend valuable taxpayer dollars to support an industry that had been depending on a government subsidy for some years. They worry about closing certain industries, yet they had six years to incentivise the closing companies to develop alternative manufacturing pathways, as clearly needed to be done. The decision to close many of the operations was in progress during Labor's time in government. Australians themselves did not support our car industry. We didn't all buy Fords and Holdens, nor even Toyotas. A government cannot have a continuous subsidy scheme. There needs to be an operational change to build sustainability.


I sit here sometimes and I wonder about this, but today I think I finally discovered the answer. It seems to me that those with business experience who kept accounts information knew that everything that was positive was in the black. Money in the bank was written in black. But everything that had to be paid was in red. If the number in the black column was bigger than in the red column then we knew we were doing okay. But the Labor Party see the red side as the correct side—the bigger the number on the red side, the happier they are. In fact, when they see whopping big employment numbers on the black side, they think that's a bad thing and say the government is losing jobs. I get it. I finally understand. It's that they don't know how to read the accounting books properly. In my community, they know that not being able to read the accounting books properly is actually not a really good skill. Everyone knows that would be a rubbish strategy. 



The Sydney Morning Herald on 16 September this year talked about all the additional jobs that have been created in the first eight months of the year. It was preceded earlier in June by information from Business Insider that again the jobs growth was huge. And today we announced we've got 371,500 more jobs. They are not equally distributed around our nation but certainly indicate we are going in the right direction. Some of the reasons for this increase in employment relate to the natural growth in the jobs market, the increased business confidence and the stability of a government intent on reducing the red side of the taxpayers' accounting books, but they also relate to active policy changes to encourage employers to take on more staff.


From 1 January this year, a number of incentives were put in place. A wage subsidy of up to $10,000 is now available to qualified businesses who employ eligible jobseekers. Some administrative changes also helped. Wage subsidies are being paid over six months instead of 12 months and an optional kickstart payment of up to 40 per cent of the wage subsidy is available for four weeks after the job begins. Minimum working hours are able to be 20 hours per week over the six-month term. There's a new youth bonus wage subsidy of up to $10,000 for employers who hire eligible jobseekers between 15 and 24 years of age. There are other sectors of the jobs market that also attract employer subsidies, and interested employers should contact their local job service providers.


I would suggest that Labor, rather than extolling the virtues of a budget that remains in the red, look more carefully at the opportunities for our working Australians and those wanting to work. Let's develop policies to grow enterprising skills among young employees, as these are likely to be the most critical skills for jobs of the future. Based on government projections, Australia will have between 5.6 million and 6.4 million job changes up to 2025. In 10 years Australia will have jobs we haven't dreamt of, but we know very many well-known occupations will still be in high demand.


My final point relates to the absolute correlation between the cost of energy and jobs. It's simple, really: the higher the price of energy, the fewer the jobs; and the lower the reliability of energy, the higher the employment numbers. Labor really need to look at the red and the black sides and realise that deficits and negative balances in government are not desirable.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:58):  When Ben Chifley in 1948 launched the first Holden off the assembly line, it was a proud moment for Australia, as the headline in this newspaper I am holding clearly shows. Tomorrow will be a sad day for Australia. On Sunday I went out to Elizabeth, to a function organised by Holden for the local community there. I was there with the member for Wakefield. Every model of every Holden ever made was on display. It was a visual presentation of the work, innovation, design and contribution to Australia and the Australian economy that Holden has made for almost 70 years. Since 1948, 7.5 million cars have been produced by Holden, with 45 different models. Into each of those models went design and innovation. Seven decades of Australians not only built those cars but built a life for themselves and their families either working for Holden or working for one of its component manufacturers. Holden, as the member for Wakefield quite rightly pointed out, was not just a brand. It was an iconic, unique Australian brand. Some members might recall the ad: 'football, meat pies, kangaroos and Holden cars'. It became part of the Australian psyche. 


On Sunday there was another very clear message from that event, as I spoke to Holden executives that are still with the company right now. Their clear message to me was that Holden would have stayed in Australia but for the negative attitude towards them from the Abbott-Turnbull coalition government. Holden was forced out of Australia by this coalition government, and it was this coalition government that turned on Holden. This will go down as one of the worst decisions ever made by an Australian government. Not only did Holden get pushed out of Australia; with them went Toyota, because Toyota had made it absolutely clear in the days before it happened that one car maker alone in Australia would not survive. They said that to the sham Productivity Commission inquiry that was underway at the time. Holden had two new models on the line, and Toyota had a strong export business going at the time. As Mike Devereux, the Holden chief executive at the time, pointed out, the car-making industry and Holden's contribution to Australia was $33 billion, or 18 times the level of assistance they were receiving. Those figures have never been disputed. 


Australia was one of 13 countries that could design and make a car from start to finish. Of the G20 countries, only Saudi Arabia did not make cars, and now Australia will join them. Indeed, while Australia joins them, Saudi Arabia is going in the opposite direction and wanting to get into the car-making business. The loss of car making in this country wasn't just a loss of car making in its own right but a loss of manufacturing capability, including the massive loss of seven decades of research, design, expertise and skills that had built up over that time. 


For South Australia, the cuts will be terrible. Twenty-four thousand jobs or thereabouts will be lost. The economy will take a $3.7 billion hit. The social costs, whether in unemployment, housing stress or health effects, are already being seen. In the Playford council area, where the unemployment rate is 15 per cent, and in Elizabeth, where it is 32 per cent, it will hit hard. So let's not talk about employment figures elsewhere in Australia. Holden's closure is this government's present to the people of the northern suburbs of Adelaide for Christmas. It is shameful. 


I make another point about the stupidity of this decision. The two car makers were producing nearly 200,000 cars a year at the time. That is going to affect our balance of trade, because all of those cars will now have to come in from overseas, or it will be a loss of export.


I finish on this point. I take this opportunity to thank the people who, over seven decades, made South Australia proud to be the home of Holden, and Australians proud to drive a Holden. It's the car I drive. They showed that Australia could build a world-class car, and for seven decades we did that. I certainly wish them well in their endeavours to get work elsewhere, but I know how disappointed they are that their jobs have come to an end. I repeat what I said earlier: this would have to go down as one of the worst decisions ever made by a government, certainly in my lifetime.

"Crewther, Chris, MP",LP,2017-10-19,"



Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (16:03):  I'm very surprised by this matter of public importance from the member for Wakefield, claiming that Australians are losing their jobs because of this government when in fact it is the very opposite. We currently have the strongest full-time jobs growth in Australia's history. In my electorate of Dunkley, in fact, unemployment increased under Labor, peaking at 6.2 per cent at the end of their terms of government in September 2013. In March 2017, after four years of coalition government, it dropped to 5.4 per cent, on the latest Dunkley-specific figures that I have. This compares very favourably to national figures. We have seen the unemployment rate decrease by 0.1 of a percentage point over the last month, to 5.5 per cent in September 2017. We've seen over 825,000 jobs created under our government, with employment standing at a record high of over 12.2 million jobs in September 2017. The participation rate is at a five-year high, and jobs growth is the highest since 2008. Over the last 12 months, 371,000 jobs were created. We've also seen, under this government, employment increase strongly, rising by 3.1 per cent over the last year, well above the decade average rate of 1.6 per cent.


Specifically in Dunkley, since I was elected, the federal government has made over 200 different funding investments, many of which contribute to jobs growth locally. One key investment is the $4 million going towards our Dunkley rail plan, which will be a business case to extend Metro rail from Frankston to Baxter. This project in and of itself will create 4,000 jobs, cutting unemployment in our area by up to one per cent. It will reduce youth disengagement by two per cent, increase local university enrolment by up to 20 per cent and provide hospital accessibility. But, unlike their federal counterparts, Victorian state Labor decided to delay this jobs growth over the past 12 months by stopping our federally funded business case going ahead. Only after a year of continual advocacy by me and the minister have they finally signed off.


On similar matters, federal Labor are worse than their state counterparts, and they were even worse when they were in government. To start with, they want to increase our energy costs, which will only make it harder for businesses to create more jobs. Labor failed working Australians. Under six years of their government, the jobless queues grew by around 203,000. In the period that the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Workplace Relations, the number of unemployed people increased by around 77,000 while his government was busy signing off on more and more 457 visas. Consider, for example, that when Labor were in government previously they made it harder for businesses to employ people by hitting them with a $9 billion-a-year carbon tax, hitting them with a mining tax and abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission—all things that contributed to Labor losing government.


In contrast, we have a plan to grow the economy and create new jobs. To this end we have, for example, included in the latest budget $75 billion in infrastructure funding from now until 2026-27. We've cut the tax rate for small businesses to 27.5 per cent. We've also invested in the establishment of a $10 billion National Rail Program to deliver rail projects that better connect our cities and regions and create job opportunities. I hope that once the state government figures out that the Baxter electrification in my electorate of Dunkley is a good thing it will contribute state funding, and then the federal government could co-contribute to this important local project. We've got the Regional Growth Fund, which will invest $472 million in regional infrastructure projects. And we've also seen several successful programs in Dunkley funded by the federal government, such as those via the Brotherhood of St Laurence or the Work for the Dole program within vision services.


In conclusion, I say to the member for Wakefield and Labor: stop the falsities and tell the truth—coalition governments create jobs. (Time expired)

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (16:08):  It is with great sadness that I too rise today to speak on this matter of public importance—Australians losing their jobs because of this government. It is very sad to see that one of our iconic manufacturers in this country, which has been producing cars for over 70 years, is shutting its doors tomorrow. It has been not only producing and manufacturing cars but skilling people, creating jobs—jobs of the future as well—and helping build the nation through the car manufacturing industry. With an issue as important as this one in the House—it is something that is so important to all of us in South Australia and all the SA MPs, especially on this side—it really surprised me, in listening to the different speeches of members opposite, to find that they have no understanding and no real idea of the car industry and car manufacturing. We heard, for example, the member for Gilmore—and I am glad that she is here in the chamber—say we can't go on subsidising industries. I have to tell you, all you have to do is go to the library and they will get the figures for you, as they got them for me a couple of years ago. You have a look at every car manufacturing country in the world and every single one subsidises their industry. They subsidise their industry because they know of the value-adding to the economy. You have a look at Germany, the US, Brazil, Thailand, Korea and Japan: they all have a subsidy for each assembly line worker working on a production line.


We were one of the lowest subsidies in the world—the lowest, not the highest. We weren't subsidising to keep an industry going; we were subsidising because we knew it value-added to the economy. It created jobs and had a spin-off for small manufacturers. It ensured we created technologies and different industries. If we look at General Motors Holden in Australia, we were one of the only nations in the world—one of 13 nations—that could create a motor vehicle from the idea to the design to the showroom in the caryard. Those were the skills that we developed in this nation, and to see Holden shutting down is very sad.


The end of motor vehicle production in this country was not inevitable. The people in this country know who to blame. The Liberal Party is to blame, including Joe Hockey, now the ambassador to the US. I am glad to see he was looked after with a good golden handshake, unlike the Holden workers tomorrow who will be leaving those factory gates not knowing what their future holds. The former Prime Minister and, of course, the current Prime Minister have destroyed an industry that was a good industry, which created jobs and ensured that it created technology and industries.


Let's look at South Australia for a moment, with the next batch of job losses. We know that the closure of Holden has a spin-off of approximately 50,000 jobs that will be lost. That's 50,000 jobs, and we could have done something. We all remember your Treasurer in this place; we remember him very well. He goaded Holden and told them to basically leave the country. We remember Mr Devereux, the chairman of GMH, in a front-page article in July 2013, saying: 'If this government tries to mess with our subsidies or mess with us, we will leave.' That is exactly what happened. We remember that speech here in this place by your Treasurer, who absolutely goaded them out of this country—Holden could have still been there today.


We also know that the people of South Australia will remember, and they know who to blame. They will know. I dare those mentioned on the other side—the Prime Minister and others—to come out to the suburbs of Adelaide, as the last Holden car comes off the production line, and meet the workers as they leave the gates of the manufacturing factory that they have worked at for years and leave their manufacturing, high-skill jobs to go home to their families for an uncertain future.


GMH gave work to many people; one of those people who worked there was my father. He came off a boat in the early fifties and, on his second day in Australia, he started at Fishermans Bend. From Fishermans Bend he went to the Woodville factory in South Australia. From there, he was transferred to Elizabeth and spent most of his working life there. I know the importance of that and how it put food and bread on our table. This closure is a travesty and it should not have happened. (Time expired)

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (16:13):  If those opposite wanted to talk about Holden, why didn't they move a matter of public importance on Holden rather than this bizarre matter of public importance? It's another bizarre matter of public importance from those opposite that talks about Australians losing their jobs because of this government, which, as we know, is not the case. Since we have been in government in 2013, we have created an extra 825,500 jobs. The matter of public importance makes no sense whatsoever but that's really what we expect from those opposite. Very often they don't make much sense at all. I can tell you that what really makes no sense are the state Labor government in South Australia's energy policies that have seen us end up with the most expensive electricity in the world—not just in the nation, but in the world—and successive blackouts. The state Labor government have been in power for 16 long years and they have delivered a disaster to my home state.


We know why power is important—without affordable and reliable electricity, there won't be any jobs in Australia because employers won't be able to afford to employ people in those jobs. When electricity prices are too high and when electricity is unreliable, we hurt jobs, and that's what's happened in South Australia. This was the very clear message that I heard from my local employers at a forum that I held with the Minister for the Environment and Energy. I'm grateful to the minister for travelling to South Australia to talk to my businesses direct about the skyrocketing power prices in South Australia, what it means for them as employers and what it may mean for jobs.


Businesses in my home state of South Australia and in my electorate of Boothby are already doing it really tough thanks to the Weatherill Labor government's complete mismanagement of the South Australian economy. My businesses do not have the capacity to absorb the horrific electricity price hikes that will kick in on 1 January for many businesses. There is no employer being left untouched by this energy crisis in South Australia created by the South Australian Labor Party. I pray that those opposite, with their very irresponsible policies that they would implement if they were elected, will not be elected. I will be doing my very best to make sure that they're not, because if they are we will see the power situation worsen.


Our hotels, motels and pubs, who employ thousands of South Australians, are facing increases of 50 per cent in their power costs. Some businesses have told me that their power bills will be an extra $750,000 a year as of next year. That is unbelievable, and I do not know how those businesses will be able to absorb those costs. Some local supermarkets, for example, are facing up to a 72 per cent increase in their electricity bills, and others have bills that are doubling. We're talking of a lot of them, because they are relatively energy-intensive users—they have a lot of refrigerators and freezers and a lot of lights. We're looking at bills heading into millions of dollars of increased energy costs to them. These independent supermarkets, in particular, who employ about 5,500 South Australians across the state, are going to have to find these millions of dollars from somewhere to meet the cost of keeping their lights on and the fridges and the freezers running.


The government has had to budget for extra millions of dollars to build or buy generators so that when we start our Defence shipbuilding program we can guarantee that the power won't go out in South Australia. This is why we, on this side, have a highly responsible and careful energy policy that will make sure we bring down prices for hardworking South Australians, for families and for businesses. We will be doing everything we can to guarantee the reliability of the system as well.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (16:30):  I rise today to pay tribute to a local legend and a national legend. James Walker was known as the 'Mayor of Hackett' for his activism in the Hackett Community Association. Born in Ashfield in Sydney, and raised in Cowra, James was a serious transport buff, somebody who worked as the historical officer with the Department of Transport and for the Civil Aviation Authority, who compiled a number of booklets detailing a history of civil aviation in Australia—including The girls were up there too, on the role of women in Australian aviation history—and who became a member of the Australian Railway Historical Society. He married Barbara Yelds in 1963, and their son, Jamie, was born shortly thereafter. James came to Hackett soon after arriving in Canberra and was a founding member of the Hackett Community Association in 2003, serving as its chair for many years. When the Neighbourhood Watch newsletter came out, James could be relied upon to drop into my office to ensure that I had a copy of it.


He was fondly remembered at a get-together at Siam Twist recently, alongside so many of those who've contributed to the Hackett Community Association, among them Len Crossfield, Jochen Zeil, Terry de Luca, Bruce Smith, Dorothy Mackenzie, Jolanta Gallagher, Greg Haughy and Chris Mobbs. We remembered how James was initially appointed the historical officer for the association and proposed the idea of having an annual Hackett Day, which would later turn into Party at the Shops. James came every day to Siam Twist to get his cup of tea made with real tea leaves, not tea bags. He loved his books. He had a huge collection of over 8,000 books, including books on railway history, war history and the classics. As his son, Jamie, recalled, his pleasure was lending his books to his friends. Vale James Walker. My sympathies to his family for their loss.


Last year former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the US national anthem, refusing to stand, in protest against police shootings of unarmed African Americans. His action, kneeling during the national anthem, has since been copied by players across US sports, including NFL, soccer, basketball, baseball and ice hockey. Importantly, their white teammates have supported them, locking arms in solidarity for the cause of racial equality, recognising that, while discrimination principally affects African Americans, the cause of racial equality is one in which whites have a critical role to play.


As many, including South African journo Khaya Dlanga, have noted, events 49 years ago this week have an important lesson for these protests. In the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games, Australian athlete Peter Norman ran a time of 20.06 seconds in the men's 200 metres final. He won the silver medal, set the Australian record, and, as recently as the 2000 Olympics, that time would've won him the gold medal. But it was Norman's actions after the race which were so critical. As The Star-Spangled Banner played, and Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood, heads bowed, with black gloves on their hands, it was Peter Norman who said to them, 'I'll stand with you.' Carlos said he expected to see fear in Norman's eyes, but he didn't: 'I only saw love.' Norman wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge, which he'd borrowed from white US rower Paul Hoffman.


I was pleased in this place in 2012 to move a motion which received unanimous support from the parliament, apologising to Peter Norman for the way in which he was treated upon his return. He took a brave stand for racial equality. A statue at San Jose State University, erected in 2005, speaks so powerfully of what he did. It contains a space on the statue where Peter Norman stood and invites passers-by to stand in that place and consider what they would have done. It is an important message that resonates with Americans today.


There has been talk recently of erecting a statue in Melbourne in tribute to Peter Norman. I believe that would be a powerful signal to recognise the role that Peter Norman played for racial equality, an action which would resonate to the other side of the world today and recognise that all of us can play a role in standing up for racial equality in the current era.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:00):  Today, I want to talk about a great opportunity for seniors, people living with disability, providers and carers to come together in the electorate of Blair. The Blair Disability Links is an annual event that brings together organisations and groups that provide services, support and opportunities for those living with a disability, their carers, families and seniors in the Ipswich and Somerset region. The launch of the Blair Disability Links directory coincides with the International Day of People with Disability, which is 3 December. It celebrates the contributions and achievements of people with disability in our community. Since 2010, the Blair Disability Links has grown every year and demonstrates the need for disability service providers, people living with disability and their carers to connect and share information throughout our local community. I wish to acknowledge and thank the service providers, carers and volunteers who work so hard to improve and enhance the lives of people living with disability and seniors in the Ipswich and Somerset region. They do tireless and often thankless work but provide enormous support and wonderful opportunities for people. 


It has been an absolute pleasure to hold the Blair Disability Links each year and it is probably the best thing I've done since I've been a federal member. I'm grateful for the immense contribution that people have made. Every year, we give out the Blair Disability Links and the Blair Seniors Links, and we've given out nearly 80,000 of those directories. I look forward to 1 December and the great celebration of ability and diversity that will take place at the Brassall shopping centre in Ipswich from 10 am to 2 pm. The Blair Seniors Links booklet is nearly 50 pages in length and the Blair Disability Links booklet nearly 100 pages in length. I expect them to increase by at least 20 pages as more organisations become involved in the directory. 


Unfortunately, I must detail some problems some of my constituents have brought to me regarding their experiences with the NDIS application process. My office has received complaints ranging from telephone-only assessment interviews; excessive time frames and processing; assessment practices for eligible conditions, including refusals of long-term conditions; disregarding reports from treating medical professionals; insufficient funding within plans; impractical restrictions on how funds can be spent; and, in some cases, constituents have reported themselves short on funds due to provider fees increasing following allocation of funding. The common complaints seem to be, while bringing the potential for flexibility, the current NDIS procedures and practices, particularly around assessment, result in considerable difficulty and distress for constituents. I have requested a meeting with the NDIA in my electorate. I look forward to meeting with Carers Queensland, who have the contract locally. I look forward to the government finally getting the NDIS right.

"Feeney, David, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (10:29):  This amendment bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, was first flagged in last year's budget. It was the political centrepiece of the Turnbull government's 2016-17 budget. The fact that we've only got to commence the parliamentary debate concerning these bills in mid-September of 2017 speaks to the chasm that exists between what the Turnbull government says are its political priorities and what its deeds reveal its priorities to actually be.


Labor has made plain that we will not support the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut for business. It is a tax cut that the Australian budget and the country cannot afford. It is in ever-deepening deficit under this conservative government, with a gross debt that has hit the $500 billion mark in June and is still growing. It is a record debt that has nearly doubled from the $280 billion that existed when the coalition took office in 2013. It is a matter of fact that, when the coalition took office, gross debt per person was $12,076. Today, after nearly five years of coalition economic stewardship, that number has grown to around $20,025 per person. This is a government Australia cannot afford, and this government is proposing a tax cut that Australia cannot afford.


The Turnbull government's plans for growth only meant growth of the debt. The government's budget papers expect gross debt to hit $725 billion in 2027-28, with no peak in sight. It is the coalition that turned out to be the debt and deficit disaster for our country. Labor has always opposed this tax cut because it represents a significant structural deterioration to the budget over the medium term and it represents a deterioration at precisely the wrong moment for the Australian public debt. This amendment bill represents a hit to the budget that shows the rank hypocrisy of a government which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair on the one hand and yet deliberately deepens the debt on the other.


Remember the glory days of 2013-14, when the then Prime Minister and the then Treasurer spoke of the nation's debt and deficit disaster? We don't hear that rhetoric these days. Why? Because the successive Abbott and Turnbull coalition governments have dramatically expanded Australia's national debt and have abandoned even the pretext of reining in public sector spending and gross debt. On this government's watch, the deficit has blown out and debt has crashed past the half a trillion dollar mark. The Turnbull government doesn't speak of debt and deficit anymore. Policy failure has rendered that catchphrase an embarrassment to the coalition. In 2016, the Prime Minister found a new catchphrase: jobs and growth. Like its predecessor, this phrase, too, is on its way to embarrassing oblivion in the annals of conservative marketing failures. Today, Australia's gross domestic product growth is less than two per cent. That is lower than the GDP growth of New Zealand, the United States and Canada. That is less than the OECD average. The very low growth rates experienced by Australia are a testament to the fact that, when this government focuses on a policy priority, one can be assured of failure.


We also get a sense of the scale of the budget hit earlier this year when the farcical scenes of question time are recalled. Just after the last budget, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister, 'What was the full cost of the company tax rates proposed by this government?' The answer given to the Leader of the Opposition's question included three figures: $24 billion, then $26 billion and then $50 billion. Such was the abject confusion that the Leader of the Opposition, ever the gentleman, asked the question for a second time. When asked again to confirm the projected cost of the business tax cuts, the Prime Minister flicked to Scott Morrison—in a rather comedic display—and the Treasurer said, '$36.5 billion.' Later, in a new answer to the same question, the government finally coughed up the truth. The Treasurer revealed that this was a policy with a price tag of $65.4 billion. In a single parliamentary question time, the coalition's company tax cuts had become more expensive by over $15 billion. This is the kind of shoddy, ad hoc leadership and shoddy, ad hoc management of this country's budget that has seen our deficit and debt position so dramatically deteriorate.


Ever since the government revealed its plan for business tax cuts, Labor has been clear that this was a plan that included not only a very large price tag but extremely minimal economic benefits to the broader economy. Let's have a quick reminder of what it is that this $65 billion cost to the budget produces for the Australian economy. By the government's own boastful measure, this is a policy that will produce a mere one per cent of economic growth over 20 years, only $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time and wages growth at record lows of 1.9 per cent. What a miserable harvest for more than $65 billion.


Australian families are facing a nasty cocktail of rising costs, rising electricity prices, stalling wages growth and record high unemployment and underemployment. This is a government that has nothing to offer them. Labor has long-held concerns about low wages growth. Without a doubt, the dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in the stagnant wages growth and rising inequality that now beset this country—also, at a time when the government has supported penalty rate cuts, operative from 1 July this year, and seeks to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. We now live in an Australia where a worker on $55,000 a year will pay an additional $275 a year and someone on $80,000 only an extra $400 a year. It goes to this government's approach and their misguided priorities that their answer for flat wages growth is a cut to pay and higher income taxes. How entirely unpersuasive is it when we see this country's Treasurer bemoan low wages growth while, at the same time, he speedily creates the conditions for that very same low wages growth!


We hear those who support this proposed tax cut for business say it is needed to drive investment, but it was only a few years ago that we had the biggest investment boom Australia has ever seen, and that was accomplished with a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. Budgets are all about priorities and this government, quite simply, has the wrong priorities. Under this government, big businesses get tax cuts, high-income earners get a tax cut, workers earning above $21,000 get increased taxes and penalty rates have been cut. Now, all of this, you thought, might have been enough to end support for this absurd policy, but it does not stop there. This government has failed on economic leadership and there's one person who is emblematic of this failure—that is, the Treasurer.


The Treasurer is incompetent and his incapacity to do his day job is the most blindingly obvious example of this government's failure in economic policy. This is not a sudden revelation; this is a pattern of incompetence and failure that underlines how badly this government is performing. Remember the heady days at the end of 2015 when Morrison was first appointed Treasurer. At that moment in time, he was believed to be formidable and he was accepted as being a significant political actor. How times have changed. He has literally shrunk in the job. Since early 2016, we have seen him with his GST reforms stillborn, we have seen him proposing and then abandoning tax powers being given back to the states, and we have watched him collapse and faint at various moments across this country's national political conversation. He has shrunk from becoming a person of substance, a politician that was regarded by Labor as formidable, to the shrinking violet and ineffective and inarticulate spokesperson that he has become today. On his watch, this nonsensical $65 billion tax cut has been proposed, and on his watch he has manifestly failed to make out the reasons for supporting it. Treasurer Morrison was supposed to be the chief spear carrier for this government but, as it turns out, he can barely wield a water pistol. 


Unlike this government and unlike this government's Treasurer, Labor has it priorities—priorities that will ensure we deal with inequality in this country. That means Labor is committed to funding our schools. This means proper investment in Australian infrastructure and it means a fairer tax system. A Labor government would further deal with superannuation tax concessions, something that we announced late last year and something that this government has since tried to describe as a secret superannuation tax. 


Labor have promised that we will level the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax—taking on the challenge of housing affordability. Labor have announced that we will cap the deductions that people can obtain for managing their tax affairs to $3,000 per person. Announced recently, our plan to impose a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts and to deal with the issue of income splitting means dealing with some fundamental issues that have been in the too-hard basket for far too long.


We now live in a topsy-turvy world where, from opposition, Labor has more aggressively promoted reform and more effectively articulated the need to manage the economic affairs of this country, while we have a government that, while in office, has managed to triple the deficit, expand the debt from $280 billion to more than $500 billion, and, of course, couldn't argue its way out of a wet paper bag. This is a government that, frankly, is paralysed—paralysed by its incompetence and paralysed by its divisions. When it comes down to it, this is a government with simply the wrong priorities—a government that is determined to reduce the tax on businesses, and big businesses in particular, while at the same time increasing tax on working Australians.


We have made the point that, in technical terms, what is being proposed by this government is an unfunded corporate tax cut—because that is what it is. There is no funding to pay for this. This is a tax cut for business that is funded by future debt. This is what, for instance, former Treasurer and former Prime Minister Paul Keating has pointed out: that it is an unfunded corporate tax cut, quite different to what he did when he was Treasurer, which was to broaden the base, go after loopholes and deal with inequities within the tax system. Paul Keating was paying for his policies. This Treasurer had a thought and said, 'Well, the politics of this ramshackle show need rescuing; I will produce a $65 billion tax cut for business.' But he is unable to fund it, unable to justify it and unable to speak to the effects it will have in our economy.


But, in another sense, this government's $65 billion tax cut is funded: it is funded by the tax increases that this government has delivered for working Australians. We know that the tax burden on PAYG taxpayers will increase in coming years, and it will increase because this government is increasing the tax rate in part through increasing the Medicare levy. The Parliamentary Budget Office projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. Under this government, the tax burden grows. From 2023-24 to 2027-28, when the company tax rate is meant to decrease to 25 per cent for all companies, personal income taxes rise by 0.2 percentage points of GDP while company taxes decrease by 0.3 percentage points.


It is clear that low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business, and they are paying it for it in the form of rising personal income taxes. This was confirmed by the PBO earlier this month, with the PBO saying that, in addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are expected to decrease due to policy changes—most notably, the policy decision to increase the Medicare levy from 2019-20.


We have also seen reports in the last weeks and months that there is confusion about which companies are eligible for this government's excessive tax cuts and the contrast between active trading businesses versus companies holding passive investments—a contrast that simply led this government into further confusion. You would have thought that, this being the centrepiece economic policy of this government, its major political survival line, the government may have had these details thought through and able to be explained. But, no, as has been shown time and time again, this is not a government that should be overestimated. This is another example of its incompetence, and its poor politics married to lousy policy.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (10:44):  I am happy to follow the eloquent member for Batman and his compelling and persuasive argument as to why the economic prescription of this government is completely discredited. It's not credible, because the prescription outlined by the government will not improve our economy and will not trickle down to the millions of workers who demand a wage increase. Indeed, this government has presided over the lowest wage growth in a generation. Wage growth in this country hasn't been this low since at least 1998, yet the government's answer to the question, 'What do we do about the wage crisis?' is to give an unfunded, subsidised $65 billion to big business—to banks and multinational companies. Much of that will leave this country and will not provide any benefits whatsoever. When you look at the Treasury forecast as to what benefits might flow, we are well and truly underwhelmed. Even if you can support the forecast by the Treasury that a $65 billion tax giveaway to big business has any benefit whatsoever, the Treasury forecast suggests that, at best, there will be one per cent of economic growth in 20 years. In 20 years, we will see one per cent of economic growth, which effectively would mean an increase of $2 a day in wages in 20 years. This is at a time when wage growth has flatlined at record lows of 1.9 per cent. This is not in any way an answer to the question: what do we do about the wage crisis in this country?


This is about the Prime Minister, a former merchant banker, and his tax giveaways to his mates at the big end of town. This is about the Prime Minister—who, as always, is more comfortable in boardrooms than in depots and offices around this nation—providing a gift to his mates in big business. That is what this Prime Minister is all about. This man has a mansion in Point Piper. He has accumulated an enormous amount of money. Good luck to him; he's done that. But, because of that to some extent, he has no regard for and no understanding of the struggle of working people in this country.


The Prime Minister is completely at odds with the aspirations of working people in this country. The Prime Minister does not empathise with the challenges that households and families have in trying to make ends meet. He doesn't understand that the flatlining wages and a fall in real wages in many respects is making it harder for people to deal with cost-of-living pressures. The Prime Minister, who's always happier when he's hanging out with his mates at the big end of town, couldn't give a toss about working people in this country. You see it with the amount of legislation that's introduced into the parliament, week after week, attacking organised labour and making sure that he can undermine the ability of unions to represent workers in order to ensure that wages are depressed.


It is not a coincidence that the Prime Minister wants to see retail workers' wages fall in real terms. It's not a coincidence that the Prime Minister wants to see hospitality workers' wages fall in real terms. They are low-paid workers in this country, and the Prime Minister is supporting a Fair Work decision that will see a fall in real wages for 750,000 workers in this country. Because of the Prime Minister's insensitivity to their aspirations and needs, he wants to see pay cuts to those people in real terms at a time when wage growth is at its lowest in a generation. That's what the Prime Minister thinks of working people in this country. He has no regard, no empathy and no concern for those people whatsoever. That is why the economic prescription of this government is so out of touch. It's not economically sound, it's socially unfair, it marginalises hardworking Australians and there is no answer to the question: what will the government do about the wage crisis in this country? The reason there is no answer is that the Prime Minister could not care one bit about the aspirations and needs of working people in this country. The budget reflects the values of the Prime Minister and the Liberals, and that's why Labor opposes this approach.


Labor believes that there is a need to attend to the wage crisis in this country. Labor believes we need to invest in education and we need to invest in skills to uplift our people. We're in a knowledge based, globalised economy. Our best resource is our people. We need to invest in them to make sure that productivity rises and economic growth happens and, indeed, people share in the bounty of that growth. Yet what we have from this Prime Minister is the repudiated economic policy of Ronald Reagan—trickle-down economics, which was introduced to the world in the 1980s by Milton Friedman, a now discredited economist who believed you give the big end of town as much money as possible, by way of tax cuts, and the money will somehow trickle down, by osmosis, to the people. Well, it didn't happen in America. What happened in the United States was that the middle class were hollowed out. There are people there now living below the poverty line, even though they are working a full week. They have the lowest wage growth. Inequality has widened to such a point that that country is beset with economic and political problems. Part of the reason for that is that they accepted the notion of trickle-down economics. Trickle-down economics is not the answer. It has been repudiated by the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank. No-one now supports this proposition except this out-of-touch Prime Minister and this out-of-touch government. 


This government have a callous disregard for working people in this country. The only legislation they ever introduce in the area of employment is to undermine unions. In fact, the only thing that unites this government is what they think about unions and what they think about penalty rates. We know what they think about penalty rates. If they could rip off every worker and take every penalty rate away from every worker in this country tomorrow, they would do it. Work Choices was their dream. It's their nightmare now. They're still living with the consequences of their obscene actions when Howard was Prime Minister. But, if they could realise that again, they would do it, because they support a low-wage economy. They're happy to see an easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire economy and society. That is their dream for this country. 


Labor has a totally different view. We invest in our people. We want to be a high-wage, high-skilled economy. We believe the way for this country to compete in this world is to ensure that we invest in our most important resource, and our most important resource just happens to be our people. That's why there's a big divide between the two major parties on investing in needs based education. We've seen this government take a decision to cut more than $20 billion from education. Our kids will be worse off as a result of the decisions taken by this government. We see an underfunding of universities in this country as a result of decisions taken by this government. We have seen 122,000 apprenticeship places disappear since the election of the Abbott-Turnbull government. They have no regard for skilling Australia. They are underfunding universities and schools and giving $65,000 million to big business. That is their answer to the problems that beset this nation—to rip off workers and give tax giveaways to big business. No wonder this government is struggling. 


It is quite remarkable that the government have had time to address this and yet, whilst their rhetoric has changed somewhat—some focus group must have told Scott Morrison to start saying 'fair', and they have started to shift, in some way, their rhetoric—their policies remain the same. They are policies that have never worked in any economy. They are totally at odds with the international bodies that have said that you need to redress inequality. Inequality is at a 75-year high. Inequality in this country is widening. The policies of the government are compounding inequality. Just take, for example, the government's decision not only to support penalty rate cuts but to impose more taxes on workers. Every worker earning over $21,000 a year will have to pay tax, and those on $55,000 a year will pay $250 extra tax, which may not sound a lot to Malcolm Turnbull, but it's a lot to a person on $55,000 a year. People on $80,000 will pay $400 extra tax. That may not seem much to the Prime Minister, but it is a lot of money for a family who might have one breadwinner making $80,000 a year. Yet, at the same time, the government is proposing a $16,400 tax cut for someone who earns $1 million a year. If you're earning $1 million a year, you will get a $16,400 tax cut. If you are earning $55,000 a year, you will get a $250 tax increase. That's at the same time that wages are falling in real terms. 


If you happen to be a retail worker, that's at the same time that you may have just had Malcolm Turnbull put his hand in your pocket and take out some of your wages because he supports penalty rate cuts. By the way, the penalty rate cuts for retail workers haven't ended. They started on 1 July this year, but there'll be cuts next year and in 2019 and 2020. For the next four years, retail and hospitality workers who may be receiving penalty rates are going to get wage cuts. At the same time they're getting these wage cuts, they're getting tax increases. And, yet, big business and millionaires are getting a tax cut.


This is the topsy-turvy world we live in because of the Prime Minister—no understanding. He's a very clever guy—just ask him! But the fact is he doesn't seem to understand what's happening in the real economy or the real world. Just go down the street, Prime Minister, and ask people, 'Do you want to get a tax increase?' They'll say, 'No.' Or even if you said this: 'You're going to get a tax increase, but someone on $1 million a year is going to get a tax cut. What do you think of that?' What do you think they're going to say to the Prime Minister? They're going to say: 'You must be kidding! You've presided over the slowest wage growth in a generation and you're giving me a tax increase?' This is why this government is in so much trouble. What's funny is the internal divisions of the government are not about these issues because they all agree. The things they all agree on are: how do we give people tax increases? How do we give penalty rate cuts to workers? That's what they all agree on. And how do we drive the union movement? That is their constant obsession.


The Minister for Employment is obsessed. She constantly quotes allegations about people swearing on building sites. If the minister had a swear jar for every time she swore in the Senate and she gave that money to Scott Morrison, we'd deal with our deficit! That's how often she is swearing in making allegations about swearing. What she doesn't do is say, 'We're dealing with a changing labour market.' What she doesn't redress is that people are feeling insecure at work. What the minister doesn't concern herself with is that people feel insecure because they're getting less security, and the government doesn't seem to care or doesn't seem to want to attend to it. What the government doesn't seem to understand—the Minister for Employment and certainly the Treasurer and Prime Minister do not understand—is that people are struggling to make ends meet. For example, there are some people who are paying off their home loans on a monthly or fortnightly basis, and they're on fine margins. We know that. It is a big thing to pay the mortgage. If interest rates go up a couple of points and wages are falling, do you think that people will be able to pay their mortgage? There'll be people who will not be able to pay their mortgage if we see a few bumps in the interest rates of this country.


Wages are falling and we have a government who are complicit. Their economic policies are placing downward pressure on wages. They have no answer to the wage crisis in this country. Their only answer is to give $65 billion to Malcolm Turnbull's best mates—big business. Even the Treasury has said, 'Even if the best happens with this policy, we'll see one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time.' The Prime Minister will be well gone from this place by then, of course—indeed, most of us will be. This economic prescription of trickle-down economics, which was repudiated 30 years ago and confirmed so by all of the major organisations—the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD—is not working. This is just a gift to the government's mates at the big end of town, as always. There is no regard whatsoever for working people.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (10:59):  I join with my Labor colleagues, who have spoken extensively in this debate—unlike the government—to oppose this piece of legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. There have been many Labor speakers in this debate, and hopefully the government will see fit to stand up at some point and defend what is a hypocritical and unfair piece of legislation. It just seems remarkable to me that the government puts forward this legislation but is not prepared to put forward speakers to defend this legislation. Perhaps there is something very much in that.


This bill seeks to implement the remainder of the government's company tax cut plans. It will provide a tax cut of 25 per cent to companies with a turnover of over $50 million. This will create a $65 billion tax cut for business, and that is the fundamental point that every single Labor speaker has made. It's providing an enormous tax cut to the tune of $65 billion to businesses with a turnover of more than $50 million. The previous speaker—and I'm sure other speakers have made this point—mentioned that the diminishing amount that you earn in fact attracts more tax, and it just makes a mockery of the government's so-called commitment to fairness. It is ridiculous that the Treasurer would stand up and use the word 'fairness' when putting forward this piece of legislation. It is anything but fair and is full of hypocrisy. That is perfectly obvious.


It's not just perfectly obvious to people within this side of politics; it's perfectly obvious to the public, particularly those that are struggling with underemployment and those that are unemployed and finding it very difficult to find for work. I was listening to the radio this morning and the point was being made there is only one job for every young unemployed person. There was a young man speaking on the radio who wanted work, who was desperately looking for work but was unable to find it in the community in which he lived. In that context, when we are seeing rising unemployment and youth unemployment rates in some parts of this country that are well into double-digit figures, this government sees fit to provide an enormous tax cut to big business. It is also at the same time we're seeing drastic cuts to budgets for essential services, including the cuts to the education budget at the primary, secondary and tertiary level. It just doesn't make sense, but it does reflect to me the chaos that this government is experiencing. It reflects the lack of capacity for this government to work as a government, and that is obvious in so many ways. That's including the fact the government is so arrogant and out of touch that it doesn't feel it necessary to provide speakers to prosecute this argument of major tax cuts to big business.


I have never seen such hypocrisy from government, and I've been around government for a very long time in one form or another. The hypocrisies are there in terms of cutting funds to things like education, drug rehabilitation and health, yet providing an enormous amount of tax breaks to people and businesses that can most afford it. The government, which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair, is in fact pursuing such an unfair piece of legislation. This is a government which was hysterical about the debt and deficit disaster—we all remember that—and hysterical about the budget emergency. Yet it proceeds with what they know to be an unfair tax cut, a tax cut that is perceived to be unfair by so many people. The government has overseen a deficit blowout and debt surging past half a trillion dollars, which is not often spoken about but that is the truth. You could almost say we have a Treasurer who has lost control of his brief. Perhaps that's why every time he gets to his feet he thinks it's necessary to yell at people. Now the government wants to deliver a $65 billion unfunded tax cut for big, multinational companies. As shadow minister for human services, I think about the disgraceful robo-debt debacle and the fact that this government saw fit to accuse at least 20,000 Australians, many of whom are vulnerable Australians, of owing the government money, and yet it proceeds with this $65 billion unfunded tax cut for big multinational companies.


Ultimately, it's ordinary Australians who will bear the burden of the government's lavish multibillion-dollar tax cut—people who are struggling, people who can't find employment and people who are underemployed. The Parliamentary Budget Office projects that personal income taxes will rise by 1.6 per cent of the gross domestic product over the medium term, from 11.1 per cent in 2016-17 to 12.6 per cent in 2027-28. At the same time, company tax receipts will decline from 2023-24 as a result of this bill. That just does not make sense. In 2023-24, personal income tax will represent 12.4 per cent of GDP, while company tax will make up 4.5 per cent of GDP. By 2027-28, personal income tax will represent 12.6 per cent of GDP, while company tax will represent just 4.2 per cent of GDP. It is clear that low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business through rising personal income taxes.


On all counts, this government is out of touch. It is a government that doesn't have a clue about what ordinary Australians are going through, and 21 opinion polls should tell it that. While Australian families are facing rising costs of living, rising electricity prices, falling wage growth and anaemic economic growth, the government is more concerned about giving big multinationals this tax cut. We see the enormous casualisation of the workforce, including using labour hire companies and private providers for Centrelink call centres.


Ordinary Australians are doing it tough. As has been articulated, 1.1 million Australians are underemployed. University graduates are less likely to find full-time graduate entry work today than they were a decade ago. The government is more interested in driving down the bargaining power of workers, with stagnating wage growth. The government is more interested in slashing penalty rates, while seeking to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. As the previous speaker articulated well, a worker on $55,000 will pay an extra $275 a year and someone on $80,000 will pay an extra $400. The government is more interested in attacking ordinary Australians in need of income support, slashing pension eligibility and making it more difficult to access income support when they need it. The government's multibillion-dollar tax cut for multinational companies simply adds insult to injury for ordinary Australians.


The government's cut of almost 12,000 jobs in the Department of Human Services speaks loudly. It has overseen 42 million missed calls to Centrelink, which is completely unacceptable. There is a 10-month wait period for people wanting to access age pensions, and, as I said earlier, we all know about the robo-debt crisis. The government and the minister are completely unapologetic about the fear, stress and anxiety they've put thousands of Australians through, sending letters with the police logo, threatening prosecution and imprisonment.


Over the past year I've heard countless heartbreaking stories about older Australians and those with a disability being forced to wait almost a year to receive the pension that they are rightfully owed, and yet we see this multibillion-dollar tax cut going forward. The truth is that the government's track record on supporting ordinary Australians is awful. It is completely atrocious. The government is interested in attacking and victimising Australians in need of income support. It is placing the burden of its own financial mismanagement on the backs of vulnerable Australians. It is more interested in defending negative gearing or capital gains tax concessions for the wealthy. It is only interested in making it difficult, painful and fearful to claim income support, to the point where people just give up.


I want to finish up in the last five minutes by saying this: Labor believes in ordinary Australians—they should be a priority—and so should any government. Labor knows there is inequality that needs to be dealt with. Fighting inequality and fighting for ordinary Australians means proper funding of schools, investing in infrastructure, a fairer tax system and dealing properly with superannuation tax concessions. Labor will level the playing field for first home buyers through reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax, and Labor will ensure a strong, comprehensive social safety net. It can and should be accessible and accountable to all Australians when they need it. People should not be made to feel frightened, anxious or intimidated. We should provide departmental staff with the necessary support they need to ensure they deliver a quality product. 


Labor is committed to embracing policies which ensure that all Australians benefit from economic growth. This piece of legislation does none of those things. This piece of legislation says clearly to the Australian community, broadly: the government has walked away from you. Despite the fact that there have been so many cuts to essential services by this government, they are pursuing this incredibly huge tax break for big multinational companies, which just does not make sense to me—it does not make sense to me electorally, it does not make sense to me politically and certainly it does not make sense to the many, many, many, many thousands of Australians who will look at this and feel left behind. What do you think happened in Murray, Cootamundra and Blacktown at the recent by-elections in New South Wales? Seats like Cootamundra and Murray were firmly National Party seats, jewels in the crown of the New South Wales government. People voted in their thousands against the ruling parties because of issues like this. They feel they've been forgotten. They feel that the government no longer understands what their concerns are. 


Labor is committed to ensuring that our industrial relations settings ensure a living wage and safe, productive workplaces. Australians are Labor's priority. Fairness is Labor's priority, not unfunded multibillion-dollar tax cuts for multinationals. I will finish by picking up on the point that the shadow minister raised, which was the obsession of this government to attack the union movement. I'd ask this government and members of this government to think about what the union movement has delivered for this country. It has delivered safe workplaces. It has delivered decent wages. It has delivered humane workplaces, and it just seems inconceivable to me that these cuts are not about demonising the union movement. The government should understand that, by demonising the union movement, they are demonising many Australians. 


Yesterday morning I attended a forum for Catholic Social Services which talked about this issue—that this government, in search of a narrative, is demonising poor people. In fact, a government's responsibility, whether they be Labor, Liberal or anything else, is to lift up people, provide people with hope, provide people with choice and provide people with a decent—although frugal sometimes—living wage. It does not and should not include these enormous tax cuts which have been pursued ideologically and despite the fact there have been such massive cuts in other areas that affect the lives and wellbeing of people. I would also add that it affects the economic future of this country when you're attacking schools, when you're attacking tertiary institutions. I join with my colleagues in opposing this bill.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:14):  We are debating a proposition in the bill being put forward by the government that would see billions of dollars in tax cuts for massive businesses that operate here and abroad, at the time we're being told that there's not enough money for the other things we want to do. For people watching this, the bill is Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. In fact the words in the brackets should be replaced and it should be the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reverse Midas Touch) Bill, because everything this Prime Minister touches turns to dust not to gold—every single thing. The Prime Minister was the person who decided he would change the way broadband was being rolled out in this country. What happened? We have seen the highest level of complaints about the broadband network. People are upset with the fact they expected a broadband system to deliver but it has failed to deliver—thank you, courtesy the Prime Minister; the reverse Midas touch. He had something that should have made everyone happy with the government. He couldn't do it, because he stuffed up the broadband network. 


We have watched the other side of politics for the best part of 12 months try to come up with a game plan on energy. We've seen them twist and turn, bicker and fight and go around expert shopping—trying to find one expert after another to back in what they want to do. They have had the best part of 12 months and what have we got to? We have a 50c a week saving. That's all we have on energy: 50c a week. That is not worth the pain that the country has been forced to endure because of this government and the way they have been unable to get their act together. Now we have this: they claim that the economy will be saved if we just handover billions to companies from a budget that we're told doesn't have enough money in it. This is not a plan for economic salvation; this is a plan for political salvation. It is wrong and it's why Labor is opposing the handover of billions of dollars in this way. 


Reports have emerged over the last 24 hours that the people who are more likely to be unemployed are those who have low skills. This should not be a surprise. Everyone has known this for a long period of time. When you look at the people who are unemployed, more often than not it is their low-skill attainment that has held them back. This government know it because in two years time they will bring in the Career Transition Assistance Program for older workers that will particularly target people in their 50s. What was one of the things that they found? They found that most people in that age bracket have a job—there's less unemployment amongst older workers; in fact, it's probably half the national unemployment rate and that is a great thing—but the minute those people lose their job, they are unable to get work for an average of 73 weeks; 73 weeks without work. What's one of the biggest reasons why they've lost work and can't find it again? It is low-skill attainment and low-education attainment.


The reason I mention this is that we wanted to see more investment in schools. What did we see? The reverse Midas touch in action again when the Gonski 2.0 plan, as it was erroneously labelled, was put forward. It cut out billions from what was required in school funding. So there's the first cut: to schools. TAFE has seen billions cut out of it, and more cuts are proposed—and a failure to bring in a new agreement to support it. So we have TAFE cuts. And what is happening with universities? We have billions to be cut from universities being continuously debated by a government that does not value education; it values demonising the people that don't have jobs, and for many of those people it's not because of low-skill attainment. But when we try to ensure that the next generation are as skilled as possible to get work, they are not given the chance. Why? Because the government says the money is not there, yet they can do this: they can actually saw underneath the bottom of the budget. It's like in those cartoons where you see someone sawing the floor to make someone fall through it. In this case it's the average Australian who is being undermined by a government that is cutting the support out from underneath them in a way that prevents them from being able to get ahead. That's what we're seeing with this bill. It cuts out billions from the budget and hands it over to big business, at a time when I argue those businesses are doing quite well. They have billions sitting there, but the government wants to make this massive transfer—and the bulk of it will go offshore anyway.


But that's what their plan for political salvation is—to say that they had a win. By the way, aren't all these wins translating in a great way! They had their first tranche of company tax cuts that got through. They had their changes to the backpacker tax. They had their changes to Gonski. They had changes to media reform. They are banking on all these wins, but look at where things have gone. The Prime Minister, in getting rid of the former Prime Minister, said that the government had lost its way, trailing in 30 Newspolls. But, after all these wins, how has this government under this Prime Minister—the man with the reverse Midas touch—been going? It's been trailing in 21—getting so close to losing out.


The government's plan is to hand billions over to big business. Look at the scale of dividend growth in this country from roughly 2014 to 2017: $40 billion handed out to investors and $70 billion this year—from $40 billion to $70 billion. With this tax cut, $65 billion is what's being proposed. The money is there. Big business is handing it out, in many cases to investors. But big business is not doing the lion's share of work in terms of investing or where capex is—capex is collapsing and hardly has any life to it—and it's certainly not providing average wage earners with wage increases. So what do we do as a result? We hand over billions that won't go into the pockets of average wage earners, that won't be put into productive investment to make the economy grow and provide more secure work, better wages for people and better economic outcomes. We won't see that. What will happen is it will funnel into investors here and overseas and we won't see any benefit from that whatsoever—when those businesses are already sitting on the equivalent amount when you see what's being paid out in dividends.


So this is the economic narrative—as the word is often described—of this government saying that this will provide a massive benefit to the economy. Really? Look at the stats. Since this plan was first introduced we've been able to scope out the economic benefit. What we're seeing is, potentially, one per cent economic growth in 20 years time and an increase in wages of $2 a day in 20 years time. This is in a climate where wages growth is flatlining. I think 1.9 per cent, roughly, is what's recorded. These are record lows. We see that living standards, which had been climbing, have gone backwards in the last quarter. We also see rising costs, largely driven by, as I mentioned earlier, the failure of this government to get a national energy plan in place. This has meant that the cost of electricity has gone up because there's not enough supply and demand is growing. Everyone knows what happens in that formula. The people who are bearing the price of that formula going the wrong way are average Australian households. When they are experiencing that sort of impact on their household budgets, particularly at a time when wages aren't growing, you can understand why people are anxious about their economic health. But, again, there is no answer from those opposite about how to improve wages growth and how to improve or tackle the issue of underemployment and how to get people into work.


My colleague the member for Longman and I attended a jobseekers forum that she convened last week in Caboolture, where people were saying that they found it so hard to find work and that the job programs that the Turnbull government are putting forward just aren't cutting it. This has been of great concern to the member for Longman, as it has been for other members of electorates that I've visited where jobseekers say the same thing. We spend billions on these job programs. We spend $9 billion on job programs for the 730,000 unemployed and we have 40,000 employment consultants in the country. But do you know what the most important performance stat of all is in terms of getting people into work—the success rate? It's 20 per cent. For $9 billion, we have a success rate, in terms of getting people back into work through government programs, of only 20 per cent. Eight out of ten people do not find work as a result of the Turnbull government's job programs.


Look at some of the other job programs that they're running—like Work for the Dole, which has been estimated by some to only improve the employability of the people forced to go through that program by a mere two per cent. Ninety per cent of the young people that go through Work for the Dole are not in work three months after. The other disgusting thing about this program is that, 18 months ago today, one poor bloke lost his life under it, and this government has not had the decency to release the internal review that they did on that accident or outline how they've made that program safer. This is a program, I add, members, that forces young people to go through it—and it doesn't deliver them a job—but it does so in a climate where there are legitimate concerns about the safety performance of that program. They don't get a job, and they're forced into a program that has massive safety concerns around it. This is wrong.


Again, these programs need attention. They need a government that has answers. They need a government that can get people back into work. They need an investment in skills. And what do we have in response? We have a government that proposes handing over, in the biggest glory gift, $65 billion straight out of the budget, instead of investing in people's skills, instead of investing in people's employability and instead of making these programs work. This is a massive indictment of this government, when you look at what has been happening under their watch. They can find money to hand to big businesses that are already sitting on massive piles of cash that they're handing out in dividends to investors—$70 billion this year, which they'll hold on top of that $65 million. And what's their other answer? At a time when people are worried about their jobs, their pay and wages growth, the other answer from this government is to cut the take-home pay of average Australians. There are 700,000 Australians who are looking at a pay cut as a result of a cut to penalty rates of $77 a week being championed by those opposite. You can't get a wage increase; the best you get out of this government is a wage cut.


What they're doing makes no economic sense whatsoever. But this is not, as I said, a plan for economic salvation; this is a plan for political salvation by this government. No matter what it does, it cannot find a way to get clear air. No matter what it does, whatever it puts its hand to—whatever it touches—turns to dust, not gold. The reverse Midas touch of this government is extraordinary. It is something to behold.



Mr Hill interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  I am being very generous, as the member for Bruce indicates, in using the term 'dust'.



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  I am a very generous man.




Mr Hill:
  Turnbull dust.




Mr HUSIC:
  It is Turnbull dust. Everything that he touches turns to dust. The problem is that the people who are forced to wear the cost of this are not those opposite. It is the people that we care about and that we represent in this place—average Australians who just want to get ahead and are constantly being weighed down by the poor decisions of this government. They constantly get told that the money's not there for the things they need in terms of better health care, better education for their kids, better child care, better infrastructure and better broadband—every single thing they want to see an investment in. But then the government finds money whenever it needs it to spend on things like this, handing $65 billion to the big end of town, when you know that they have the money already and you know how this will vandalise the budget. What we are seeing from those opposite is disgraceful. Every decision they make is tortured. Every decision they make is contentious. With every single decision they make, we have to wait for the outcome of the brawl in their party room to see how the country is going to be impacted by their flawed decisions. This is another flawed decision by this government. This is why we won't support it. We support better investment in this country rather than the politicking that we have to endure from those opposite.

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (11:29):  I rise today in opposition, standing against the party of economic mismanagement. It's the very party that cried foul when Labor sensibly utilised the budget to keep Australia out of a recession. You will remember the cry: it was an economic disaster and a budget emergency, despite countless international economists praising Labor's very, very fine treatment of a global crisis. Many economists agreed that the quite small debt that was accrued was nothing to be scared of. It was totally justifiable under the circumstances that were presented, and here we are, just a few years later, and the debt has done nothing but balloon under this government. You won't hear anything about that. They are very, very silent on the ballooning debt. Where is the budget emergency now? Where is the budget emergency that we heard so much about?


I'm starting to think that the reason that colour printers are so hard to come by in Parliament House is to hide how much red there would be on the government's balance sheet. I don't know about you, but I don't have a colour printer in my office and I think that's probably why. So here we are today with the government's legacy: an exorbitant national debt. It's set to get bigger with the government's unfunded big-business tax cut—$65 billion bigger. That is not chump change, Deputy Speaker Howarth. I know you know that. You know that the people in your electorate and my electorate could do a lot with $65 billion.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order! Don't reflect on the chair.




Ms LAMB:
  A lot of that money could go to health care, a lot of it could go to education and a lot of it could go to supporting, training and helping people into work. Instead, that $65 billion of taxpayers' money is going straight into the pockets of big business. This is at a time when company profits are soaring and wage growth has flatlined. Under this government we've seen record lows in wage growth, reaching just 1.9 per cent. With the cost of living increasing year after year after year, this is having an incredibly devastating effect. Economic data has shown that living standards, which had previously been climbing, fell backwards in the last quarter.


It won't be the rich who will be hit by this move by Prime Minister Turnbull, because he's giving them a $16,400 tax cut. It won't be the rich; it will be ordinary, hardworking Australians who just deserve a fair go. But, under this out-of-touch government, they're not going to get one, because the government does not understand what it's like for people who are struggling to get by. The Prime Minister doesn't understand. His electorate of Wentworth is absolutely nothing like my electorate of Longman. While his constituents may have a median personal income of around $1,100 a week, many people in Longman struggle to feed their family on an income of around $580 a week. It is nothing like Wentworth. I'd forgive the Prime Minister's ignorance if he actually did try to understand—if he listened to ordinary Australians and heard their stories, but he won't. He's stubborn. He's made up his mind without listening to all of the facts. It's no wonder he thinks that a cut to big business and banks is a good idea when we know that he only listens to his colleagues and the powerful lobby groups that wander up and down the halls of parliament and he shuts everyone else out. He hears those lobbyists claim that this hit to our economy is worth it and he hears the promises that it will drive investment, but he shuts out the fact that the biggest investment boom Australia has ever seen was when Australia had a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. That was the time of the biggest investment boom, at 30 per cent. The Prime Minister, his backbenchers and his government ministers shut out the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank, who quashed the argument that this tax cut will drive investment. They shut out anyone whose position differs from their own, and that can be very, very dangerous. It's not easy to have a proper thought in your head when you're stuck in this echo chamber. The hypocritical priorities of this government are glaringly obvious. 


Just yesterday during the matter of public importance discussion—and I stayed for all speakers, including government speakers—I was subjected to government speakers attacking the use of welfare to help vulnerable people get back on their feet. Yet here they are today advocating for corporate welfare—unbelievable! They are throwing money at big businesses who turn over tens of millions of dollars each year. They're fighting to increase taxation on working Australians but slash taxes for millionaires and businesses. 


The government just do not care about workers. I honestly think they have got it in for then. At every chance, they give a worker in this country another hurdle to jump over, another cut to endure, another attack to appeal—every single day. It's why the government trash the trade union movement at every single chance they get. The trade union movement is the organisations standing up for workers in this country. It is through the increased bargaining power of a unionised workforce that everyday Australians can actually get a voice loud enough to be heard, to stand up and face this government. That's their voice. But the government don't like it. They don't like that voice one bit. The Prime Minister doesn't like it when the united voice of Australian workers collectively matches the reaffirming 'yeses' that he likes to surround himself with. He does not like that one bit. 


But the voices of those opposed to the Turnbull government—I have to let you know, Deputy Speaker—are growing louder. They are growing louder in cities and suburbs. They are growing louder in states and territories. They are growing louder in regional towns and communities. They are growing louder even in his own party room, of course. The government have never had a real plan for Australia. They are still stuck in opposition mode. Every time any government member gets up to speak, it's never about policy, because they know how rubbish their policies are. Instead, all we ever seem to hear the government talk about is Labor. That's all we ever hear. If we listen to question time or a debate in the chamber, we hear you talking about Labor and not about your policies. People in the political sphere often say it's the role of government to create policy and the role of opposition to pick out the flaws, but the government seem to have got it the wrong way around, because the government have no actual costed policies. Labor have had to craft our policies early to fill that void. Because the government have run out of spin to try and sell their misuse of taxpayers' money, they're attempting to pre-emptively fall into the role of opposition. It's quite interesting. I understand the government want to get some practice in before the impending electoral defeat, but now is the time to lead. Now is the time to have a plan. That's what people expect of government. Lead. Have a plan. Give us a vision. Tell us how you're going to get there. 


We've listened to businesses and unions, we've listened to groups and stakeholders, we've heard the economic debate and we've developed a very strong plan to move Australia forward, to tackle the rise of inequality that the government's policies exacerbate time after time, to help repair the economic mess that the Treasurer's reckless misuse of taxpayers' funds has created and to ease the cost-of-living pressures for all Australians—from the seniors, who have already given so much to this country, to the youngest people, who are just starting out. While the government showers its corporate mates with unjust tax cuts, let me tell you what Labor will do. While that's happening, let's not be blind-sided. Let's look at what Labor will do. We will invest in quality education for all Australians, whether you live in Perth, Brisbane, Darwin or Hobart. We will invest in education for all Australians. This means not sneaking through cuts and mislabelling them as new funding. It means reversing the government's short-sighted cuts to TAFE and vocational education. I really wonder how this government can claim that they're all about Australian jobs when they're making it harder for people to get the skills they need to make them ready for the workforce. Instead, we're seeing them let jobs go overseas, bring overseas workers in and cut local people out of local jobs. That's what we're seeing. That is why Labor will introduce true labour market testing for 457 visas. Businesses should not be able to game the system, cutting costs at the expense of Australian workers looking for jobs.


Labor is also committed to making strong investments in reliable infrastructure projects around Australia. We understand that, to help Australia grow, we need to build the foundations that we can then expand upon. They are foundations like unlocking the Northern Australia infrastructure fund. That's still locked away. We are trying to get it unlocked and make some really wise investment decisions in our country—decisions that will create jobs and get people into work. You don't need to go much further than my electorate. When you start moving up the coast—whether you go to Rockhampton, Mackay, Cairns or Townsville—there are people there who are ready to work, willing to train and willing to get skilled; they just need a job. Unlocking the NAIF would help do that. Stop using the money to pay the NAIF board. Unlocking it to create some jobs is what we need. The people in my electorate would absolutely welcome that.


A real centrepiece of our platform is Labor's reshaping of a tax system to be fairer to Australians and not just a select few—not just the rich. A fairer tax system means a level playing field for first home buyers, for example, through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. It is not about dipping into your retirement savings. That is not what we do to help people get into housing. Dipping into your retirement savings is obviously a bandaid measure that we know will cause problems down the line, going back to what I mentioned before about a government that needs some vision and a plan. A fairer tax system also would mean capping at $3,000 the deductions that people can obtain by managing their tax affairs—not being able to write-off thousands or tens of thousands of dollars by having some crafty accounting done.


Let's be very clear: a fairer tax system would impose a 30 per cent minimum tax on discretionary trusts, closing another loophole for people who've been able to forego paying their fair share of tax. We want to make sure that that gets tightened up, again, making sure that people pay their fair share of tax. A fairer tax system doesn't mean upping the taxation rate of ordinary Australians so the budget doesn't collapse entirely under the weight of a $65 billion handout to companies that don't need it. For around 85 per cent of people in my electorate who are going to be hit with a taxation rate increase, this is going to have a devastating impact on their families and their family budgets. While the government is handing $65 billion to big business and banks, they're sitting down at the kitchen table trying to work out what they're going to do with less money coming into their family budget. They are looking at that handout and trying to find some way where that looks even remotely fair or is remotely going to help them and their families.


We need to have policies in this country that help people get ahead, not just a select few—not just for people who are wealthy, people who are fortunate. We need policies in this country. We need a government that has vision and a plan to get there. I can't understand how anybody can stand in this place and say that a $65 billion handout will somehow trickle down to people in our communities—how that is fair and how that is going to help those families sitting around the table, working out their family budget. I would implore that this government takes a view of creating a vision and a plan.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:44):  Thank you to the member for La Trobe. It's always good to be here in the Federation Chamber, the place where good speeches go to die! I'm sure I have 15 minutes of remarks in me. I feel confident about that.


In setting the scene for the remarks I have on this bill, I would pick up, actually, on something the member for Barton said. I was here a little while ago and heard her sterling remarks. She said that this does not make sense politically, and I believe that to be true. As I will try to outline, these big company tax cuts fail the fiscal test. They fail the economic test. They fail the fairness test. But also they fail the political test. You only have to go to any everyday community in Australia and you can get a pretty quick response from people as to what they think about the idea of firing up the nation's ATM and handing away $65.4 billion of taxpayer money to big, multinational companies and big companies. If you ask most people in the street, 'What do you think you'd spend $65.4 billion on?' you would get all sorts of responses. It might be to fix the hospital system. It might be to not cut school funding by $17 billion. It might be to not threaten our world-class universities with yet another $4 billion cut. It might be all sorts of things. From my experience, I encourage those opposite to try that test. Go out into your main streets. Have a little stall in the main street up in La Trobe, or wherever you are this Saturday, member for La Trobe, and say, 'I've got $65.4 billion, people. What do you reckon we should spend it on?' I think it fails the political test. But if those opposite want to stand over there and yet again bash themselves over the head bringing this bill back again—if that's what they want to do and if that's their political strategy—then who are we to argue against it? I know who it will advantage at the next election.


Of course, this is part of the government's jobs and growth agenda. 'Jobs and growth'—remember that? People listening at home—if anyone listens to the Federation Chamber at home—may remember 'jobs and growth'. You couldn't turn on the telly in the never-ending campaign through winter without hearing: 'Jobs and growth, jobs and growth, jobs and growth!' You might have been fooled. I get the political strategy—if you say it enough, maybe someone will believe it. You might have been fooled into thinking there was actually a plan because they said, 'We had a plan for jobs and growth.' If you say you have a plan, then maybe someone will think you actually have a plan.


As it turned out, and as has been revealed, month after month, week after week, day after day, it is not a plan. It was a logo. It was blue and yellow. There was a website and a slogan, but there was no actual plan. That started to become clear to me, because I remember that it was the priority. The centrepiece of the government's economic strategy in the jobs and growth agenda were these big company tax cuts. And they introduced the legislation last year. Nothing happened. I was thinking, 'Nothing happened'—for this critical part of the economic plan. It wasn't even brought on for debate until March this year. Then they struck this bizarre and desperate deal with some of the senators in that moment where the Prime Minister needed some kind of legislative victory—a political win, so to speak; anything really. They put through the lower end of it, and now we're back here with the bit that really stinks. It's the bit that brings home Gina's bacon—the tax cuts for the top end of town.


You might also remember—it was hilarious from our side, I suppose, but it probably wasn't the best day to be a government backbencher. Member for La Trobe, we sit opposite up there every day—



Mr Wood interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  It probably wasn't the best day to be a government backbencher when the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister, 'How much is this going to cost?' And we had an answer of, 'Well, it's going to cost $24 billion'—waffle, waffle, waffle, glasses come off. 'Oh, I mean $26 billion'—waffle, waffle, waffle. But of course that would be $50 billion. We had one answer with three different costs. We thought that was a bit weird. So we thought we'd try asking the Treasurer, 'How much is this package going to cost?' The Treasurer said, 'Well, of course, it's going to cost $36.5 billion.' We thought, 'That's a fourth number. Maybe we'll go back to the Prime Minister.' So we asked, 'Prime Minister, how much is this package going to cost?' The answer was $65.4 billion. In just three minutes of question time, the government spent an extra $15 billion, and so there it sits. The true figure over 10 years in the long-term estimate is $65.4 billion of taxpayer funding for this tax cut for big companies and multinationals.


Of course, this is in an environment where there was a 'debt and deficit disaster'. But somehow, magically, just by electing the Tories of course that was going to be fixed—just because they're Tories! Of course, the budget was just going to whirr back into surplus in some mystical fashion.


The true record under the drunken-sailor spending of the previous Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, was to add $100 billion to Australia's debt—it's not really in the right direction or trajectory. One of the things which really disturbs me about this is the unfunded nature of it. Sure, if you want to put forward a plan that says, 'We believe this. Here's the economic theory and here's how we're going to pay for it,' do that. That is not what this government has had the courage or policy conviction to do. There is absolutely no clarity, no explanation—not even a peep about how this is going to be paid for. And we know this trick: it's what conservative governments around the world do to justify cuts to essential public services. We've seen it in America. We've seen it in other countries. You say, 'This is the critical thing: we have to cut these taxes for the top end of town, whether it's income tax cuts'—because the only people who got an income tax cut from this government, of course, were people who earn over $180—'so we'll pop that in because that's somehow the priority.' The other priority is: cut taxes for the top end of town. Then, when you get that you through, you say, 'Goodness gracious me, the deficit's got bigger. We've got a fiscal crisis. The only way to fix a fiscal crisis is to cut Medicare, cut education, cut social spending. Goodness me, the age pension—that's a bit high. We'd better go and have another hack at pensioners.' And of course the Notice Paper is littered with bills that have another hack at pensioners.


We're not going to be fooled by this trick. If you are fair dinkum, if you actually believe this, if you actually had any idea how to manage the budget, you would have come into the parliament and said, 'We think this is an important economic reform'—make the case—'and here's how we're going to pay for it. Here are the things that we're going to stop doing, Australian people. Let's be honest: here are the things that are going to be cut to pay for this enormous company tax cut.'


We're told that this is essential—actually, I'll just go back to the member for Hughes; probably my least favourite member for his complete lack of rationality in any of his speeches. I had the misfortune of being on chamber duty for a few months in a row and, every single time I was on chamber duty, we had the foghorn of the member for Hughes blaring across. But I discovered 'Kellynomics' from listening to his speech in March on the company tax cuts, and it goes something like this: 'Because we're going to cut government revenue by cutting company tax, actually revenue is going to increase and we'll create a surplus.' Somehow by cutting revenue, you're going get more revenue when you're the member for Hughes. 


Then he misrepresents the wonderful legacy of Paul Keating when he was Treasurer—the government is obsessed with Paul Keating; they're jealous of his enormous legacy. I understand why because he transformed the Australian economy, and John Howard's government kind of coasted through living off the proceeds of that reform—I still haven't heard of a single structural economic reform that those opposite can name that the Howard government implemented after the GST; they just reacted to events. But what the member for Hughes and those opposite love to claim is: 'Well, Paul Keating cut the company tax rate from 49c to 39c, and somehow Labor portrays that proud legacy because we oppose this unfunded tax cut.' There are a couple of critical points though that you conveniently miss in putting forward this misrepresentation of what occurred in the eighties and nineties—that is, because the Treasury summary notes then that the company tax reductions have largely corresponded with base-broadening measures, such as the removal of accelerated depreciation. That's right: in plain English, the cut in the company tax rate that Paul Keating put forward was fully funded. It was clear where the money was coming from because the base of the tax was broadened at the expense of budget and important services and investments; whereas this government is putting forward a company tax cut which is unfunded. It shows the rank hypocrisy of the government. 


The reductions in the headline rate in previous years, such as Paul Keating's, were funded through making the tax more efficient and broadening the base. It is a special kind of love that you have discovered of late for Paul Keating—and actually we hear a lot about John Curtin and Ben Chifley as well; we don't hear much about your own legacy. I will read again into the Hansard an extract of what Keating said in 1998. It goes: 


The government is to cut the corporate tax rate in one step, from 49 cents to 39 cents, to give Australian companies a tax structure more than competitive with the rest of the world.


… the government has decided to lower the tax rates by removing some tax concessions—


—that is, lower the company tax rate by broadening the base; not just take $65 billion out of the forward estimates, give it away to big business for little to no economic benefit and call that reform. That's Kellynomics. Apparently we should all be in a race to the bottom on company tax—and we have to do it because some other countries have a bit of a lower headline company tax rate, therefore we should. Presumably, if you take that logic, if President Trump cut the company tax rate to 15 per cent, then we'd have to match that, and then someone would cut it to 10, and we'd cut it to 10—and zero would be nirvana. So we would have no tax revenue and somehow that would be a perfectly competitive world! Of course, you'd have to cut all government spending, but we don't actually get to that part of the conversation of how we are going to fund this ridiculous tax cut. That's Kellynomics. 


Why are you doing this? What's the government's stated policy reason for doing this? There's the global competitiveness bit, even though any sensible economist will tell you that the headline rate is not the correct comparator. You just take the headline rate and say, 'We'll compare that to another headline rate.' The US Congressional Budget Office is the most respected and well-developed budget office in the world, providing independent budget analysis for the Congress there. Our PBO, relatively young in its life, is learning from it, but that's a different story. But the Congressional Budget Office in America has said: 'You don't look at the headline rate. That's for dummies. That doesn't mean anything. You look at the effective tax rate that companies actually pay.' When you look at the effective tax rate, that is not 30 per cent in Australia. I think that on the last figures—I haven't got them in front of me—it was in the order of 24 per cent, which is a very different proposition. 


What you also find, if you've worked in investment facilitation and think broadly, is that the company tax rate, headline or effective, is but one of the many inputs that companies take into consideration in making investment decisions. I used to work in the Victorian government, in the economic development department, in the trade and investment facilitation area, and it's a very sophisticated methodology. You look at all sorts of things. We should not be ashamed in Australia that we have high-quality public services. This is something to aspire to, and you need money to provide them—not that that has dawned on those opposite, because apparently you can just take money out of the budget and not worry about where it's coming from. 


There are many other things: the stability of our financial system, the reliability of our regulatory environment, the rule of law, the quality of life, the human capital, the kinds of skilled workers you can get in Australia if you choose to invest, the infrastructure—putting aside the NBN, 'fraudband'; that actually is a problem, as we move down the competitiveness rankings. But all of these things are factors which are properly taken into account in the real world, the grown-up world, in making investment decisions. It's not just some race to the bottom on company tax as the only thing that matters. 


The purported gain is one per cent. This is the best estimate. The Treasury figures, the ones that the government is relying on, show a one per cent gain in 10 to 20 years. In 10 years something might start happening, and after 20 years it might get to one per cent. What does that mean? It means $2 a day in wages in 20 years time—for spending $65 billion over the next 10 years. That sounds like a pretty dumb return to me, but perhaps the political strategy of the Prime Minister, 'Mr 50c', is shining through. He's now adding 50c off your electricity bill in 10 or 20 years time, so you might get $2.50! Maybe that's it. Maybe that sort of spread-copper, burn-coal, spin-crap election strategy that we're starting to see emerging—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order! Just watch your—




Mr HILL:
  That was exactly what I said in Hansard yesterday, if you check, and it was agreed—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I just ask the member for Bruce to watch his language and not to reflect on members personally like you did earlier. 'Waffle, waffle, waffle, taking glasses off' is reflecting on members personally. I would just ask the member to keep that in mind, thanks.




Mr HILL:
  I think 'waffle' is a figure of speech. 



An honourable member:  Taking glasses off?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You weren't here.




Mr HILL:
  That's a description of what happens in question time. That's not indicating—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No. It's a reflection on the Prime Minister, and I'd ask the member for Bruce—




Mr HILL:
  It is a reflection. Would you like me to make more reflections on the Prime Minister?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No. I would ask the member for Bruce not to do that. It's not in order. Thank you. Continue. You've got 24 seconds left.




Mr HILL:
  That's fine. I'm happy to seek clarification. I wasn't imitating the Prime Minister, which is against practice. I was observing what the Prime Minister does, which I think is entirely in accordance with the standing orders. So what's your point?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Bruce—




Mr HILL:
  You don't have a point.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Your time's finished. I was merely saying that you were out of order. I invite you to go and reflect on those orders. Check with Mr Burke. Mr Burke would be able to fill you in.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (11:59):  I'm sure the member for Bruce will reflect on the standing orders. I wasn't going to speak on this particular matter, but the member for Bruce inspired me with his rhetoric and passion for the subject. I, too, want to speak about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. Deputy Speaker Howarth, you've obviously heard that, on this side, there have been a lot of concerns raised about the net benefit for our economy if the $65 billion tax cut goes through. I've heard a lot of observations from our perspective that it will not be terribly much. That's in the spirit of bipartisanship. That was really driven home to me. I would categorise myself as someone in the Labor Party who is pro-business. I have worked with businesses in a whole range of areas in my previous life. If I thought this was a good idea and I thought this would actually generate the prosperity that this government says it is going to generate, then not just I but also others on our side would support this proposed tax cut, but that's not what I see at all.


I deal with businesspeople a lot. For the parliamentary record, when I was parliamentary secretary to Kevin Rudd, particularly during the global financial crisis—the one that is often denigrated on the other side; the one that we say wasn't as bad as people were saying—we worked very closely with business. It's important to lay the groundwork for why I say that the $65 billion could be better spent and could be backed up with appropriate savings. If I go back in history—and it does tie into the enterprise tax plan—we started detecting a substantial softening in the US economy, particularly when we saw the collapse of Lehmann Brothers. I'm glad I'm able to talk about this, because it's one of the great failings of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era that they were never able to get a proper description of what we were facing during the global financial crisis, due to the internal dynamics.


I hoped that your side of politics, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, had learnt from us, but I think you took the wrong lessons from us. I think you're now reaping the dividend of that cancer in the way you deal with unpopular leaders or have difficulties with leaders. That's not an attack on you; it's just an observation. When you are consumed by the discussion about internal dynamics, your government doesn't get the message out about what it wants to achieve and what it has achieved for the economy. During that particular period of time, particularly with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, businesses generally were facing diabolically bad conditions, and they weren't talking about tax cuts then, I can tell you.


We faced two difficulties. I can recall being party to a number of very serious conversations about the economic difficulties that we faced. The first one was stabilising the world financial order. When I spoke to Lindsay Tanner, who was then our finance minister, he said that the world had a financial heart attack on three occasions and, in effect, the entire world financial system was close to collapse. Australians don't realise that. Australians don't realise that a lot of businesses were going to basically hit the wall. We were facing the most grave consequences in terms of what might happen since the Great Depression. That's how bad it was. It's interesting, when we have this discussion now about this particular bill and the $65 billion tax cut, to reflect on what actually occurred then. That informs Labor's view a lot on how to best support business productively so that it can grow in a market that is still affected by the vestiges of the global financial crisis. When a lot of the economic commentators spoke about the global financial crisis and how Australia came out of it, I always detected an underlying fragility. I think it's still there. I think it affects big business and small business.


But my point is that we basically faced a situation where the global financial order was going to collapse. What stopped it collapsing here in Australia was the bank guarantee. I meet with businesses. I deal with businesses across the area—and I'll touch on that in a second and tie it to this particular bill. The Prime Minister formed a special committee—I think it was the SBPC, the strategic budget priorities committee—and I recall having a discussion on the weekend that the SBPC was meeting. There was a lot of criticism about the SBPC, but we were facing a situation at the end of that particular week in October where, if the Australian government had not taken action, there would be a run on the banks the following week.


Why do I talk about business? The reason that I talk about business is that, on the weekend that the SBPC was meeting, I sat down with a gentleman who had developed a lot of property around Dandenong and the surrounding area—someone who was not necessarily pro-Labor but someone I would speak to from time to time—and, while we were sitting there having breakfast, he said, 'If you don't provide a bank guarantee for my business, I'm taking $16 million out of the bank next week.' I thought that that was bluster and I said, 'You can't be serious.' He said, 'My savings aren't safe; I'm taking the money out of the bank'—he was a liquid businessperson, a successful businessperson, not a spendthrift—and I thought, 'This is getting very serious.' If you remember what Ken Henry said when we talked about this period of time, you'd recall that he talked about his mother basically wanting to take money out of the bank.


People underestimate what it was like for businesses during that time. At that time, I dealt with Gerry Ryan, who's the head of Jayco, and we would convene meetings with large businesses in the Dandenong area. These were not publicised. They were important meetings that were put together with major retail chains and major manufacturers that formed the bulk of employment in the Dandenong region. This was slightly out of my area, and I would ask, 'What can we do to protect your businesses? This was around the same period—late 2008-09. Gerry started to convene these meetings so that I could talk with big businesses and small businesses directly, who said, 'We've got to have stimulus in the economy; otherwise, we're going to start laying off thousands of workers.'


I think the thing for critics of the then government's stimulus package—and again it relates to this particular bill—is the question around what business needs to create jobs and opportunity. When I hark back to that period of time, what business needed was spend on infrastructure and the creation of confidence in the community. I won't go into the details of the meetings, because these meetings were held with up to 14 or 15 members of the business community—and my staff member was there at that time. We were literally facing this yawning chasm of: 'My God; employment is going to collapse in the south eastern region of Melbourne.' It was that close.


The worrisome thing, when I look at this bill and the $65 billion we're talking about, is that everyone has forgotten what Australian businesses were facing and what the Australian government needed to do to keep those businesses afloat. The first component was to stop the run on the banks—and that's what happened with the bank guarantee. I noticed that former Treasurer Wayne Swan was speaking here yesterday about BHP and its role. The former Treasurer was obviously right at the coalface in terms of what happened there, and he was talking about businesses that don't pay tax—and I'll talk about that briefly later on. But people forget that we needed to create confidence.


The second measure—regardless of what side of politics—is to inject liquidity into the system, which we did with the first stimulus in November-December that year. That lifted retail. Retail is the canary in the coalmine. If retail is doing well, it's a good canary. When it was not doing well, major retailers were telling me, 'We're sacking.' They were getting ready to sack thousands of workers for the Christmas period in 2008. That didn't happen. That was, I think, a government working constructively with small business and big business.


Then, of course, we established the infrastructure projects. Again, we would have differences about how that money was spent. When I looked at the number of tradespeople in my constituency whose jobs were saved by those stimulus packages that built those buildings that the opposition, the now government, were criticising, I was seeing a person, a livelihood, a lifestyle, potentially taken away. My point is: when I look at what the government's putting forward, I see a measure that is not going to deliver the economic benefits that the government wants and that will be at a substantial cost to the economy and to its own reputation really. There are better ways of doing this.


Again, when I talk to businesses now, they're not saying, 'Don't give us a tax cut.' They're saying, 'Build more infrastructure.' There are Liberal supporters and coalition supporters. I wouldn't go so far as to say they were talking like socialists, but when you're talking about people that I would regard as being in the far right of the Liberal party and they are saying to me, 'I want you guys in the state government to concentrate on infrastructure,' not one person has mentioned a tax cut. We're proposing $65 billion worth of tax cuts, and these are big businesses—they don't talk about this—like Jayco, for example. Gerry Ryan hasn't come up to me and said, 'I would like a tax cut'—and they employ 800 people. They are a world-leading manufacturer of a great product. Gerry has another wing, his dinosaur creatures company, which features in Hollywood. I think that's about a $130 million enterprise. This is a man that does business overseas. This are one of the people that your government is targeting with this tax cut, but he's not saying we need this.


Again, when I look at the rationale for why we need this, it's just not evident. I accept that the government has put forward its reason, but we've heard speaker after speaker on our side debunk that. We're not opposing this because we just like opposing it; we're opposing it because we think the $65 billion, if it needed to be spent, could be spent in much more effective ways. For example, I have two headspaces in my regional area. They happened as a consequence of lobbying that my office did with a group of incredible young students in 2012 because we had a suicide cluster. If anyone has lived in a region where you see young people killing themselves in the numbers that they did in my constituency, you don't want your worst enemy to live through that; I can assure you of that. What we did was lobby the then government—and there was resistance from our side, so I'm not saying this was an easy thing. We did a program with Four Corners called 'There is no 3G in heaven'. What the then Gillard government did was direct, I think, up to $6 million—$3 million for the headspace in Dandenong and $3 million for the headspace in Narre Warren. At least we did something with that.


Last week I went back to that headspace again as part of national Mental Health Week and headspace day. I met with the young people and I heard about the lives that are being saved. As I was saying, when you've been through an area that's been as scarred as that region, particularly with the young people that had been killing themselves, you ask: 'What do they need?' If you talk with them afterwards, they say, 'We need funding certainty because, beyond 2019, we're not quite sure if we can still function.' We have massive population growth down our way and, as someone who's lived through that experience of young people hurting themselves in this way, the fact that there's not a guarantee of the funding for an essential service that protects and saves young people blows my mind. If I saw something in this bill that basically said, 'We're going to put $120 million to national headspace,' I would say congratulations to your side of politics, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth. I would like that, but there's nothing there.


There are tax cuts to businesses that sometimes, in effect, pay no tax. I have here, in my hand, an article from ABC News titled: 'Who pays what? ATO names large companies that paid zero tax in 2014-15'. It says there are 670 large companies that paid no corporate tax in the 2014-15 financial year, and 1,900 public, private and foreign-owned entities for the 2014-15 income year paid no tax. I could spend a couple of hours reading through these figures. For example, you have a company with an income of $216 million and there's no tax payable—that's quite extraordinary. My view is that we can't support this particular tax cut. There are better ways of doing this. I respectfully put to you and to the government that this bill be reconsidered.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (12:15):  I rise in this place today to ask the Turnbull government one very simple question. Is this government kidding, giving a $65 billion tax cut to big business? Is the Turnbull government so out of touch with the Australian people that it honestly believes that giving a big tax cut to big business is what this country needs to move forward? This government needs a reality check, and I am more than happy to provide it. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison, listen carefully to these facts. Growing inequality in this country is one of our fastest growing concerns, and the government should be addressing it. Inequality is at a 70-year high. More than 105,000 people are homeless. One-third of Australian aged pensioners are living in poverty. Thirty-two per cent of unemployed people live in poverty, and the HILDA report showed that child poverty is growing. Wage growth hasn't been this low since the retention of records began.


The Australian Bureau of Statistics has collected data since 1975 on earnings inequality. Profits have gone up by 40 per cent, but wages have gone up by less than two per cent. Real wages have grown by 72 per cent for the top 10 per cent of earners—in 1975 they earned twice as much as the bottom 10 per cent, but by 2014 it was nearly three times as much. If low-wage earners had enjoyed the same percentage gains as the highest paid, they would be $16,000 a year better off. The richest one per cent of Australians own more wealth than the bottom 70 per cent of Australians combined. For every dollar a male earns, a woman earns 82c. A total of 678 corporations and 48 millionaires paid no tax. How completely messed up are the Turnbull government's priorities! It wants to give a $65 billion tax cut to big business and not address homelessness and stagnant wage growth or assist Australians living in poverty. What kind of government does that? It is an out of touch, out of its mind, incompetent, right-wing government.


And then there are the facts about my community of Herbert. We are a strong and resilient community, and we have experienced our fair share of knocks. But the Turnbull government is insistent on kicking us while we are down. Unemployment in Townsville is at 8.9 per cent. Youth unemployment is just under 25 per cent. To add to those very high unemployment figures, we also have a very high underemployment situation. Personal insolvency is amongst some of the highest rates in the country. We are drought declared and on level 3 water restrictions. Our electricity prices have skyrocketed, with some local businesses even choosing not to run their air conditioners in 33-degree heat. Yes, there are projects coming, and yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Even so, there is still serious concern over the potential lack of skills to deliver those projects, and that includes apprentices and trainees, a fact that is definitely not helped by the Turnbull government's more than $2 billion cut to TAFE.


Because of our community's get-back-up-and-get-going, never-say-die attitude, we will come through these challenges. But our success and survival will not come from the Turnbull government. It will come because we work hard and we are resilient. It will come from federal Labor backing and supporting our community with $100 million towards vital water infrastructure. The vision for our community will come from a federal Labor government, which has committed $200 million towards hydropower on the Burdekin Falls Dam. It will come from strong investment by the Queensland Labor government, which has also invested in water, infrastructure, roads and the CBD revitalisation. It will come from the local council and local community leaders, like Brad Webb, who have stepped up, united and worked collaboratively to assist in addressing these issues. Most importantly, our survival will be the result of the united Townsville community, who continue to support each other and local businesses through tough times. But assistance to Townsville, our workers, families and pensioners will not come from the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut. Interestingly, the assistance that is coming from the Turnbull government will aim to have Australians believe that giving big businesses a tax cut will eventually trickle down to workers' pay packets and create more jobs. The theory of trickle-down economics has been around for over 40 years. I, along with many other workers and families, am still waiting to see exactly what does trickle down, because, at this stage, the only thing that is trickling down is inequality.


The Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut will have minimal economic impact. It's barely even measurable: one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time, and a $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time. This is at a time when wages growth has flatlined at a record low of 1.9 per cent. Recently released economic data show that living standards that had been climbing have gone backwards in the last quarter. Australian families are facing a nasty cocktail of rising costs and electricity prices, stalling wages growth and resulting in record-high underemployment, and the Turnbull government has nothing to offer. Labor has long-held concerns about low wages growth. Without a doubt, the dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in the stagnation of wages growth and in rising inequality.


At a time when the government have also supported penalty rate cuts from 1 July this year, they also seek to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with an income above $21,000. A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year in tax, and for someone on $80,000 it's an extra $400 in tax. How is it fair that a worker on $55,000 a year will pay $275 more when big businesses are paying less. It's clear that, in the form of rising personal income taxes, low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business. This was confirmed by the Parliamentary Budget Office earlier this month, with the PBO saying that:


In addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are projected to increase due to policy changes, most notably the policy decision to increase the Medicare Levy from 2019-20.


The PBO projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. This is a government that has totally confused the Robin Hood message, because they take from the poor and give to the rich in the form of taxation.


If the Turnbull government is looking for ideas on how to spend $65 billion that would improve the situation in this country, particularly in my electorate, I have a very long list of ideas. Provide water security for Townsville and match Labor's commitment for $100 million. Provide hydropower generation on the Burdekin Falls Dam and match Labor's commitment of $200 million. Complete the rollout of Labor's NBN, as the NBN will be the greatest new infrastructure for regional, rural and remote Queensland—but only if we have fibre to the curb or premises. Reverse the $401.8 million in cuts to Queensland universities, in particular the $37.1 million cut to James Cook University in North Queensland. Reinstate the cuts to the Townsville Health and Hospital Service. Stop the $300 million in cuts to public dental services, where, across Queensland, waiting lists have blown out to 117,000 people. End the GP freeze on everything—an issue that is holding our doctors and medical practices to ransom. Stop the cuts to pathology. Re-establish Labor's Health Workforce Australia, which was working on retaining doctors in regional, rural and remote areas, because right now in Townsville we are facing a GP registrar crisis. Commit to ongoing funding for the Townsville Salvation Army for the youth drug and alcohol detox facility. End the more than $2 billion in cuts to TAFE. Stop the more than $2 billion in cuts to aged care. Don't raise the working age to 70. Don't cut the energy supplement. Spend more on infrastructure. Commit and sign off on even one project from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. There are a number of ways that $65 billion could be better spent than on a $65 billion big business tax break that will contribute to the growing inequality divide.


Labor have the priorities right. We will ensure we deal with inequality in this country by properly funding needs based funding for schools; investing in job-creating infrastructure; establishing a fairer tax system; dealing with superannuation tax concessions, which is something that we announced late last year and yet somehow the government has now decided that it is a secret superannuation tax; levelling the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax; capping the deductions people can obtain for managing their tax affairs to $3,000; and imposing a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts to deal with income splitting—dealing with something that has been in the too-hard basket for far too long.


In contrast we have a government that has its priorities all wrong. It is a government determined to reduce the tax on businesses—big business in particular—while at the same time increasing the tax on everyday working Australians who are just trying to get ahead. Only Labor will stand and fight to eliminate inequality, only Labor will stand up for workers, families and pensioners, and only Labor will deliver a fairer tax system for every citizen in this country.

Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (10:29):  This amendment bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, was first flagged in last year's budget. It was the political centrepiece of the Turnbull government's 2016-17 budget. The fact that we've only got to commence the parliamentary debate concerning these bills in mid-September of 2017 speaks to the chasm that exists between what the Turnbull government says are its political priorities and what its deeds reveal its priorities to actually be.


Labor has made plain that we will not support the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut for business. It is a tax cut that the Australian budget and the country cannot afford. It is in ever-deepening deficit under this conservative government, with a gross debt that has hit the $500 billion mark in June and is still growing. It is a record debt that has nearly doubled from the $280 billion that existed when the coalition took office in 2013. It is a matter of fact that, when the coalition took office, gross debt per person was $12,076. Today, after nearly five years of coalition economic stewardship, that number has grown to around $20,025 per person. This is a government Australia cannot afford, and this government is proposing a tax cut that Australia cannot afford.


The Turnbull government's plans for growth only meant growth of the debt. The government's budget papers expect gross debt to hit $725 billion in 2027-28, with no peak in sight. It is the coalition that turned out to be the debt and deficit disaster for our country. Labor has always opposed this tax cut because it represents a significant structural deterioration to the budget over the medium term and it represents a deterioration at precisely the wrong moment for the Australian public debt. This amendment bill represents a hit to the budget that shows the rank hypocrisy of a government which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair on the one hand and yet deliberately deepens the debt on the other.


Remember the glory days of 2013-14, when the then Prime Minister and the then Treasurer spoke of the nation's debt and deficit disaster? We don't hear that rhetoric these days. Why? Because the successive Abbott and Turnbull coalition governments have dramatically expanded Australia's national debt and have abandoned even the pretext of reining in public sector spending and gross debt. On this government's watch, the deficit has blown out and debt has crashed past the half a trillion dollar mark. The Turnbull government doesn't speak of debt and deficit anymore. Policy failure has rendered that catchphrase an embarrassment to the coalition. In 2016, the Prime Minister found a new catchphrase: jobs and growth. Like its predecessor, this phrase, too, is on its way to embarrassing oblivion in the annals of conservative marketing failures. Today, Australia's gross domestic product growth is less than two per cent. That is lower than the GDP growth of New Zealand, the United States and Canada. That is less than the OECD average. The very low growth rates experienced by Australia are a testament to the fact that, when this government focuses on a policy priority, one can be assured of failure.


We also get a sense of the scale of the budget hit earlier this year when the farcical scenes of question time are recalled. Just after the last budget, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister, 'What was the full cost of the company tax rates proposed by this government?' The answer given to the Leader of the Opposition's question included three figures: $24 billion, then $26 billion and then $50 billion. Such was the abject confusion that the Leader of the Opposition, ever the gentleman, asked the question for a second time. When asked again to confirm the projected cost of the business tax cuts, the Prime Minister flicked to Scott Morrison—in a rather comedic display—and the Treasurer said, '$36.5 billion.' Later, in a new answer to the same question, the government finally coughed up the truth. The Treasurer revealed that this was a policy with a price tag of $65.4 billion. In a single parliamentary question time, the coalition's company tax cuts had become more expensive by over $15 billion. This is the kind of shoddy, ad hoc leadership and shoddy, ad hoc management of this country's budget that has seen our deficit and debt position so dramatically deteriorate.


Ever since the government revealed its plan for business tax cuts, Labor has been clear that this was a plan that included not only a very large price tag but extremely minimal economic benefits to the broader economy. Let's have a quick reminder of what it is that this $65 billion cost to the budget produces for the Australian economy. By the government's own boastful measure, this is a policy that will produce a mere one per cent of economic growth over 20 years, only $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time and wages growth at record lows of 1.9 per cent. What a miserable harvest for more than $65 billion.


Australian families are facing a nasty cocktail of rising costs, rising electricity prices, stalling wages growth and record high unemployment and underemployment. This is a government that has nothing to offer them. Labor has long-held concerns about low wages growth. Without a doubt, the dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in the stagnant wages growth and rising inequality that now beset this country—also, at a time when the government has supported penalty rate cuts, operative from 1 July this year, and seeks to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. We now live in an Australia where a worker on $55,000 a year will pay an additional $275 a year and someone on $80,000 only an extra $400 a year. It goes to this government's approach and their misguided priorities that their answer for flat wages growth is a cut to pay and higher income taxes. How entirely unpersuasive is it when we see this country's Treasurer bemoan low wages growth while, at the same time, he speedily creates the conditions for that very same low wages growth!


We hear those who support this proposed tax cut for business say it is needed to drive investment, but it was only a few years ago that we had the biggest investment boom Australia has ever seen, and that was accomplished with a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. Budgets are all about priorities and this government, quite simply, has the wrong priorities. Under this government, big businesses get tax cuts, high-income earners get a tax cut, workers earning above $21,000 get increased taxes and penalty rates have been cut. Now, all of this, you thought, might have been enough to end support for this absurd policy, but it does not stop there. This government has failed on economic leadership and there's one person who is emblematic of this failure—that is, the Treasurer.


The Treasurer is incompetent and his incapacity to do his day job is the most blindingly obvious example of this government's failure in economic policy. This is not a sudden revelation; this is a pattern of incompetence and failure that underlines how badly this government is performing. Remember the heady days at the end of 2015 when Morrison was first appointed Treasurer. At that moment in time, he was believed to be formidable and he was accepted as being a significant political actor. How times have changed. He has literally shrunk in the job. Since early 2016, we have seen him with his GST reforms stillborn, we have seen him proposing and then abandoning tax powers being given back to the states, and we have watched him collapse and faint at various moments across this country's national political conversation. He has shrunk from becoming a person of substance, a politician that was regarded by Labor as formidable, to the shrinking violet and ineffective and inarticulate spokesperson that he has become today. On his watch, this nonsensical $65 billion tax cut has been proposed, and on his watch he has manifestly failed to make out the reasons for supporting it. Treasurer Morrison was supposed to be the chief spear carrier for this government but, as it turns out, he can barely wield a water pistol. 


Unlike this government and unlike this government's Treasurer, Labor has it priorities—priorities that will ensure we deal with inequality in this country. That means Labor is committed to funding our schools. This means proper investment in Australian infrastructure and it means a fairer tax system. A Labor government would further deal with superannuation tax concessions, something that we announced late last year and something that this government has since tried to describe as a secret superannuation tax. 


Labor have promised that we will level the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax—taking on the challenge of housing affordability. Labor have announced that we will cap the deductions that people can obtain for managing their tax affairs to $3,000 per person. Announced recently, our plan to impose a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts and to deal with the issue of income splitting means dealing with some fundamental issues that have been in the too-hard basket for far too long.


We now live in a topsy-turvy world where, from opposition, Labor has more aggressively promoted reform and more effectively articulated the need to manage the economic affairs of this country, while we have a government that, while in office, has managed to triple the deficit, expand the debt from $280 billion to more than $500 billion, and, of course, couldn't argue its way out of a wet paper bag. This is a government that, frankly, is paralysed—paralysed by its incompetence and paralysed by its divisions. When it comes down to it, this is a government with simply the wrong priorities—a government that is determined to reduce the tax on businesses, and big businesses in particular, while at the same time increasing tax on working Australians.


We have made the point that, in technical terms, what is being proposed by this government is an unfunded corporate tax cut—because that is what it is. There is no funding to pay for this. This is a tax cut for business that is funded by future debt. This is what, for instance, former Treasurer and former Prime Minister Paul Keating has pointed out: that it is an unfunded corporate tax cut, quite different to what he did when he was Treasurer, which was to broaden the base, go after loopholes and deal with inequities within the tax system. Paul Keating was paying for his policies. This Treasurer had a thought and said, 'Well, the politics of this ramshackle show need rescuing; I will produce a $65 billion tax cut for business.' But he is unable to fund it, unable to justify it and unable to speak to the effects it will have in our economy.


But, in another sense, this government's $65 billion tax cut is funded: it is funded by the tax increases that this government has delivered for working Australians. We know that the tax burden on PAYG taxpayers will increase in coming years, and it will increase because this government is increasing the tax rate in part through increasing the Medicare levy. The Parliamentary Budget Office projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. Under this government, the tax burden grows. From 2023-24 to 2027-28, when the company tax rate is meant to decrease to 25 per cent for all companies, personal income taxes rise by 0.2 percentage points of GDP while company taxes decrease by 0.3 percentage points.


It is clear that low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business, and they are paying it for it in the form of rising personal income taxes. This was confirmed by the PBO earlier this month, with the PBO saying that, in addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are expected to decrease due to policy changes—most notably, the policy decision to increase the Medicare levy from 2019-20.


We have also seen reports in the last weeks and months that there is confusion about which companies are eligible for this government's excessive tax cuts and the contrast between active trading businesses versus companies holding passive investments—a contrast that simply led this government into further confusion. You would have thought that, this being the centrepiece economic policy of this government, its major political survival line, the government may have had these details thought through and able to be explained. But, no, as has been shown time and time again, this is not a government that should be overestimated. This is another example of its incompetence, and its poor politics married to lousy policy.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (10:44):  I am happy to follow the eloquent member for Batman and his compelling and persuasive argument as to why the economic prescription of this government is completely discredited. It's not credible, because the prescription outlined by the government will not improve our economy and will not trickle down to the millions of workers who demand a wage increase. Indeed, this government has presided over the lowest wage growth in a generation. Wage growth in this country hasn't been this low since at least 1998, yet the government's answer to the question, 'What do we do about the wage crisis?' is to give an unfunded, subsidised $65 billion to big business—to banks and multinational companies. Much of that will leave this country and will not provide any benefits whatsoever. When you look at the Treasury forecast as to what benefits might flow, we are well and truly underwhelmed. Even if you can support the forecast by the Treasury that a $65 billion tax giveaway to big business has any benefit whatsoever, the Treasury forecast suggests that, at best, there will be one per cent of economic growth in 20 years. In 20 years, we will see one per cent of economic growth, which effectively would mean an increase of $2 a day in wages in 20 years. This is at a time when wage growth has flatlined at record lows of 1.9 per cent. This is not in any way an answer to the question: what do we do about the wage crisis in this country?


This is about the Prime Minister, a former merchant banker, and his tax giveaways to his mates at the big end of town. This is about the Prime Minister—who, as always, is more comfortable in boardrooms than in depots and offices around this nation—providing a gift to his mates in big business. That is what this Prime Minister is all about. This man has a mansion in Point Piper. He has accumulated an enormous amount of money. Good luck to him; he's done that. But, because of that to some extent, he has no regard for and no understanding of the struggle of working people in this country.


The Prime Minister is completely at odds with the aspirations of working people in this country. The Prime Minister does not empathise with the challenges that households and families have in trying to make ends meet. He doesn't understand that the flatlining wages and a fall in real wages in many respects is making it harder for people to deal with cost-of-living pressures. The Prime Minister, who's always happier when he's hanging out with his mates at the big end of town, couldn't give a toss about working people in this country. You see it with the amount of legislation that's introduced into the parliament, week after week, attacking organised labour and making sure that he can undermine the ability of unions to represent workers in order to ensure that wages are depressed.


It is not a coincidence that the Prime Minister wants to see retail workers' wages fall in real terms. It's not a coincidence that the Prime Minister wants to see hospitality workers' wages fall in real terms. They are low-paid workers in this country, and the Prime Minister is supporting a Fair Work decision that will see a fall in real wages for 750,000 workers in this country. Because of the Prime Minister's insensitivity to their aspirations and needs, he wants to see pay cuts to those people in real terms at a time when wage growth is at its lowest in a generation. That's what the Prime Minister thinks of working people in this country. He has no regard, no empathy and no concern for those people whatsoever. That is why the economic prescription of this government is so out of touch. It's not economically sound, it's socially unfair, it marginalises hardworking Australians and there is no answer to the question: what will the government do about the wage crisis in this country? The reason there is no answer is that the Prime Minister could not care one bit about the aspirations and needs of working people in this country. The budget reflects the values of the Prime Minister and the Liberals, and that's why Labor opposes this approach.


Labor believes that there is a need to attend to the wage crisis in this country. Labor believes we need to invest in education and we need to invest in skills to uplift our people. We're in a knowledge based, globalised economy. Our best resource is our people. We need to invest in them to make sure that productivity rises and economic growth happens and, indeed, people share in the bounty of that growth. Yet what we have from this Prime Minister is the repudiated economic policy of Ronald Reagan—trickle-down economics, which was introduced to the world in the 1980s by Milton Friedman, a now discredited economist who believed you give the big end of town as much money as possible, by way of tax cuts, and the money will somehow trickle down, by osmosis, to the people. Well, it didn't happen in America. What happened in the United States was that the middle class were hollowed out. There are people there now living below the poverty line, even though they are working a full week. They have the lowest wage growth. Inequality has widened to such a point that that country is beset with economic and political problems. Part of the reason for that is that they accepted the notion of trickle-down economics. Trickle-down economics is not the answer. It has been repudiated by the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank. No-one now supports this proposition except this out-of-touch Prime Minister and this out-of-touch government. 


This government have a callous disregard for working people in this country. The only legislation they ever introduce in the area of employment is to undermine unions. In fact, the only thing that unites this government is what they think about unions and what they think about penalty rates. We know what they think about penalty rates. If they could rip off every worker and take every penalty rate away from every worker in this country tomorrow, they would do it. Work Choices was their dream. It's their nightmare now. They're still living with the consequences of their obscene actions when Howard was Prime Minister. But, if they could realise that again, they would do it, because they support a low-wage economy. They're happy to see an easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire economy and society. That is their dream for this country. 


Labor has a totally different view. We invest in our people. We want to be a high-wage, high-skilled economy. We believe the way for this country to compete in this world is to ensure that we invest in our most important resource, and our most important resource just happens to be our people. That's why there's a big divide between the two major parties on investing in needs based education. We've seen this government take a decision to cut more than $20 billion from education. Our kids will be worse off as a result of the decisions taken by this government. We see an underfunding of universities in this country as a result of decisions taken by this government. We have seen 122,000 apprenticeship places disappear since the election of the Abbott-Turnbull government. They have no regard for skilling Australia. They are underfunding universities and schools and giving $65,000 million to big business. That is their answer to the problems that beset this nation—to rip off workers and give tax giveaways to big business. No wonder this government is struggling. 


It is quite remarkable that the government have had time to address this and yet, whilst their rhetoric has changed somewhat—some focus group must have told Scott Morrison to start saying 'fair', and they have started to shift, in some way, their rhetoric—their policies remain the same. They are policies that have never worked in any economy. They are totally at odds with the international bodies that have said that you need to redress inequality. Inequality is at a 75-year high. Inequality in this country is widening. The policies of the government are compounding inequality. Just take, for example, the government's decision not only to support penalty rate cuts but to impose more taxes on workers. Every worker earning over $21,000 a year will have to pay tax, and those on $55,000 a year will pay $250 extra tax, which may not sound a lot to Malcolm Turnbull, but it's a lot to a person on $55,000 a year. People on $80,000 will pay $400 extra tax. That may not seem much to the Prime Minister, but it is a lot of money for a family who might have one breadwinner making $80,000 a year. Yet, at the same time, the government is proposing a $16,400 tax cut for someone who earns $1 million a year. If you're earning $1 million a year, you will get a $16,400 tax cut. If you are earning $55,000 a year, you will get a $250 tax increase. That's at the same time that wages are falling in real terms. 


If you happen to be a retail worker, that's at the same time that you may have just had Malcolm Turnbull put his hand in your pocket and take out some of your wages because he supports penalty rate cuts. By the way, the penalty rate cuts for retail workers haven't ended. They started on 1 July this year, but there'll be cuts next year and in 2019 and 2020. For the next four years, retail and hospitality workers who may be receiving penalty rates are going to get wage cuts. At the same time they're getting these wage cuts, they're getting tax increases. And, yet, big business and millionaires are getting a tax cut.


This is the topsy-turvy world we live in because of the Prime Minister—no understanding. He's a very clever guy—just ask him! But the fact is he doesn't seem to understand what's happening in the real economy or the real world. Just go down the street, Prime Minister, and ask people, 'Do you want to get a tax increase?' They'll say, 'No.' Or even if you said this: 'You're going to get a tax increase, but someone on $1 million a year is going to get a tax cut. What do you think of that?' What do you think they're going to say to the Prime Minister? They're going to say: 'You must be kidding! You've presided over the slowest wage growth in a generation and you're giving me a tax increase?' This is why this government is in so much trouble. What's funny is the internal divisions of the government are not about these issues because they all agree. The things they all agree on are: how do we give people tax increases? How do we give penalty rate cuts to workers? That's what they all agree on. And how do we drive the union movement? That is their constant obsession.


The Minister for Employment is obsessed. She constantly quotes allegations about people swearing on building sites. If the minister had a swear jar for every time she swore in the Senate and she gave that money to Scott Morrison, we'd deal with our deficit! That's how often she is swearing in making allegations about swearing. What she doesn't do is say, 'We're dealing with a changing labour market.' What she doesn't redress is that people are feeling insecure at work. What the minister doesn't concern herself with is that people feel insecure because they're getting less security, and the government doesn't seem to care or doesn't seem to want to attend to it. What the government doesn't seem to understand—the Minister for Employment and certainly the Treasurer and Prime Minister do not understand—is that people are struggling to make ends meet. For example, there are some people who are paying off their home loans on a monthly or fortnightly basis, and they're on fine margins. We know that. It is a big thing to pay the mortgage. If interest rates go up a couple of points and wages are falling, do you think that people will be able to pay their mortgage? There'll be people who will not be able to pay their mortgage if we see a few bumps in the interest rates of this country.


Wages are falling and we have a government who are complicit. Their economic policies are placing downward pressure on wages. They have no answer to the wage crisis in this country. Their only answer is to give $65 billion to Malcolm Turnbull's best mates—big business. Even the Treasury has said, 'Even if the best happens with this policy, we'll see one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time.' The Prime Minister will be well gone from this place by then, of course—indeed, most of us will be. This economic prescription of trickle-down economics, which was repudiated 30 years ago and confirmed so by all of the major organisations—the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD—is not working. This is just a gift to the government's mates at the big end of town, as always. There is no regard whatsoever for working people.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (10:59):  I join with my Labor colleagues, who have spoken extensively in this debate—unlike the government—to oppose this piece of legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. There have been many Labor speakers in this debate, and hopefully the government will see fit to stand up at some point and defend what is a hypocritical and unfair piece of legislation. It just seems remarkable to me that the government puts forward this legislation but is not prepared to put forward speakers to defend this legislation. Perhaps there is something very much in that.


This bill seeks to implement the remainder of the government's company tax cut plans. It will provide a tax cut of 25 per cent to companies with a turnover of over $50 million. This will create a $65 billion tax cut for business, and that is the fundamental point that every single Labor speaker has made. It's providing an enormous tax cut to the tune of $65 billion to businesses with a turnover of more than $50 million. The previous speaker—and I'm sure other speakers have made this point—mentioned that the diminishing amount that you earn in fact attracts more tax, and it just makes a mockery of the government's so-called commitment to fairness. It is ridiculous that the Treasurer would stand up and use the word 'fairness' when putting forward this piece of legislation. It is anything but fair and is full of hypocrisy. That is perfectly obvious.


It's not just perfectly obvious to people within this side of politics; it's perfectly obvious to the public, particularly those that are struggling with underemployment and those that are unemployed and finding it very difficult to find for work. I was listening to the radio this morning and the point was being made there is only one job for every young unemployed person. There was a young man speaking on the radio who wanted work, who was desperately looking for work but was unable to find it in the community in which he lived. In that context, when we are seeing rising unemployment and youth unemployment rates in some parts of this country that are well into double-digit figures, this government sees fit to provide an enormous tax cut to big business. It is also at the same time we're seeing drastic cuts to budgets for essential services, including the cuts to the education budget at the primary, secondary and tertiary level. It just doesn't make sense, but it does reflect to me the chaos that this government is experiencing. It reflects the lack of capacity for this government to work as a government, and that is obvious in so many ways. That's including the fact the government is so arrogant and out of touch that it doesn't feel it necessary to provide speakers to prosecute this argument of major tax cuts to big business.


I have never seen such hypocrisy from government, and I've been around government for a very long time in one form or another. The hypocrisies are there in terms of cutting funds to things like education, drug rehabilitation and health, yet providing an enormous amount of tax breaks to people and businesses that can most afford it. The government, which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair, is in fact pursuing such an unfair piece of legislation. This is a government which was hysterical about the debt and deficit disaster—we all remember that—and hysterical about the budget emergency. Yet it proceeds with what they know to be an unfair tax cut, a tax cut that is perceived to be unfair by so many people. The government has overseen a deficit blowout and debt surging past half a trillion dollars, which is not often spoken about but that is the truth. You could almost say we have a Treasurer who has lost control of his brief. Perhaps that's why every time he gets to his feet he thinks it's necessary to yell at people. Now the government wants to deliver a $65 billion unfunded tax cut for big, multinational companies. As shadow minister for human services, I think about the disgraceful robo-debt debacle and the fact that this government saw fit to accuse at least 20,000 Australians, many of whom are vulnerable Australians, of owing the government money, and yet it proceeds with this $65 billion unfunded tax cut for big multinational companies.


Ultimately, it's ordinary Australians who will bear the burden of the government's lavish multibillion-dollar tax cut—people who are struggling, people who can't find employment and people who are underemployed. The Parliamentary Budget Office projects that personal income taxes will rise by 1.6 per cent of the gross domestic product over the medium term, from 11.1 per cent in 2016-17 to 12.6 per cent in 2027-28. At the same time, company tax receipts will decline from 2023-24 as a result of this bill. That just does not make sense. In 2023-24, personal income tax will represent 12.4 per cent of GDP, while company tax will make up 4.5 per cent of GDP. By 2027-28, personal income tax will represent 12.6 per cent of GDP, while company tax will represent just 4.2 per cent of GDP. It is clear that low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business through rising personal income taxes.


On all counts, this government is out of touch. It is a government that doesn't have a clue about what ordinary Australians are going through, and 21 opinion polls should tell it that. While Australian families are facing rising costs of living, rising electricity prices, falling wage growth and anaemic economic growth, the government is more concerned about giving big multinationals this tax cut. We see the enormous casualisation of the workforce, including using labour hire companies and private providers for Centrelink call centres.


Ordinary Australians are doing it tough. As has been articulated, 1.1 million Australians are underemployed. University graduates are less likely to find full-time graduate entry work today than they were a decade ago. The government is more interested in driving down the bargaining power of workers, with stagnating wage growth. The government is more interested in slashing penalty rates, while seeking to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with incomes above $21,000. As the previous speaker articulated well, a worker on $55,000 will pay an extra $275 a year and someone on $80,000 will pay an extra $400. The government is more interested in attacking ordinary Australians in need of income support, slashing pension eligibility and making it more difficult to access income support when they need it. The government's multibillion-dollar tax cut for multinational companies simply adds insult to injury for ordinary Australians.


The government's cut of almost 12,000 jobs in the Department of Human Services speaks loudly. It has overseen 42 million missed calls to Centrelink, which is completely unacceptable. There is a 10-month wait period for people wanting to access age pensions, and, as I said earlier, we all know about the robo-debt crisis. The government and the minister are completely unapologetic about the fear, stress and anxiety they've put thousands of Australians through, sending letters with the police logo, threatening prosecution and imprisonment.


Over the past year I've heard countless heartbreaking stories about older Australians and those with a disability being forced to wait almost a year to receive the pension that they are rightfully owed, and yet we see this multibillion-dollar tax cut going forward. The truth is that the government's track record on supporting ordinary Australians is awful. It is completely atrocious. The government is interested in attacking and victimising Australians in need of income support. It is placing the burden of its own financial mismanagement on the backs of vulnerable Australians. It is more interested in defending negative gearing or capital gains tax concessions for the wealthy. It is only interested in making it difficult, painful and fearful to claim income support, to the point where people just give up.


I want to finish up in the last five minutes by saying this: Labor believes in ordinary Australians—they should be a priority—and so should any government. Labor knows there is inequality that needs to be dealt with. Fighting inequality and fighting for ordinary Australians means proper funding of schools, investing in infrastructure, a fairer tax system and dealing properly with superannuation tax concessions. Labor will level the playing field for first home buyers through reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax, and Labor will ensure a strong, comprehensive social safety net. It can and should be accessible and accountable to all Australians when they need it. People should not be made to feel frightened, anxious or intimidated. We should provide departmental staff with the necessary support they need to ensure they deliver a quality product. 


Labor is committed to embracing policies which ensure that all Australians benefit from economic growth. This piece of legislation does none of those things. This piece of legislation says clearly to the Australian community, broadly: the government has walked away from you. Despite the fact that there have been so many cuts to essential services by this government, they are pursuing this incredibly huge tax break for big multinational companies, which just does not make sense to me—it does not make sense to me electorally, it does not make sense to me politically and certainly it does not make sense to the many, many, many, many thousands of Australians who will look at this and feel left behind. What do you think happened in Murray, Cootamundra and Blacktown at the recent by-elections in New South Wales? Seats like Cootamundra and Murray were firmly National Party seats, jewels in the crown of the New South Wales government. People voted in their thousands against the ruling parties because of issues like this. They feel they've been forgotten. They feel that the government no longer understands what their concerns are. 


Labor is committed to ensuring that our industrial relations settings ensure a living wage and safe, productive workplaces. Australians are Labor's priority. Fairness is Labor's priority, not unfunded multibillion-dollar tax cuts for multinationals. I will finish by picking up on the point that the shadow minister raised, which was the obsession of this government to attack the union movement. I'd ask this government and members of this government to think about what the union movement has delivered for this country. It has delivered safe workplaces. It has delivered decent wages. It has delivered humane workplaces, and it just seems inconceivable to me that these cuts are not about demonising the union movement. The government should understand that, by demonising the union movement, they are demonising many Australians. 


Yesterday morning I attended a forum for Catholic Social Services which talked about this issue—that this government, in search of a narrative, is demonising poor people. In fact, a government's responsibility, whether they be Labor, Liberal or anything else, is to lift up people, provide people with hope, provide people with choice and provide people with a decent—although frugal sometimes—living wage. It does not and should not include these enormous tax cuts which have been pursued ideologically and despite the fact there have been such massive cuts in other areas that affect the lives and wellbeing of people. I would also add that it affects the economic future of this country when you're attacking schools, when you're attacking tertiary institutions. I join with my colleagues in opposing this bill.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:14):  We are debating a proposition in the bill being put forward by the government that would see billions of dollars in tax cuts for massive businesses that operate here and abroad, at the time we're being told that there's not enough money for the other things we want to do. For people watching this, the bill is Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. In fact the words in the brackets should be replaced and it should be the Treasury Laws Amendment (Reverse Midas Touch) Bill, because everything this Prime Minister touches turns to dust not to gold—every single thing. The Prime Minister was the person who decided he would change the way broadband was being rolled out in this country. What happened? We have seen the highest level of complaints about the broadband network. People are upset with the fact they expected a broadband system to deliver but it has failed to deliver—thank you, courtesy the Prime Minister; the reverse Midas touch. He had something that should have made everyone happy with the government. He couldn't do it, because he stuffed up the broadband network. 


We have watched the other side of politics for the best part of 12 months try to come up with a game plan on energy. We've seen them twist and turn, bicker and fight and go around expert shopping—trying to find one expert after another to back in what they want to do. They have had the best part of 12 months and what have we got to? We have a 50c a week saving. That's all we have on energy: 50c a week. That is not worth the pain that the country has been forced to endure because of this government and the way they have been unable to get their act together. Now we have this: they claim that the economy will be saved if we just handover billions to companies from a budget that we're told doesn't have enough money in it. This is not a plan for economic salvation; this is a plan for political salvation. It is wrong and it's why Labor is opposing the handover of billions of dollars in this way. 


Reports have emerged over the last 24 hours that the people who are more likely to be unemployed are those who have low skills. This should not be a surprise. Everyone has known this for a long period of time. When you look at the people who are unemployed, more often than not it is their low-skill attainment that has held them back. This government know it because in two years time they will bring in the Career Transition Assistance Program for older workers that will particularly target people in their 50s. What was one of the things that they found? They found that most people in that age bracket have a job—there's less unemployment amongst older workers; in fact, it's probably half the national unemployment rate and that is a great thing—but the minute those people lose their job, they are unable to get work for an average of 73 weeks; 73 weeks without work. What's one of the biggest reasons why they've lost work and can't find it again? It is low-skill attainment and low-education attainment.


The reason I mention this is that we wanted to see more investment in schools. What did we see? The reverse Midas touch in action again when the Gonski 2.0 plan, as it was erroneously labelled, was put forward. It cut out billions from what was required in school funding. So there's the first cut: to schools. TAFE has seen billions cut out of it, and more cuts are proposed—and a failure to bring in a new agreement to support it. So we have TAFE cuts. And what is happening with universities? We have billions to be cut from universities being continuously debated by a government that does not value education; it values demonising the people that don't have jobs, and for many of those people it's not because of low-skill attainment. But when we try to ensure that the next generation are as skilled as possible to get work, they are not given the chance. Why? Because the government says the money is not there, yet they can do this: they can actually saw underneath the bottom of the budget. It's like in those cartoons where you see someone sawing the floor to make someone fall through it. In this case it's the average Australian who is being undermined by a government that is cutting the support out from underneath them in a way that prevents them from being able to get ahead. That's what we're seeing with this bill. It cuts out billions from the budget and hands it over to big business, at a time when I argue those businesses are doing quite well. They have billions sitting there, but the government wants to make this massive transfer—and the bulk of it will go offshore anyway.


But that's what their plan for political salvation is—to say that they had a win. By the way, aren't all these wins translating in a great way! They had their first tranche of company tax cuts that got through. They had their changes to the backpacker tax. They had their changes to Gonski. They had changes to media reform. They are banking on all these wins, but look at where things have gone. The Prime Minister, in getting rid of the former Prime Minister, said that the government had lost its way, trailing in 30 Newspolls. But, after all these wins, how has this government under this Prime Minister—the man with the reverse Midas touch—been going? It's been trailing in 21—getting so close to losing out.


The government's plan is to hand billions over to big business. Look at the scale of dividend growth in this country from roughly 2014 to 2017: $40 billion handed out to investors and $70 billion this year—from $40 billion to $70 billion. With this tax cut, $65 billion is what's being proposed. The money is there. Big business is handing it out, in many cases to investors. But big business is not doing the lion's share of work in terms of investing or where capex is—capex is collapsing and hardly has any life to it—and it's certainly not providing average wage earners with wage increases. So what do we do as a result? We hand over billions that won't go into the pockets of average wage earners, that won't be put into productive investment to make the economy grow and provide more secure work, better wages for people and better economic outcomes. We won't see that. What will happen is it will funnel into investors here and overseas and we won't see any benefit from that whatsoever—when those businesses are already sitting on the equivalent amount when you see what's being paid out in dividends.


So this is the economic narrative—as the word is often described—of this government saying that this will provide a massive benefit to the economy. Really? Look at the stats. Since this plan was first introduced we've been able to scope out the economic benefit. What we're seeing is, potentially, one per cent economic growth in 20 years time and an increase in wages of $2 a day in 20 years time. This is in a climate where wages growth is flatlining. I think 1.9 per cent, roughly, is what's recorded. These are record lows. We see that living standards, which had been climbing, have gone backwards in the last quarter. We also see rising costs, largely driven by, as I mentioned earlier, the failure of this government to get a national energy plan in place. This has meant that the cost of electricity has gone up because there's not enough supply and demand is growing. Everyone knows what happens in that formula. The people who are bearing the price of that formula going the wrong way are average Australian households. When they are experiencing that sort of impact on their household budgets, particularly at a time when wages aren't growing, you can understand why people are anxious about their economic health. But, again, there is no answer from those opposite about how to improve wages growth and how to improve or tackle the issue of underemployment and how to get people into work.


My colleague the member for Longman and I attended a jobseekers forum that she convened last week in Caboolture, where people were saying that they found it so hard to find work and that the job programs that the Turnbull government are putting forward just aren't cutting it. This has been of great concern to the member for Longman, as it has been for other members of electorates that I've visited where jobseekers say the same thing. We spend billions on these job programs. We spend $9 billion on job programs for the 730,000 unemployed and we have 40,000 employment consultants in the country. But do you know what the most important performance stat of all is in terms of getting people into work—the success rate? It's 20 per cent. For $9 billion, we have a success rate, in terms of getting people back into work through government programs, of only 20 per cent. Eight out of ten people do not find work as a result of the Turnbull government's job programs.


Look at some of the other job programs that they're running—like Work for the Dole, which has been estimated by some to only improve the employability of the people forced to go through that program by a mere two per cent. Ninety per cent of the young people that go through Work for the Dole are not in work three months after. The other disgusting thing about this program is that, 18 months ago today, one poor bloke lost his life under it, and this government has not had the decency to release the internal review that they did on that accident or outline how they've made that program safer. This is a program, I add, members, that forces young people to go through it—and it doesn't deliver them a job—but it does so in a climate where there are legitimate concerns about the safety performance of that program. They don't get a job, and they're forced into a program that has massive safety concerns around it. This is wrong.


Again, these programs need attention. They need a government that has answers. They need a government that can get people back into work. They need an investment in skills. And what do we have in response? We have a government that proposes handing over, in the biggest glory gift, $65 billion straight out of the budget, instead of investing in people's skills, instead of investing in people's employability and instead of making these programs work. This is a massive indictment of this government, when you look at what has been happening under their watch. They can find money to hand to big businesses that are already sitting on massive piles of cash that they're handing out in dividends to investors—$70 billion this year, which they'll hold on top of that $65 million. And what's their other answer? At a time when people are worried about their jobs, their pay and wages growth, the other answer from this government is to cut the take-home pay of average Australians. There are 700,000 Australians who are looking at a pay cut as a result of a cut to penalty rates of $77 a week being championed by those opposite. You can't get a wage increase; the best you get out of this government is a wage cut.


What they're doing makes no economic sense whatsoever. But this is not, as I said, a plan for economic salvation; this is a plan for political salvation by this government. No matter what it does, it cannot find a way to get clear air. No matter what it does, whatever it puts its hand to—whatever it touches—turns to dust, not gold. The reverse Midas touch of this government is extraordinary. It is something to behold.



Mr Hill interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  I am being very generous, as the member for Bruce indicates, in using the term 'dust'.



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  I am a very generous man.




Mr Hill:
  Turnbull dust.




Mr HUSIC:
  It is Turnbull dust. Everything that he touches turns to dust. The problem is that the people who are forced to wear the cost of this are not those opposite. It is the people that we care about and that we represent in this place—average Australians who just want to get ahead and are constantly being weighed down by the poor decisions of this government. They constantly get told that the money's not there for the things they need in terms of better health care, better education for their kids, better child care, better infrastructure and better broadband—every single thing they want to see an investment in. But then the government finds money whenever it needs it to spend on things like this, handing $65 billion to the big end of town, when you know that they have the money already and you know how this will vandalise the budget. What we are seeing from those opposite is disgraceful. Every decision they make is tortured. Every decision they make is contentious. With every single decision they make, we have to wait for the outcome of the brawl in their party room to see how the country is going to be impacted by their flawed decisions. This is another flawed decision by this government. This is why we won't support it. We support better investment in this country rather than the politicking that we have to endure from those opposite.

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (11:29):  I rise today in opposition, standing against the party of economic mismanagement. It's the very party that cried foul when Labor sensibly utilised the budget to keep Australia out of a recession. You will remember the cry: it was an economic disaster and a budget emergency, despite countless international economists praising Labor's very, very fine treatment of a global crisis. Many economists agreed that the quite small debt that was accrued was nothing to be scared of. It was totally justifiable under the circumstances that were presented, and here we are, just a few years later, and the debt has done nothing but balloon under this government. You won't hear anything about that. They are very, very silent on the ballooning debt. Where is the budget emergency now? Where is the budget emergency that we heard so much about?


I'm starting to think that the reason that colour printers are so hard to come by in Parliament House is to hide how much red there would be on the government's balance sheet. I don't know about you, but I don't have a colour printer in my office and I think that's probably why. So here we are today with the government's legacy: an exorbitant national debt. It's set to get bigger with the government's unfunded big-business tax cut—$65 billion bigger. That is not chump change, Deputy Speaker Howarth. I know you know that. You know that the people in your electorate and my electorate could do a lot with $65 billion.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order! Don't reflect on the chair.




Ms LAMB:
  A lot of that money could go to health care, a lot of it could go to education and a lot of it could go to supporting, training and helping people into work. Instead, that $65 billion of taxpayers' money is going straight into the pockets of big business. This is at a time when company profits are soaring and wage growth has flatlined. Under this government we've seen record lows in wage growth, reaching just 1.9 per cent. With the cost of living increasing year after year after year, this is having an incredibly devastating effect. Economic data has shown that living standards, which had previously been climbing, fell backwards in the last quarter.


It won't be the rich who will be hit by this move by Prime Minister Turnbull, because he's giving them a $16,400 tax cut. It won't be the rich; it will be ordinary, hardworking Australians who just deserve a fair go. But, under this out-of-touch government, they're not going to get one, because the government does not understand what it's like for people who are struggling to get by. The Prime Minister doesn't understand. His electorate of Wentworth is absolutely nothing like my electorate of Longman. While his constituents may have a median personal income of around $1,100 a week, many people in Longman struggle to feed their family on an income of around $580 a week. It is nothing like Wentworth. I'd forgive the Prime Minister's ignorance if he actually did try to understand—if he listened to ordinary Australians and heard their stories, but he won't. He's stubborn. He's made up his mind without listening to all of the facts. It's no wonder he thinks that a cut to big business and banks is a good idea when we know that he only listens to his colleagues and the powerful lobby groups that wander up and down the halls of parliament and he shuts everyone else out. He hears those lobbyists claim that this hit to our economy is worth it and he hears the promises that it will drive investment, but he shuts out the fact that the biggest investment boom Australia has ever seen was when Australia had a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. That was the time of the biggest investment boom, at 30 per cent. The Prime Minister, his backbenchers and his government ministers shut out the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank, who quashed the argument that this tax cut will drive investment. They shut out anyone whose position differs from their own, and that can be very, very dangerous. It's not easy to have a proper thought in your head when you're stuck in this echo chamber. The hypocritical priorities of this government are glaringly obvious. 


Just yesterday during the matter of public importance discussion—and I stayed for all speakers, including government speakers—I was subjected to government speakers attacking the use of welfare to help vulnerable people get back on their feet. Yet here they are today advocating for corporate welfare—unbelievable! They are throwing money at big businesses who turn over tens of millions of dollars each year. They're fighting to increase taxation on working Australians but slash taxes for millionaires and businesses. 


The government just do not care about workers. I honestly think they have got it in for then. At every chance, they give a worker in this country another hurdle to jump over, another cut to endure, another attack to appeal—every single day. It's why the government trash the trade union movement at every single chance they get. The trade union movement is the organisations standing up for workers in this country. It is through the increased bargaining power of a unionised workforce that everyday Australians can actually get a voice loud enough to be heard, to stand up and face this government. That's their voice. But the government don't like it. They don't like that voice one bit. The Prime Minister doesn't like it when the united voice of Australian workers collectively matches the reaffirming 'yeses' that he likes to surround himself with. He does not like that one bit. 


But the voices of those opposed to the Turnbull government—I have to let you know, Deputy Speaker—are growing louder. They are growing louder in cities and suburbs. They are growing louder in states and territories. They are growing louder in regional towns and communities. They are growing louder even in his own party room, of course. The government have never had a real plan for Australia. They are still stuck in opposition mode. Every time any government member gets up to speak, it's never about policy, because they know how rubbish their policies are. Instead, all we ever seem to hear the government talk about is Labor. That's all we ever hear. If we listen to question time or a debate in the chamber, we hear you talking about Labor and not about your policies. People in the political sphere often say it's the role of government to create policy and the role of opposition to pick out the flaws, but the government seem to have got it the wrong way around, because the government have no actual costed policies. Labor have had to craft our policies early to fill that void. Because the government have run out of spin to try and sell their misuse of taxpayers' money, they're attempting to pre-emptively fall into the role of opposition. It's quite interesting. I understand the government want to get some practice in before the impending electoral defeat, but now is the time to lead. Now is the time to have a plan. That's what people expect of government. Lead. Have a plan. Give us a vision. Tell us how you're going to get there. 


We've listened to businesses and unions, we've listened to groups and stakeholders, we've heard the economic debate and we've developed a very strong plan to move Australia forward, to tackle the rise of inequality that the government's policies exacerbate time after time, to help repair the economic mess that the Treasurer's reckless misuse of taxpayers' funds has created and to ease the cost-of-living pressures for all Australians—from the seniors, who have already given so much to this country, to the youngest people, who are just starting out. While the government showers its corporate mates with unjust tax cuts, let me tell you what Labor will do. While that's happening, let's not be blind-sided. Let's look at what Labor will do. We will invest in quality education for all Australians, whether you live in Perth, Brisbane, Darwin or Hobart. We will invest in education for all Australians. This means not sneaking through cuts and mislabelling them as new funding. It means reversing the government's short-sighted cuts to TAFE and vocational education. I really wonder how this government can claim that they're all about Australian jobs when they're making it harder for people to get the skills they need to make them ready for the workforce. Instead, we're seeing them let jobs go overseas, bring overseas workers in and cut local people out of local jobs. That's what we're seeing. That is why Labor will introduce true labour market testing for 457 visas. Businesses should not be able to game the system, cutting costs at the expense of Australian workers looking for jobs.


Labor is also committed to making strong investments in reliable infrastructure projects around Australia. We understand that, to help Australia grow, we need to build the foundations that we can then expand upon. They are foundations like unlocking the Northern Australia infrastructure fund. That's still locked away. We are trying to get it unlocked and make some really wise investment decisions in our country—decisions that will create jobs and get people into work. You don't need to go much further than my electorate. When you start moving up the coast—whether you go to Rockhampton, Mackay, Cairns or Townsville—there are people there who are ready to work, willing to train and willing to get skilled; they just need a job. Unlocking the NAIF would help do that. Stop using the money to pay the NAIF board. Unlocking it to create some jobs is what we need. The people in my electorate would absolutely welcome that.


A real centrepiece of our platform is Labor's reshaping of a tax system to be fairer to Australians and not just a select few—not just the rich. A fairer tax system means a level playing field for first home buyers, for example, through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. It is not about dipping into your retirement savings. That is not what we do to help people get into housing. Dipping into your retirement savings is obviously a bandaid measure that we know will cause problems down the line, going back to what I mentioned before about a government that needs some vision and a plan. A fairer tax system also would mean capping at $3,000 the deductions that people can obtain by managing their tax affairs—not being able to write-off thousands or tens of thousands of dollars by having some crafty accounting done.


Let's be very clear: a fairer tax system would impose a 30 per cent minimum tax on discretionary trusts, closing another loophole for people who've been able to forego paying their fair share of tax. We want to make sure that that gets tightened up, again, making sure that people pay their fair share of tax. A fairer tax system doesn't mean upping the taxation rate of ordinary Australians so the budget doesn't collapse entirely under the weight of a $65 billion handout to companies that don't need it. For around 85 per cent of people in my electorate who are going to be hit with a taxation rate increase, this is going to have a devastating impact on their families and their family budgets. While the government is handing $65 billion to big business and banks, they're sitting down at the kitchen table trying to work out what they're going to do with less money coming into their family budget. They are looking at that handout and trying to find some way where that looks even remotely fair or is remotely going to help them and their families.


We need to have policies in this country that help people get ahead, not just a select few—not just for people who are wealthy, people who are fortunate. We need policies in this country. We need a government that has vision and a plan to get there. I can't understand how anybody can stand in this place and say that a $65 billion handout will somehow trickle down to people in our communities—how that is fair and how that is going to help those families sitting around the table, working out their family budget. I would implore that this government takes a view of creating a vision and a plan.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:44):  Thank you to the member for La Trobe. It's always good to be here in the Federation Chamber, the place where good speeches go to die! I'm sure I have 15 minutes of remarks in me. I feel confident about that.


In setting the scene for the remarks I have on this bill, I would pick up, actually, on something the member for Barton said. I was here a little while ago and heard her sterling remarks. She said that this does not make sense politically, and I believe that to be true. As I will try to outline, these big company tax cuts fail the fiscal test. They fail the economic test. They fail the fairness test. But also they fail the political test. You only have to go to any everyday community in Australia and you can get a pretty quick response from people as to what they think about the idea of firing up the nation's ATM and handing away $65.4 billion of taxpayer money to big, multinational companies and big companies. If you ask most people in the street, 'What do you think you'd spend $65.4 billion on?' you would get all sorts of responses. It might be to fix the hospital system. It might be to not cut school funding by $17 billion. It might be to not threaten our world-class universities with yet another $4 billion cut. It might be all sorts of things. From my experience, I encourage those opposite to try that test. Go out into your main streets. Have a little stall in the main street up in La Trobe, or wherever you are this Saturday, member for La Trobe, and say, 'I've got $65.4 billion, people. What do you reckon we should spend it on?' I think it fails the political test. But if those opposite want to stand over there and yet again bash themselves over the head bringing this bill back again—if that's what they want to do and if that's their political strategy—then who are we to argue against it? I know who it will advantage at the next election.


Of course, this is part of the government's jobs and growth agenda. 'Jobs and growth'—remember that? People listening at home—if anyone listens to the Federation Chamber at home—may remember 'jobs and growth'. You couldn't turn on the telly in the never-ending campaign through winter without hearing: 'Jobs and growth, jobs and growth, jobs and growth!' You might have been fooled. I get the political strategy—if you say it enough, maybe someone will believe it. You might have been fooled into thinking there was actually a plan because they said, 'We had a plan for jobs and growth.' If you say you have a plan, then maybe someone will think you actually have a plan.


As it turned out, and as has been revealed, month after month, week after week, day after day, it is not a plan. It was a logo. It was blue and yellow. There was a website and a slogan, but there was no actual plan. That started to become clear to me, because I remember that it was the priority. The centrepiece of the government's economic strategy in the jobs and growth agenda were these big company tax cuts. And they introduced the legislation last year. Nothing happened. I was thinking, 'Nothing happened'—for this critical part of the economic plan. It wasn't even brought on for debate until March this year. Then they struck this bizarre and desperate deal with some of the senators in that moment where the Prime Minister needed some kind of legislative victory—a political win, so to speak; anything really. They put through the lower end of it, and now we're back here with the bit that really stinks. It's the bit that brings home Gina's bacon—the tax cuts for the top end of town.


You might also remember—it was hilarious from our side, I suppose, but it probably wasn't the best day to be a government backbencher. Member for La Trobe, we sit opposite up there every day—



Mr Wood interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  It probably wasn't the best day to be a government backbencher when the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister, 'How much is this going to cost?' And we had an answer of, 'Well, it's going to cost $24 billion'—waffle, waffle, waffle, glasses come off. 'Oh, I mean $26 billion'—waffle, waffle, waffle. But of course that would be $50 billion. We had one answer with three different costs. We thought that was a bit weird. So we thought we'd try asking the Treasurer, 'How much is this package going to cost?' The Treasurer said, 'Well, of course, it's going to cost $36.5 billion.' We thought, 'That's a fourth number. Maybe we'll go back to the Prime Minister.' So we asked, 'Prime Minister, how much is this package going to cost?' The answer was $65.4 billion. In just three minutes of question time, the government spent an extra $15 billion, and so there it sits. The true figure over 10 years in the long-term estimate is $65.4 billion of taxpayer funding for this tax cut for big companies and multinationals.


Of course, this is in an environment where there was a 'debt and deficit disaster'. But somehow, magically, just by electing the Tories of course that was going to be fixed—just because they're Tories! Of course, the budget was just going to whirr back into surplus in some mystical fashion.


The true record under the drunken-sailor spending of the previous Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, was to add $100 billion to Australia's debt—it's not really in the right direction or trajectory. One of the things which really disturbs me about this is the unfunded nature of it. Sure, if you want to put forward a plan that says, 'We believe this. Here's the economic theory and here's how we're going to pay for it,' do that. That is not what this government has had the courage or policy conviction to do. There is absolutely no clarity, no explanation—not even a peep about how this is going to be paid for. And we know this trick: it's what conservative governments around the world do to justify cuts to essential public services. We've seen it in America. We've seen it in other countries. You say, 'This is the critical thing: we have to cut these taxes for the top end of town, whether it's income tax cuts'—because the only people who got an income tax cut from this government, of course, were people who earn over $180—'so we'll pop that in because that's somehow the priority.' The other priority is: cut taxes for the top end of town. Then, when you get that you through, you say, 'Goodness gracious me, the deficit's got bigger. We've got a fiscal crisis. The only way to fix a fiscal crisis is to cut Medicare, cut education, cut social spending. Goodness me, the age pension—that's a bit high. We'd better go and have another hack at pensioners.' And of course the Notice Paper is littered with bills that have another hack at pensioners.


We're not going to be fooled by this trick. If you are fair dinkum, if you actually believe this, if you actually had any idea how to manage the budget, you would have come into the parliament and said, 'We think this is an important economic reform'—make the case—'and here's how we're going to pay for it. Here are the things that we're going to stop doing, Australian people. Let's be honest: here are the things that are going to be cut to pay for this enormous company tax cut.'


We're told that this is essential—actually, I'll just go back to the member for Hughes; probably my least favourite member for his complete lack of rationality in any of his speeches. I had the misfortune of being on chamber duty for a few months in a row and, every single time I was on chamber duty, we had the foghorn of the member for Hughes blaring across. But I discovered 'Kellynomics' from listening to his speech in March on the company tax cuts, and it goes something like this: 'Because we're going to cut government revenue by cutting company tax, actually revenue is going to increase and we'll create a surplus.' Somehow by cutting revenue, you're going get more revenue when you're the member for Hughes. 


Then he misrepresents the wonderful legacy of Paul Keating when he was Treasurer—the government is obsessed with Paul Keating; they're jealous of his enormous legacy. I understand why because he transformed the Australian economy, and John Howard's government kind of coasted through living off the proceeds of that reform—I still haven't heard of a single structural economic reform that those opposite can name that the Howard government implemented after the GST; they just reacted to events. But what the member for Hughes and those opposite love to claim is: 'Well, Paul Keating cut the company tax rate from 49c to 39c, and somehow Labor portrays that proud legacy because we oppose this unfunded tax cut.' There are a couple of critical points though that you conveniently miss in putting forward this misrepresentation of what occurred in the eighties and nineties—that is, because the Treasury summary notes then that the company tax reductions have largely corresponded with base-broadening measures, such as the removal of accelerated depreciation. That's right: in plain English, the cut in the company tax rate that Paul Keating put forward was fully funded. It was clear where the money was coming from because the base of the tax was broadened at the expense of budget and important services and investments; whereas this government is putting forward a company tax cut which is unfunded. It shows the rank hypocrisy of the government. 


The reductions in the headline rate in previous years, such as Paul Keating's, were funded through making the tax more efficient and broadening the base. It is a special kind of love that you have discovered of late for Paul Keating—and actually we hear a lot about John Curtin and Ben Chifley as well; we don't hear much about your own legacy. I will read again into the Hansard an extract of what Keating said in 1998. It goes: 


The government is to cut the corporate tax rate in one step, from 49 cents to 39 cents, to give Australian companies a tax structure more than competitive with the rest of the world.


… the government has decided to lower the tax rates by removing some tax concessions—


—that is, lower the company tax rate by broadening the base; not just take $65 billion out of the forward estimates, give it away to big business for little to no economic benefit and call that reform. That's Kellynomics. Apparently we should all be in a race to the bottom on company tax—and we have to do it because some other countries have a bit of a lower headline company tax rate, therefore we should. Presumably, if you take that logic, if President Trump cut the company tax rate to 15 per cent, then we'd have to match that, and then someone would cut it to 10, and we'd cut it to 10—and zero would be nirvana. So we would have no tax revenue and somehow that would be a perfectly competitive world! Of course, you'd have to cut all government spending, but we don't actually get to that part of the conversation of how we are going to fund this ridiculous tax cut. That's Kellynomics. 


Why are you doing this? What's the government's stated policy reason for doing this? There's the global competitiveness bit, even though any sensible economist will tell you that the headline rate is not the correct comparator. You just take the headline rate and say, 'We'll compare that to another headline rate.' The US Congressional Budget Office is the most respected and well-developed budget office in the world, providing independent budget analysis for the Congress there. Our PBO, relatively young in its life, is learning from it, but that's a different story. But the Congressional Budget Office in America has said: 'You don't look at the headline rate. That's for dummies. That doesn't mean anything. You look at the effective tax rate that companies actually pay.' When you look at the effective tax rate, that is not 30 per cent in Australia. I think that on the last figures—I haven't got them in front of me—it was in the order of 24 per cent, which is a very different proposition. 


What you also find, if you've worked in investment facilitation and think broadly, is that the company tax rate, headline or effective, is but one of the many inputs that companies take into consideration in making investment decisions. I used to work in the Victorian government, in the economic development department, in the trade and investment facilitation area, and it's a very sophisticated methodology. You look at all sorts of things. We should not be ashamed in Australia that we have high-quality public services. This is something to aspire to, and you need money to provide them—not that that has dawned on those opposite, because apparently you can just take money out of the budget and not worry about where it's coming from. 


There are many other things: the stability of our financial system, the reliability of our regulatory environment, the rule of law, the quality of life, the human capital, the kinds of skilled workers you can get in Australia if you choose to invest, the infrastructure—putting aside the NBN, 'fraudband'; that actually is a problem, as we move down the competitiveness rankings. But all of these things are factors which are properly taken into account in the real world, the grown-up world, in making investment decisions. It's not just some race to the bottom on company tax as the only thing that matters. 


The purported gain is one per cent. This is the best estimate. The Treasury figures, the ones that the government is relying on, show a one per cent gain in 10 to 20 years. In 10 years something might start happening, and after 20 years it might get to one per cent. What does that mean? It means $2 a day in wages in 20 years time—for spending $65 billion over the next 10 years. That sounds like a pretty dumb return to me, but perhaps the political strategy of the Prime Minister, 'Mr 50c', is shining through. He's now adding 50c off your electricity bill in 10 or 20 years time, so you might get $2.50! Maybe that's it. Maybe that sort of spread-copper, burn-coal, spin-crap election strategy that we're starting to see emerging—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order! Just watch your—




Mr HILL:
  That was exactly what I said in Hansard yesterday, if you check, and it was agreed—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I just ask the member for Bruce to watch his language and not to reflect on members personally like you did earlier. 'Waffle, waffle, waffle, taking glasses off' is reflecting on members personally. I would just ask the member to keep that in mind, thanks.




Mr HILL:
  I think 'waffle' is a figure of speech. 



An honourable member:  Taking glasses off?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You weren't here.




Mr HILL:
  That's a description of what happens in question time. That's not indicating—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No. It's a reflection on the Prime Minister, and I'd ask the member for Bruce—




Mr HILL:
  It is a reflection. Would you like me to make more reflections on the Prime Minister?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No. I would ask the member for Bruce not to do that. It's not in order. Thank you. Continue. You've got 24 seconds left.




Mr HILL:
  That's fine. I'm happy to seek clarification. I wasn't imitating the Prime Minister, which is against practice. I was observing what the Prime Minister does, which I think is entirely in accordance with the standing orders. So what's your point?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Bruce—




Mr HILL:
  You don't have a point.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Your time's finished. I was merely saying that you were out of order. I invite you to go and reflect on those orders. Check with Mr Burke. Mr Burke would be able to fill you in. 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,2
"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (11:59):  I'm sure the member for Bruce will reflect on the standing orders. I wasn't going to speak on this particular matter, but the member for Bruce inspired me with his rhetoric and passion for the subject. I, too, want to speak about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. Deputy Speaker Howarth, you've obviously heard that, on this side, there have been a lot of concerns raised about the net benefit for our economy if the $65 billion tax cut goes through. I've heard a lot of observations from our perspective that it will not be terribly much. That's in the spirit of bipartisanship. That was really driven home to me. I would categorise myself as someone in the Labor Party who is pro-business. I have worked with businesses in a whole range of areas in my previous life. If I thought this was a good idea and I thought this would actually generate the prosperity that this government says it is going to generate, then not just I but also others on our side would support this proposed tax cut, but that's not what I see at all.


I deal with businesspeople a lot. For the parliamentary record, when I was parliamentary secretary to Kevin Rudd, particularly during the global financial crisis—the one that is often denigrated on the other side; the one that we say wasn't as bad as people were saying—we worked very closely with business. It's important to lay the groundwork for why I say that the $65 billion could be better spent and could be backed up with appropriate savings. If I go back in history—and it does tie into the enterprise tax plan—we started detecting a substantial softening in the US economy, particularly when we saw the collapse of Lehmann Brothers. I'm glad I'm able to talk about this, because it's one of the great failings of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era that they were never able to get a proper description of what we were facing during the global financial crisis, due to the internal dynamics.


I hoped that your side of politics, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, had learnt from us, but I think you took the wrong lessons from us. I think you're now reaping the dividend of that cancer in the way you deal with unpopular leaders or have difficulties with leaders. That's not an attack on you; it's just an observation. When you are consumed by the discussion about internal dynamics, your government doesn't get the message out about what it wants to achieve and what it has achieved for the economy. During that particular period of time, particularly with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, businesses generally were facing diabolically bad conditions, and they weren't talking about tax cuts then, I can tell you.


We faced two difficulties. I can recall being party to a number of very serious conversations about the economic difficulties that we faced. The first one was stabilising the world financial order. When I spoke to Lindsay Tanner, who was then our finance minister, he said that the world had a financial heart attack on three occasions and, in effect, the entire world financial system was close to collapse. Australians don't realise that. Australians don't realise that a lot of businesses were going to basically hit the wall. We were facing the most grave consequences in terms of what might happen since the Great Depression. That's how bad it was. It's interesting, when we have this discussion now about this particular bill and the $65 billion tax cut, to reflect on what actually occurred then. That informs Labor's view a lot on how to best support business productively so that it can grow in a market that is still affected by the vestiges of the global financial crisis. When a lot of the economic commentators spoke about the global financial crisis and how Australia came out of it, I always detected an underlying fragility. I think it's still there. I think it affects big business and small business.


But my point is that we basically faced a situation where the global financial order was going to collapse. What stopped it collapsing here in Australia was the bank guarantee. I meet with businesses. I deal with businesses across the area—and I'll touch on that in a second and tie it to this particular bill. The Prime Minister formed a special committee—I think it was the SBPC, the strategic budget priorities committee—and I recall having a discussion on the weekend that the SBPC was meeting. There was a lot of criticism about the SBPC, but we were facing a situation at the end of that particular week in October where, if the Australian government had not taken action, there would be a run on the banks the following week.


Why do I talk about business? The reason that I talk about business is that, on the weekend that the SBPC was meeting, I sat down with a gentleman who had developed a lot of property around Dandenong and the surrounding area—someone who was not necessarily pro-Labor but someone I would speak to from time to time—and, while we were sitting there having breakfast, he said, 'If you don't provide a bank guarantee for my business, I'm taking $16 million out of the bank next week.' I thought that that was bluster and I said, 'You can't be serious.' He said, 'My savings aren't safe; I'm taking the money out of the bank'—he was a liquid businessperson, a successful businessperson, not a spendthrift—and I thought, 'This is getting very serious.' If you remember what Ken Henry said when we talked about this period of time, you'd recall that he talked about his mother basically wanting to take money out of the bank.


People underestimate what it was like for businesses during that time. At that time, I dealt with Gerry Ryan, who's the head of Jayco, and we would convene meetings with large businesses in the Dandenong area. These were not publicised. They were important meetings that were put together with major retail chains and major manufacturers that formed the bulk of employment in the Dandenong region. This was slightly out of my area, and I would ask, 'What can we do to protect your businesses? This was around the same period—late 2008-09. Gerry started to convene these meetings so that I could talk with big businesses and small businesses directly, who said, 'We've got to have stimulus in the economy; otherwise, we're going to start laying off thousands of workers.'


I think the thing for critics of the then government's stimulus package—and again it relates to this particular bill—is the question around what business needs to create jobs and opportunity. When I hark back to that period of time, what business needed was spend on infrastructure and the creation of confidence in the community. I won't go into the details of the meetings, because these meetings were held with up to 14 or 15 members of the business community—and my staff member was there at that time. We were literally facing this yawning chasm of: 'My God; employment is going to collapse in the south eastern region of Melbourne.' It was that close.


The worrisome thing, when I look at this bill and the $65 billion we're talking about, is that everyone has forgotten what Australian businesses were facing and what the Australian government needed to do to keep those businesses afloat. The first component was to stop the run on the banks—and that's what happened with the bank guarantee. I noticed that former Treasurer Wayne Swan was speaking here yesterday about BHP and its role. The former Treasurer was obviously right at the coalface in terms of what happened there, and he was talking about businesses that don't pay tax—and I'll talk about that briefly later on. But people forget that we needed to create confidence.


The second measure—regardless of what side of politics—is to inject liquidity into the system, which we did with the first stimulus in November-December that year. That lifted retail. Retail is the canary in the coalmine. If retail is doing well, it's a good canary. When it was not doing well, major retailers were telling me, 'We're sacking.' They were getting ready to sack thousands of workers for the Christmas period in 2008. That didn't happen. That was, I think, a government working constructively with small business and big business.


Then, of course, we established the infrastructure projects. Again, we would have differences about how that money was spent. When I looked at the number of tradespeople in my constituency whose jobs were saved by those stimulus packages that built those buildings that the opposition, the now government, were criticising, I was seeing a person, a livelihood, a lifestyle, potentially taken away. My point is: when I look at what the government's putting forward, I see a measure that is not going to deliver the economic benefits that the government wants and that will be at a substantial cost to the economy and to its own reputation really. There are better ways of doing this.


Again, when I talk to businesses now, they're not saying, 'Don't give us a tax cut.' They're saying, 'Build more infrastructure.' There are Liberal supporters and coalition supporters. I wouldn't go so far as to say they were talking like socialists, but when you're talking about people that I would regard as being in the far right of the Liberal party and they are saying to me, 'I want you guys in the state government to concentrate on infrastructure,' not one person has mentioned a tax cut. We're proposing $65 billion worth of tax cuts, and these are big businesses—they don't talk about this—like Jayco, for example. Gerry Ryan hasn't come up to me and said, 'I would like a tax cut'—and they employ 800 people. They are a world-leading manufacturer of a great product. Gerry has another wing, his dinosaur creatures company, which features in Hollywood. I think that's about a $130 million enterprise. This is a man that does business overseas. This are one of the people that your government is targeting with this tax cut, but he's not saying we need this.


Again, when I look at the rationale for why we need this, it's just not evident. I accept that the government has put forward its reason, but we've heard speaker after speaker on our side debunk that. We're not opposing this because we just like opposing it; we're opposing it because we think the $65 billion, if it needed to be spent, could be spent in much more effective ways. For example, I have two headspaces in my regional area. They happened as a consequence of lobbying that my office did with a group of incredible young students in 2012 because we had a suicide cluster. If anyone has lived in a region where you see young people killing themselves in the numbers that they did in my constituency, you don't want your worst enemy to live through that; I can assure you of that. What we did was lobby the then government—and there was resistance from our side, so I'm not saying this was an easy thing. We did a program with Four Corners called 'There is no 3G in heaven'. What the then Gillard government did was direct, I think, up to $6 million—$3 million for the headspace in Dandenong and $3 million for the headspace in Narre Warren. At least we did something with that.


Last week I went back to that headspace again as part of national Mental Health Week and headspace day. I met with the young people and I heard about the lives that are being saved. As I was saying, when you've been through an area that's been as scarred as that region, particularly with the young people that had been killing themselves, you ask: 'What do they need?' If you talk with them afterwards, they say, 'We need funding certainty because, beyond 2019, we're not quite sure if we can still function.' We have massive population growth down our way and, as someone who's lived through that experience of young people hurting themselves in this way, the fact that there's not a guarantee of the funding for an essential service that protects and saves young people blows my mind. If I saw something in this bill that basically said, 'We're going to put $120 million to national headspace,' I would say congratulations to your side of politics, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth. I would like that, but there's nothing there.


There are tax cuts to businesses that sometimes, in effect, pay no tax. I have here, in my hand, an article from ABC News titled: 'Who pays what? ATO names large companies that paid zero tax in 2014-15'. It says there are 670 large companies that paid no corporate tax in the 2014-15 financial year, and 1,900 public, private and foreign-owned entities for the 2014-15 income year paid no tax. I could spend a couple of hours reading through these figures. For example, you have a company with an income of $216 million and there's no tax payable—that's quite extraordinary. My view is that we can't support this particular tax cut. There are better ways of doing this. I respectfully put to you and to the government that this bill be reconsidered.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-10-19,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (12:15):  I rise in this place today to ask the Turnbull government one very simple question. Is this government kidding, giving a $65 billion tax cut to big business? Is the Turnbull government so out of touch with the Australian people that it honestly believes that giving a big tax cut to big business is what this country needs to move forward? This government needs a reality check, and I am more than happy to provide it. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison, listen carefully to these facts. Growing inequality in this country is one of our fastest growing concerns, and the government should be addressing it. Inequality is at a 70-year high. More than 105,000 people are homeless. One-third of Australian aged pensioners are living in poverty. Thirty-two per cent of unemployed people live in poverty, and the HILDA report showed that child poverty is growing. Wage growth hasn't been this low since the retention of records began.


The Australian Bureau of Statistics has collected data since 1975 on earnings inequality. Profits have gone up by 40 per cent, but wages have gone up by less than two per cent. Real wages have grown by 72 per cent for the top 10 per cent of earners—in 1975 they earned twice as much as the bottom 10 per cent, but by 2014 it was nearly three times as much. If low-wage earners had enjoyed the same percentage gains as the highest paid, they would be $16,000 a year better off. The richest one per cent of Australians own more wealth than the bottom 70 per cent of Australians combined. For every dollar a male earns, a woman earns 82c. A total of 678 corporations and 48 millionaires paid no tax. How completely messed up are the Turnbull government's priorities! It wants to give a $65 billion tax cut to big business and not address homelessness and stagnant wage growth or assist Australians living in poverty. What kind of government does that? It is an out of touch, out of its mind, incompetent, right-wing government.


And then there are the facts about my community of Herbert. We are a strong and resilient community, and we have experienced our fair share of knocks. But the Turnbull government is insistent on kicking us while we are down. Unemployment in Townsville is at 8.9 per cent. Youth unemployment is just under 25 per cent. To add to those very high unemployment figures, we also have a very high underemployment situation. Personal insolvency is amongst some of the highest rates in the country. We are drought declared and on level 3 water restrictions. Our electricity prices have skyrocketed, with some local businesses even choosing not to run their air conditioners in 33-degree heat. Yes, there are projects coming, and yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Even so, there is still serious concern over the potential lack of skills to deliver those projects, and that includes apprentices and trainees, a fact that is definitely not helped by the Turnbull government's more than $2 billion cut to TAFE.


Because of our community's get-back-up-and-get-going, never-say-die attitude, we will come through these challenges. But our success and survival will not come from the Turnbull government. It will come because we work hard and we are resilient. It will come from federal Labor backing and supporting our community with $100 million towards vital water infrastructure. The vision for our community will come from a federal Labor government, which has committed $200 million towards hydropower on the Burdekin Falls Dam. It will come from strong investment by the Queensland Labor government, which has also invested in water, infrastructure, roads and the CBD revitalisation. It will come from the local council and local community leaders, like Brad Webb, who have stepped up, united and worked collaboratively to assist in addressing these issues. Most importantly, our survival will be the result of the united Townsville community, who continue to support each other and local businesses through tough times. But assistance to Townsville, our workers, families and pensioners will not come from the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut. Interestingly, the assistance that is coming from the Turnbull government will aim to have Australians believe that giving big businesses a tax cut will eventually trickle down to workers' pay packets and create more jobs. The theory of trickle-down economics has been around for over 40 years. I, along with many other workers and families, am still waiting to see exactly what does trickle down, because, at this stage, the only thing that is trickling down is inequality.


The Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut will have minimal economic impact. It's barely even measurable: one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time, and a $2 a day increase in wages in 20 years time. This is at a time when wages growth has flatlined at a record low of 1.9 per cent. Recently released economic data show that living standards that had been climbing have gone backwards in the last quarter. Australian families are facing a nasty cocktail of rising costs and electricity prices, stalling wages growth and resulting in record-high underemployment, and the Turnbull government has nothing to offer. Labor has long-held concerns about low wages growth. Without a doubt, the dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in the stagnation of wages growth and in rising inequality.


At a time when the government have also supported penalty rate cuts from 1 July this year, they also seek to raise income taxes on all taxpayers with an income above $21,000. A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year in tax, and for someone on $80,000 it's an extra $400 in tax. How is it fair that a worker on $55,000 a year will pay $275 more when big businesses are paying less. It's clear that, in the form of rising personal income taxes, low- and middle-income Australians are paying for the government's $65 billion handout to big business. This was confirmed by the Parliamentary Budget Office earlier this month, with the PBO saying that:


In addition to the effect of nominal income growth, average tax rates are projected to increase due to policy changes, most notably the policy decision to increase the Medicare Levy from 2019-20.


The PBO projects that the average tax rate on personal income will rise from 22.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 25.9 per cent in 2027-28. This is a government that has totally confused the Robin Hood message, because they take from the poor and give to the rich in the form of taxation.


If the Turnbull government is looking for ideas on how to spend $65 billion that would improve the situation in this country, particularly in my electorate, I have a very long list of ideas. Provide water security for Townsville and match Labor's commitment for $100 million. Provide hydropower generation on the Burdekin Falls Dam and match Labor's commitment of $200 million. Complete the rollout of Labor's NBN, as the NBN will be the greatest new infrastructure for regional, rural and remote Queensland—but only if we have fibre to the curb or premises. Reverse the $401.8 million in cuts to Queensland universities, in particular the $37.1 million cut to James Cook University in North Queensland. Reinstate the cuts to the Townsville Health and Hospital Service. Stop the $300 million in cuts to public dental services, where, across Queensland, waiting lists have blown out to 117,000 people. End the GP freeze on everything—an issue that is holding our doctors and medical practices to ransom. Stop the cuts to pathology. Re-establish Labor's Health Workforce Australia, which was working on retaining doctors in regional, rural and remote areas, because right now in Townsville we are facing a GP registrar crisis. Commit to ongoing funding for the Townsville Salvation Army for the youth drug and alcohol detox facility. End the more than $2 billion in cuts to TAFE. Stop the more than $2 billion in cuts to aged care. Don't raise the working age to 70. Don't cut the energy supplement. Spend more on infrastructure. Commit and sign off on even one project from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. There are a number of ways that $65 billion could be better spent than on a $65 billion big business tax break that will contribute to the growing inequality divide.


Labor have the priorities right. We will ensure we deal with inequality in this country by properly funding needs based funding for schools; investing in job-creating infrastructure; establishing a fairer tax system; dealing with superannuation tax concessions, which is something that we announced late last year and yet somehow the government has now decided that it is a secret superannuation tax; levelling the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax; capping the deductions people can obtain for managing their tax affairs to $3,000; and imposing a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts to deal with income splitting—dealing with something that has been in the too-hard basket for far too long.


In contrast we have a government that has its priorities all wrong. It is a government determined to reduce the tax on businesses—big business in particular—while at the same time increasing the tax on everyday working Australians who are just trying to get ahead. Only Labor will stand and fight to eliminate inequality, only Labor will stand up for workers, families and pensioners, and only Labor will deliver a fairer tax system for every citizen in this country.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (12:27):  Last week I was honoured to meet student leader representatives from Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College in Kensington. It was a very articulate and passionate group of representatives who had sought a meeting with me to discuss the urgency of taking action on climate change and to deliver to me a petition, signed by no fewer than 700 constituents of Kingsford Smith, calling on the Commonwealth parliament to take greater action on climate change, to be serious about this issue and to ensure that Australia is making a transition to renewable energy. The petition outlines the threat that climate change is having to the health, wellbeing and security of the people of the world, particularly some of our poorest and most vulnerable neighbours. It points out that Australia has the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions of any nation in the world, yet we have some of the weakest emissions reduction targets under this government. The petition calls on the Australian parliament, us as representatives, to do more to protect Australians from the threat of climate change and our neighbours through deeper cuts to emissions targets and greater commitment to renewable energy. I wish to congratulate the girls who came to see me and all who signed the petition.


It's incredibly sad that it's been left to young Australians, to students, to point out that the Abbott-Turnbull government is failing them when it comes to taking fair dinkum action to reduce Australia's carbon pollution and take action on climate change. These students expressed their frustration about the weak targets and the weak approach of the government on this issue. The weakness exhibited by the Prime Minister—who used to believe in climate change and used to believe in strong action on reducing carbon emissions; hell, he even voted for it in the parliament; he crossed the floor to vote for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and subsequently abandoned it—means that it will be left to the next generation of younger Australians to clean up the mess that the Abbott-Turnbull government created due to their lack of action on climate change.


With the girls I had a very thoughtful and passionate discussion about the fact that in Australia our carbon pollution is on the rise again. After falling during the period of the Labor government when we put in place a price on carbon emissions, carbon pollution is actually increasing in Australia at the moment. There is a cost associated with that for individuals, families, communities and the Australian people. That cost comes in the form of increasing insurance premiums, in the form of repairing damaged infrastructure and in the cost of increasing health care. Passing on that cost to young people is irresponsible.


The Abbott-Turnbull government have actively taken steps to reduce the amount of renewable energy that we have here in Australia. They've done this by recently cutting the Renewable Energy Target and, with the announcement this week on the so-called new energy policy, they're pledging to phase out completely the Renewable Energy Target from 2020. They removed the price on carbon emissions in our economy—a mechanism that was working to put a price on the cost of carbon emissions and reduce them over time. We actually saw that carbon pollution in Australia was falling during the Labor government, and the funds that were raised from that were pumped into the development of clean energy through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They're trying to delay the closure of dirty coal-fired power stations that have come to the end of their natural life.


This government is ignoring the interests of young people when it comes to climate change, but we're also letting down our neighbours. We had a passionate discussion about the fact that, in the Pacific, climate change is a present danger and we're letting down countries like Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands where communities are actively facing the threat of sea-level rise, where wells are becoming salinised, where crops are drying up and populations are looking to move off those islands. 


To those who signed the petition, I tell you: I and my Labor colleagues understand your frustration. We accept that climate change is real. We accept that it's doing damage and we will take greater action to reduce pollution and increase renewables. We will commit to doing more. We will not abandon young Australians when it comes to this issue.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The document will be forwarded to the Standing Committee on Petitions for its consideration. It will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms to the standing orders.




Mr THISTLETHWAITE:
  I seek leave to table this important petition.


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—



To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:


This petition of concerned people of the electorate of Kingsford-Smith, draws to the attention of the House the severe and urgent threat that climate change poses to the health, well-being and security of all people around the world, particularly our poorest and most vulnerable neighbours. We remind the House that Australia's greenhouse emissions are the highest per person among wealthy nations while our emissions reduction targets are among the weakest. 


We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to protect communities in Australia and our region from the harmful impacts of climate change - such as more severe heat, extreme and unpredictable weather and rising seas - by:


committing to deeper and more urgent reductions of our greenhouse emissions;


developing a plan to ensure Australia achieves zero net greenhouse emissions well before 2050, and supporting families and communities affected by the transition towards renewable energy and more sustainable land use;


providing additional assistance to help our poorest neighbours adapt to the harmful impacts of climate change.
