"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-03,"—We are discussing whether we should change `exceptional circumstances' to `unforeseen circumstances' if the national broadcasters cannot begin digital transmission when they are supposed to. There are two things that worry me about this and I would like the minister's assurance on both of them. If I can get that assurance, I will not be so worried. Firstly, if by chance some mythical government did not fund one or other of the national broadcasters properly to start digital transmission—for example, they just did not have the money to do it because they did not get it out of appropriations—would that be seen as exceptional or would they just have to give back the spectrum, despite the fact that the next government, after the one which did not fund them, may well fund them properly? Would that be seen as exceptional?
—You are describing a Liberal and Labor government there.
—I am considering a Democrat government, which would fund the 
 ABC brilliantly for digital broadcasting. The point is that, if the ABC or SBS are not properly funded to be able to start digital broadcasting, would that be seen as an exceptional circumstance? Would they will still have the opportunity to have that spectrum or could it be sold off to people such as datacasters?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—The short answer is that, if they did not get any funding, that would clearly be an exceptional circumstance.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—In view of that succinct commitment from the government, we support the government's amendment.
—Good on you, Schachty!
—What is wrong?
—Supporting the government's amendment.
—Senator Watson should remember that I have been extraordinarily cooperative with the government over this bill, and the last four or five hours of discussion in the committee stage of this bill have proved it.
If any government was mad enough to cut the funding and then use that as an excuse to take the megahertz back from the national broadcaster, whatever one may think about those individual national broadcasters, the public debate that would ensue would be very vigorous, widespread and something that a government would take an enormous amount of bruising on, and it would be forced to capitulate. I do not think there is any doubt about that, because it would be an unheard of procedure to say to a national broadcaster, `We are taking your spectrum off you and we have cut the money off you.' It would never happen with a Labor government. I hope a Liberal government is dopey enough to try, because the political damage it would incur would be massive.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-03,"—I thank the minister for that answer. I should mention to Senator Schacht—and I am sure he knows—that the ABC in particular has been given only $20.8 
 million when it needs $108 million for stage 1 of digitisation, and that has been accepted by an independent study. I hope that the minister's answer means that the ABC will be given the rest of that $108 million in the very near future for stage 1 of digitisation. I thank the minister for his answer that he believes that that would be exceptional, and that does allay my fears a great deal.
The other circumstance that does not worry me as much, but does worry me somewhat, is that, if something were to happen to the national transmission network in private or public hands, and the national broadcasters were unable to begin digital broadcasting perhaps for weeks beyond the point when they were supposed to, would that be seen as exceptional as well? If it is, with those two circumstances covered, I would not bother proceeding with the amendment.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—The underlying principle is that you would only contemplate resumption of the spectrum where the players themselves were at fault. It follows by definition that, if the NTA or the government itself does not fund them, it is not their fault. So you would have no basis for asking for it to be handed back. It is only when you get into these degrees where they say, `Yes, technically we have not been able to roll it out, but there have been exceptional circumstances,' and you say, `If that is the case, we will allow you to keep going.'",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—With respect to any exceptional or unforeseen circumstances applying to the ABC, it seems that the construct of this clause is ostensibly about providing an opportunity for an out, if you like, if the ABC finds itself in the position of being uncompetitive or unfair.
On that point I would like to raise a concern I have with the minister about the way the ABC could possibly compete, particularly in the potential area of datacasting. Perhaps an extraordinary circumstance could be described as the advent of other broadcasters who are recipients of seven megahertz of spectrum being in a position, as we know 
 they are, to provide a datacasting service concurrently with their broadcasting services now; yet the ABC does not have that infrastructure or capacity to invest in partnerships with other providers of infrastructure to establish themselves as a provider of a datacasting service now prior to the completion of the year 2000 review.
Firstly, if the ABC found themselves in that situation, would that constitute an exceptional circumstance? Secondly, it raises a broader issue of the actual exclusion of the ABC in being able to provide a datacasting service in the intervening period when we know that other broadcasters, particularly Channel 7 and Channel 9, are in a position to in fact do that right now.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—Datacasting is in some respects an optional extra. That is why the Labor Party at one stage wanted to put it all off and take it out of the bill. The core element of it is that we want to see a digital rollout and the broadcasters getting into the HDTV business. This clause is saying that, `If we give you the spectrum on the basis that you will roll it out, and then you welsh on the deal, if there is no good reason for that, we want to recall it.'
Exceptional circumstances is only concerned with the extent to which the broadcasters, both national and commercial, honour their obligations to move in that direction in a broadcasting sense. As far as datacasting is concerned, the ABC and SBS can get into datacasting if they want to. They will be treated in the same way as the commercials. They will be entitled to charge for using their spectrum for those purposes, but otherwise it is their call.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Minister, in some of your comments yesterday, you described the review that is going to take place as being quite narrow in its relevancy. Can you comment on the circumstance that could arise where the excess digital spectrum that may potentially be available for datacasting is actually not required by the broadcaster because they are providing those services 
 elsewhere and whether or not the retention of that digital spectrum for those purposes over and above the datacasting service they are providing will be possible?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—The broadcasters will be using only whatever is left over from their seven megahertz after they have provided broadcasting facilities. If they start off at standard definition and move towards a degree of digital—I forget the numbers now, but let us say they go to 625 on the way to 1080—they will have maybe a third left for datacasting. If they go to full HDTV, they may not have much left over, but I think they would still have a bit left over for datacasting. If you are talking about the excess within their seven megahertz, it is a matter for them, subject to meeting the progressive time lines in terms of the transmission rollout for broadcasting. But if you are talking about the balance of the spectrum that is otherwise available for datacasters, as we have said a number of times, we believe that there is more than sufficient for any of the new entrants and there may indeed be some surplus spectrum. But that is not a problem; that is just an abundance of spectrum which can be used for other purposes entirely, if that turns out to be the case.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Minister, with respect to future datacasting services, do you see it as being within your role to ensure that the ABC suffers no competitive disadvantage in presenting that first interface with the viewer for a datacasting service or do you think that is something that should just fall within the determination of the market, so to speak?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—The essential principle is a level playing field, so no-one is trying to discriminate for or against commercials or national broadcasters. If, say, the ABC decides that it is not really interested in datacasting and that it wants to go to full high definition ahead of the commercials, then it would do that. If it simply met the progressive timetable, then over time it would pro 
 gressively have less spectrum available for the purpose. But it would, nonetheless, have surplus spectrum which could be used for commercial purposes. It could enter into sharing arrangements with other datacasters, and it would be in the business of earning revenue from that source and, at the same time, be subject to an across-the-board revenue collection mechanism from the Commonwealth.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Pursuing that point, if it is not within the capacity of the ABC to in fact embark upon the same sorts of realignments and partnerships with the providers of other bandwidth infrastructure, what special consideration, if you like, is the government prepared to consider?
—Give them more money.
—I will acknowledge Senator Schacht's point—it is about more money. It is about the government being the source of funding for the ABC and ensuring that the ABC does have the resources to present its datacasting product to the community in a way that is not subservient to other datacasting services which, under the current time frames, will be long established.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—This is not meant to be a subsidised area of activity; it is meant to be a commercial opportunity. The ABC will have spectrum there for datacasting purposes. I imagine that they would have a head start in terms of content. They would be able to enter into agreements with any other player to ensure that they have a proper datacasting facility and enjoy the fruits of that commercial exercise. But, if it were going to involve more money, it would not be a commercial operation in the first instance, so there would be no purpose in getting into it. In other words, it is not there as some sort of CSO; it is there as an opportunity to earn revenue. If the ABC is not able to persuade others that this is a good commercial opportunity, I suppose that tells you that it is not a top priority for them. But I would have thought they have a head start because they 
 have their own content which others do not have.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Minister, I think that reinforces my point rather than providing a countervailing point to what I am saying. You say that datacasting is a competitive opportunity. The provisions of this bill provide for that commercial opportunity, if you like, not to be available to the ABC for a period of time, yet the commercial realities for other providers of datacasting service exist outside the confines of this legislation. As for a head start in content, the ABC's capacity and ability to produce content suitable for datacasting is solely contingent upon your government's decisions with respect to funding. Indeed, further, your comments with respect to the capacity of the ABC to earn revenue and make a datacasting service a commercial viability also ring patently false, given the charter of the ABC.
We know that the economics of broadcasting and datacasting services are very closely related to the capacity of those services to attract advertisers. This is obviously a point of distinction between the national broadcasters, particularly the ABC, and the commercials. So the issue that you say has no relevance—being funding to the ABC—has the highest degree of relevance to the capacity of the ABC to produce not only content suitable for datacasting but also quality. There is also the question of the ability of the ABC to actually present that datacasting service across infrastructure other than digital spectrum, which is locked within the confines of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—The ABC already has ABC Online, which is, I think, pretty tangible proof that they can get into the business of generating broadcasting services. There is no reason at all to imagine that the ABC will not be interested in pursuing commercial opportunities with other specialist players who are not broadcasters, because there will be a revenue sharing opportunity there. 
The funding that is being made available by the government to the ABC is essentially to assist in the migration to digital television. That is why I say that in some respects datacasting is an optional extra. It is there. The reason it is there is that we do not think it would make sense to force any of the broadcasters to move to any particular level of digital standard at any particular point in time until we see how it plays out in the marketplace. If it turns out not to be an in-demand product, clearly it would be ridiculous to effectively try to phase out existing analog sections—doing what you lot did with analog mobile phones. So you allow it to occur progressively and you monitor that as you set your progressive standards.
We can have an argument about how much money the ABC ought to get, and how quickly, for the digital rollout, but that is unrelated to datacasting. That will be something they will pursue quite separately. They will have the capacity to do it because they are being given the same seven megahertz that are available to the commercials. There will be surplus spectrum available and they will do with it what they like. I would have thought they have advantages compared to the commercials because they have a unique archive which is in considerable demand. There should not be any shortage of an ability to generate datacasting product.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I want to get this point clear from the government. You have provided $20 million to the ABC for the first stage of digital broadcasting. It is over five years or some such period of time. They are claiming that they want more and that you have been short-changing them, but that is not the point I want to raise. That money, whatever the amount of money is, will be used to put in the infrastructure for digital broadcasting generally. In the end, if they do run a commercial digital datacasting system, is it the case that the government will withdraw a proportion of that money, whatever the amount is, saying, `That bit of digital broadcasting is actually in a commercial area, and for true transparency you have got to refund to the government, because we only gave it 
 to you for free to air broadcasting'? I just want to get it clear that later there would not be a sum taken back when you see that there is a proportion of the signal clearly being used when they have reached a commercial arrangement for a datacasting signal such as you have described, which we do not disagree with. I just want to get it clear that it is not a way for Treasury to come and to tell you to take back $5 million because they are effectively taking $5 million of that money from the infrastructure generally to run a datacasting signal.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—I think you would probably find that the funding will be used for production, post-production and transmission purposes, and it may be that there is a bit of overlap in all that.
—The transmission costs.
—That is basically phase 2. Essentially, they have got the camera gear and the studio equipment and the rest which will have to be digitised. I imagine there would be some spillover, just is as there is currently with ABC Online. Our priority, and I imagine theirs, is to be able to compete effectively with the other broadcasters in digital television. If it turned out that you were able to say, `Look, they have used the money for datacasting. This is a nice little earner. They are in bed with Fairfax and they are making money out there. Because they put the money in there, they have not been able to keep up with the other networks in terms of digital television,' you would probably look askance. But I do not think that is what they will do and, to the extent that they might be able to accomplish the television objectives but at the same time assist the datacasting, I do not think anyone would have a problem.
—That's fine.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—On the issue of the ability of the ABC to actually fund that content production, they will be competing with a commercial datacasting market which we know will be substantially subsidised via advertising revenue. I make specific reference again to what is a critical reference point for 
 me throughout this debate, the trusty Working Party on the Information Economy report Content as a new growth industry . It looks specifically at the way advertising revenue is trending away from TV and splitting among other new media. I would like to read out a short paragraph. It reads:
This market is increasingly fragmenting as new delivery media develop. An annual survey of advertising by DeWitt Media Inc. says marketers will continue to shift advertising dollars from the broadcast networks to other new media as broadcasters lose viewers. About 40 per cent of marketers said they planned to reallocate advertising dollars. Of the 28 per cent that said they would shift advertising dollars, 80 per cent will shift to cable television. Other media include direct mail, interactive media and computer online services.
It refers to USA Today , and I quote:
USA Today reported that spending for advertising placement on the World Wide Web in the first quarter of 1996 was $26 million, up 110 per cent from $13.6 million in the last quarter of 1995.
It then goes on to list the top advertisers as being IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, c/net and AT&T. My point is that there is no doubt that substantial revenues will arise from datacasting services, be they in a Web format or in a more direct presentation from the commercial networks. How is the ABC going to compete in the presentation of their datacasting services, given the confines of their charter and their high reliance upon you as minister to fund them in a way which, as you have said yourself, will ensure that they are at no competitive disadvantage?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—To the extent that the ABC already has transmission facilities and a full suite of services available, it might actually make sense for a datacaster to lease ABC spectrum. But, assuming that is not the principal approach, I would have thought one of the main points of distinction between the ABC and the commercial broadcasting networks is the fact that the ABC does not have advertising. So, if it is not a disadvantage there, it is not a disadvantage in datacasting otherwise, because these things will stand or fall on the quality of the content. They do not stand or fall on whether the ads are any good. You do not go to the site in the first place if 
 it is rubbish. Clearly, if the ABC is able to achieve market share in a competitive broadcasting environment without running ads, it ought to be able to do the same with datacasting. It may well be a point of advantage. They may prefer to offer a subscription service, and I would have thought they could turn it into a nice little earner.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—So your solution, from what you have described, to this disadvantage relates specifically to the content, but on the basis that the ABC will have to charge for access to the service that they hope to provide. That is quite simplistic.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—The choice between subscription and advertising occurs every day. Basically, a lot of services are charged for. In pay TV that is the model. Some channels are subscription, others are advertising. By and large, there is not all that much advertising on most pay TV channels, as I understand it. So there is no difference here. If the ABC wants to get into that datacasting business and is philosophically opposed to advertising, it is a bit hard to see how it makes a quid if it does not then provide a subscription service. People like Bloomberg's charge very high subscription fees because they have high-quality product. These are niche markets certainly, but people will play a lot of money for access to that service. In the same way, if the ABC is able to generate unique content, alone or in conjunction with other players, it may well be a very high demand channel.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—There is no doubt that other providers of datacasting services in the current market are not relying necessarily on subscriptions but are offering products, in conjunction with partners, that do not provide for an up-front fee for access to it. Let us look again at ninemsn. The relationship between that service and Telstra provide that, if you have ninemsn product, you are also required to participate in that product using Telstra's Internet service provider, Big Pond.
My point is that other services, because of their opportunity to advertise, may not be subscription based. Again, given that these services are establishing now, what you are suggesting is another layer of competitive disadvantage in that the only option for the ABC to fund such a service would be to make people pay for it up-front if they want access to that content.
I agree with your points about the ABC's high standards. In fact, it is one of these outcomes that they are so under pressure in terms of funding that they have managed to develop what I would argue is the most sophisticated system and process for the production of digital content across all aspects of that organisation. I concur with any inherent structural advantages that are there, but those advantages have nothing to do with any additional revenue or support provided by your government and can be directly attributed to the creativity and innovation within that organisation. That is the only basis you have to present with respect to the ABC's ability to compete. I suggest that you need to perhaps review the Hansard afterwards but reconsider your position that you have described this morning, as I believe it structurally places the ABC in an uncompetitive position with respect to these new services.
Amendments not agreed to.
—Senator Bourne, are you intending to move Democrat amendment No. 14 on sheet 1062?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-03,"—With Democrat amendments Nos 14 to 34, I have a few questions I would like to ask of the minister, but I suspect that pretty well all of those are covered by the schedule 4 amendments that we did earlier so they would not need to be moved. I do have a few questions that I would like to ask the minister to get a few things on the record with them. Firstly, with digital television requirements, particularly for the national broadcasters, it is probably pretty obvious, and I think the minister would agree, that they may need some degree of flexibility. For instance, if it were said that the commercials should show one hour of HDTV in prime time twice a week—particularly with SBS but 
 perhaps also with the ABC—it might be better to give them the flexibility of saying so many hours in a month rather than in a week because of their buying arrangements, where they get things from and the sort of programming that they make. Is the minister prepared to look at flexibility in the review for the timing for when the national broadcasters will be required to show HDTV?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—I do not have a dogmatic view on what is appropriate, and that is why we have that review, so all of these things can be fully explored. My understanding is that the high likelihood is that the broadcasters will all want to move as quickly as possible to HDTV in prime time anyway, so you almost would not need to do it. It is really beyond prime time that you then start to wonder how much you need to encourage them. The short answer is that is what the review process is for. The national broadcasters will have every opportunity to argue for points of difference between them and the commercials in terms of any requirements for minimum levels. We certainly do not have a view against that.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-03,"—I have a couple of other issues. One amendment that I am not moving now is about captioning. I am sure that this will be provided for in the review, but I would like your agreement that you think it would be sensible to look at it. The captioning services, particularly for live events like news and sports, can be problematical. Should we be looking at whether captioning is reasonable in live news and current affairs and in live sport? Or is there a different type of captioning which you can do which is not real-time but has necessarily to be after the event at some point?
The other point I want to make on captioning was that,  particularly for SBS, much of their product already arrives with English language captioning in it. As they are a broadcaster in many different languages, I think it would be reasonable to check in the captioning section of the review whether or not all channels, in particular the SBS, should 
 be asked to caption in the English language rather than in other languages. For SBS, in particular, it will be very difficult if they are forced to caption in the language in which the programming that they are putting to air is actually being spoken.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—I think the broad principle is that we are all in favour of captioning as far as possible. There has to be some trade-off in terms of what is technically feasible to do on the run. As I understand it, you can do news because you know what the news items are in advance. There are a lot of people who are there able to convert that into screen text. But the idea of being able to effectively have an instant translation from a live feed coming in may not be practicable. The reviewer will look at all those things, starting from the premise that in the US, as I understand it, the networks have signed off to in excess of 90 per cent for captioning. If they can do it, prima facie the networks ought to be able to do it here. We go into the review wanting to see as much as possible.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

These amendments look at access to national transmission network sites. In the bill it says that you have to be provided with access by 
 the owner. We think it would be useful if it said `the owner of the site' because the owner of the site and the owner of the tower may be two different people. It is basically one that makes it more clear that anybody—a national broadcaster or a commercial broadcaster—who is broadcasting from that site should be able to gain access to the site from the person on the ground at the site. If there is somebody on the ground at the site, the person who needs access to the tower goes to the site, gets permission from the person on the ground, the owner of the site, and is then able to go in. We think that would be more useful. It may well be one that people see as six of one and a half dozen of the other. If that is the case, I do not see why we should not put it in.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—I think the answer is that the landlord cannot unreasonably withhold permission to a third party. If in a lease the landlord allows the owner or operator of the transmission tower to provide facilities and that transmission tower operator then wants to provide access to ABC or commercials, the landlord would not have the ability to block that unreasonably. You then do not need to also get the permission of the owner of the site, because the owner of the site is already prepared to allow someone to operate the transmission tower. They could not then say, `But we will not let you effectively expand your operation or finetune it to accommodate new entrants.' Our advice is that it is simply not necessary, and there is already a statutory override in place.
—Could the minister just let me know where the statutory override comes from? That would be useful.
—In this act and, indeed, in the Telecommunications Act, where you have a similar model for access, the obligation is on the owner of the transmission tower to provide access to the access seeker. That simply overrides any rights that the landlord might have to somehow veto any further access.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-03,"—I think what the minister has 
 given on the record sounds like a reasonable explanation. If any hideous court case comes up, we will rely on that and say it was all the minister's fault. After that explanation, I am prepared to withdraw those amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Until we had received that explanation, we were probably inclined to support your amendment. But now that the minister has put himself on record, we understand.
Amendments—by leave—withdrawn.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 7), after item 1, insert:
1A 	 After section 28
Insert:
28ASection 28 does not apply to the allocation of a licence under section 38A
		 The rule in section 28 does not apply to the allocation of a licence under section 38A.
Apart from that third reading or the addition to the committee report, the only matter outstanding is an amendment which I am very confident has been circulated. It is really just to pick up on an oversight to ensure that supplementary licences can still be granted, even where you impose an embargo on new entrants for regional broadcasters. So it is 325, and it simply says, `The rule in section 28 does not apply to the allocation of a licence under section 38A.' That is what that really means—that there is still the capacity to allow supplementary licences.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I will use this opportunity, Minister. I mentioned to you privately that I wanted to ask you about the issue of Imparja Television. Imparja Television is not just a terrestrial broadcaster; it is a satellite that uses satellite systems to distribute part of its signal to its customers or consumers in various parts of outback Australia. It does have a different cost structure.
Imparja has raised with my office the issue of where it fits in the great scheme of things with access to digital broadcasting, particular 
 ly in view of the fact that it is not purely a terrestrial broadcaster. You can claim that it is a terrestrial broadcaster when people are receiving the signal, but part of the signal gets to them via a satellite distribution system.
Also, because of its unique features, Imparja Television provides services to remote areas of Australia. We all know that Imparja is consistently stressed financially because of the high cost of getting its signal out to remote communities, et cetera, whether those communities are Aboriginal or mining. In my own state of South Australia, until Imparja Television turned up, remote communities in South Australia such as Coober Pedy or Leigh Creek were not able to receive any commercial television. Now they have been receiving it for over a decade or more via Imparja.
The information I am seeking from the minister is whether Imparja is covered in the grand scheme of this legislation, in particular, for digital television. Is it considered to be metropolitan television; is it considered to be in an aggregated market, a solus market, or a mixture of both; or is it considered to be in an underserviced area?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—The answer is that the government acknowledges the additional costs of regional and remote broadcasters, such as Imparja, and they will be assisted through the regional equalisation plan. The bill provides the ABA with the ability to vary the commercial conversion scheme to accommodate the special circumstances and special operational characteristics of remote licensees—for example, the recent conversion to digital technology, the use of satellite services and the large number of self-help facilities of remote licensees. The ABA will use the commercial conversion scheme as a benchmark that may be varied as necessary.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—So the fact that it partly uses a satellite system does not mean that it falls between the stools? That is the one thing I am concerned about: that it uses a satellite system to distribute the signal. I just want to make absolutely certain that accidentally we have 
 not excluded it under the act and that, with the definitions, it falls somewhere else.
I note the minister has said that the regional equalisation plan with which he will come back to the parliament can take into account special assistance that may be needed, as I am sure it will be, by Imparja as a broadcaster, including cost of conversion. But the real issue I just want to be absolutely certain about is that Imparja does not fall out of the ambit of the bill because of it partially not being a terrestrial system.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—No, it has been specifically written in. Clause 14 provides that the ABA shall have regard to the special circumstances that apply in remote licence areas.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I would follow on that point. I had the opportunity to look at the Hughes-Ericsson-Telstra partnership of Direct PC, which, Minister, obviously as you are aware, is going to be providing thousands upon thousands of farmers largely in rural Australia with an Internet based service through the government funded farm wide project. With respect to direct PC providing a service, they are capable of extending both free-to-air and pay TV signals through that infrastructure. Minister, can you describe how that particular service will fit within the definitions of the bill as they stand?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—Direct PC is not providing television services; it is principally designed to accommodate those who want to have access to the Internet in remote areas. The Hughes service is separate from direct TV, which is their other satellite delivered television service. Because these are not terrestrial services, they will not be covered by the provisions of the bill.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Minister, can I just clarify that? My understanding is that a direct PC will have a capability of delivering TV services through their infrastructure, regardless of your government's intended use of that 
 project and your funded project. So, if it is outside the scope of this bill, that means that we have digital TV being delivered via satellite spectrum that sits outside of the bill. I am concerned that, again, the issue of uncompetitive structures arises, particularly, again, when you look at some of the corporate alignments and relationships that are linked to that particular project at this point in time.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—This bill is not designed to solve the problems of the entire television or Internet industries. This bill is to do with enabling broadcasters to migrate from analog to digital, according to a reasonable timetable, and at the same time to have datacasting/Internet applications available. It does not interfere in any way with the capacity of broadcasters and others to provide services such as pay TV via satellite or MDS. If Hughes TV want to come in and use the same satellite to provide some direct TV services and some direct PC services, good on them. That is just broadening the options available to consumers. All this is doing is regulating the current broadcasting arrangements via terrestrial means.
Amendment agreed to.
—The question is that the bill, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Yesterday I sought to follow up a series of questions to the minister and was guided by the chair that I would have the opportunity to do so. Is this my opportunity to do so?
—Yes.
—Thank you. The questions I wanted to follow up relate to the general theme of my contributions throughout this debate that the convergence of technologies has a huge impact on the nature and construct of this bill. The issue I am dealing with is not so much what the bill prescribes and puts in place but indeed what it does not, and what the implications are for technological convergence as a result of that.
On Wednesday, in response to a number of questions that I put to you, Minister, about the scope or otherwise of the pending review you indicated that that review would not encompass any other datacasting upon infrastructure other than that provided in the digital spectrum. You made the statement that, with respect to this bill, you were trying to create a very clear distinction between Internet services and broadcast services. But, as we have seen throughout the committee stage of this bill, the blend and the convergence of those two services is a reality because commercial products are available to do that.
I want to ask the minister again of his government's intention to address issues of convergence in such a way that they have some relevance over the next 18 months during the period of review, for these services are indeed providing a combination of services. To not give some indication, Minister, will show that what we are dealing with is more an exercise in excluding access to a potential service as opposed to opening opportunities and encouraging the progression to a new technology, being HDTV.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—All I can say is that this little effort has very little to do with convergence. It has a lot more to do with ambit claims for making a late run to be considered as shadow minister for communications after the next election. You have not got the field to yourself. George is in here for the very same reason. I think Chris Schacht is in front at this stage. But, by all means, you are entitled in a democratic society to keep running.
—It's good to see that you concede that we are going to win the next election.
—No, I did not say that. I said this is a competition for who is going to be the shadow minister after the next election.
—I thought you were conceding that you were going to lose the election. 
—No. You run the same risk as Senator Lundy—
—Senator Alston, would you like to address the chair, then we can deal with the matter at hand.
—Madam Chair, I simply say to Senator Lundy: if you overplay your hand and your colleagues see you asking the same question in a different guise four or five times, they might actually mark you down for that. So I would be very careful about being overly repetitious.
I have told you time and again that clause 59(b) enables the convergence inquiry to deal with a whole range of other technologies. This bill is simply about terrestrial services. We can all spend as much time as we like talking about how new and exciting it is going to be in the new world. This, however, is a limited bill, and convergence will manifest itself in a variety of ways. The parliament will be required, no doubt, to address the social and other implications of those developments. But at this stage the convergence review is simply one of probably getting up to about 10. Clause 59 simply requires the review process to examine:
(b)	 whether any amendments of laws of the Commonwealth should be made in order to deal with convergence between broadcasting services and other services.
—Madam Chairman, on a point of order. I do not think there is a standing order against being patronising. But I just wonder whether or not you might speak to the minister in relation to impugning the motives of the senator for daring to ask questions.
—I am sure the minister was not meaning to do that.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I would like to take the opportunity to respond. How typical it is of the minister for irrelevance to get up and try to ignore what is a critical question in throwing that sort of rubbish back across the chamber. There are three points I would like to make in this debate, and then I will let it sit. 
First of all, the importance of this bill is in what is not contained in the bill as opposed to what is. The second point is that, with respect to high definition television, the lessons of this parliament in providing a degree of technological specificity have been well learnt. They have been learnt by Labor and they have been learnt by Liberal governments for many years. Yet we see this minister and this government prevailing with a degree of specificity that is beyond all common sense at a time when—as you can see with my emphasis on convergence through the whole debate—the industry is completely subsumed with new technologies already.
The point about high definition television is that it is one new technology for the presentation of content into people's homes. There is evidence already from the UK and other places that its popularity is not cracked up to what you have described. The usage of high definition television comes in not the actual picture that is presented but in the scope that digital television provides for multi-channelling and datacasting services. The emphasis on these glorious pictures that you will receive only if you have the funds within your household budgets to purchase the hardware on which it will be delivered becomes quite a ridiculous argument the longer it is perpetuated.
 The final point relates to the competitive environment. The degree of specificity in relation to technologies contained in this bill, the way this government has treated the ABC and the way this government is determined to blank out what is happening with new technologies on the one hand and then focus all of their attention on one glorious new technology, being high definition television, all demonstrate the incapability of the minister and the government to get a grip on what is happening with technology now. The minister's earlier comments about the respective capabilities of the providers of content competing, be they commercial or national providers, again demonstrate your ignorance with respect to what opportunities the provision of such content provides to Australia.
We know that this is one of our great strengths. We know that here lies an opportunity to perpetuate and strengthen our capability in the provision of content. Senator Bourne's amendment with respect to the CER case was a classic example of where a small window of opportunity existed for the coalition in government to enhance Australia's capability to provide such quality content.
The last issue I will raise is that of the relationships that exist within this sector. I believe it is incredibly important that people have access to a wide range of content. At the moment, I am concerned about a number of the government's policies, including the full privatisation of Telstra, your funding cuts and your active pursuance of the ABC in what seems to be a campaign to denigrate that organisation. This particular bill and your attitude of ignoring convergence as a technical reality demonstrate that you are happy for some particular providers to have established themselves as the dominant players not just in broadcasting but in new datacasting services.
I think the opportunity for Australians to fully experience these new services will be hindered by this policy of the government. Minister, when we are back here at some point in the future, perhaps on the other side of the chamber, I am sure we will go through lengthy debates about the folly of this particular course of action that you took at this point in time, and we will be forced to revisit it time and time again.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—I will respond very briefly by saying that, if Senator Lundy is seriously saying that one of the lessons to be learned is that you should not be technology specific, that is absolutely right. If this bill somehow meant that the only way in which you could move to the new digital area was via terrestrial services, the point would be very valid. But it is not doing that in any shape or form. There will be an abundance of mediums for the provision of content, as we have said. Whether they are wireless services, whether they are telephone based services, whether they are satellite services, or whether they are cable services, they are all there in 
 abundance. All that this is doing is trying to enable the current broadcasters to move to a digital era in such a way that it does not cause disruption to consumers.	 If the fact is, as you say, that digital TV turns out to be a damp squib, then there is the capacity there to extend the simulcast indefinitely. So no-one for a moment is suggesting that somehow, at the end of 10 years, you have to junk your sets; that is precisely what you tried to do with the analog phase-out of mobile phones.
—You supported that.
—Do you want to apologise first?
—No, you supported that.
—Do you want to apologise for moving it?
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—You don't?
—Order!
—There are none so blind—
—We can take our bruises together if you want to, Richard.
—It is a matter of regret that the Labor Party still has not seen the error of its ways on that matter any more than it has in its blind opposition to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. It is just extraordinary, and the punters know it. I simply say to Senator Lundy that, far from limiting people's options, if what you are suggesting is that we somehow should have been trying to regulate the way in which people receive content through a variety of other mediums, then that would be the ultimate nightmare. If you seriously think that we should be now trying to anticipate how we can put boundaries around satellite services and MDS and all the rest, it is a lunatic proposition.
A review that takes account of convergence vis-a-vis broadcasting is clearly desirable because it impacts on broadcasting, and that is what this bill is all about. If you had had your way, and if Senator Schacht's original amendments had succeeded, we would not even be looking at datacasting, multi-channelling and closed captioning.
—Yes, you would. You would have been back here within 12 months with a proper bill after a proper exposure draft.
—No, there would be no guarantee of any of that; it would have just been deleted. It would have fallen into a giant black hole, and you would have been left with a second-class digital television system, so we have avoided that little disaster. I am speechless.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—Thank you for the invitation, Minister. This is the first time since you have been a minister in this place—
—Senator Schacht, would you address the chair, please.
—In 2¼ years as a minister, this is the first time that Senator Alston has ever admitted that he is speechless. We hope that this is a growing trend in his performance as a minister—we would all be greatly relieved. Minister, I think you missed the point of what Senator Lundy was raising.
—Sure, we all did.
—You may have. The issues are whether the structure of this bill has inadvertently—to give it the best construction—given the free to air television stations a lead start in the development of access to such things as digital datacasting, or whether that has been done deliberately by the government. I think they are genuine questions, and I think they are going to be part of the debate. One of the things we are very pleased with it—
—You just supported this bill.
—You have surrendered and accepted. The point is that the intent of all of our amendments announced over two weeks ago has been accepted by the government. The main reason is that we were about ensuring that some of those issues that Senator Lundy raised would have to come back to this parliament and be debated by the parliament by resolution after open public disclosure of those review committees tabled in the parliament.
What we have been about from the beginning is ensuring that the parliament has the final say in a positive debate. The best you were offering us was that, after all the reviews, there would be a number of regulations tabled in the parliament which would be disallowable. We all know that once that happens the government of the day is in the box seat because it can say, `Take it or leave it.' It disallows the regulations and another set of marginally different regulations are then tabled. And after another month of waiting you have another disallowance resolution. In the end, by exhaustion, the government gets its way. We did not accept that process because there are too many important decisions to be taken in the national interest in this area, and there was too much uncertainty of just where you were leading or leaving the community with the introduction of digital television.
I made it clear in the second reading stage, and during earlier parts of this debate, that the government deserves to be strongly criticised for not putting this legislation out as an exposure draft for two or three months before there was even a hearing and a debate at the Senate legislative committee level. That would have been plenty of time for all those interested in this issue, whatever their conflicting interests, to consider and put forward suggestions. The government had a different agenda.
The agenda was very simple. It was to meet an arrangement with the free-to-air broadcasters—bring the bill in and give it the highest priority. It was quite clear that this bill suddenly became even more important than the appropriation bill. It was even move important than the  Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 . The word we were given was that, clearly, this bill would have the highest priority. Some people were astonished—in view of all the other pieces of legislation and a long list from the budget bills to Telstra, et cetera—that this bill, out of the blue, would be described as the most important piece of legislation to be put before the parliament in this period.
If it were so important, one would have thought that this piece of legislation would 
 have been around, out in the community, for several months, and that is something that this minister has chosen not to do. I, again, point out to the minister that his own ABA in July last year said that this legislation did not have to be introduced until October this year, not passed by October, for a start-up date a year earlier than the minister has announced.
So it is quite clear that there is a political agenda for this bill. That is accepted by everybody. Because we believe, in principle, that the introduction of digital television, HD television, is not just a new way of delivering entertainment to people but also an information system, and despite all of the problems that Senator Lundy has pointed out, the opposition accepted that the bill had to be dealt with. We are delighted that all the intent of all our amendments has been accepted—in the end, the government rolled over and accepted every one of them. That, we think, is a considerable achievement.
I do notice that, in the last couple of months since this bill was introduced, the general media and comment around the place was interest in who was lobbying whom for what interest in this bill. I, as a shadow minister in this area, have to say it is true. I, like all the others who had an interest, were lobbied by the various players from the various media interests. I do not find anything untoward about the fact that my old colleague Senator Richardson was ringing up—
—I am glad you did not say `friend'.
—Former Senator Richardson was a colleague in the Labor Party, and I have known him now for nearly 30 years. He was representing and working for PBL, and Andrew Robb, the former national secretary of the Liberal Party, was also lobbying for PBL. Mr Graeme Morris, former principal adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), was lobbying for News Limited. We also had Mr Malcolm Colless, not a former political representative down here or political staffer—apparently, he told me, he was a journalist in the press gallery in the past—lobbying. I also acknowledge—and it should be on the record, I think this should be 
 very open—a former colleague of mine, former Senator Stephen Loosely—
—A very low form of life.
—You might say that. That is your typical way of dealing with things. Former Senator Loosley, now a lawyer in Sydney, has spoken to me on behalf of News Limited on this and other matters. I have also seen representatives of Fairfax and representatives of provincial newspapers. Mr Cameron O'Reilly has spoken to me.
—Hasn't everybody?
—What I am saying, Senator Margetts, is that there was an obsession—
—This is as good as it gets.
—I am just saying that there was an obsession around the place, and a lot of people tried to say that, when you actually see somebody from one of these organisations, they are trying to get at you, they are lobbying a particular interest. That is part of the political process, and quite appropriate.
I had the Consumers Association speak to me. I had OzEmail, Michael Ward—people who gave evidence to the committee came and saw all of us individually. I actually asked my secretary to give me a list of all the people who had an appointment with me over the last three months. I am not going to take up the time of the Senate to put it on the record.
—Is it true you're charging for appointments these days?
—Of course it is not. If I did, I would declare the pecuniary interest. But the point is, Senator Alston, that you made a suggestion, in levity, I accept, that I may have been charging. You know that is absolutely ridiculous.
However, the way the government handled this bill led to enormous suspicion that this government was rolling over for a political deal. With the way it was introduced, the rush with which it was dealt, suggested that there was a political deal between the minister, with the Prime Minister as a full part of it, and the 
 existing television proprietors in Australia. That is the suggestion all over the place.
You can shake your head. If you had actually put out an exposure draft of this bill in a more timely manner, Minister, those accusations may not have had the same intent and acceptance across the community as they have now. The opposition, when it got this bill, decided its position. We listened to all the various views. We decided what our amendments would be. We are delighted the government rolled over and accepted the intent of every one of them.
—And was left speechless.
—And was left speechless, as Senator Sherry says. I am putting on the record the fact that intense lobbying went on—which was to be expected, as big interests were at stake. I think the outcome of the bill is the best we could do in view of the hurried way the government introduced it. Minister, I trust that, while you are still the minister—which may only be for a few months—you take note of the fact that in the future, when the opposition is in government and dealing with such bills, I give a commitment that we will make every endeavour to put such bills out as an exposure draft to the broad community for a period of some months.
When I was a minister, we rewrote the full Customs Act. That went out as an exposure draft for a lengthy period of time so that everybody had a chance to see what was in it and to make representations to parliamentarians if they could see ways to improve it. Out of that process, everybody—including the community—got a better bill. That is the process we should always adopt in government on this sort of legislation. An exposure draft should be put out in the community for a lengthy period.
Minister, I understand that you are going to move a motion on the adoption of the report for referral to a committee. On this motion, the reporting date is by the end of October. We were told at the estimates committee that the reporting date for the ABA's inquiry into the Blue Sky matter, as it is called, is January of next year. I am not arguing about the timetable. Because of the statutory require 
 ment in the way the ABA conducts its inquiry, will people claim that they are constrained in what they can tell a Senate committee on these issues because they have to give evidence to the ABA?
I think the ABA is conducting this inquiry partly in private. I do not know whether it is going to have public hearings. I want to make sure that, as a member of the committee you have referred it to, we do not have a hearing and find that everybody who turns up says, `Sorry, I can't say anything because the ABA hasn't completed its hearing and we can't make any comment till they do because we do not want to prejudice our position.' Some people take every opportunity to claim commercial-in-confidence, sub judice, et cetera. I want to make sure that there is no restraint on anybody giving evidence to the ERCA committee as part of this review.
Minister, when we get to the third reading I will also give my thanks on the record to a number of people who have been involved in drafting amendments and providing advice on this bill. However, while we are doing the summing up of the committee stage, I would like to get that clear.
Senator Alston interjecting—
—If you are going to put the bids in, Minister, you might be lucky, or you might actually do him in.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-03,"—The minister will be moving a third reading amendment. I draw it to the Senate's attention that I also have a third reading ammendment. There is a basic difference between the minister's third reading amendment and my third reading amendment: the minister's amendment only deals with subsection 160(d) of the Broadcasting Services Act, which is the Australian content issue which was brought up as a result of the outcome of the New Zealand court case.
I certainly agree that this is an important issue. We have had a lot of statements by the government that it will deal with this issue. Without revisiting Australia's trade regime, I am not sure what the Australian government will be able to do legislatively, but I look forward to seeing how this particular issue 
 can or may be solved. I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate that I believe—and I have said this all along—that the framework and the basis of this decision needs to be revisited.
As Senator Schacht just indicated, the bill should have been put out as an exposure draft. In reality, I think the entire bill should be revisited, with the ability to take those things into proper consideration. Whilst subsection 160(d) is an interesting element and useful to look at, I will still be moving that the references committee look at the bill and the implications of that as a whole—not just the words of the bill but what the other options could be. The legislation committee tends not to be able to look at other options.
I will be asking that the bills be referred to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee so that not only the bill can be looked at but so that the opportunity is also there to look at other options and examine what options we are cutting off by taking this particular framework. It is a pity that, while Senator Schacht talks about the government rolling over, the clear indication is that, over the last couple of days, the opposition has rolled over and allowed this framework to go through in such an unacceptable manner.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—In relation to the Greens (WA) amendment, it is pure and unadulterated grandstanding. Essentially, this very bill has already been to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee—
—For three weeks.
—Yes, for three separate hearings. Senator Margetts was entitled to be there as a participating member, but she took no interest in proceedings. She did not see the need to participate in a Senate hearing then, but now she gets up at the eleventh hour and suggests that we go through precisely the same process with pretty much the same bill. I suggest that it ought to be referred to the Greens National Policy Consultative Committee and it can spend as much time as it likes dealing with the issue.
As far as the amendment is concerned, Senator Schacht, I used the term `31 October' yesterday as shorthand. The actual wording is `the first sitting day after 31 October'. As I understand it, the ABA will have released a draft standard by 1 October, so that will be on the public record. I would expect that the ABA would be prepared to come along and cooperate with the committee. To that extent, you will have not only the formal position but, as much as you need it, the ABA's broader assessment of the issues. The revised version is required to be proclaimed by 1 January. The timetable that we have set enables us to look at what will, by then, be on the public record, as well as any other matters.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—The ABA is dealing with its witnesses and getting information for its draft outcome, which will be available to us before the committee concludes its business. That is fine; it is excellent. I am trying to ensure that we do not get someone saying, `Until the ABA completes its business, we're not making any other public comment.' I hope the ABA can indicate to people that there is not a conflict of interest in giving evidence to the parliamentary committee after the ABA has released its first draft. I have a suspicion that at some time some people will use it as an excuse not to give us evidence.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-03,"—The minister made a few comments about the Senate committee looking into this. He seemed to think that we were able to have a massive inquiry into this bill and the related issues. Those who read the transcripts and the report of the committee will see that that is obviously not the case. We had three meetings with the committee, all of which were in Canberra. It was very difficult to even begin to understand all the very technical issues and the possibilities for the future, which are endless and absolutely huge, with three committee hearings.
The chair of that committee did a very good job. She kept everybody in line very well. It was not easy with all of us on that committee, but she did it. It was very difficult. We had very little time to hear a great many people 
 who wanted to give evidence. We had very little time to consider the chairman's draft. The committee had very little time to write the chairman's draft, and the chairman had little time to consider it herself. While the committee report was very good and the staff need to be commended on it, I cannot see how you can consider it to have been a comprehensive review of this legislation. It simply was not. It could not be in that time frame.
I recall when we had the review of the subscription television legislation that the minister was the one who believed at the time from opposition that 12 weeks was far too short a time to consider such a massive change to Australian broadcasting. He was right at the time, and it is right again now. We need more time to consider everything about this. I am pleased to see that we have a bit more time with the proclamation date on the bills. I do not think it is reasonable to assume that the Senate committee has had a very comprehensive and thorough look at the issues involved in this. They are far too huge.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I put a specific question to the minister in my previous speech to which he can respond. I also emphasise and support the remarks of Senator Bourne. Someone said that this bill should be referred to a references committee. The opposition said that it was happy for it to go to a legislation committee but that it should report in late August or early September. We knew that what was in this bill was significant not just for the next year but for the next decade or more. The government insisted that it be considered and reported on so that the bill could be dealt with under its political agenda and put through before this session of parliament ended. That is why it was jammed through.
I attended every hearing. I do not disagree with Senator Bourne that, under the pressure, Senator Paterson, as chair of the committee, did quite a reasonable job. We appreciated the fact that the minister's department came along and gave a briefing about the technical aspects of the bill. It was all very useful. But we got so many people put in a one-page submission and then say, `We want to give a 
 more detailed submission on this issue, but we do not have time.' We gave people 11 days to put in a submission. We had to accept that they could put supplementary submissions in as they got a chance to read the bill and consider it for a few days.
When other people put in other submissions, we did not have an opportunity to cross-reference the submissions. This was really critical. It would have been much better for the committee—we have done this before on this committee and others; it is a most useful thing to do—to have some protagonists put their case and then have others present to argue against it. This would have enabled the senators present to make a judgment about the merits of the various arguments. We did that last year.
—Is this your definition of chaos theory?
—If you want to sound like an idiot suggesting that, that is your business. Last year, we dealt with the deregulatory bill for telecommunications. It was certainly the biggest package of bills on telecommunications. When we sat in January and February, the draft bill had been out in various forms for over two years and people still wanted to make further amendments to it. Instead of having the various protagonists come to give evidence one by one at the hearings, we put several of them together at the table. We always had Department of Communications and the Arts representatives present so that when someone from an organisation gave a view you could check with the department whether it was technically correct and legislatively possible. We could then immediately make a judgment about it.
That expedited the process of dealing with a very technical bill. When it came back in here, though it still took two weeks in the committee stage for that bill to go through the parliament, we had removed most of the argument and we had reached agreement on a sensible outcome. If we had not had that process, we would probably still be in the committee stage on the regulatory bill for telecommunications or we would have fallen over through sheer exhaustion.
My view, whether I am a minister or a shadow minister, is that that is the most sensible way to handle complex bills. It is to the advantage of the government of the day to do it this way. If you try as a government of the day to ram a bill through that is complex and has long-term implications, you will end up with a mess on your hands. What will invariably happen is that someone will be back here within six weeks demanding an amendment—oh, we've made a drafting error—and you have to re-amend the bill.
Minister, the opposition completely supports the issues that Senator Bourne has raised. I agree that there are lots of other bills that come before us that can be dealt with in a couple of Friday hearings of a legislative committee, but not this bill. The only reason that we did not get a decent time to deal with it is that suddenly it was on the government's political agenda to reach an agreement to buy favour with the television broadcasters in Australia. That was the bottom line.
From the very beginning, even back when the bill was first introduced through that brief committee hearing, the opposition prepared a policy outcome that did not please all players on all sides. You could not do that. But the other thing we did not do is play favouritism with one group of proprietors, which this bill in its initial draft by this minister was aimed at—fixing up a political arrangement and buying political favour with the television broadcasters of Australia. The government played favourites.
We have amended the bill as best we can in this process. And I have to say to Senator Margetts that the point she raised has some validity, that the bill should be referred back to a reference committee for further consideration. We made it clear last week that if any of our substantial, significant amendments had been rejected by the government, at the third reading stage we would have moved that the whole bill be referred back to the committee. We made that very clear. I think that is one reason why the government rolled over and accepted our amendments.
The intent of every one of our amendments has been achieved. The minister may try to make a little argy bargy about, `Well, we've 
 drafted them a bit differently from when we initially put them forward,' but the intent we were after we achieved 100 per cent. In terms of who put the white flag up the pole higher, we certainly did not do it; the minister had to do it. When he says that he has achieved a great victory at our expense, by comparison, he sounds a bit like General Custer when he was being scalped at Little Bighorn claiming that it was just a rearrangement of his haircut. We are delighted to have achieved those outcomes, but we are very sad that the government, for a political arrangement, had a very inappropriate parliamentary process to deal with a very important bill.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-03,"—As far as the Senate inquiry is concerned, I would certainly expect all the interested parties to put in submissions, and there will be no—
—No inhibition from the ABA.
—There is no reason why they will not be dealing with both. I certainly think they will take every opportunity to press their case, as they should.
I conclude by thanking all those who have been involved in the exercise, particularly David Quilty from my staff and Mark Hough from Senator Schacht's staff. It has been quite an exercise in trying to achieve some degree of agreement on the amendments. I have to say that in the first blush of enthusiasm we thought that that would result in a committee stage of less than hour; we are now well beyond the six-hour point. I would also like to pay tribute to the department, particularly Col Lyons. It is a very difficult bill, as we all know, to get on top of and to have people who understand every aspect of it is tremendously important from my point of view. It is not the first time that Col Lyons has been a tower of strength on this type of legislation.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-03,"—While we are saying thank you, I would like to thank, on the technical side, David Quilty from the minister's office and to particularly thank my own staff member, Mark Hough, for the work he put in. I also thank Col Lyons from the department for the 
 discussion about drafting. I also want to thank the Procedures Office's Rosemary Laing for providing a lot of advice. We all know that in opposition you do not have the same access to the same drafting resources as government, and the Procedures Office of the Senate is the office of last resort to get advice from for an opposition, and I say that not in a derogatory way. I also thank Sue Blunden for preparing the usual running sheets, which make these whole processes work pretty well.
I also thank the officers of the Democrats, Joanne and others, for their cooperation in working this through. Again, I emphasise and thank those from all the various vested interest groups who took the trouble to ring up and lobby the opposition and, as they said, claimed that they were always only motivated by altruism and the national interest in why they wanted certain things done in this bill. I am sure in the next media bill we have before us, the same processes and lobbying will take place for it. I look forward to the next round of lobbying.
From this perspective, when we next deal with this bill, I am very confident that I will be dealing with it as the minister for communications in 12 to 18 months time, and I look forward to doing that. I can assure the Senate that the parliamentary process will be not be done in the rorted way it was this time by the government.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-03,"—While we are thanking people, I would like to thank my own staffer, Joanne Yates, who I noticed nobody else mentioned, but I think in fact she probably knows more about it than everybody else concerned.
—I did mention Joanne.
—You did? Thank you very much, Senator Schacht. I would also like to thank other staffers, Mark Hough and David Quilty, who are both very knowledgeable about this. I am very grateful that all three were so reasonable in their discussions with each other. Rosemary Laing, who wrote our amendments with about five seconds notice, is also to be very much commended. Rosemary has to be one of the most efficient drafters of amendments I have ever come across in my life. I do not know how she 
 does it; she reads minds and knows exactly what you are talking about, even when you don't. I would like to thank her for being so efficient and for coming up with such terrific amendments.
Col Lyons from the department has been very helpful and very good to me. He listened to my questions when he was supposed to be listening to the minister. Finally, I would like to thank the committee secretariat who dealt with the inquiry into this legislation at the same time as they were dealing with the inquiry into the Telstra legislation. How they handled that in the one go and in such incredibly short time frames just amazes me.
I have seen the minister's promised amendment. We will keep the committee on their toes by making sure that they do not get any rest at all and get straight into looking at the Australian content rules in this legislation. I am sure they are doing other things; I think a committee reference for them is coming up directly after we conclude the consideration of this legislation. There are a lot of people to thank. This is an incredibly complex issue which I am just starting to understand. I am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.
Bill, as amended, agreed to.
—I would like to have the Greens (WA) no vote registered.
—It would be more appropriate to do so at the third reading stage.
DATACASTING CHARGE (IMPOSITION) BILL 1998

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 . Members of the public and members of the Senate might be fooled into thinking that this piece of legislation deals entirely with country of origin. Bearing in mind the title of the bill and the exposure which the bill has received, I think that would be a pretty reasonable misunderstanding. Of course, this bill is not restricted just to country of origin, though it is a very important part of it. I will return to discuss that issue at a later stage in the second reading debate.
There is something that disturbs the opposition particularly; that is, what is contained in schedule 2 of this bill, which is titled fairly innocuously `Miscellaneous Provisions'. When drafting this bill, the government has taken action which, I believe, is entirely inappropriate, deceptive and dishonest. Contained within schedule 2 is a provision inserted by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, which attempts to take action retrospectively against the MUA for the industrial action that now seems largely to be resolved.
Last night, watching the 7.30 Report, I saw that Mr Reith, despite the depth that he dragged this country down to, is entirely unrepentant and continues to peddle this absurd view that he, Mr Howard and the government, despite the documentary evidence which has been tabled in the House and provided to members of the media, knew nothing about the plans proposed to sack the work force on our wharves. I am sure there are a large number of people who believe, despite the increased productivity on the wharves, that there was real need for reform. I put that issue aside because I do not believe 
 that we can deny that improvements and productivity are advantageous.
I and the community are very concerned to see Mr Howard—the Prime Minister and supposed leader of this country—and his industrial relations minister being involved in a deceptive, dishonest and disingenuous conspiracy to sack a group of Australian workers. No matter how Mr Reith tries to demonise the work force on the wharves, the fact is that they are Australian workers who are entitled to retain their jobs and rely on the fact that the government which many of them may have elected will not enter into a conspiracy with Patrick's and a range of other people.
—I raise a point of order. I question the relevance of this speech in regard to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill.
—If you had read the bill, you would probably realise. If you listen to my speech, I will explain it to you.
—There is no point of order, but I would ask the speaker to address the issues in the bill, which I am sure she is doing.
—I am somewhat astonished that the minister, whom I understand has the conduct of this bill, does not realise that contained in schedule 2 entitled `Miscellaneous amendment' is a provision that allows the ACCC to pursue unions through the courts under the restricted trade practices section of the Trade Practices Act.
—It's a sneaky amendment.
—This is extraordinarily sneaky.
—The minister has even missed it.
—It does concern me a little that the minister does not even seem to understand that this is the effect of schedule 2 of the bill. I do not accept his lack of understanding, despite the other matters on his mind at the moment and his personal concerns. Bearing that in mind, he has failed to miss a major part of this bill.
I believe that this government is showing complete and utter disregard, not only for this house and already for the other house but also for the people of Australia. The government believes that this important provision should be snuck through under the skirts of a country of origin labelling bill. That is exactly what the government is attempting to do.
If the government believe that this debate should occur—and obviously from their ideological position they believe that—that is well and good. They are the government. They do control the legislation that is debated in this parliament and they are quite entitled to introduce a bill that has that effect. But to do it in this way, to try to disguise a fairly important industrial relations provision within a bill dealing with country of origin, I find quite extraordinary.
We will be moving an amendment to excise this portion of the bill and we ask—both in terms of the credibility of this house and the honesty of this government—that they introduce a separate bill, if they so desire, that deals with this issue and allows people to properly see what their agenda and objectives are. Certainly, they are not doing it cleanly or fairly. They are not doing it in the proper traditions of democracy, which say that we may have differences of opinion, but when we do have those differences of opinion they are debated cleanly and openly in this house, and those who have the majority will in the end win the day. This is not what they have done.
Under items 3 and 5 of this bill, subsection 87(1B) will enable the ACCC to take representative action for anti-competitive conduct. This is in addition to the already listed matters that the ACCC can already take action under, which are contained in part 4 of the Trade Practices Act. This includes the notorious secondary boycott provisions of section 45D.
This is a fundamental change in our industrial relations policy that will allow the ACCC to pursue actions against workers and unions who have engaged in industrial action. It does apply retrospectively and we have had the debate on the issue of retrospectivity over and over again in this chamber. This particular provision is almost certainly designed to 
 apply retrospectively to allow the ACCC to pursue the MUA and its supporters for action taken during the recent dispute.
Basically, this Prime Minister and industrial relations minister, who, having played the game—and, frankly, played it pretty badly—have decided that the way to win is to change the rules after the event to try to save their skins and the remnants of self-confidence that they have at the moment. I do not believe it is in the interests of Australia and it is entirely underhanded for the government to behave in this way.
I intend to leave the matter for the time being, but we will return to it. I am sure that some of my colleagues who have particular interest in industrial relations will have a few words to say. I hope that they will make this chamber understand fully the anger that we feel at the way this government has attempted to dupe the Australian population by behaving in such a dishonourable way. Bearing in mind that the bill has `country of origin' in its title, I will deal with those aspects of the bill as well. Because of my time limit, I will now turn to that section of the bill contained in schedule 1.
The opposition agrees that this legislation is an improvement on the existing arrangements for country of origin labelling. On that basis, we will not seek to prevent this legislation going through because, to date, the validity of a manufacturer's claim to country of origin has only been designated by section 52 of the Trade Practices Act, relating to misleading and deceptive conduct, and section 53, relating to misleading as to country of origin. These provisions are enforceable, as are all provisions under the Trade Practices Act, by the ACCC. Essentially it says that you cannot make a statement about a product that is false and misleading and, if you do, the ACCC can take action against you.
In fact, there is nothing contained in the legislation—besides saying you cannot be misleading—to actually allow certainty so that those people selling products know what sort of label they can put on their products and not be in breach of this particular provision. There has been quite a large amount of case law which tried to define what sort of label 
 ling as to country of origin was appropriate and would not be misleading. It has created rather a complex body of law that has become a bit of a nightmare for those people who are selling and manufacturing products in Australia.
In the period since this government was elected in March 1996—almost three years, but not quite because we are looking at an early election—this government has said that it will bring legislation into this chamber in order to rectify the situation and provide some certainty in relation to country of origin. It is interesting to note that the consumer interest coalition policy document that was distributed widely during the election stated its policy as such. It said:
Products labelled `Made in Australia' must be genuinely manufactured in this country from Australian components and ingredients.
That is a fairly straightforward and clear statement, I suppose, but I have to say that that is not really the policy that is contained in the bill that is before us.
I find it extraordinary that, in all the discussion that has gone on to date, there has been no acknowledgment by this government—and I hope the minister can stand up and honestly acknowledge there has been a shift in policy since they moved from the seats on this side of the chamber to the red seats on the other side of the chamber—that in fact the proposal contained in this bill that is before us as to country of origin is nothing like what was set out in their original policy document.
The proposal that is before us provides for two categories. Essentially, there is a category that will be known either as `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia'. That product must be 100 per cent Australian or very close to it. I think most people would say that that is a fairly reasonable form of labelling for those sorts of products. But where it becomes difficult is that the government have created a second category of `Made in Australia'. In their policy document they clearly said that products labelled `Made in Australia' must be genuinely manufactured in this country from Australian components and ingredients. That is why it is quite extraordinary to look at this bill. It actually says 
 that a product can be labelled `Made in Australia' if it is substantially transformed in Australia and is 50 per cent, by cost, Australian. That is an interesting concept—one I am sure will be interpreted ad infinitum by the courts. We have a situation where this government is putting forward a bill enabling a product that is, in fact, 50 per cent by cost a foreign product to be labelled `Made in Australia' and not be in breach of the Trade Practices Act.
It was put to us by a number of people that there is concern about this. Imagine, if you can, Minister, that you are a consumer, wandering down the grocery aisles. You pick up a product and look at it—strawberry yoghurt, say—and see that it is labelled `Made in Australia'. You would think it would quite reasonable for someone picking up such a product to assume that the milk, the strawberries and everything else contained in it were made in Australia. But, under this legislation, this product may very well be half foreign product. In fact, the strawberries contained in it or, in reverse, the milk, may come from outside Australia.
It is a concern not only of consumers who are interested in seeing some sort of honesty in labelling but also of groups in the community—for example, the primary producers who either grow strawberries or produce milk—that people can have the advantage of using the label `Made in Australia' and might be able to rely on that label to convince people to buy the product when in fact they are using foreign material. The view of most Australians is that they wish to promote Australian products and promote Australian jobs.
This is a real concern, and it is a matter that was raised in the Senate inquiry. I know that it is a matter that this government does not seem particularly concerned about. I suppose that is because, in large part, industry—apart from some specific primary producers, and I will talk about them in a moment—believe that, having waited almost three years, any sort of increased certainty is a better proposition than the sort of situation that has continued until this time.
That is why the opposition, though we are very concerned about the aspects of the bill that I have outlined, do not intend to prevent the passage of this bill. But let me tell you clearly, we will be monitoring very carefully what occurs in relation to this bill and, if the problems arise that we anticipate, we will be taking action in the future to amend this legislation to make it a bit more honest and fairer, and to have products that have the advantage of being labelled `Made in Australia' actually have a reasonable level of Australian product in them.
There is an issue I wish to speak briefly about in the few minutes I have, and that is the green and gold kangaroo, the made in Australia logo that used to be administered by the Advance Australia Foundation. A very successful and respected organisation in the community it was. It essentially administered the licensing of the logo that people were able to rely on as indicating an Australian product. In the first budget after this government was elected, the funding provided to it by the federal government was completely scrapped. It was not a huge amount of money; in the scheme of things it was paltry—$1.5 million. But, as soon as this government got in, it did not like to see money being provided to an independent body to administer the green and gold kangaroo, a scheme that was designed to enhance and improve the marketability of Australian products. As a result, that organisation went into liquidation and, though in theory the logo licence continues, any administration or promotion of that logo has gone, because the foundation no longer exists.
Having been the instrument of the destruction of the Advance Australia Foundation which promoted the green and gold kangaroo, just before an election this government suddenly decide that they too support the green and gold kangaroo, the logo created and promoted by the previous Labor government. This government have decided once again that they will embrace a very good policy that we began. How are they going to do this? They are not going to have it administered by an independent body; they are going to hand it over lock, stock and barrel to the Chamber of Commerce.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-07-03,"—The Australian Democrats welcome this bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 . In doing so, I want to thank the many people who have consulted with us on this issue about their concerns on labelling. That goes not only to this particular piece of legislation but to the fact that the government were so tardy in bringing in any legislation along these lines, despite the fact that it was one of the issues they trumpeted in their pre-election propaganda. I wonder about the coincidence, having myself introduced a bill to deal with labelling, that it was just a few weeks after that that we then saw the government legislation. I would not want to make any inference from that; I am sure it was simply a coincidence.
In thanking a lot of people who had great concerns about the issue and still have concerns about this legislation, I would like to mention particularly the Victorian Strawberry Growers Association and the Australian Strawberry Growers Association, who brought to my attention a range of products which all purported to be Australian products or made in Australia. They had no description like that but simply had an address on them which was an address of some particular office in Australia. The inference in all of those cases was that somehow or other the product which contained strawberries was a product of Australia or was made in Australia. The growers pointed out, in putting this range of products before me—I do not think I should mention the product names—that every one of those products contained Mexican strawberries. In fact, there were virtually no Australian strawberries in any of those products; they were all imported strawberries. On only one of those products was there any indication that perhaps some of the contents may not be totally Australian.
So there is a real difficulty which this legislation seeks to address. I think it is an improvement on previous legislation. We need to say to the Labor Party that this is an improvement on previous legislation that had been enacted by the previous government.
—It is almost identical.
—But it does have a lot of problems, Senator Neal. That is what I want to address, and I know you are seeking to address this by some of your amendments, as we will and as the Greens will in the amendments they bring forward. Let me also thank Harry Wallace from the Australian Owned Companies Association and congratulate him once again for the work he has done on behalf of Australians with his AusBuy guide, which the Democrats give away in their hundreds. We continually run out of them because people really want to know what is Australian and how they can buy Australian products. Harry Wallace, a successful businessman himself, set up the Australian Owned Companies Association, which he has funded himself, in order to put in people's hands a tool which they can use to identify genuine Australian products. I think that this country owes him a tremendous debt of gratitude for the work that he did, which he funded himself, in order to support Australian companies. He is a great Australian and he has done a great job.
I would like to thank the Australian Consumers Association, which made a very useful submission to the committee which inquired into the bill. I have had discussions with many farmers' organisations—particularly the South Australian Farmers Federation and the National Farmers Federation—which were concerned that the government did not seem to be moving on something they had promised and which the organisations saw as essential to their attempts to allow Australian consumers who wished to do so to buy Australian primary products.
As I have said, we introduced our own bill, and I might indicate the process that we entered into. We do not think that our ideas are so perfect that we cannot benefit from discussion with other people. I know that my bill—if we had proceeded with it—now needs amendment. It is important that legislation always goes through a process of discussion with the people most affected by it. I recommend that as a process to the government: it really is helpful to get input from other people. I indicate that my colleague Senator Meg Lees some years ago conducted a trial of 
 a Democrat proposal for labelling, and we did that through one of the food chains in South Australia.
—Foodland.
—Foodland. We discovered that consumers were enthusiastic about the proposal that we had put up because they really wanted to buy Australian made products. It was a scheme in which there was a scale A, B, C and D. A represented entirely Australian product with Australian owned companies, D represented totally imported product, while B and C were somewhere in between. I simply say that to underline that people really do want legislation which enables them to address this issue.
Let me now turn to the legislation itself. Currently, section 53 of the Trade Practices Act prohibits false or misleading representations being made about the origin of goods offered for sale in Australia. There has, however, been a good deal of trouble establishing just what constitutes false or misleading representation for the purposes of this section. The legislation before us today seeks to address that issue. It does that by establishing that a corporation making a claim about the country of origin of a particular good will not breach the Trade Practices Act where the claims it makes meet certain criteria. For example, to be able to claim that a good is the product of Australia all the ingredients contained within that good must be from Australia, and virtually all production processes must have been undertaken within Australia. That is a good piece of legislation. To be able to claim that a good was made in Australia, it will have to have been what is referred to as `substantially transformed' here in Australia and that at least 50 per cent of the cost of producing the product was incurred in Australia. That would rule out the misleading labelling of those strawberry products that I described earlier.
The Democrats are generally supportive of this legislation. We will, however, be seeking to amend the bill, and I would like to briefly outline some of the concerns we will be aiming to address. Firstly, we believe that, where a corporation makes a claim about the country of origin of any ingredients within a 
 product, that claim should be subject to the restrictions in this bill. This is in line with our belief that consumers should be given full information and not be taken for granted. I described to you the trial that we conducted in South Australia which showed that consumers were enthusiastic about a labelling process which actually enabled them to know what they were buying.
Secondly, the bill in its current form applies a 50 per cent cost test for the `Made in Australia' descriptor. The Democrats believe that this 50 per cent threshold is too low and that a 75 per cent threshold is a more appropriate level. That was the advice we took from the Victorian strawberry growers, and that would be their preference. This higher cut-off would provide a greater level of credibility to the product that has a `Made in Australia' label. It will also provide a boost to local producers, as it will encourage food manufacturers, such as yoghurt manufacturers, to use Australian soft fruit in their manufacture. I was interested to see that the Greens also have some amendments on this issue and indicate that the Democrats will consider those carefully in the committee stage.
Thirdly, we believe the regulations to this act should provide examples of what constitutes substantial transformation. Clearly this is a qualitative test and may turn out to be very difficult for people to interpret and/or enforce. We believe that the inclusion of examples in the regulations would be of great assistance to the courts, to industry and to those seeking to enforce this legislation. Fourthly, the Democrats believe that the legislation should be split into food and non-food amendments. We say this because we feel the needs of Australian food producers are different from those who manufacture non-food products. We got that distinction in debate within the hearings for the inquiry which was conducted. Quite clearly, those who were concerned about labelling of food products, such as the strawberry growers, had quite distinct concerns to those who were perhaps involved in the TCF industry. Whilst the same provisions will apply to food and non-food products, we believe it is appropri 
 ate to separate those categories within the legislation.
As a final point, I would simply like to mention the situation that many people who go into delis or fruit and vege shops are faced with: that is, a cabinetful or bins full of produce with no labels indicating where the produce is from. A good example is the leg of ham that you might see in your deli cabinet. The purchaser has no idea whether that ham is from Australian pork or has been manufactured from imported pork. Whilst the scope of the current legislation does not really allow us to address that problem, I think it is important to put the government on notice that this is an issue that the Democrats and the pork industry and many others are very concerned about. Recent election results in Queensland underline that.
Consumers have a right to know where their goods are coming from, and those who want to buy Australian should be given sufficient information to allow them to do so. The concerns I have just outlined all relate to schedule 1 of the bill.
In relation to schedule 2, I indicate now that my colleague Senator Murray will also be moving some amendments. Schedule 2 seeks to give the ACCC the power to undertake representative actions in respect of breaches of part IV of the act. Part IV, of course, deals with various restrictive trade practices, such as misuse of market power, unfair trading and secondary boycotts.
The House of Representatives committee on fair trading—the Reid committee—recommended that the ACCC be given the power to undertake representative actions, particularly in respect of section 46, that is, the misuse of market power provisions. The committee in its report argued that this power `will marginally improve small business access to justice'.
The Democrats support the general proposition of ACCC representative action powers, as recommended by the Reid committee, and broadly support the provisions in the act. But the Labor opposition has raised an important concern with these provisions, arguing that it would also give the ACCC the power to take representative action on secondary boycott 
 provisions—and Senator Neal spelt this out very well in her speech.
The Democrats position is quite clear: unless a secondary boycott involves competition issues, we do not believe that the ACCC should be involved and, in fact, cannot see why it got involved in recent industrial action. That was the longstanding policy position of the ACCC predecessor, the Trade Practices Commission, from 1977 to 1996. Not once did the Trade Practices Commission ever engage in a secondary boycott action. Indeed, the TPC made its views known to the Senate employment committee's inquiry into secondary boycotts in late 1993. Its policy stance is the following:
It is the anti-competitive class of case that the Commission as a competition authority is primarily concerned with . . . The company damage class of case without substantially lessening of competition is better left to private action.
From 1994 to 1996 this position was also reflected in law, with section 45D secondary boycotts in the Trade Practices Act restricted to boycotts involving substantial lessening of competition and other boycotts in the Industrial Relations Act. In 1996 the secondary boycott provisions were transferred back to the Trade Practices Act.
In our discussions with the ACCC and the government at the time, it was made pretty clear that the ACCC's primary interest would be in the competition class of the cases. Indeed, one would have thought the objects clause of the Trade Practices Act, which expressly refers to competition, would have restricted the ACCC's role in any case only to dealing with boycotts involving competition issues. However, over the last year, without any public announcement of a change of policy, the ACCC has changed a 20-year policy and started going after secondary boycotts that do not involve competition issues.
This, in our view, is an inappropriate use of the ACCC's scarce resources. If a company wants to use the secondary boycott provisions against a union, it should use its own money, not get public funding through an ACCC action. Our amendments will seek to reinstate in law the distinction between `competition' 
 and `non-competition' secondary boycotts, and make it clear that the person suffering the damage must instigate boycott action if there are no competition issues involved.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-03,"—This bill has a long name—it is called the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 —but it has a very short trajectory. The aim of this bill is to deceive Australian shoppers, Australian consumers. This bill aims to allow a whole polyglot of manufactured goods, including those which have ingredients principally from overseas, to have the label `Made in Australia' placed on them. This means there will be hoodwinking of the person going down supermarket aisles looking for Australian made goods because he or she wants to support Aussie made and wants to make sure that not only the manufacture has been carried out in Australia—because that supports Australian jobs—but also that the ingredients come from Australia because that supports Australian bush regions and primary producers.
But, as I say, such Australian shoppers or consumers are going to be hoodwinked because, under this legislation—which is a sleight-of-hand and a response to World Trade Organisation requirements to lower barriers—it is possible, in terms of cost, for 50 per cent of a good's manufacture to have occurred in Australia and the label `Made in Australia' to be applied.
What does this mean? Consider, for example, a jar of jam or peanut butter. As a percentage of the overall cost, the cost of its manufacture, having been carried out in Australia, is very high; yet the cost of its ingredients, the peanuts, strawberries or raspberries perhaps having been wholly imported, is very low. However, putting the label `Made in Australia' on it deceives people into thinking this is a genuine Australian product when it patently is not.
If you have two bottles of cordial on the shelves, one made out of wholly imported raspberries from Chile and the other made out of wholly domestic raspberries from Tasmania, under this legislation both bottles could have the label `Made in Australia' on them, 
 and the consumer cannot tell the difference. I believe that is a scam.
This legislation, if the impact of it were known to the wider Australian audience, would be howled down. That is not what Australian shoppers, Australian consumers, want. I have a submission from Mara Bun of the Australian Consumers Association which was presented to the Economics Legislation Committee that looked at this bill. Page 1 of that submission states:
We oppose the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998  in its current form. We believe that establishing a minimum criterion of 50% of the cost of production incurred in Australia for unqualified country of origin representations breaches the consumers right to truthful product labelling.
In simple terms, consumers could think they are buying a wholly Australian product, yet may only get half Australian. Consumers identify not only with the processing or manufacturing as an important element in a `Made in Australia' claim, but also the origin of the ingredients or components of a product. There is ample evidence to indicate this in the food arena.
Then they cite three sources. Firstly, they state:
The CSIRO's Australian Food Survey (1993) for Edgell Birdseye found that ""98% of those asked agreed that food should not be labelled ""Australian made"" unless it is both grown and processed entirely in this country.""
Secondly, the SPC funded Quadrant Survey (1994) results indicate:
. . . ""three quarters of people believe `Made in Australia' should preclude any imported ingredients.""
Thirdly, the Consumers Association state:
The ANZSFA commissioned origin labelling survey of Yann, Campbell, Hoare and Wheeler (1995) found ""The term `Made in Australia' is widely believed to be a product which is totally Australian, in terms of ingredients, processing and packaging. The majority (58%) also consider this to be the best description of the term.
That is it, pure and simple. Australians believe when they see a label `Made in Australia' or `Australian made' that it means just that. It means that not only the manufacture but also the produce which has gone to the making of the goods is domestic.
What Australians believe when they see a `Made in Australia' label is what the government says will be the case when you have a label `Product of Australia'. The problem is that no amount of advertising, certainly not the $1 million to $2 million that the government wants to follow up in its so-called education campaign—it is a re-education campaign—on the Australian people, will separate out in the Australian consumers' minds the labels `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia'. It will fail because lifelong conditioning to those two labels, which mean very much the same thing, is not going to be altered by a tiny campaign like that. That is window-dressing; that is green washing; that is trying to hoodwink the consumers. Who is it being done for? It is being done for big manufacturers who are dealing in international trade, for people who want to cross international boundaries and stick the `Made in Australia' label on their produce when it is not in large proportion made in Australia.
 It is going to mean the devaluing of the label. It is going to mean that Australians cannot believe that a product on the shelf which has `Made in Australia' on it means just that. It is going to mean that, every time you see that label, you are going to still wonder where the ingredients come from or how much of the manufacturing occurred in the United States, in New Zealand, in Indonesia or in Japan. You simply will not know.
It is my aim to rectify that situation through the Greens' amendments. We will be aiming to keep those two labels which are central to this bill so that the first one—`Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia'—does mean 100 per cent and nothing else; but the second one—`Made in Australia'—goes close to that as well. Where there is a minor component of ingredients from elsewhere, then the `Made in Australia' label stands, but there should be an indication that the ingredients came from elsewhere—in other words, quite simply, truth in advertising.
If the government cannot come up with legislation which embodies the spirit of truth in advertising, how are we to expect manufacturers or people out there in the marketplace, 
 whose profits depend on how they package goods, to have an honour system which goes to truth in advertising? What the government is doing here is dishonest; it is deceptive; and, worst of all, it is aimed at the very people it should be protecting—the Australian consumers, the Australian shoppers.
For the life of me, I cannot understand the position of the National Farmers Federation when it says, in its submission to the Economics Legislation Committee, `We want to support this legislation.' I also understand that the National Farmers Federation did not appear before this vital committee. Its submission states:
We understand that the amendments will replace the existing essential character test with a combined substantial transformation test and cost of production test—
there are three tests in that—
to ensure that only genuine Australian products can claim to be `Made in Australia'.
Well, they are wrong. The National Farmers Federation is doing the wrong thing by the farmers of this country.
Let me reiterate that, if the cost of manufacture is the major component in goods that are being manufactured in Australia and the ingredients are very minor, it is well nigh possible for the ingredients to be totally imported yet for the label to say `Made in Australia'. Let me reiterate, because this is the point of the argument against this legislation, that it is possible to have peanut butter, raspberry jam, blackcurrant cordial and orange juice—a whole range of things—where the ingredients come from overseas but the label says `Made in Australia'. That is not fair dinkum; that is not fair to the consumers, but it is not fair for our Australian farmers and producers.
The real advantage they have in this world where overseas costs can be so much lower is the fact that they are producing Australian goods, and the Australian consumers are on side and want to back them. The surveys all show that. What this legislation is doing, with the backing of the National Farmers Federation, is pulling the rug from under that. I simply do not understand it.
What about the representatives of the pork industry? My office has rung them in recent days, and the first reaction we got was, `Well, there will be concern if pork can be introduced from Canada, mixed with some Australian pork, turned into sausages and put out as Australian made sausages.' 
—They can't do that.
—`They can't do that,' says Senator Calvert.
—Pork is made out of fresh meat for a start.
—Let me tell you, Senator, that this legislation is going to enable just that sort of thing to happen. You know yourself that there is a whole range of manufactured meat products, and this legislation is going to give imported meats a distinct advantage because it is going to allow the fib to be peddled, providing that manufacturing costs are a major component here in Australia, that the goods are made up of Australian meat products when they also have imported meat products—even, potentially, a majority of imported meat products. But there is the label: `Made in Australia'.
If the consumers out there only knew that this sleight of hand is being used in this legislation, there would be somewhat of a revolt, because it is revolting legislation. I think, if the farmers knew the disadvantage that they were being given in this legislation, they would be appalled. I think also that if the farmers knew that the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, allowed this legislation through the House of Representatives without even speaking on it—let alone voting against it—they would wonder how consistent she is about the self-professed mantle of being the protector of the Australian identity. She has failed totally not only Australian consumers, but also Australian farmers and small business by allowing unfair competitiveness for imported goods to be practised through this legislation.
The outcome of this legislation is to put Australian manufacturers who do favour Australian ingredients at a distinct disadvantage. At the moment, as a result of court rulings, there is some advantage for manufac 
 turers who have the alternatives of an imported ingredient and an Australian ingredient of roughly the same price—maybe the Australian ingredient is a little more expensive—to take the Australian ingredient, because the very fact that they can therefore put `Made in Australia' on the label gives them a sales advantage.But this legislation is going to bomb that one out.
If you look at the government's own explanatory memorandum attached to this legislation, under the heading `Impact Analysis' you see which groups might be disadvantaged by product labelling. You find that the government itself knows that it is firstly the consumers `who desire accurate and useful origin information'. And there in the list—writ large—is also `primary producers'. Why? Well, it is their products that `typically embody high levels of domestic content and may therefore may be disadvantaged in relation to imports as a result of any changes to the law governing origin claims.'
What is happening here is that the government is deliberately disadvantaging those primary producers, because it is lowering the barrier, and it is going to allow more and more goods made from ingredients from overseas to be sold in Australian outlets, deceptively, as `Made in Australia'. What appalling legislation, and what an appalling process. I say again, the people out there—and there is not an Australian who is not going to be hoodwinked by false labelling once it is legitimised through this legislation—would be appalled by this legislation. Therefore, I move:
At the end of the motion, add: ""and that further consideration of the bill be postponed and be an order of the day for the first day of sitting in 1999"".
That is a very earnest amendment. I have spoken on a number of radio stations around the country in recent days, and the response has been quite extraordinary. When people learn what is built into this legislation, they are appalled. There is quite an electrifying response from consumers.
In response to what I have said, we will no doubt have Senator Parer and the government trying to say that it is not so—that really this 
 is a good deal, and that really this is going to help exporters. That is the prime aim of it—to help  some big manufacturers in their exporting because the label `Made in Australia' sells well overseas as well.
But the concern I have is that the losses are going to far outweigh the gains. By lowering the bar, we are going to devalue the currency in the market that matters most for Australian produced goods, and that is the Australian market itself, the 18 million Australians who consume every day, and the majority of them want to know that, when they see a product with `Made in Australia' on it, it is dinkum and they are not being deceived.
In the committee stage, I will be presenting further amendments to tighten up the definitions along the lines of the argument I have been putting forward. If the Greens amendments are not successful—and I hope they are—we will be supporting, in the main, the amendments from the Democrats and the Labor Party, which are weaker than the Greens amendments but certainly far better than what the government is putting forward.
The minister should hang his head in shame on this. I would like to see him go out to a consumers group and try to put this one over them. Of course he will not. He might be comfortable with some big manufacturers who want to get an advantage out of this sleight of hand, but he would not do so well at all if he were to meet with a consumers group who had been informed about what was going on here. It is appalling legislation, and I will be voting against it.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I will follow on from the comments of my colleague Senator Neal, who spoke earlier on schedule 2 and referred to the sneakiness of the government in slipping this section into the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 . I concur wholeheartedly with all her comments in that area and, as she has addressed that in fair depth, I am not going to attempt to address that today. I am going to concentrate pretty much on the issue of the labelling, which is a very difficult issue in itself, as has been said by a number of speakers here today.
The provisions of the bill set out to establish a 50 per cent plus substantially transformed test for the use of the `Made in Australia' logo, establish almost a 100 per cent test for `Produce of Australia' or `Product of Australia' or allow for ministerial discretion to apply a stricter test. That is all well and good. But, if we look at the previous regime, which came under a Labor bill, we find that there was a much tighter test than is being advocated here for the term `Made in Australia'. The now government, the then opposition, was terribly critical of what Labor was trying to do. As I understand it, at that time, it sought by way of amendment in the debate to strengthen the then bill. However, today we find that the government has put up something even weaker by its own standards.
It is interesting to look at the complexity of this debate in terms of the minority report in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report of June 1998. It outlines the complexity which, on the surface, many people are aware of, but it is the depth which they do not understand. On page 14 of the report, two cases have been referred to. In the Bush Friends case, in the decision of Davies J. and in the appeal decision of Nicholson J., it was:
. . . viewed that the term `Made in Australia' attached to the toy koala assembled in Australia almost wholly from imported materials was misleading and deceptive.
So, in that particular case referred to in the minority report that has been presented to this Senate, it was clearly identified that there is case law that shows that, even where something was assembled in Australia, almost wholly from imported materials, the labelling of it as `Made in Australia' was misleading and deceptive. Even though it had been substantially transformed, it was considered to be misleading and deceptive to call it `Made in Australia'. The second case that is cited in the minority report refers to the Email case where:
. . . the Court ruled that airconditioners could be labelled `Made in Australia' despite being constructed significantly from imported components.
So one can understand readily the confusion that lies out there in the consumer world where the courts take, on a case by case basis, a different view of this issue. Undoubtedly, as 
 is expressed in the minority report, there is dissatisfaction with this case by case determination as to what actually constitutes `Made in Australia'. The minority report goes on, quite rightly, to say:
A balance needs to be struck between the right of the consumer to have access to truthful information on labels and manufacturers and producers desire to use country of origin labelling as a marketing tool.
After all, that is what it is in terms of the producers and the marketers. It is a marketing tool. It is something by which they wish to arouse the spirit of people to support an Australian-made product. In that itself, there is nothing wrong. However, what is wrong, of course, is the abuse of such labelling and the deceptive use of such labelling. That is wrong.
So, whilst the issue is complex, as seen in that brief excerpt from the minority report, there is no doubt that the legislation that the government is presenting here today will not overcome the complexities. I have no doubt that this will see some difficulties emerging in the longer term which will need to be resolved by the courts because legislating in this area is terribly difficult indeed.
I rise to speak in this debate because I have a fair degree of working knowledge of the previous logo that was available and was recognised as indicating that something was made in Australia. My involvement came through the Advance Australia Foundation. I was a member of a Queensland committee of the Advance Australia Foundation. The interesting thing about that organisation was that its sole objective was to promote the `Made in Australia' logo, and to promote a logo that the public could recognise as having a great degree of integrity and one in which they could place their faith.
The committee itself was broad based. It was not based on political or other affiliations. It went across industry, unions, government and the community. As a matter of fact, on the committee in Queensland there were a prominent Australian cricketer, a prominent person from the girl guide movement and one from the historical movement. There was a wide range of people, but they 
 all had one purpose in mind: the promotion of the `Made in Australia' logo and the maintenance of its integrity.
One problem that the committee was constantly faced with was maintaining the integrity of that logo. There were always people on the fringes seeking to diminish the value of that logo by using some other form of terminology, either to equate to the logo or in some way to link themselves to the `Made in Australia' logo without paying the appropriate licence fees. My experience over a period of about 2½ years was that it was a successful committee. It worked well and actively in a completely bipartisan way to promote the issue throughout not only the business community through retailers but also in the rural and regional areas of Queensland.
There is no doubt in my mind that the committee was a success. It ran some very successful campaigns. However, the Advance Australia Foundation was subsequently scuttled by this government on its election to office. To see how successful the foundation was, one need only look at the 1994-95 report of the Advance Australia Foundation. This report, which was tabled in this parliament, contains all the issues that are being raised today by others participating in the debate.
On the issue of consumer research, the report says that research was conducted by the Department of Administrative Services during the year, focusing on consumer awareness of the campaign. This campaign was aimed at consumers identifying with the `Made in Australia' logo—the kangaroo. It was undertaken by Taverner Research Company in May 1996—just when the government was contemplating scuttling the Advance Australia Foundation.
The survey showed that 74 per cent of consumers buy `Australian Made' mostly or wherever possible. This figure had risen from 50 per cent in 1986. I have no doubt that that can be attributed to the work done in an honorary capacity by people in the Advance Australia Foundation. The survey also identified that 62 per cent of consumers used the `Australian Made' symbol to recognise products made in Australia. One must realise that that label then required a 75 per cent content. 
 In other words, it was not the 50 per cent plus that we are now looking at; it was 75 per cent. It was a label of integrity.
The report also said that 86 per cent of the people surveyed said that they had purchased products with the `Australian Made' symbol. The Australian people identified with it, but this government has allowed it to die. Interestingly, the report goes on to say that the Pratt Research 1994 shopping report concluded that Australian consumers are not concerned about the question of company ownership and that, as long as the product is genuinely made here, it is seen to provide jobs for Australians.
That was my experience in the Advance Australia Foundation. People saw buying an Australian product as creating Australian jobs and, therefore, it had great value. When the coalition came to office, it cut the funding for the Advance Australia Foundation. That was most unfortunate, as I said earlier. The Advance Australia Foundation report outlines in some detail the promotions undertaken by the foundation in the 1994-95 year. One promotion was an `Australian Made Month'. For three years we have not had a month that focuses Australian consumers on the need to support the purchase of goods made in Australia. We have allowed the issue of how to identify goods made in Australia to lapse.
While the government is putting up a proposal today, I believe that proposal is not strong enough to enable Australians to clearly identify what those products will be and are. The Advance Australia Foundation campaign involved the following: a two-week national TV campaign; a major supplement directed to more than 6.1 Australians in Sunday newspapers nationally; extensive regional radio advertising; a variety of promotions run in major shopping centres throughout Australia; and extensive support by Coles supermarkets, which staged a major promotion involving catalogues and in-store displays. It was not done on a penny-pinching budget; it was done with a great degree of focus. The focus was to get Australians to concentrate on buying Australian goods.
It is interesting to look at a survey that was conducted by Coles supermarkets and report 
 ed in the 1994-95 Advance Australia Foundation report. Coles commissioned a survey of 451 shoppers. The findings included that a national average of 94 per cent of grocery shoppers preferred to buy local products. So it is already established that there is a preference. It also found that 67 per cent of shoppers nationally believed that Australian food products offered better quality than imports. It also found that 71 per cent of respondents said that they would buy Australian even if the imported product was slightly better in quality and, last but not least, it said that 67 per cent would buy local products even if the equivalent product was up to 10 per cent less expensive.
That survey shows that there is a demand out there but the demand relies upon people being able to clearly identify what is an Australian product. This gets to the vexed question that is posed in this piece of legislation. How are we going to be able to successfully label a product such that it can be identified as a `Made in Australia'? The government apparently has said that it will spend $1.2 million in an advertising campaign to enable the differentiation between `Made in Australia' and `Product of Australia'.
Whilst that is good, the minority report severely questions how that will in any way go to lessening the confusion that exists out there in the community. Undoubtedly, there is a great deal of confusion in the community at large. Having said that, I do not think this legislation will resolve the problem. The issue is that consumers, tourists, manufacturers and producers want something that stands out and enables them to identify quite clearly that they are dealing with a `Made in Australia' product.
For example, tourists want to buy an Australian stuffed koala, stuffed by an Australian with Australian stuff. These people do not want to buy something that has come off the shelf in Taiwan or China and is made to look like a koala. They want to buy the real stuff. That is what it is about. They do not want a multiplicity of categories. They do not want labelling that will devalue the concept of `Made in Australia'; they want something that will enhance it. This is really about appealing 
 to people's pride in purchasing goods that are made in Australia. There is a commercial spin-off: Australian producers and manufacturers will do well, and so will the community through the jobs created. That is what this is about, and that is what it should be about. It should not be about giving access to greater profits to people who want to ride on the back of the title `Made in Australia'.
In conclusion, I want to make a brief comment on what the government is going to do with the promotion of the new logo through the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I think that is the wrong body to have control of the handling of this. It should be an independent organisation and not one which is driven by the profit motive and which will be seeking profit out of this logo. For me, it should be placed in the hands of something like the Advance Australia Foundation which is built on broad based community support, so that the community has an input into and say in the continuation of this worthwhile title, `Made in Australia'. It should not lead to confusion. In the end, the government is taking a bandaid approach which will not solve the problem.
Sitting suspended from 12.33 p.m. to 1.35 p.m.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-07-03,"—I rise as the consumer affairs spokesperson for the Australian Democrats to support some of the comments made by my colleague Senator John Woodley earlier in this debate, specifically in relation to labelling. I would like to extend some of that discussion not only to labelling but to some of the broader consumer rights issues and some of the spin-off effects of labelling, or its impact on the economy.
As Senator Woodley remarked, the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 is a belated improvement to existing law, but he also recognised that we consider there are still deficiencies within this bill. It is no secret that the issue of labelling, specifically that of Australian made products, is something on which the Democrats have campaigned long and hard for many years. As Senator Woodley pointed 
 out, the Democrats have private members' bills currently—and have had them previously—before this chamber dealing with the issues of not only labelling generally but `Product of Australia' and `Australian made' labelling.
My personal concern about labelling of goods relates to those foods and other goods that are genetically modified in some way. I make it very clear that I think it is the right of all consumers in our society to have goods, foods and other things labelled appropriately, so that consumers can make an informed choice about what they are buying, wearing, using or eating, as the case may be. I am conscious that a lot of that issue is relevant to a debate at another time and I am keen to maintain the dialogue that we have with the government on that issue.
The Democrats' concern on this issue relates not only to this government's work on its legislation but to that of the previous government. We had many concerns with legislation put forward by the Australian Labor Party and, more often than not, with the inaction on this issue. I do not pretend that this is an issue that is not complex; it is a significant issue, but it is also a hard and delicate issue. Certainly, the issue of definitions is a hard one to resolve—how we define what is Australian, whether it is made in Australia, whether it is a product of Australia, whether it is manufactured in Australia, and what component parts are Australian made.
We have worked very hard to bring this issue to the parliamentary arena, just as we are very conscious that organisations such as AusBuy, Harry Wallace and the Australian Consumers Association have worked very hard to raise these issues in debate in the wider community.
The Australian Democrats were one of the first organisations or parties to launch a scheme that looked into better labelling—not only laws but easier ways that Australians could identify Australian made products. Senator Woodley referred to the scheme which ranked products in order of their direct economic benefit to Australia and the Australian economy.
There have been private members' bills—one recently from Senator John Woodley and also one from our leader, Senator Meg Lees—dealing with the issue of labelling laws. I look back at some of her speeches when the draft amendment bill on labelling was introduced back in 1992, many years ago now, yet some of the issues are still relevant. She raised these issues in the parliament back in December 1992, during a matter of public interest debate. Some of the issues that she picked up on were products that were labelled `Product of Australia'. A good example that has been given already in this debate is that of tomatoes—the fact that tomatoes in tomato sauce are often imported but because the processing is done here, they can at the moment, under existing laws, be legitimately labelled `Product of Australia'.
I know that former Senator Robert Bell gave peanuts as an example on many occasions—the fact that we can go through many jars of peanut butter, and certainly in 1992 we could only find one brand of peanut butter that actually contained Australian peanuts. Nevertheless, all the brands were labelled `Product of Australia'. 	So we know that this is an issue that is important not only to us but to a majority of consumers, and was important long before 1992. We still seek adequate resolution of this issue. I have noted that there are improvements in this bill but we still think it has deficiencies.
In addressing some of the broader issues relating to this bill, there is the fact that what we buy affects our economy. Greater awareness through labelling of Australian made products and goods has the potential to increase investments in our country and the purchasing power of consumers. Senator Hogg in his remarks noted how a survey of consumers showed they were more likely to buy products if they were genuinely products of Australia, even if, in some cases, those costs were greater. We have no doubt that consumers are more likely to purchase those products and therefore increase investment and, presumably and hopefully, jobs in Australia as a result.
The Australian Democrats have always strongly opposed the speed with which this 
 government—and of course the former government—cut tariffs, quotas and bounties and went a long way further than our obligations under treaties such as GATT. We are still very concerned about these issues. We think that future international commitments by Australia towards globalising trade should reflect Australia's interests. This is particularly concerning for Australian manufactured products and our agricultural output. This is the primary reason why we want good country of origin labelling.
The Labor government was aided and abetted by the coalition in opposition. This led to the decimation of many jobs in Australian industries. It has also made Australian businesses and workers compete directly with overseas wages, which are significantly lower than our own, with no obligation to meet basic employment standards and with no regard to environmental protections and quality of life. I have mentioned before the fact that we measure our economy in terms of gross domestic product, which is a measure of economic activity. It gives number to the value of all final goods and services produced within this nation. In our modern societies we often work out the GDP as a measure of individual worth and wealth. My objection to this, and I think many of my Democrat colleagues' objection—certainly that of my predecessor, Senator John Woodley—is the failure of GDP as a measurement to take into account social components and the failure to indicate the quality of life.
We think we should use a range of indicators which give us measures which take quality of life into account. Among other things, this would value household work, time with the family, voluntary and community work and other non-market activities which go towards making our community more inclusive, more tolerant and much fairer. Indicators like the genuine progress indicators and the index of sustainable economic welfare are interesting and worth some consideration. For example, the GPI for Australia has stayed approximately the same since 1975, while GDP has increased significantly. This means we have more economic activity, but our 
 quality of life has not necessarily changed much.
In its publication Perspectives on progress: is life getting better?, the CSIRO clearly showed that comparisons of GDP against other indicators of life satisfaction showed increasing GDP and decreasing life satisfaction. They found economic growth only improved quality of life in some circumstances.
I am not saying we do not need economic growth; I am saying that there is more to improving our lives than just a positive GDP number. I am saying that we need to investigate some of these other factors more, and include them in our assessments of what is and what is not good policy. I am saying we need to make sure our lives are improving. For example, we should include the environment as a part of our assessment because we value biodiversity, clean air, water and space—how appropriate that the Minister for the Environment should walk into the Senate at this point. These are all directly linked to a declining environment through land clearance, development and a range of other impacts.
As a key component of globalising trade and taking these quality of life issues into account, we need to have an efficient and effective method of labelling in this country, because what we buy directly affects our economic activity, and by making choices—this is all we are talking about: ensuring that consumers are able to make an informed choice—we can support our local industries and businesses.
Australians want to buy Australian goods to help their fellow workers and to promote Australian agriculture, manufacturing and businesses. We want to know that the product has been produced with proper respect for the employment practices, health and safety, the environment and the peculiarities of Australians and others. We also want to know that a product has satisfied our Australian regulatory scheme.
We can do this best with a label that provides accurate information and gives the purchaser enough information to make an informed choice. As I have mentioned, the 
 Democrats have undertaken a number of initiatives to promote labelling. This is an issue of choice and being able to make informed choices. We want to have labels that provide us with relevant information. We welcome, for that very reason, this debate about country of origin labelling as labelling information consumers want and deserve.
Briefly, I turn to an issue that I remarked on in my earlier comments: the issue of labelling for the purposes of genetically modified foods. As a political party the Democrats have always maintained that all food derived from gene technology should be labelled as containing genetically modified material, with an identification of the food or the component of that food that has been genetically modified.
We believe, again, as part of this broad debate on labelling, that this is an important consumer issue based on a right to choose and the right to make an informed choice. If the outcomes of these types of decisions and debates are the wrong outcomes—and we know that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, ANZFA, is proposing to introduce a food standard as part of the food standards code—and if we are not ensuring that there is adequate labelling, especially of food that has been genetically modified in some way, potentially the community will be alienated about the use of things such as genetic technology.
This is particularly concerning because we increasingly have food, textiles and medicines from genetically modified organisms. Transgenic Australian cotton and soybeans are available to consumers, yet there are few regulatory regimes to address these new products. We must remember that vast amounts of money are being expended on the research and development of transgenic foods and of course there are considerable profits to be made from their sale. These are huge interests, and it is for these very reasons that we must make sure the debate is not overrun at the expense of the concerned consumer voice.
The Democrats maintain that the parliament has a role in  overseeing the development of such a regulatory scheme in which the com 
 munity can have confidence that their concerns are being heard and dealt with. I do not believe this is happening for labelling, because we are being duped by half-truths and so-called experts. What we need is an inclusive discussion that takes into account the concerns of the community, which will mean that these types of technologies are not forced on us without full recognition of both the good and the bad aspects.
To ensure that we actually get the best, we have to consider the options available to us and choose a future that recognises the invoidability of species, the dignity of individuals and the need to preserve naturally evolved life forms in their natural environments. There are bad aspects that consumers have concerns about in respect of these foods or genetically modified products.
Some of the consumer concerns I have been advised of include: the chance event of an inserted gene activating or increasing the production of a toxic or allergenic component in the food; the loss of nutritional value in the food; and the introduction of toxic or allergenic substances as a result of the insertion. Consumers have a range of concerns for health and other reasons.
Further, the possibility that there could be hundreds of thousands of genetically modified organisms in the environment will threaten our naturally evolved life forms in their natural environments. I mentioned that we have a responsibility to ensure that the cohort of presently existing organisms are maintained into the future, expressing their diversity and unique solutions to biology's challenges. These are a range of areas that have yet to be addressed as part of the broader debate about labelling. They are valid concerns for consumers, and they must be addressed.
I conclude by reiterating the Democrats' support for the minor improvements we are seeing in this bill. I add a further comment about the concerns that have been expressed in relation to the ACCC and their representative action powers. I confirm the position that Senator Woodley outlined earlier. I understand that Senator Andrew Murray will be moving an amendment to make the Democrat position clear on this matter. Unless a secon 
 dary boycott involves competition issues, we do not believe that the ACCC should be involved. That was the longstanding policy position of the ACCC's predecessor—the Trade Practices Commission—from 1977 to 1996. I understand that Senator Murray will be moving amendments that reflect our concern about the bill as it is currently outlined and also to make clear our position on this issue.
I commend the debate—not just the parliamentary debate but a broader community debate on labelling, and not just on country of origin, although I think that is fundamentally important. From a Democrat point of view, it is certainly high time for that debate. We were wondering how many private members' bills and debates we were going to have to bring on in this place before we saw some progress. Unfortunately, we did not see progress under the former government. We are not convinced that this government has gone far enough, but it is a start and a debate that we welcome and will be strongly engaged in.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I rise in this debate to address the timetable of the introduction of this legislation and matters relevant to the government's response to the concerns of pork producers with regard to labelling of imported product. I do so because there is a rather vigorous debate taking place in public as to what should occur in relation to pork producers in this country.
In the pork producers' own publication, The Pork Producer, No. 18, volume 7, July 1998, which I received today, a producer Mr Girvan is reported as saying that the federal government also promised new labelling laws in the last election, but again nothing has come of it. Of course, the government would say that this bill is the delivery of that promise.
We are talking about a period of time since March 1996. We are now in July 1998 and well over two years has elapsed. One might think that it would certainly take some time to prepare legislation to deal with this complex area and there would be a need to consult with consumers and industry bodies to 
 get the legislation right. I am sure that is what the government will claim.
On 23 March 1994 the previous Labor government introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994, which I will call the 1994 bill. That bill had substantially the same purpose as this bill. It was then subjected to inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which issued a report on that bill in June 1994. It was further subjected to inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which issued a report on 1 September 1994.
There were a number of issues that arose from the 1994 bill which several of the senators who formed part of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs suggested should be the subject of amendment. Indeed, that bill remained on the Notice Paper until the parliament was prorogued in either late January or early February 1996. There had been a great deal of work done in the preparation of the legislation and the examination of issues, and there was consultation with consumers and other parties as to the form of any appropriate legislation in this area. The election was called and, of course, the bill lapsed.
Why then does it take this government well over two years to present a new bill? This bill was debated in the House of Representatives in April this year, and, as the government clearly has the numbers there, it received passage. The debate on the bill commenced in the Senate today, that is, on 3 July 1998. This is hardly a bill that the government has given priority to. This is hardly a bill which—notwithstanding the comments this government has made to the pork industry—will be the saviour of the pork industry. I think the government and the industry knows that, notwithstanding the comments that have been made.
The first thing that should be understood about the scheme that is being introduced into Australia by this bill is that it is a voluntary scheme. It will only apply where a manufacturer or supplier chooses to represent that Australia, or in fact another country, is the 
 place of origin of the particular goods that the producer is seeking to sell.
The bill deals with how the producer or manufacturer represents those goods, as to whether they are made in, produced in or a product of Australia or another country. There are tests laid down as to whether the particular good is substantially transformed in Australia, if it is identified as made in Australia or, if 50 per cent of the costs of production are incurred in Australia, the goods can be described as `Made in Australia'.
I do not think it is in any way understating the case to say that this legislation is well and truly overdue. This is legislation—which as I indicated at the start—pork producers expected this government to have introduced well before today. This was an issue on which the government went to the people and said, `We will introduce new labelling laws.' This is an issue on which the government had a substantial amount of work already done for it by the previous government.
Yet we are now in July 1998 and only now is the bill in the Senate. It has taken this government over two years to get to this point. I do not believe that even the pork producers believe that this measure will be the saviour. It is interesting to note what they say in their publication which I received today. This is the July edition of The Pork Producer, the official publication of the Queensland Pork Producers' Organisation. Mr Brechin has submitted the following five-point rescue plan to the government:
1. Urgent provisional safeguard action for 200 days by the application of a tariff of $2 per kg on imported uncooked pigmeat pursuant to Article 6 of the GATT Agreement on Safeguards.
2. A TTQ (Temporary Tariff Quota) for four years on pigmeat imports set at 4000 tonnes at current bound rates of duty with imports thereafter at a duty of $2 per kg following industry agreed public investigation procedures by the Productivity Commission inquiry announced by the Government on June 10, 1998.
3. Urgent review of the industry's Exceptional Circumstances relief request under the Rural Adjustment Scheme.
4. Commitment by government to ongoing pigmeat industry international competitiveness, structural 
 adjustment and export development assistance over the four-year period of TTQ structural adjustment.
5. Establishment of industry/government consultative processes to restore industry and investor confidence.
The industry—certainly Queensland producers' representatives—do not see this measure as being in any way critical to the survival of the industry. Of course, it could not be, because the industry is currently in a phase where producers are—as is, I think, very accurately reported in this publication—leaving the industry, selling their herds, selling their property and their homes and getting out if they can find a market for their herds, their properties and their homes in this climate. So I would not want it to be said that this bill represents a dramatic leap forward for these primary producers or, indeed, for any primary producers in this country.
This legislation is overdue. I say that this legislation is important. I am not saying that this legislation is without flaw, but I do say that it is overdue. It should have been introduced at least within six months of the last election, given the amount of work that had already been done by the parliamentary draftspeople and by the committees of this parliament. That work was available for this government to build upon, so a bill could have been before this parliament and passed many months before this.
Having said that, I do not propose to deal with any of the technical aspects of this legislation; those aspects were well dealt with by Senator Neal and Senator Hogg before me. I also listened with interest to the comments of Senator Woodley and Senator Brown in relation to what they suggest are deficiencies in the legislation. I will be listening with interest to the debate during the committee stage of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-07-03,"—I would like to thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on this important bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 .
The rules governing origin labelling are in need of urgent reform to ensure that consum 
 ers receive accurate, useful information and that Australian producers can market their products effectively. By any standards, the government's proposals strengthen origin labelling rules. We have set a threshold for claims which is higher than any threshold set by the courts or the previous ALP bill. The consumers can have confidence in the integrity of those claims.
The issues raised by the Democrats and the Greens mainly focus on food. The government recognises that consumers may have different expectations about food and has asked the Australian New Zealand Food Authority to consider the need for additional regulation in the food sector. This is a more appropriate way to address this issue than using a general act, such as the Trade Practices Act, to set industry specific requirements.
I note the Democrats wish to have examples of what constitutes substantial transformation in regulations. The government is happy to meet this request in the compliance guidelines to be issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
I am disappointed that the Greens have sought to delay this legislation and that they have shown so little understanding of or sympathy for Australian producers. The Greens have sought to introduce impractical amendments to the bill which would prevent products made here, and recognised everywhere in the world as being Australian, being sold here as `Made in Australia'. I remind the Greens that Australian primary producers and the industry strongly support the government's bill and are very much waiting for its early passage. Small business people wishing to use the `Australian Made' logo are also waiting.
I foreshadow the government moving an amendment to the bill to address uncertainty about the application of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act to sugar marketing arrangements in Queensland.
Adopting a sensible and fair approach to origin labelling consistent with international practice will maximise the opportunities Australian consumers have to identify and buy Australian products to the benefit of local 
 jobs and investment. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-07-03,"—I rise on the adjournment this afternoon to relate some concerns regarding the administration of the Sutherland shire, an area which is well known to senators. On occasions in past adjournments I have had reason to raise issues, the most notable of which being the decision of this government to consider the Holsworthy airport as a possible site for Sydney's second airport.
As honourable senators will know, the citizens of the Sutherland shire reacted very forcefully against that proposal by the Howard coalition government and managed to change the government's mind. But on the very day in September last year when the federal government announced that it was no longer considering putting Sydney's second airport, a 24-hour international airport, at Holsworthy, within the bounds of the Sutherland shire, it announced that it proposed to locate a new 
 reactor at Lucas Heights. Senators and the public are all aware that there is a reactor located at Lucas Heights. It was constructed in 1958 and has now just about reached its use-by date. It must close down and commence decommissioning by the year 2004.
This coalition government decided, notwithstanding recommendations by a previous review conducted by Professor McKinnon, that a new reactor should be built at the Lucas Heights site. I have said before that there was little, if any, consultation with the local council. There was virtually no consultation with the residents of the shire. Rather, the government simply announced that that was where the new reactor was going to go and the people of Lucas Heights and the rest of the shire would have to put up with it.
Whilst it is conceded that, when the reactor was first built in 1958, it was considered to be remote bushland and many people have since moved into that area and have had to naturally accept that they were living within the vicinity of a nuclear reactor, that is no reason to say to them, `If you have put up with it for 50 years, you should put up with it for another 50 years.' I would venture to say that, if there was not a reactor at that site now, considered once remote but no longer remote, no government of any political persuasion in its right mind would think of putting a reactor there.
I raise this concern again this afternoon because there is a campaign being conducted by environmental groups, by citizens of all political persuasions within the Sutherland shire against the government's decision. Quite rightly, they  are entitled to put their views to the community and to their elected representatives. I might say that that campaign is being conducted in a most appropriate, responsible and peaceful manner, and involves the preparation and dissemination of much written material putting the case on behalf of those who are opposed to a reactor. ANSTO, which operates the Lucas Heights facility, has at its disposal millions of dollars to promote its case for a reactor.
I go back to where I started: the Sutherland shire council. When the decision was made last year by the Liberal-National Party 
 government to build the reactor, the Sutherland council shire president at the time, Mayor Schreiber, expressed his disgust at that decision. Within about a week he changed his mind, and the Sutherland shire council changed its longstanding policy. It has been opposed to a new reactor at Lucas Heights for many years and has raised its concerns about issues of waste storage and disposal. But the council now is under the control of the Liberal Party councillors, and it was interesting that, within a couple of weeks of the announcement, the Sutherland shire council reversed its position and said that they now support a reactor. The local state and federal members from the Liberal Party in that area have also indicated that they support another reactor being located at Lucas Heights, quite contrary to the longstanding policy position of the Sutherland shire council and other representatives of the community.
What is also of concern is that the council very recently decided to ban the availability of anti-nuclear reactor literature in the Sutherland Shire Council library. We are all aware of what happened during the war years and the Cold War: totalitarian regimes set out to ban the availability of knowledge to people—commonly called `book burning'.
But here we have a council, the Sutherland Shire Council, in the City of Sydney deciding to remove from its public communications area material available to the public putting the case against a reactor. These were publications produced, for instance, by the Sutherland Shire Environment Centre. As is the case in public libraries all over this country, community groups are given the opportunity to put material in a library and, provided it is not offensive, it is available for people to look at.
When this decision was made, complaints were lodged with the council. The general manager of the Sutherland Shire Council, in a letter to one of the Labor councillors, stated: Reference is made to your Request No: 13075 concerning the placement of `anti-nuclear reactor' material in Council libraries.
Following Council's decision of 1 December 1997 to support the Federal Government's proposal to construct a replacement reactor at Lucas Heights contingent upon a full and open comprehensive 
 EIS, the Mayor took the decision that material opposing the reactor should not be displayed at Council libraries.
This decision was based on the fact that the display of such material in Council premises would not be in line with Council's stance on the issue.
What greater example of political censorship could there be than for a council, in 1998, in what we understand to be a free and open democratic society, to take the decision to prohibit in its public libraries the availability of any material opposing a decision of the council, particularly on such a major issue—that is, whether or not there should be a nuclear reactor located within that area. How would honourable senators and members of parliament feel if the Parliamentary Library here in Canberra were only ever allowed to 
 produce and make available material that was in line with the government's position on any issue? It would be disgraceful. People have a right to have available to them the arguments put by both sides on any major issue, such as this one. I find it disgraceful that Sutherland Shire Council took this action.
In fairness, subsequently, a week ago, the council reversed its decision because of the media outcry and because of the complaints made by the Labor councillors on the council. But the original decision prohibiting the availability of such material should never have occurred, and it concerns me when our supposed democratic institutions stoop to such censorship.
