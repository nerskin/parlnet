"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-16,"—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister confirm the Prime Minister's statement of 3 September that people should `hold their judgment' as to the whereabouts of WMD in Iraq and that they should wait until the interim report by the Iraq survey group is delivered? I also refer the minister to the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 1 September, in which he said:
So all those who have wished to weigh in to this debate and make all kinds of accusations will be able to make their own judgments on the basis of an interim report.
When the interim report was produced by the Iraq survey group, the Prime Minister then said that we should wait until the full report was produced. Minister, what is the government's response to the Iraq survey group's findings? When will it be legitimate for the government to make a formal assessment of Iraq's WMD capability, or will you simply change the goalposts again?

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-16,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister stand by the statement of the Prime Minister of 7 August 2002 when he said, `Iraq does have weapons of mass destruction'? Does he also stand by the statement of the Prime Minister on 9 September 2002 that Iraq `does ... possess chemical and biological weapons'? Does the minister continue to hold the view on behalf of the government that stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons will be found in Iraq?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-10-16,"—The Iraq survey group's interim report does not and was never expected to provide a final, definitive analysis at this time of Iraq's WMD activities. Investigating sites, huge numbers of documents and other information collected by the ISG and tracing and interviewing Iraqi scientists and officials will take more time. The ISG also faces considerable obstacles, including the destruction of evidence as part of a targeted deception campaign.
But having said that, the ISG did find many material breaches of UN sanctions, including: evidence of dozens of continuing, undeclared Iraqi WMD related research and development activities, many pursued separately, so easily denied but reconstituted quickly when UN sanctions eased; deep involvement by Iraqi intelligence services in an undeclared network of laboratories suitable for chemical and biological weapons research; evidence of an extensive, targeted campaign to conceal, disperse or destroy evidence of these WMD related programs both before, during and after Operation Iraqi Freedom; indications that Saddam was firmly committed to acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities; and evidence that Iraq was committed to developing proscribed missiles and other WMD-capable delivery systems, including new evidence of programs never declared to, or discovered by, the United Nations.
This was an interim report, as it was intended to be. Obviously, as has been said, more work is necessary before a definitive and final conclusion can be reached.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-10-16,"—Of course Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein used weapons of mass destruction on his own people and on his neighbours. The whole international community, including even the Australian Labor Party, was confident that Saddam Hussein not only had weapons of mass destruction but still had weapons at the time of the invasion. The question was whether other processes should be pursued before taking the sort of proactive action that was actually taken. There was no dispute about that. That was the basis of all of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-10-16,"—My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, and relates to test case funding for the mass marketed schemes the ATO determined were in breach of tax law. In April 2001, the ATO announced that it would fund both sides of court cases to determine who was right in the disputed areas of these schemes. Can the minister inform the Senate how many taxpayer funding applications the ATO has received and how many of these applications have been funded? Can the minister also inform the Senate of the reasons the ATO has used for rejecting funding applications?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Mass Marketed Schemes</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-10-16,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister says that the ATO funded the Budplan case because it was representative of all schemes, something the ATO has also claimed. I quote from a June 2002 letter from the commissioner to a tax scheme participant:
The outcome of both the Budplan and Vincent cases confirms that finance arrangements typically used in mass marketed schemes in an attempt to artificially create tax deductions, do not succeed.
However, by April 2003, following a full bench decision against the ATO, the story changed, and I quote:
In addition, it is the Tax Office view that the decision in the Vincent case only applies to investors in Active Cattle Management and even then, each case will be decided on its own facts.
Minister, isn't the ATO being dishonest with taxpayers? Surely the tax office cannot have it both ways. Either the schemes are all the same or they are not. And, if they are not, why isn't the tax office funding those cases, for which they gave a commitment in April 2001, as was announced by Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Neill?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Mass Marketed Schemes</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-16,"—I thank Senator Murphy for the question. By way of answering the question, I want to make a few preliminary comments about how the test case funding works and how the test case panel approaches its task. The tax office runs a test case litigation program designed to provide financial assistance to taxpayers involved in litigation where the outcome is likely to resolve taxation issues that are important to the general administration of the tax system and where clarification of the issues would be in the public interest. I should stress that the program is not about funding every individual case in which a taxpayer seeks to test the commissioner's view of the law; instead, it is designed to clarify issues and to apply generally.
The program was established following a 1993 Joint Committee of Public Accounts report, and the aim is to develop legal precedent—that is, a legal decision that will serve as a general rule for future similar cases. A test case litigation panel has been set up to consider applications for funding and to recommend whether or not funding is appropriate, and that, of course, is relevant to the way in which refusals are also made. The panel consists of senior ATO officers and members of accounting and legal professions, and provides community input. Representatives from both professions provide independent reviews of the merits of cases and of the significance of issues to the community, so criteria for funding in the first place are whether or not the issue will clarify tax law in a manner beneficial to the community and whether the issue is in the public interest. Generally, the panel has recommended against funding cases involving tax schemes. In the case of mass marketed schemes, however, a key subject of the litigation was the application of the general anti-avoidance provisions, which is why it came into the criteria. 
The commissioner has advised me that, while the ATO does not generally support these schemes, it did fund participants involved in Budplan. A key reason the commissioner decided to fund that was that the litigation of these schemes was taking longer than expected. The decision to fund the case recognised that the benefits from clarifying the law were in the public interest, as the case was considered to be representative and would assist in clarifying the principles to be applied to the more than 100 other mass marketed schemes involving over 48,000 taxpayers and more than 60,000 investments. The Budplan scheme was considered by the ATO to be representative of other—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. With regard to a matter that the minister is answering about—
—There's no point of order.
—I will get to the point of order, Senator Campbell, if you mind your place.
—Order! I'm the chair; you're not.
—My point of order is that the minister has indicated that the test case funding for the mass marketed tax schemes was decided back in 1993, when in fact it was not. It was decided in 2001 and was announced by Assistant Commissioner Michael O'Neill.
—Senator, what is the point of order?
—The point or order, Mr President, is that the minister at least ought to have the facts right in this particular matter.
—There is no point of order.
—I think Senator Murphy must have misheard me, because I said it was set up as a result of the recommendation of the committee in 1993. I did not say that was when it was commenced. In any event, what I was endeavouring to do by way of comprehensively answering Senator Murphy's question was to point out that the Budplan scheme was chosen as a representative case because it had the greatest number of investors of any scheme, and the decision to fund this case followed the key recommendations, once again, of the Senate Economics Committee report into mass marketed schemes, which I know Senator Murphy took a great interest in, and recognised that the community would benefit from clarifying the operation of the law in relation to these types of schemes.
In Budplan, the court found that the deductions in relation to participation in mass market schemes were not allowable under the general deduction provisions of the tax law and, even if they had been, the general anti-avoidance provisions would apply to disallow them—that is, the legal principles in this test case established a precedent for those other taxpayers. The aim of the test case litigation program is, of course, not to provide legal finality but to develop legal precedent.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-16,"—Thank you for the supplementary question, Senator Murphy. What I in fact said was that the Budplan scheme was considered by the ATO to be representative of other mass market schemes, as it involved the greatest number of investors of any scheme. That is, in fact, what I said. As Senator Murphy would know, the whole issue to do with mass market schemes does involve very technical legal and audit questions. The current status of the five mass market investment scheme cases that have been considered by the Federal Court is that four have been appealed to the full Federal Court—in two cases, the court has confirmed the commissioner's view that the deductions are not allowable, one decision is pending, and the other case has not yet been heard—and in the fifth case, Budplan, it was confirmed that the deduction was not allowable and there was no appeal.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Mass Marketed Schemes</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,answer
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-16,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely a motion to respond to the President's statement.
I have moved for the suspension of standing orders because the matter warrants a response. I asked you, Mr President, firstly, a specific question during question time which required a yes or no answer and then an elaboration. In your response after question time you refused to give that answer. It is very important to establish here, in a parliament which is free of guns as far as parliamentary security personnel are concerned, that that is not going to be overturned next week. 
This is the parliament of Australia. This parliament has very strict security measures which protect the security of members of parliament, including prime ministers of this nation, and it is entirely adequate to protect the security of visiting heads of state as well. I am aware that there have been negotiations with the secret security agents from the United States and China about security matters in this parliament. Has the government given permission for foreign agents who are armed to be brought into the parliament? If so, that is repugnant. It is not acceptable. This is a sovereign nation. This is Australia. We have the wherewithal to protect anybody coming to our parliament and we will do so. If a decision has been made to do other than that, then the President should say so.
We have already established that the President and the Speaker, and no doubt the government, are determining security arrangements in here. Let me remind you, Mr President, of the way things go. You are the servant of this Senate. The Senate is the servant of the people. It is not the other way around. We have to be able to debate this issue on behalf of the people. That has not been allowed on this occasion. If we are going to have people coming in here with guns, acting as sheriffs in this parliament, then let us debate it. Your failure to answer says that the answer to that is, `Yes, that is what is going to happen.'
Let me tell you, Mr President, that anybody bringing a gun into this place should be stopped at the door, whether they are Chinese, American or from any other country. We do not need gun-toting people sheriffing over us in this Australian parliament. It is not acceptable. It is bad enough that you have made a decision with the government to exclude people from this parliament. You outlined an alternative arrangement for children who have been waiting for months to come here. They should be in these galleries next week. You should have turned that planning of theirs into something special. Instead of that they are being denied the opportunity to come here and they are being sent to the Old Parliament House down the hill. It is wrong—this obsequiousness, this knee trembling. We can protect those personnel who come to this parliament. We can treat them with dinkum dignity while not being obsequious. We can hold a conversation with anybody in the world on equal terms. But this subservience is not Australian. The Prime Minister has been talking today about the courage and the specialness of the Australian personality. It is not showing here and the Prime Minister is not showing it here. 
Finally, I say this: you should never allow this to happen again. It is your responsibility on occasions like this to go to the Senate to get advice and to have a debate about this. You have failed that responsibility on this occasion. This is not a parliament to be run by the executive. This is a parliament of the people of Australia. You have forgotten that, and you should not have. If we were debating this, if the opportunity were given as it should have been to this Senate, I can assure you that the Greens would not be permitting people from outside this country with guns in here. We would be permitting people to have protests under the normal circumstances outside parliament and we would have the schoolchildren in the galleries. We are not frightened like the members opposite. We have a better opinion of Australians and a more eye-to-eye opinion of other people, including leaders not elected in a democratic fashion from elsewhere around the world.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENT HOUSE: SECURITY</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1,speech

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-16,"—Mr President, the motion before the chamber concerns whether to suspend standing orders to take note of your statement after question time. I think that your statement is worth taking note of, and the debate we are having now is the mechanism for doing that. There are a few aspects to deal with. As I said this morning, I am disappointed that the public is basically excluded from the entire Parliament House during the visit of the US President. Obviously it would be impractical for the public to be in the gallery whilst the President is speaking, given the demand. Even on the occasional days for House of Representatives question time there is too much demand from people wanting to get in and not everyone can get in. I do not know why—it is the last thing I would want to do myself. But the fact is that not everybody will be able to get in. It is unfortunate that the public is going to be excluded from the entire Parliament House; it is unfortunate symbolically. I find it interesting that it is for the US President that everybody is kept out and for the Chinese President that everything proceeds as normal—except that I presume people will not be able to get into the chamber to hear his address because of security and lack of room. 
I am pleased to hear that the school visits are occurring down the road at Old Parliament House. I still think it is unfortunate that arrangements cannot be made for them to happen here. In relation to the protests outside, one of the core things in the President's statement—and I do think it needs to be noted, because aspects of Senator Brown's comments may have made it seem otherwise—is that, whether you are talking about firearms or about amplification equipment, what is being ruled here is not specific, special treatment just for the President of the US. It is using established guidelines, whether in relation to firearms or in relation to amplifications. Whilst I might not agree with those guidelines, I think the point has to be made that they are established guidelines. If we want to change those guidelines, that is how we should be going about it. I am supportive of the people who wish to voice their views outside Parliament House on Thursday—and I hope on Friday because, frankly, whatever complaints I have about the US President I would put the Chinese President a lot higher up the list in terms of human rights abuses. The Democrats will certainly be supporting those people who are making their views known.
Whilst I support the intent of Senator Brown, I want the focus to be on the real issues. I actually find this suggestion that we are somehow giving special treatment and allowing people from outside this country to tell us what to do a bit offensive. I do not think we are doing that. Not surprisingly, we have procedures in place whereby, if we have people in the place who we have authorised to carry firearms for security reasons, we do not make a song and dance about it. If you want complete openness and transparency, you may as well just provide a map telling everybody where they are going to be standing so that people who might want to do dangerous things can avoid them.
Obviously we have a responsibility when we invite someone into Parliament House to ensure their safety, but we also need to ensure the safety of everybody around them. Frankly, I would prefer to ensure that we have adequate security. I do not think it is enough just to say, `We can protect people and it will all be fine.' I do not know whether the Greens have a security force that they are able to provide for the time being that can guarantee our safety, but I think we have to recognise that we are about protecting Australians as well. I can bet you London to a brick that we have had people in this house before with firearms when security has been high enough. Obviously that is not going to be admitted, and it is not going to be admitted on this occasion either; although again I would bet London to a brick that it is going to occur.
Whilst it is not the intent of Senator Brown's comments, I find quite offensive the suggestion that they are all people from the US and we cannot protect ourselves. I think it distracts from the real issue, which is the policies of the US President—that is what this is about. This is a decision of the Presiding Officers; it is not a decision of the government. It is according to existing practices. We need to keep our eye on the ball here on what the real public debate should be about, rather than getting sidetracked about procedures that have been in place for a long time. Whilst we do not agree with them all, they are there to ensure the protection and safety not just of whoever happens to be visiting but also, equally importantly, of the many Australian people who will be in the building—not least on Friday when, thankfully, the building will be open to all Australians.

MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CUSTOMS SENATE
(Question No. 1637)
Senator Collins asked the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 17 July 2003:
With reference to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) response to Senator Collins' question on notice 58, from the additional estimates hearings of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in November 2002, in which it was indicated by the AFP that assistance was sought of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel at Post to calculate where the vessel [SIEV X] may have foundered:
(1)	What was the outcome of the RAN's investigations into calculating where the SIEV X sank.
(2)	(a) What was the information that the RAN obtained about the company believed to have owned SIEV X; and (b) can the AFP name that company.
(3)	Was the North Jakarta Harbourmaster's report of the SIEV X survivor rescue coordinates, dated 24 October 2001 (10241530 G), taken into account when the RAN made attempts to calculate where the SIEV foundered; if not, why not.
(4)	Did the AFP or any other Australian agency, whilst investigating where the SIEV X had foundered, ever interview the Harbourmaster at the Sunda Kelapa Port, North Jakarta; if so, what was the outcome of this interview; if not, why not. 
(5)	If the Harbourmaster's coordinates have not been fully investigated by the AFP, how then can the AFP claim `all avenues of enquiry have been exhausted' with regard to calculating where SIEV X foundered.
Senator Ellison—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	This is a matter for response by the Minister for Defence.
(2)	This is a matter for response by the Minister for Defence.
(3)	This is a matter for response by the Minister for Defence.
(4)	The AFP has not interviewed the Harbourmaster at the Sunda Kelapa Port, North Jakarta. The AFP is not able to advise whether Indonesian Nation Police have interviewed the Harbourmaster.
On 22 October 2001, the AFP liaison officer based in Jakarta became aware that a vessel known subsequently as SIEV X had foundered with a large loss of life. At the time of the incident the extent of loss of life was estimated at 353. The location of the incident was unknown.
On the 22 October 2001 the AFP liaison officer spoke to one of the SIEV X survivors via telephone and acquired an overview of what had occurred in respect to the founding of the SIEV X.
On 23 October 2001, the AFP liaison officer with the assistance of other Australian agencies at post in Jakarta produced a cable which outlined the current situation in respect to the SIEV X, including an estimate of where the boat foundered. At that time all avenues of enquiry available to the AFP at post were exhausted in determining the location of where the SIEV X foundered, as investigations in Indonesia are the responsibility of the Indonesian National Police.
On 23 October 2001, Indonesian National Police (INP) advised the AFP liaison officer that the INP were conducting an investigation into the sinking of the SIEV X.
The AFP has maintained an ongoing investigation into the people smuggling aspect of the SIEV X disaster.
The AFP People Smuggling Strike Team as a result of its investigations has identified a number of organisers concerning the SIEV X enterprise. The AFP has sought extradition of two principal organisers, these being, Abu Quassey and Khaled Daoed.
On 24 April 2003 Abu Quassey was deported from Indonesia to Egypt. Through the assistance of the Attorney General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs the AFP has sought to extradite Abu Quassey from Egypt. To date the Egyptian authorities have not responded to this request. The AFP has also offered assistance to Egyptian Authorities who it is understood are prosecuting Abu Quassey for offences relating to the death of passengers on board SIEV X and People Smuggling related offences. Whilst it is inappropriate to go into the detail of this assistance, I am advised that the AFP investigation has obtained evidence relevant to the prosecution of Abu Quassey and others in relation to these aspects of the SIEV X disaster.
As this process is ongoing and negotiations to provide this information to Egyptian Authorities are underway it would be inappropriate to make further comment.
As a result of AFP PSST inquiries Khaled Daoed has also been identified in relation to the SIEV X matter. His extradition is currently being sought from Sweden. As such it would be inappropriate to comment further on this matter.
The AFP investigation into the SIEV X disaster has been extensive and is ongoing.
Witnesses have been identified, located and interviewed in a number of countries and statements have been taken with the assistance of foreign police services.
Organisers of the SIEV X matter have been identified with a view to prosecution, be that by the AFP through extradition or in cooperation with the jurisdiction in which they are located. 
The AFP PSST continues to work co-operatively with the INP, who rightfully have jurisdiction in Indonesia, to seek out witnesses relevant to all SIEV X investigations. The timing and decision on when such interviews takes place, lays appropriately with the investigators be they the INP or the PSST. This matter is ongoing and is achieving tangible results. It involves sensitive international relationships and inquiries and assistance from foreign police. As these investigations are ongoing it is inappropriate to make further comment.
(5)	The AFP Jakarta Post has confirmed that the INP has made contact with the Harbour Administrator (a separate entity to the Harbour Master). The INP is still attempting to locate the Harbour Master but have not yet located him.
The AFP is not privy to information which either corroborates or discounts the coordinates allegedly reported by the Harbourmaster. The INP advised the AFP on 23 October 2001, that the INP were conducting an investigation into the sinking of the SIEV X. Whether the INP has interviewed the Harbourmaster is a matter for the INP.
On 23 October 2001, the AFP members used information obtained from the INP and other sources, together with knowledge based on experience with previous people smuggling activities, to develop estimates of the characteristics of the SIEV X vessel. AFP members then sought the assistance of Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to calculate where the vessel may have foundered. I believe information regarding RAN assistance has been provided to Senator Collins by the Minister for Defence in his answer to the question taken on notice on 17 July 2003.
Based on the information available at the time, all avenues of inquiry had been fully exhausted with regards to calculating where SIEV X foundered.
The AFP investigation into the people smuggling syndicate behind SIEV X is ongoing. It is not appropriate for the detail of these inquiries be provided as this is an ongoing operation.
I am advised that the INP has, and continues to assist the AFP People Smuggling Strike Team. Any decision to interview Indonesian Citizens rightfully lays with the Indonesian National Police. The AFP People Smuggling Strike Team will continue to work cooperatively with the INP in relation to this investigation in order to identify and interview potential witnesses.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 1637</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-10-16,"—I have some further information in response to a question asked of me yesterday by Senator Bartlett concerning Natural Heritage Trust funds. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following additional information. It is correct that Natural Heritage Trust funds are provided to the Department of the Environment and Heritage for the purposes of administering the trust. These funds also include payments for the conduct and attendance of meetings by the Threatened Species Advisory Committee. This is consistent with the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997 and the goal of the Natural Heritage Trust, which is to stimulate activities in the national interest to achieve the conservation, sustainable use and repair of Australia's natural environment. 
The commitment to spend $350 million of the Natural Heritage Trust directly on measures to improve water quality is over the five-year life of the trust. To date, more than $20 million of the Natural Heritage Trust has been identified as being spent in accordance with this commitment. Much of the regional component of the trust is currently establishing the arrangements for regional plans and community engagement. Substantial acceleration in expenditure to meet the commitment will occur in the near future. The key working guideline being used by departments to provide advice to the government is the contribution of an activity to an improved water quality output in accordance with the National Water Quality Management Strategy, whether it is an on-ground project or the development of management planning and monitoring arrangements to improve water quality.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Natural Heritage Trust</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,speech

"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-16,"—by leave—I will make a short statement about the program for this afternoon. I thank honourable senators for that—I know that leave is a precious thing at the moment. Senator Nettle inquired during question time about how we are going to handle the balance of the afternoon. The balance of the afternoon is ostensibly time for private senators' business or business of the Senate. We have negotiated and agreed amongst everybody—and I think it was in Senator Nettle's interest—that we go back to the unfinished program that was interrupted at 10.30 this morning when we adjourned for the Bali commemoration ceremony.
We have a number of items before us. We have to finish what I colloquially call `housekeeping', which is the formal motions, which I know Senator Nettle has got an interest in. We also need to deal with an important motion of Senator Bartlett's in relation to a proposal for the Senate to sit next Thursday and Friday to do government business. We also need to have a matter of public importance debate and also a general business debate, and we have to do it all in the next few short hours. So I would respectfully suggest to Senator Nettle that, in amongst all of that, if we actually want to get to those general business notices of motion, it might be better to defer this debate, because you simply will not have time to do everything else.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-10-16,"—I seek leave to take note of the statement that Senator Abetz gave yesterday in response to the Senate's order for the production of documents and to make a short statement of about three minutes.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
The motion that was passed by the Senate on 9 October called on the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing and also the Minister representing the Minister for Trade to lay on the table documents relating to the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement and the regulation of labelling of genetically modified foods. To date, an answer has been received—and I will get onto the quality of the answer—by the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing. To date, no answer has been received by the Minister representing the Minister for Trade. 
The Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing presented a number of documents that related to correspondence Commonwealth government departments have had with the public in relation to their concerns on this issue. The detail of the order for the production of documents passed by the Senate asked specifically for documents relating to correspondence between government departments, between state and Commonwealth departments and between Australia and the United States. The order was not confined to these forms of correspondence, yet none of these forms of correspondence have been provided. I think there are significant questions that need to be asked about some additional comments about what documents would not be provided to the Senate. The response given yesterday in the parliament stated:
With respect to a number of other documents relevant to the order, I inform the Senate that the government considers that it would not be in the public interest to disclose those on the grounds that it could damage international relations. 
This is not dissimilar to a response which was given to an earlier Senate order for the production of documents in relation to the US-Australia free trade agreement and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We have not had any adequate response from the government as to why it is not in the public interest for our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and, in this instance, our GE labelling laws, to be protected, since clearly they are in the public interest. Just last weekend in the West Australian newspaper, the results of a poll carried out by the Australian Consumers Association showed that 84 per cent of Australians were worried about eating GE products and 94 per cent of Australians wanted comprehensive labelling of GM foods. So it is clear that it is a matter of concern to the public, and yet the government believe that it is not of such concern to the public that they need to table such documents in the Senate.
We clearly cannot assume that there is no internal communication, since the GE producers in the United States have made it quite clear that they perceive GE labelling as a barrier to trade and that Australia, through Minister Vaile, have joined with the United States in an action against the European Union against their GE labelling laws in the WTO disputes mechanism. Quite clearly we need to be concerned about the government's position, and yet they are not prepared to put documents on the table. In the United States, the negotiations for a free trade agreement need to be passed by Congress—
—Senator Nettle, your three minutes is up. You assured the Senate that it would take three minutes, and we took you on your word. Thank you, Senator Nettle.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-10-16,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer provided by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to question on notice no. 1637 relating to the vessel now identified as SIEV X.
In relation to the answers to these questions on the Senate NoticePaper that are some 30 days outstanding, I would like to note that these answers and the answers provided previously by Senator Hill in relation to questions to the Department of Defence, do not go to an adequate response to the critical issue about the SIEVX that remains a matter of public concern. The issue is the failure to demonstrate an adequate response to the vessel's foundering and the concern that, from government agencies, this is more about protecting the Prime Minister's claim that the ship sank in Indonesian territory and was, as a consequence, not a responsibility for the Australian government, when several other indicators seem to indicate that it was actually in international waters and it should have been more to our concern.
There were two elements of this answer that I wish to highlight in relation to the AFP. The first is that it asserts in point (5):
Based on the information available at the time, all avenues of inquiry had been fully exhausted with regards to calculating where SIEV X foundered.
But it seems to contradict itself earlier in point (5), where it says:
The AFP is not privy to information which either corroborates or discounts the coordinates allegedly reported by the Harbourmaster. 
And even earlier in point (5), it says:
The AFP Jakarta Post has confirmed that the INP has made contact with the Harbour Administrator (a separate entity to the Harbour Master). The INP is still attempting to locate the Harbour Master but have not yet located him.
This is simply not good enough. More than 350 lives were lost when this vessel foundered, and for there to be detailed coordinates in relation to the vessel that saved the remaining people from this vessel and for them to never have been attempted to have been corroborated—and for us to be told now so far from the time of the sinking that nobody has sought to contact the harbour master to corroborate or discount those coordinates—is outrageous.
What makes it more outrageous with respect to the Australian agencies is that we were told by Defence, during hearings of the inquiry into a certain maritime incident, that these coordinates could be discounted. Now we discover, from further information from Defence and from the AFP that they have, to quote the answer today, no basis to either corroborate or discount those coordinates. But then it indicates neglect. No-one has sought that corroboration other than to say, `IMP might be looking into it, but they have never found him and that's none of our business.' It is simply not good enough.
I note the Greens motion yesterday and the Democrats motion today, again in relation to the SIEVX. This issue will not go away. With respect to the answers that have been provided by the AFP and the Department of Defence, we will keep raising questions through Senate estimates about why we never sought to understand what had happened to these souls. It is outrageous that in this climate we do know the full details of all of the poor souls who suffered in Bali but in relation to this tragedy we still cannot get a list of those who drowned. There are some reasonable explanations for some issues there, but that is another example of neglect and lack of respect for people in relation to how this was managed. I will seek to make further comments on these issues at another time.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Collins today relating to funding for child care.
On another serious note, next week is Children's Week. Reflecting that at a national, state and local level there is quite a broad variety of activities in order to focus on Australia's children and how well we look after their wellbeing, it was very disappointing that the answer given by Senator Patterson today demonstrates that we can only see ongoing uncertainty for this sector. As I outlined in my question, today the minister finally made available the final report of the broadband consultations in relation to child-care support and redevelopment. Whilst Minister Anthony—and today Senator Patterson—has accused the opposition of being pre-emptive, the sector of being pre-emptive and the opposition of scaremongering, we now clearly can say that this report commissioned by the government does recommend abolishing the operational subsidy for family day care providers. It is now clear in writing. There has been talk in the sector for a long time that drafts were referring to this but, no, the minister was saying that we were being pre-emptive and we were scaremongering. But it is now released; it is out there. And now we await the government's response.
What do we know about the government's response? The government told the family day care providers recently that they can wait until Christmas. So we know that the government is looking at responding now immediately before Christmas. The cynic in me says, `At Christmas, when it is quiet, when families are focusing on Christmas activities, they are going to get a Christmas present from the government.' Let us hope that that Christmas present from the government is not going to compromise family day care services. Certainly in this report there are many concerns about simply following the recommendations that are made. But there are some aspects of the report that also leave you with concerns about the process itself.
For instance, the consultant Community Link have advised that further work is required to model the impact of their recommendations, which they say is a matter for the Commonwealth department and beyond the brief of Community Link. The problem is that the original tender had an optional proposal that that modelling actually occur as part of the consultancy. It seems obvious that Community Link decided not to do that modelling, and have now decided to say, `We're going to recommend this path and we're pretty confident it's the path that the government wanted.' But at the same time they are going to say, `Well, actually, we need to take a step back and model it a bit more carefully and see what the consequences might be.' In terms of process, this is simply not good enough for the sector.
Let me describe what is happening in the sector at the moment. Some of the agencies operating services have had their contracts extended until December. Now extensions have occurred until June next year. But nobody knows what framework they are going to be operating under next year. This uncertainty is fuelling and contributing to the chronic shortage of child-care places, because if there is no certainty then nobody is going to establish the new services and the new places that are desperately needed. In fact, it gets worse because in this climate of uncertainty we have several local councils—many of whom invest significant amounts in the family day care services that they sponsor—saying, `If the operational subsidy goes, so do we.' 
What happened to the Treasurer's commitment to maintaining social capital? What happens when processes that have been bungled, that have taken much longer than they should have and that have been mismanaged affect the community sector to the extent that those parties that are making significant contributions now say, `We will go.' I am aware of some services who want to discontinue family day care but cannot find alternative sponsors. And they are not going to find alternative sponsors between now and Christmas or between now and June—if ever. This is also in the context, as I indicated in my question, where child-care places are capped by this government.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I rise to take note of the answer from Senator Patterson and, like my colleague Jacinta Collins, I want to express my grave concern about what is happening to child care under this government. We know that there is a chronic shortage of child-care places in this country, and that has particularly been the case since this government came to office in 1996. This government has withdrawn from any national planning role for long day care places. It is even harder to get the numbers to meet the demand, particularly in long day care places. These are numbers that this government does not keep and does not make any attempt to try to get a handle on. The government has placed a cap on family day care and outside school hours care, when figures around the country have shown us that demand has increased. In fact, in family day care, there is a national unmet demand of more than 2,500 places. In New South Wales the number is 663 and in Queensland it is a staggering 1,201.
In outside school hours care, even though this government would seek to blame the states for the crisis, it is not in fact their fault. The government's cap on funded places in outside school hours care has contributed to the shortage of 28,000 places in that sector. In the Northern Territory, for example, that has given us a shortage of nearly 350 places. In the Northern Territory there are 30 places in demand for before school hours care, 160 places for after school hours care and 160 places for vacation care. That is only in the Darwin CBD, in the northern suburbs and in Palmerston. But in places like New South Wales, there is a demand for outside school hours care of nearly 11,749 places. There are over 28,000 places nationally needed for outside school hours care.
Let us have a look specifically at what has happened with family day care, or what the government is probably intending will happen. We know that if the government decides to take up the recommendations in the report on child-care support redevelopment—a review of the broadband activities under child care—which has finally been released by this government, family day care providers would be set to lose $54 million in operational subsidy. That is money that would affect more than 126,000 children in this country and more than 60,000 Australian families who use these crucial services.
It was interesting today to note, though, that the minister in her response said that family day care is highly valued. That we can agree on. But the report was not about funding cuts; it was about improved services. The minister failed to rule out that funding may not be rearranged within the sector—within the broadband categories—and that family day care providers and services will not have money taken off them so that the money can be reallocated to other sectors within that category. It might not be about funding cuts, but the minister failed to rule out that it might be about reallocating that funding, which, in effect, would lead to a funding cut for family day care. Back in November 2002 the government announced a review of the way in which the $184 million is allocated to children's services across Australia. Almost one-third of the money is to support auspice bodies, the largest being local government, which actually sponsors family day care services in Australia. 
This government will only guarantee funding for these child-care support services for six months, and that is, of course, subject to the outcome of this review. We now say to this government: you have undertaken this review, the report has been released, you now need to look at it and clearly make your recommendations for this sector. You need to be able to stand in this place and say to us categorically that family day care will not experience a funding cut and that family day care will not have to look at decreasing its services. This government ought to ensure that the provision of child care in this country keeps up with the pattern of paid work participation and that family day care is protected.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I also rise to take note of the answers by Senator Patterson to the questions asked by Senator Jacinta Collins in relation to family day care. The minister was asked twice, very clearly and very simply, whether or not she was in a position to guarantee that there would be no cuts to family day care. Twice she avoided answering that question. She went through a Yes, Minister response—she went everywhere but back to that very point. That goes to the issue at the heart of this debate today: whether there is going to be adequate funding to get this industry out of the crisis that it is in. I know the minister will say, `I don't like you to use the word “crisis”; it is alarming.' But this is the same minister who, as the Minister for Health and Ageing, time after time avoided recognising that there was a crisis in the health portfolio.
I have to hand it to you, Minister—you got up there very stoically, defending the position and time after time denying the reality. What happened as soon as you were replaced in that ministry? What did the new minister do? He admitted that there was a crisis in the health portfolio. We are hearing today, again, from this minister that there is no crisis in the funding of family day care. The reality is that it is there. Who can confirm that it is there? The Prime Minister himself can. I refer the Senate to an opinion piece penned by the Prime Minister himself in the Australian of Monday, 6 October 2003. He stated:
Access to quality, affordable childcare is essential for parents trying to balance work and family responsibilities. It is not only important to working parents. Many parents who are caring for children at home intend to return to paid work in the future and want to know that they will have choices about childcare arrangements.
I and the Labor Party could not agree with that more. He goes on in the opinion piece that he penned:
The childcare system is not perfect. In some local areas and in some service types, shortages do exist.
In a classic understatement from the Prime Minister, he is recognising the problem that the minister is failing to recognise. That is a concern to me.
We have a Prime Minister who accepts that there are serious problems in the child-care sector yet we have a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the other place with a final report relating to the broadband review, undertaken by the Department of Family and Community Services into the issue of how better to direct $184 million in child-care funding, and there has been no economic modelling on the options. Then we have the Minister for Family and Community Services in this place fumbling and bumbling her way through, shirking any responsibility on this issue and avoiding tackling it or giving any substantial answers to questions regarding it. She has clearly avoided answering the direct questions on whether or not they will guarantee the continued funding. 
Working families in this country are being absolutely dudded by this Howard government and its supposedly working family friendly policies. They are an absolute sham. The broadband review itself has found a shortage of over 28,000 outside school-hour care places and 2,500 family day care places. It is obvious to me and to everybody that urgent action is needed to address these issues.
—Do you have a policy?
—Yes. You always fail to recognise that you are in government and you have an obligation to govern on behalf of Australians. Every time there is a crisis and every time a difficult position is put to you, all you want to do is talk about what might have happened under a previous government or the government before that, or about what someone else might have done. But you never, ever want to take responsibility for what is going on right now. You never want to take responsibility for your actions over the last 7½ years. You just want to sidestep that and avoid it. It is a disgrace. People will work out that you are the government and you have a responsibility to deliver in this area. Time after time you have failed the test.
We can see how you failed it, because three opposition speakers have spoken in a row. You have not even got up to defend your position at this point in time. That is an absolutely disgraceful abandonment in the battlefield in that respect.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I draw to your attention that the government surrendered its speakers this afternoon to assist the business of the Senate and to enable the opposition to move some of the motions that they want to move this afternoon. You have a general business notice of motion, Deputy President, and you have a matter of public importance motion before the chamber. The government surrendered the right to two speakers in taking note to enable the business of the opposition to proceed.
—There is no point of order, Senator Ferris. You know that. I am chairing the chamber; I am not responsible for the management of the chamber. That is in the hands of the whips and the managers of government business and opposition business.
—I thank Senator Ferris for using the word `surrender' a number of times because that is exactly what the government have done on this issue. They have certainly surrendered the ground. (Time expired)
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I used the word `surrender' in relation to our speakers and not in relation to the content of Senator Marshall's comments.
—Again, there is no point of order.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-10-16,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Bartlett moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to the reconsideration of general business notice of motion no. 641.
Bearing in mind that this motion was inadvertently voted on earlier today, I did understand that the Labor Party wanted to make a short statement. The Democrats understand that this motion has the support of a number of senators, including Senator Brian Harradine, the Greens senators and, of course, the Australian Democrats. That is because this motion is an important motion, and I argue that standing orders should be suspended because it is an urgent one. We have a time constraint within which we should deal with this motion. The motion raises specific concerns regarding human rights in China. It has been moved specifically at this time by the Australian Democrats in the lead-up to President Hu's visit next week. The President's visit next week presents the Senate with what I think is an exceptional opportunity to raise these issues and, indeed, challenge the Chinese government on its human rights record. If we do not have a vote on this motion, I do not think we are going to have an opportunity to do so before the President's visit.
I do not think for a moment that there is a senator in this place who does not have concerns about the human rights record of China. I think we are all agreed on that. I was hoping we could all be agreed on my expression of that concern in the motion before us today. This motion gives us an opportunity to encourage the Chinese government to address some of these outstanding human rights issues. It is not only the Democrats who believe that this motion is urgent and should be moved; there are many Australians who have implored us to use the President's visit to Australia as a way of highlighting these issues.
In recent weeks I—and, I am sure, other senators in this place—have met with the Dalai Lama representative in Australia and with a number of Falun Gong practitioners. They are very anxious to see that we all seize this opportunity afforded by the President's visit. We have all had emails, faxes, letters and phone calls to our offices here and to our electorate offices asking us to highlight these issues. The Democrats have responded to this concern. Some of those people—some of these Australians—have relatives in China who are being persecuted on the basis of their beliefs. These are our fellow Australians who fear for the safety of their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, partners et cetera. This motion in part is a result of those many representations that have been made to me and others, and it is partly on behalf of those people that I ask for this suspension of standing orders today and for the motion to be taken as a formal motion. 
Even last night—and I am sure my office was not alone—my office received desperate phone calls inquiring as to whether or not this would be dealt with today and, more importantly, asking if it would be supported by a majority of the Senate today. Some people were concerned that the Labor Party was not going to support this motion. Obviously, we will hear shortly in the context of this debate the reasons why. Those people have vowed to continue to work hard to ensure that all members of parliament understand the vital importance of this motion and related motions we have been dealing with on this issue. I suspect many of you have been contacted.
Any objection raised to this motion being taken as a formal motion indicates that there is only qualified support if not outright objection to this motion. I look forward to finding out exactly why that is. The Democrats accept that it is a comprehensive and, in some respects, strongly worded motion. We acknowledge that, but we would point out that the strongest paragraphs in this motion of mine are actually modelled on a resolution passed by the United States congress. The strongest wording in this motion is a reflection of what was passed by the US congress. I find it a little bizarre that, for example, yesterday the opposition was prepared to support a motion that expressed concern over human rights issues in the USA but today, from what I can see, it is not prepared to support a motion expressing similar concerns in relation to China—particularly when the US itself has been a vocal critic of some of those practices in China. Nevertheless, let us bring on the motion, let us have the debate and let us vote accordingly. However, if the Senate do not take this opportunity to take this motion formally at this time, I think we will have missed a historic opportunity.

It goes to matters that many Australians—including practitioners of Falun Gong in Australia and the Tibetan community in this country, who have an enormous support base amongst Australians at large—are concerned about, including working rights, cultural rights, the rights of disabled people, the rights of women and the rights of prisoners. This motion goes to exactly the sorts of things we should be debating and discussing with President Hu when he comes to this country. We absolutely strongly support, in the fullest sense, the debate of this motion. I congratulate Senator Stott Despoja on bringing it forward and expect that, whatever the outcome, it will be forwarded to the Chinese embassy and President Hu for a response.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS: CHINA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I thank the Senate and Senator Stott Despoja, particularly, for allowing us to have this—albeit brief—opportunity to address this very important issue. I can say to the Senate that the opposition support upholding human rights internationally, as every senator in this place knows. We call on governments around the world to uphold international declarations and covenants covering human rights, and our call to China is no different.
Labor have a very long and proud history with China. It was Gough Whitlam who established diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China 30 years ago. We have also had a very longstanding history of not shying away from expressing our differences with the Chinese government over human rights in their country. We have never shied away from that and we never will shy away from it. While the opposition acknowledge the strides that have been made by the Chinese government in recent years in improving the social conditions of the people who live in China, we remain concerned about reports which indicate that human rights abuses continue to occur in China—including forced labour and the execution of prisoners. 
So, yes, there are problems and, yes, there are concerns, but the opposition do not want to support this motion in the form that is before the chamber. In our view this motion is too broad to consider seriously without a fully-fledged and proper debate. Had the motion been drafted to reflect support for broad human rights principles and support for international covenants—such as upholding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which China is a signatory—then, of course, it would have been considered positively. But that is not the way that the motion was drafted.
The Labor Party are committed to further developing a very strong and multifaceted relationship with China. After 30 years of diplomatic relations with Beijing, we have a very broad based relationship with China. It has extensive commercial ties, extensive cultural ties and extensive people to people ties. Many thousands of Australians have deep links with China—family ties, educational ties and business ties. It is a very broadly based and successful relationship. We believe that that relationship will grow—it will deepen and broaden—over the years. But, in the context of our relationship, we do have to continue to speak up on human rights issues. We should stand up for the values that we hold dear. We should express our views in a clear and forthright but mature way.
When the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, visited China last year he raised the issue of human rights, including human rights in Tibet. After his visit to China, Mr Crean indicated that his discussions with the Chinese Premier were frank, in particular over the issue of Tibet. Mr Crean said:
... the Chinese indicated the strength of their conviction that they were committed to improvements in Tibet. For my part, and I indicated the importance of the issue and the concerns that are raised with us and our ability to in turn raise those with the Chinese ...
So, as Mr Crean has said, we must build a relationship with the Chinese which recognises their political system as it is and recognises the progress that has been made there. But, importantly, it should also accommodate our raising of concerns—including our raising of concerns about human rights—with the Chinese government. I remind the Senate that at the last election we said that a Labor government would make the advancement of human rights a core foreign policy objective. We have said that human rights have been pushed to the margins of Australian foreign relations. We have said that a Labor government would actively pursue wider regional dialogue and cooperation concerning problems of sustainable economic and social development, and environmental protection, with the aim of enhancing human security throughout our region.
I have said on a number of occasions in this chamber that, as is so often the way, motions on foreign policy matters are a blunt instrument that cannot easily express the nuances that are necessarily a part of effective international diplomacy. There are elements of the motion to which we are, of course, naturally sympathetic but there are other elements of the motion that do not accurately convey our position on these matters. That is why we have not given leave for this motion to be declared formal.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-10-16,"—I would like to speak on the same matter. I was not intending to speak on this, but I found it quite fascinating listening to Senator Faulkner—
—I am often fascinating.
—Yes, I was quite fascinated on this occasion because I suspect that what you would actually like to do is to add some more to this motion.
—That is the point. That is why we need a full debate and the capacity to debate it.
—Absolutely. I would like to suggest that if we did pass this today then we could move on, and Senator Stott Despoja would probably be only too happy to talk about that. I made a few notes of things to include in my speech, such as the fact that the Labor Party have raised concerns on this issue and the wider regional dialogue involved. I am sure that all of these issues could be covered in an additional motion.
—I suggest that Senator Stott Despoja go and work it out with Mr Rudd.
—Senator Stott Despoja may well wish to move a further motion, but I am amazed that Senator Faulkner can actually find fault with the motion before us today. To begin with, Senator Stott Despoja's motion notes that the People's Republic of China has forbidden Falun Gong practitioners from practising. It goes on with a whole series of paragraphs, none of which, certainly based on the material that has come across my desk—and I suspect I get the same emails, faxes and letters that are sent to others—can be questioned. Senator Stott Despoja then calls on the People's Republic of China to immediately cease its persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, and a number of parts of this motion relate to that.
I do not understand what the technical problems in this motion are that would lead Senator Faulkner to suggest that it is not worth supporting today. We see that part (f) of the motion calls on the People's Republic of China to immediately release all prisoners being held in relation to non-violent protest activities, such as calling for an independent Tibet. Again, I have great trouble with those who seem to feel that this motion is not worthy of support. I wish to place on the record here this afternoon that I will be supporting this motion. Hopefully at least some members of the Labor Party would see it as a step in the right direction and may indeed sit down with the Democrats at a later time and negotiate a more detailed motion.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS: CHINA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-10-16,"—I share Senator Faulkner's view on this particular motion. I find it interesting that it is being moved at this particular time. Here we are at 4.20 p.m. on Thursday debating a matter that does contain some very serious issues. I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that there are very serious issues within the motion but, as Senator Faulkner put, we have to be mature about this. We have to ensure that through our process we pursue these things in a way that will get some outcomes. In understanding the processes with respect to the government in China, it seems to me that this is being moved at a time that is not necessarily going to be helpful to the Falun Gong practitioners and that it is more aimed at the visit of the Chinese President, for a purpose that from my point of view will not serve to get an outcome which everyone would like to see.
—The practitioners requested it. 
—If the practitioners requested it, that is probably all the more reason not to move it at this point in time. It is specifically aimed at the visit of the President, and I do not think that is a helpful thing to do. I think everybody has cause for concern with regards to human rights issues. I note that Senator Stott Despoja said some of the words contained within this motion were passed by the US Congress. I find it interesting that Senator Stott Despoja wants to use a reference to the US Congress in supporting a proposition. I am not sure she would want to support all the propositions that have arisen from the US Congress. There is one closer to heart, in respect of another President's visit, on the war on Iraq. I am not sure the Democrats would be endorsing the US Congress's position on that.
I have concerns about human rights issues wherever they exist, but it is also a matter of dealing with these issues through a process that gets the desired outcome. That is what this parliament has to be careful about. As I said, I agree with Senator Faulkner that to allow a full and proper debate about these issues and for amendments to be moved we should do this at another time.
—Senator Stott Despoja, the notice was given on 13 October. I would be more than happy to participate in a debate on these matters at a different time rather than just aiming at a particular visit of the President of China. I will not be supporting the motion at this time.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-16,"—I seek leave to make a short statement on behalf of Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in response to a Senate order to produce documents. (Quorum formed)
Leave granted. 
—I thank the Senate for giving me leave. The order I am responding to on behalf of Senator Vanstone arises from a motion moved by Senator Allison and it relates to the management of detention centres. There are two parts to Senator Allison's notice of motion. Part (a) relates to the production of default notices issued to Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd under the government's general agreement contract to manage detention centres, and I will address, on behalf of Senator Vanstone, that part. Senator Vanstone says in response:
	I am concerned at this Senate motion which seeks to circumvent the exemption provisions in the Freedom of Information Act to restrict access to this material for legitimate reasons. 
- I am advised that as per relevant FOI provisions, there is a potential impact on Australasian Correctional Management, particularly the possible adverse impact that the public release [of] the material may have on ACM's present and future business affairs. 
	I acknowledge the requirement and importance for accountability in Government operations but am advised that there are also legitimate security concerns in the material which go to the good order and security of detention centres--which is why I do not propose to release the material publicly.
	In the light of the concerns of the Senate however, I will provide a confidential briefing to interested Senators. 
In respect of part (b) of Senator Allison's motion, which relates to the production of the Knowledge Enterprises report on major incidents at detention centres in June 2000, Senator Vanstone says:
	I reiterate my concerns that the Senate motion seeks to go beyond the exemption provisions in the Freedom of Information Act to restrict access to this material for legitimate reasons. 
	I do acknowledge the requirement for accountability in Government operations, however I am advised that there are legitimate security concerns in this material which go to the good order and security of detention centres, which is why I do not propose to make the full report publicly available.
	I am, however, willing to table the FOI response provided to the applicant in relation to the Knowledge Enterprises report. 
	In addition, I draw Senators' attention to responses to a question on notice from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee provided by the Department in estimates hearings in May 2001 in relation to these matters.
- This response provides the findings of the Knowledge Enterprises report con-cerning the incident at Woomera in August 2000 and the findings con-cerning the subsequent management of the incident. This is readily available to Senators. 
	I do not propose, however, to table additional detail from the report as I am advised that to do so would compromise the good order and security of the detention centres. 
	I am prepared to arrange a confidential briefing on the content of the report to interested Senators should they seek it. ",SENATE,<title>IMMIGRATION: DETENTION CENTRES</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,34,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-16,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement. 
I realise that we are chewing up time and there are lots of things people want to talk about, so I will be brief. I understand that Senator Sherry wants to make a comment or two as well. This return to order motion was moved by Senator Allison, so I thought it appropriate to speak on behalf of the Democrats. I hear what the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer says, but without labouring the point—and this point has been made many times before—the issues of national security, of law and order and the good running of detention centres et cetera are starting to be used a little too often to maintain credibility. Obviously, without seeing it—and I note the offer of a confidential briefing; I thank the minister for that and I suspect we will be seeking to take that offer up—it is an area where there has been a lot of public concern about secrecy. One of the problems and one of the reasons why concerns have been expressed for a long period about the contracting-out of security arrangements or the operation of immigration detention centres is that we are involving a private provider in the operations of Commonwealth detention facilities and then we run into this commercial-in-confidence problem. One of the reasons why we would prefer it to be run and controlled by the government is so that it would be more accountable. 
Having said that, I know that when it was run by the government there were problems as well. There is no guarantee that there will not be any problems. But it is another area, suffice to say, where a return to order has not been fully complied with. I will study the statement more closely. On first hearing, I did not feel convinced that the rationale or the reasons stacked up. We will read the statement more closely and we will consider the confidential briefing offer. At the heart of a broader concern of the Australian community is the operation of all our detention centres, the practices by Australasian Correctional Management in particular in a whole range of areas and the difficulty in getting clear information about what happens. As all of us would know, there are any number of allegations about what has happened and about the conduct of various people. I am not in any way suggesting that they are all correct or true, but it is difficult to verify them one way or another in a climate of such secrecy. I would suggest that it is in the government's interest to try to break away from that climate as well. I could make a broader statement about our detention regime and the innate problems in that, but I think we will have plenty of opportunity to debate that in this place, so I will finish my remarks there.",SENATE,<title>IMMIGRATION: DETENTION CENTRES</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,34,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-16,"—This is the second occasion this week that I have had to speak in response to a ministerial response to a Senate resolution on a return to order. Earlier this week I had occasion to speak in response to Senator Coonan's refusal to meet the resolution of the Senate on a return to order for documents from the Australian Government Actuary which relate to the costings of the future liabilities and, as a consequence, charges to be made with respect to medical indemnity insurance. Today we have been presented with yet another refusal, at least in part, by a minister—in this case the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone—on behalf of the government to meet a further return to order, on this occasion of documents relating to the operation of detention centres. Although I do acknowledge the notification that a confidential private briefing will be given and some documentation will be provided, the response does not meet the return to order resolution made by the Senate.  
As I have said, this is the second occasion on which I have had to respond to a refusal to meet a reasonable request of the Senate. I do not know the latest figures. I think Senator Carr might have been referring to the number of occasions on which return to order resolutions of the Senate have been refused by this government, but this is yet another to add to that very long list and, as I understand it, a record number of refusals to meet return to order motions passed by the Senate. I think this very identifiable trend is very regrettable. It is an arrogant and contemptuous attitude that is being reflected by the government towards the Senate and its rightful place to scrutinise legislation and the operations of government and, to scrutinise in particular, the operations of the executive. 
The return to order motion moved by Senator Allison, at least in part, was I think motivated by the material that was presented to the Senate estimates committee on the operations of detention centres in this country. This government has pursued very actively a process of subcontracting out the operations of our detention centres to the private sector. As Senator Bartlett rightly alluded to, both in the forum of Senate estimates on a number of occasions and from time to time publicly there have been serious issues raised about the effectiveness or otherwise of the day-to-day management by private contractors, in this case ACM—Australasian Correctional Management—and serious allegations have been made about the manner of the management and the operation of the detention centres by ACM.
It is not my intention to go over the allegations in any great detail, but they can broadly be classified into two categories. The first is allegations about the treatment of some detainees by some staff working for ACM, some of them of a very serious nature. The second is the overall efficiency from an economic sense—I am not talking here from a human supervision sense—of some of the contractual payments to ACM in return for services allegedly not provided in the form stipulated within the contractual agreement. 
I acknowledge that it was Senator Allison who moved the return to order, with the support of the Labor Party, because we share these concerns. It is in the interests of ACM, and certainly in the interests of the detainees, where there are allegations of inappropriate treatment for an examination to be carried out of the appropriate documentation and the legal responsibilities of ACM. On a number of occasions at Senate estimates, Senator Allison, I and a number of others have pressed the department to release the details of these contractual arrangements. Unfortunately, that has not been forthcoming. So it is difficult for us, at least in respect of the performance of ACM, to test some of the allegations that are being made about the efficient running in an economic sense of the detention centres against the contractual obligations of ACM. There is significant expenditure of public money involved in the subcontracting and effectively the privatisation of the operations of these detention centres; it involves serious amounts of public money. I cannot recall the figures offhand, but it is in the tens of millions of dollars on an annual basis. In order for the Senate and the Labor opposition, and for that matter the Democrats and other interested senators, to be able to perform their duties and responsibilities in holding accountable the executive, and also in this case a subcontracted private company, it is necessary to have this information. I am gravely concerned that it has not been presented to the Senate. 
I am not sure that other senators would be aware of this, but on Nauru, an island where detainees have been placed, we had the extraordinary circumstance of the detainees taking over the detention centre and taking control of it and the department somewhat euphemistically referring to this as `a self-managed centre'. The contractor who was operating the centre was removed from the facility on Nauru. It is quite extraordinary that this occurred. Again, whatever the detail of the takeover of the detention centre on Nauru and who behaved properly or improperly, we had a detention centre being run by the detainees. They were actually supervising themselves, feeding themselves and running the services by themselves. If it had happened on the Australian mainland, I think it would have attracted a good deal more attention. That is just one of the issues we need to examine in the context of the documentation that has been requested from the minister and the executive. 
I point out that Labor has considered this issue in the broad in its policy response in this area and Labor does not favour these subcontractual arrangements in relation to detention centres, subject of course to existing legal requirements. Labor in its policy response is not in favour of the subcontracting of responsibilities for the supervision, wellbeing and care of detainees. It is not an appropriate response. Aside from the issues of the wellbeing of the detainees, it raises issues of the cost effectiveness of that service provision, and Labor has been arguing that it would be best if we had direct government employment supervision of detainees in detention centres. But, as I say, that is without abrogating any existing contractual arrangements.
In conclusion, I say that, whilst confidential briefings are useful, this does not meet the quite reasonable request of the Senate that the documents be produced. It is very unfortunate that the executive has reinforced its very arrogant approach—almost a contemptuous approach—to the good operation of the Senate. I can recall, on reflection, the dim and long-past days when I sat on the other side of the chamber when we were subjected to requests of this nature. If we dared not to respond when we were in government, we were subjected to hours and hours of debate and demands about why we should respond to these returns to order. I can remember Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Hill particularly subjecting us to what would verge on a tirade of criticism of the then Labor government for refusing to produce return to order documents.
—Was this when you were parliamentary secretary?
—Yes. I can recall that very well. Of course, we have a very different position now.
—One of the shortest terms in this parliament's history.
—Three years—not quite as lengthy as yours, Senator Campbell. I can recall that when the now government was sitting on this side of the chamber it was a matter of high principle that returns to order should be produced within a reasonable period of time.
—They were fairly rare beasts in those days.
—They were fairly rare beasts. But, as the secrecy of this executive and this government and their arrogance and contempt for the role of the Senate in Australia's constitutional structure have grown, it has been necessary for us to pursue mechanisms like this to obtain the necessary information to put this government under the scrutiny that it deserves. We have had numerous examples of, at best, misleading information and policy given to the Australian public on important policy matters.
I will have to take up the matter of the confidential briefing with Senator Allison and the Democrats—I do not know what their attitude to it will be—and Ms Roxon in the other place, our shadow minister on these matters, to see whether a confidential briefing will be of some value. On behalf of the Labor Party, it is with deep regret and some anger, particularly given my reflections on the criticism we were subject to when we were sitting on the other side of the chamber and refused to meet requests on returns to order— 
—John Button used to write back and say it was too expensive for the Commonwealth and he refused to respond.
—I think on many occasions he was responding to requests from Senator Bronwyn Bishop, again reflecting back. For those who were not here when Bronwyn Bishop was a senator, I think even Senator Campbell would acknowledge that some of the requests that ran into millions of dollars worth of bureaucratic time that Senator Bishop used to pursue were just a touch unreasonable on occasions. But that is history and that is another story. Labor will continue to press for the information that has been sought under the return to order for the reasons that I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>IMMIGRATION: DETENTION CENTRES</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,34,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-10-16,"—I had not planned to speak in response to this but, as I overheard Senator Sherry—who is now leaving the chamber—I felt compelled to make a couple of points. He referred intermittently during his remarks to partial compliance not being good enough. That, of course, depends on whether the explanation for partial compliance is good enough. He was good enough at least to refer, as Senator Bartlett did, to the offer of a confidential briefing. I can assure you that I have not made the decision to comply in this way from any desire not to be accountable. I hope the confidential briefings, to the extent that they are taken up, satisfy the Democrats and—to the extent that they are interested—opposition members, in whatever it is they want.
I am advised that a party made this application under FOI and, under the standard rules of FOI, was refused. I am also advised that the party has not yet exhausted his or her appeal rights in relation to FOI. Even with the respect to which returns to order in the Senate should be treated, I do not know that there is anyone who would want them to become a simple mechanism for the bypassing of the standard rules under FOI. I do not assert that Senator Allison has a relationship with this journalist and that that is the case, but it happens to be the case that, perhaps separately, there is this application which has not gone through all of its processes.
Senator Sherry referred to the secrecy he alleges the executive of this government engages in and the need, because of it, for greater numbers of returns to order than there were under the previous government. Whether that is the reason for the greater numbers is a matter for political debate. Others on this side, of course, would say that the value of a return to order—the importance and compelling nature of it—is reduced by their being used far more frequently than they were in the past. I understand that there is a necessary dynamic in this parliament and in this chamber where people in opposition will have different views to the government about the degree to which material should be released.
When then Senator Susan Ryan, in a discussion with me in one of the old bathrooms in Old Parliament House—we are not going to go any further into that detail—said to me, `You will be glad when you're in government that you've spent some time in opposition', I thought, `How could she possibly think that's true?' But that experience gave me insight and allowed me to understand, now that I am in government and looking at it from a different perspective, the nature of opposition demands and why they are made. 
I wanted to make a couple of remarks about subcontracting. The suggestion was made by Senator Sherry that this is done as a means of reducing accountability to parliament. Frankly, that is something I do have to take issue with. I recall a number of debates when there was significant concern over spending on the Working Nation program and the accountability for those dollars—their effectiveness in terms of whether real jobs were really being achieved for the amount of money being spent. But I particularly remember that the tremendous Australian actor Bill Hunter was the front face of Working Nation. We were quite interested in how much Mr Hunter had been paid to do the Working Nation ads because it turned out that Mr Hunter, subsequent to getting the contract to do the ads, did the Labor Party ads at the subsequent election. The story was that he was so committed to the Labor Party that he did the ads for nothing. You can understand that there was a great interest in this man who was so committed to the Labor Party that he would do the ads for nothing. You have to ask how much Mr Hunter was paid to do the Working Nation ads, because that might be relevant to his strong commitment to the Labor Party.
—He was the only person who got a real job out of Working Nation!
—He might have been. As I recall, a contract was given out to a firm to manage the publicity for Working Nation. But, even if you could get that contract, you could not get the contract for Mr Hunter, because that was a subcontract, and you would have to get the contractor to agree to give you the subcontract. So I think this is the pot calling the kettle black a little bit here. I have a longstanding interest in the use of terminology to avoid accountability and I understand about commercial-in-confidence being used in that way.
I recall former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch finally agreeing, after years of badgering by the now government but then opposition, that there was no reason QCs should not have their fees revealed to the Senate. A man or woman who makes this chair, this table, this carpet or these lights expects, if a question is asked about how much the chair, table or lights cost, to have the answer given. There was a long history under Labor—and, probably, under previous Liberal governments—where it was thought that QCs were somehow in a special position and should not have their fees revealed. I was happy to take up the cause there and I acknowledge the former Labor Attorney Michael Lavarch for having given in on that issue. What I mean by that is that there were occasions when, in opposition, we fought contracts that were, by design, constructed in a particular way to hide the payments. I have cited the contract for Bill Hunter to do the Working Nation programs. He subsequently, as I am advised, did the Labor ads for nothing, but I stand to be corrected if that is wrong. These were contracts set up and devised by the now opposition, who complain. But I think the general point has been made there.
Let me move on to the last point I particularly want to make about subcontracting in relation to detention centres. Detention centres are not prisons, but there is a similar aspect. This argument was frequently raised by former Labor Senator Barney Cooney about whether you would in fact get a better service if the private sector looked after general detention facilities, including prisons. He was not at all convinced that that would be the case. I often said to Senator Cooney: nominate for me the government that has a proud history in this area. If you wanted to pick just one area where I do not think a government in the world can be proud of its long history, it would be detention centres. We all know that prisons in the past were appalling and that governments have consistently tried to make them better. But, surely, you cannot say, `This is an area where governments have demonstrated that they do it very well. Therefore, governments should continue to do it.' You just cannot say that. 
Anyone who has been to a prison or any type of detention facility run by a government would understand that they do not have a proud record of running them well. When I say `running them well' I mean treating the people who happen to be inside—for whatever evil deed they have committed, if it is a prison—as though they still have the right to be treated in a dignified way. I think that that is important to mention because the proposition being put by Senator Sherry and maybe, to a limited extent, by Senator Bartlett—I do not mean to misjudge him, if I am—is that somehow the private sector should not be involved here. The simple proposition that I want to put is that, while detention centres are not prisons, they are detention facilities—facilities where people are detained—and no government that I know of has a fabulous history in relation to this matter. Therefore, I would not exclude the private sector.
So, in summary, in relation to the return to order, I do understand the senators' obligations and ministers' obligations to the Senate. I did not feel, on the advice I had available, that I could release this material. But I did feel that it was appropriate to offer confidential briefings, which might meet the needs of those people who have a genuine interest in this area.
I am slightly miffed by, but I suppose I will survive, the cruel and heartless suggestions from the other side that this government is secretive. I must say that the treaty the previous Labor government negotiated with Indonesia and told nobody about until it was made comes to mind as a tremendously secret act of the executive: not only negotiating but also signing up to a treaty with a government that at the time was not—and, perhaps, even now is not—regarded in the same light as the current Indonesian government. Yet Mr Keating and his advisers went over and made that defence treaty with Indonesia without discussing it with the public at all—without giving them any say. This government has put in train a regime to ensure that, to a far greater extent, not only this parliament but also people in Australia generally in state parliaments do get the opportunity to comment. So I reject the tag of `an overly secretive executive' and use that as an example to demonstrate the understanding this government has of the need to be accountable and to make executive processes accountable.
Lastly, of course, I turn to subcontracting. I make the point that the people who are complaining are the people who designed methods to avoid accountability to the parliament. They actually designed them. I use the One Nation example.
—That's grossly unfair!
—I acknowledge Senator Faulkner's interjection because he does not often say that things are grossly unfair and that he feels offended by my remarks. I do not say them to offend; I just have a different perspective. I understand that he perhaps does not agree. The last point I made was in relation to those people who think that there is something particularly wrong with ACM because it is in the private sector and that somehow the government ought to do this. I know, Senator Bartlett, that you acknowledged that there may not, in fact, be a better job if the government— 
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I am reasonably tolerant, as everyone in the chamber is aware. There have been a lot of diversions in Senator Vanstone's contribution, but she has not been addressing the chair. She in fact is not directing any remarks through the chair. I would ask you to—
—If you sat down, she'd be finished. You're just wasting time.
—I am not wasting time. Mr Deputy President, the point of order is that I would ask you to ask Senator Vanstone to direct her remarks through the chair, not to individual senators.
—There is no point of order. Senator Vanstone, I would ask you to wrap up.
—Mr Deputy President, it is late on Thursday and tempers might be frayed. I do not have any intention of continuing, albeit the clock indicates that I could. Senator Faulkner is offended that there have been occasions on which I have not addressed my remarks through you. The reason for that is simply that, because of the emotional force with which the arguments are put by Senator Sherry and Senator Bartlett, I have personally felt compelled to respond to them directly. If I intermittently forgot to do that through you, I am sorry. The last point I wanted to make in summary was that governments do not have a history of handling these things well, and I do not know that you can assume the private sector would be worse. In fact, you can hope they would be better.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-16,"—I got halfway through speaking about general business notice of motion No. 658, as amended, earlier before I was cut off by order of the Senate. I foreshadow that, in the interests of greater harmony, I will amend this notice of motion even further—once standing orders are suspended, if the Senate agrees—by removing the suggestion to conduct government business on Thursday and removing the requirement for notices of motion to be part of the routine of business. I made my arguments before when speaking to my motion to suspend standing orders to enable this to be moved so I shall not speak further.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Business,36,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-16,"—I would like to say that Senator Bartlett has, along with other leaders and whips who we have been discussing this with throughout the course of a fairly long day, showed a lot of goodwill in trying to facilitate a consensus on a sitting schedule for next week. Firstly, in relation to the suspension of standing orders, I indicate that the government will oppose it—for a couple of reasons. It being late on a Thursday afternoon, I know that a number of colleagues—on the quite legitimate basis that, almost without exception, there are no divisions usually after 12.45 p.m. on a Thursday—have in fact made their way to the airport and are heading home to their constituencies. I am aware of a number of senators—for example, Senator Lees, Senator Harris and Senator Harradine—who are not here. So any vote we take, even on the suspension of standing orders, would not reflect the democratically elected views of the Senate. 
—How do you say that? Senator Lees, in fact, was elected as a Democrat senator.
—Fair point. The government are opposed to the substantive motion as well. I know I should not go to the detail of that in any significant respect, but I think it is worth noting that the government have said that the sittings next week will effectively be ceremonial days—as was the case under the then Keating Labor government in 1992 when President Bush Sr visited. That was a special meeting; it was not a formal sitting of the parliament. The government have followed that protocol set by the Keating government. There was a visit in 1996 by President William Jefferson Clinton. That was scheduled on a normal sitting day so that was different to the original President George Bush Sr visit.
Because it was clear that a number of senators, and potentially a majority of senators, wanted to undertake government business while many senators were in the building next week, the government, in very good faith—and I think Senator Bartlett would respect this—looked at how we could make use of that time. Although the government's formal position was that we did not want to have sittings, we did—as I think all senators would respect—put a lot of energy today into trying to find a consensus for using the time of the Senate.
It has been problematic because the government has been negotiating with the officers of the visiting heads of state to finalise the programs for these incredibly important official visits. Many of the details of their programs have only been finalised in the past 24 hours, and many have not been totally finalised. It has been impossible to look at how you might try to put some parliamentary sittings around those visits. It has been easier to do that today; however, in the meantime senators have made travel and other plans and meetings have been organised. After all that effort I can say quite honestly, hand on heart, that it has been impossible to create a consensus around those sitting hours. It is fair to say to Senator Bartlett that it would have been of some assistance to the government to have some extra time, maybe to make a start on the Telstra bill. You would not want to impose that on the Senate unless you had a consensus. You may get a majority to sit on Thursday, but the way you should run the Senate is by consensus; otherwise, it does not work effectively. We have genuinely tried to find that consensus. It has not emerged. For those reasons, I will be opposing the suspension of standing orders.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Business,36,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I find that contribution from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate quite extraordinary. For the Manager of Government Business to argue that his approach to these matters is one of trying to develop a consensus is not a reasonable or fair reflection of the way he has managed government business in the period that he has had responsibility for that important task. Most fair-minded and objective senators would acknowledge that the reason this Senate has worked as well as it has is because of the fair-mindedness and the capacity of the opposition to ensure that extra sitting hours, days and weeks have been provided. The government's incompetence and intransigence in its management of the program are legendary. I find it quite hypocritical of the Manager of Government Business to make those sorts of statements. 
Let me go to the substantive question before the chair. I want to do that so I can sit down before 6.00 p.m. because of the provisions of standing order 57(3). I indicate first of all that the opposition will be supporting the suspension of standing orders that is proposed by Senator Bartlett. We indicated in a debate at the end of the last sitting week that, given the uncertainties in relation to the visits of President Bush and President Hu, there was a requirement for the Senate to try to establish, firstly, the timing of those addresses to the parliament and, secondly, what other functions would be taking place, in or outside this building, which would involve senators and members, so we could build an appropriate program around the joint sittings. The opposition believe the Senate should sit. My colleagues Mr Crean and Mr Latham argued very effectively and persuasively that this should also occur in the House of Representatives.
I am very happy to support the suspension of standing orders motion that stands in Senator Bartlett's name. I also want to indicate to the Senate that, in broad measure, I support the substantive motion before the chair. I do take issue with one proposal in the substantive motion which is contained in paragraphs 1(b)(i) and 2(b)(i) and deals with notices of motion. I think it is a very sensible proposition for us to deal with government business only and be quite strict and clear on that approach to this particular sitting of the Senate. I indicate to the Senate when we get to dealing with the substantive motion that I will be proposing an amendment to ensure those particular subparagraphs be omitted.
The arguments for the Senate to sit are strong. Even though this did not find favour in the House of Representatives, senators need to be aware—and the Australian public need to be aware—that these parliamentary sittings do not happen without a great deal of expense. It costs a lot of money to assemble us all in Canberra for two days. If there is going to be that cost to the taxpayer, the taxpayer is entitled to expect a little bit of output from their parliamentary representatives, beyond just being present at a ceremonial sitting. That is the approach the opposition are taking. We are consistent in relation to those matters. The Labor Party will support the suspension of standing orders and we support, with the minor amendments I have outlined, the substantive proposal. I will say more about that when that debate is before the chair.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Business,36,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-10-16,"—This whole process has been somewhat of a debacle. I do not disagree with Senator Faulkner in respect of the Senate sitting; in fact, I would be happy if we sat all next week. I acknowledge that we have George W. and the Chinese President coming, but I have to say it amazes me that somehow these arrangements cannot be organised at least a few days in advance, to allow us to have a proper debate and consider what we are doing with our time. I just cannot see why it is so difficult for the Australian government to organise a visit and, indeed, for the Americans to be able to tell us, `The President will be available at this point in time'—
 (Senator McLucas)—Order! It being 6 p.m., under the standing orders, the Senate should proceed to considering government documents. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Business,36,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-10-16,"—Madam Acting Deputy President McLucas, you would be aware—I know a number of my colleagues on this side are aware—that we are coming towards the end of what has been designated by the charitable agencies as Anti-Poverty Week. Throughout this week, the likes of St Vincent de Paul, Uniting Care, Anglicare, Mission Australia, the Salvation Army and any number of other voluntary organisations have been trying to highlight to the Australian community, and indeed to decision makers, that there is a growing divide between rich and poor in this country. However, from my understanding, there has been no response whatsoever from the federal coalition government to any of the suggestions or inputs from these agencies about what they see as the growing divide between rich and poor in this country. It is a fact that between 1996 and 2001 the top 20 per cent of Australian incomes rose at a rate seven times greater than the bottom 20 per cent. That translates into dollars this way: the top 20 per cent received a $109 per week increase and the bottom 20 per cent received a $3 a week increase.
As you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, members of the Community Affairs References Committee—you and I, along with others—travelled throughout the country on an inquiry into poverty and financial hardship. We know exactly what is happening out there. I want to highlight to the Senate a few of the things that are occurring. I know when our coalition speakers get up they will say that an economic miracle has descended upon this country and that everyone in this country is a recipient of that miracle, but Lutheran Community Care, in South Australia, told our committee about two old women who cannot afford to have a set of glasses each and share one set of glasses. 
The Salvation Army, in Tasmania, told us about pensioners who go to bed at teatime because they cannot afford the electricity bill. Mission Australia told us that in the last two years there has been a 12 per cent increase in their services to people. The Mathew Talbot Hostel in Sydney, run by St Vincent de Paul, said that in 1998 they helped out 23,000 people, and in 2002 they helped out 43,000 people. The Uniting Church in Canley Vale, in Sydney, said that last year they fed 15,425 people, which was a marked increase on the number of people they fed the year before. The Salvation Army, in Ballarat, said that there has been a significant increase in the number of clients that they are looking after. Financial counsellors in Lismore said that in the year 2002 they helped out 106 people, and in the year 2003—that is, January to June—they helped out 230 people, a 30 per cent increase. Lifeline, in Northern Rivers near Lismore, said that the requests for material aid have increased by 140 per cent over the past few years. Anglicare, in Wollongong, said that they have had a 20 per cent increase in the number of people seeking assistance from them, and that the number has been steadily growing since 1999. WACOSS, in Perth, said that in the last four years there has been a 240 per cent increase in the number of people seeking assistance from them.
We went to Townsville to the St Vincent de Paul conference—there are a number of conferences—with 88 volunteers. They said that in the year 2001-02 they received 3,542 requests for assistance and in 2002-03 they received 6,332 requests for assistance. How is this economic miracle—which those on the coalition side will tell us about shortly—percolating down to the 20 per cent? Clearly, it is not.
I go now to homelessness. Every one of those agencies that I told you about earlier—St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare, Uniting Care, the Salvation Army and Mission Australia—said that homelessness in this country is growing. They also said that the profile of people who ask them for assistance is changing, and it has changed in the last seven years. Women and children are now seeking assistance from them, not burnt out men or drunks or whatever other caricature you may think of. They are women, children and young men—people who have become desperate and homeless. This is what is happening in John Howard's Australia.
Another thing that is happening to these 2.4 million people that we will not hear about from the coalition speakers is the number of breakfast programs that are being conducted each day in this country. We are not a Third World country. The lady who runs the Uniting Church operation in Canley Vale said, `It's disgusting that we've got a soup kitchen; we are not a Third World country.' The Brotherhood of St Laurence, in Melbourne, conducts a breakfast program for children. St Vincent de Paul, in Newcastle, pays the Red Cross to conduct a breakfast program for children. Uniting Care does the same. St Vincent de Paul, in Lismore, does the same. So there is a pattern there. The only people who seem to be sharing in this economic miracle—this so-called great economic growth that we will be told about shortly—are the top 20 per cent. If you are on the bottom, as far as this government is concerned you will stay on the bottom. There is no incentive for the government to get people out of the predicament they are in—none at all. The government has condemned them to the life that they are in. The government has not even said a flaming word this week about what is happening out there. Not the Prime Minister nor one of your ministers, that I can see, has said a word about it. The only parties that have said something are my party and a number of the other minor parties. I ask you: when are you going to help the homeless? When are you going to help the destitute? When are you going to help the dispossessed?

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-10-16,"—Like Senator Hutchins, I have spent a lot of time travelling round Australia, undertaking public hearings with the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on the question of poverty. And, like him, I have been appalled to see that large numbers of Australians live in poverty.
—This is a discovery!
—No, it is not a discovery, Senator Carr. I am very familiar with poverty. You probably quite often make the mistake of characterising members on this side of the chamber as silvertails, but that is not the case.
—You are inviting me to do that?
—I invite you to come with me to the street in Sydney where my mother was born to decide whether that is a community born in privilege. I am appalled by poverty in Australia; I am truly appalled by it. As a member of that inquiry I saw evidence of real poverty in this lucky country of ours. It is distressing to see those illustrations of poverty in Australia today. I would describe poverty as being a blot on Australian values, particularly the value of egalitarianism, which is very important in the fabric of Australian society. Even if there are only a handful of Australians living in poverty—unfortunately, there are many more than a handful—we have a major challenge facing us as a community, and the Australian government in particular.
Having said that there is a real problem with poverty in Australia and that we must attack and eliminate this problem if possible, it is also fair to say that the inquiry of which Senator Hutchins and I have been a part has not been so successful in identifying the exact extent of poverty in Australia, or even any accurate indication of whether it is waxing or waning. It is true that there are a variety of indicators of the extent of poverty in Australia. Only last month, the Australian Council of Social Service brought forward a survey which they claimed showed that `a family of four needs a minimum income of $541 a week to live a healthy and decent life'. They contrasted this with the $519 which a family of four would receive on basic unemployment assistance and concluded that about $22 a week was missing from their income to reach that minimum basic standard.
That survey was based on replies elicited from a cross-section of Australian society who were asked to estimate `the smallest amount that a family of four needs each week to keep in health and to live decently'. The average amount that was concluded from that survey was $541. I think senators will see that there are problems with that kind of approach towards measuring poverty. People who are quite well off are being asked to indicate what they think a person who is not as well off as they are might need to survive. A recent study at the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales said that this kind of approach leads to `implausibly high' poverty estimates.
There are real concerns about whether some of the estimates being made about the extent of poverty in Australia can in fact be justified. Equally, there are a variety of views in the community, and we heard those views in the course of our inquiry, about exactly how you deal with that poverty, whether it is through simply increasing the level of income support that the Commonwealth provides or through some other ways that affect the structure of communities. It is very clear that, despite there being a problem with poverty in Australia, the evidence suggests very clearly—and no amount of shouting by Senator Hutchins is going to avoid this fact—that the plight of the poor in Australia has improved under the Howard coalition government. It has improved under whatever measure you care to use. 
By far the most important foil to poverty in this country is the creation of a job. Give a person the chance to find meaningful employment and you give them the best opportunity they can receive to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. It is true that there are some Australians who are described as the working poor, people who, despite being employed, are still in genuine poverty. But the fact is that it is a gross exaggeration to say that there are 2.4 million Australians living in poverty today. That is a study which Mr Swan of the opposition has been using in recent days to indicate that Australians are living in poverty. But what his claims do not support is that real disposable incomes for the median household in Australia—I am not talking here about this top 20 per cent that Senator Hutchins referred to; I am not talking about the silvertails that he referred to—fell between 1990 and 1996, the last six years of the former Labor government, from $686 a week to $650 a week.
What does that say to us about what was going on in Australian society during the last years of Labor government? It says that poverty was getting worse. Under you lot, poverty was getting worse. You have the temerity to come into this place and lecture us about poverty when your own record is so appalling. Average incomes over that period of 1990 to 1996 fell from $766 to $747 across the board. That was what was happening to Australian families during the time you were in government.
Mr Swan and Mr Crean have been making claims about the extent of Australian poverty, and they have been citing evidence that Australia has one of the highest rates of poverty of any OECD country. They have not substantiated that claim, but most likely they are basing that information on a web site called the Luxembourg Income Study. If that is not the case, then those opposite can tell us what the source of that claim is. If indeed it is the Luxembourg Income Study web site they are basing that claim on, we need to take into account that that data is based on information collected in 1994. In other words, it is a snapshot of what was happening in Australian society in the last few years of Labor government in Australia. It is hardly a convincing case to come forward now after 7½ years in opposition and say, `Poverty is getting worse under the Howard government.'
The Labor Party goes on and on about income inequality and yet, according to the OECD, Australia has one of the most effective tax transfer systems in the world. Under this government, earnings and incomes at the bottom have been going up, in contrast to what happened under Labor when they were going down. Since March 1996 we have increased the real value of family support and family pensions in Australia for those people most in need of support. Pensions have increased by 10 per cent above inflation since 1996. That is what we have done about poverty in this country. That is what we have done to help those people in the community who depend upon the public purse to be able to support themselves and their families—increase pensions by 10 per cent above inflation. We have given low-income working families much more cash assistance than was previously the case. For a couple with two small children on the federal minimum wage, that is an increase since 1996 of 62 per cent after inflation. 
As I said before, employment is the best foil to poverty. The rate of teenage unemployment during the time that Labor was in office was one in 10; today that rate is one in 25. So, for the elderly in society, there has been an increase in pensions of 10 per cent above inflation and, for ordinary working families, an increase—in the case I posed—of 62 per cent after inflation. There has been a fall in the unemployment of teenagers from one in 10 under Labor to one in 25 today. The minimum wage has risen by over eight per cent; it fell by five per cent between 1992 and 1996. These are the indicators of what the government are doing about poverty, and we are proud of that record.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-16,"—I also rise this evening to speak to this matter of public importance relating to poverty in Australia, having just come from a meeting this afternoon with the CEO of Anglicare Victoria, Dr Ray Cleary, which was organised to discuss this very topic. I had a similar meeting in my electorate office in Perth in the last fortnight. And, as a member of the Community Affairs References Committee's inquiry into poverty and financial hardship, I have heard countless examples and stories of people's experiences of modern Australian poverty. I tell you this because what has been made abundantly clear through these experiences, and what has been stated over and over again, is that we are facing nothing less than a very serious situation in this country—one that, as a wealthy nation, we cannot even begin to excuse and one for which we should feel a collective sense of shame.
The figures are startling and bleak. Almost 2½ million Australians live below the poverty line. Up to 800,000 children are growing up in families where neither parent is working. More than one in 10 Australians live in poverty. Study after study continues to confirm that those living in poverty are likely to have significantly reduced health, are increasingly less likely to go to the doctor, have poorer nutrition and are more likely to be overmedicated. Amongst the poorest of all Australians, Indigenous people have the worst health outcomes by far and experience significantly reduced life expectancy when compared with non-Indigenous Australians. Lower income Australians experience lower education outcomes, generally leaving education at an earlier stage and attaining fewer qualifications than higher paid Australians. The consequence for many is that they are much more likely to be either unemployed or underemployed—that is, to be in precarious and low-paid forms of casual, part-time, seasonal and contract work with fewer and fewer entitlements, rights and safeguards protecting the durability and conditions of their employment. The number of people who are long-term unemployed and entirely reliant on Centrelink payments—often through no fault of their own, I might add—continues to grow and, with it, we have witnessed the growth of intergenerational unemployment and poverty.
The reality of the extreme hardship faced by these families and individuals amounts to a national tragedy: families struggling to meet food bills, let alone being able to afford to send their children on a school excursion; the elderly pensioner who freezes in winter rather than risking unaffordable power bills; and the person with a disability or mental illness who is unable to afford their medication or their in-home support or a social outing. These are the types of common experiences that hundreds of thousands of Australians face every day, and this gap between the rich and poor and the haves and the have-nots continues to grow. 
Drawing public attention to these issues continues to be a difficult exercise. The constancy of poverty and its lack of a `shiny saleability' means that only very limited public space and attention is paid to it. The space that is devoted often lacks a broader contextual critique. It often scapegoats or focuses on the ways in which costs are created for the whole community: for example, property crime, robbery and violent assault, costs of welfare, drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, depression, suicide, domestic violence, homelessness and long-term unemployment.
The government must accept responsibility for, on the one hand, allowing this disparity to continue to grow while, on the other hand, continuing to fuel community sentiment that seeks to blame the poor for their own predicament. The government has taken one step after another to tighten eligibility and remove supports from those who need them most, while at the same time requiring that a greater number of obligation hoops be jumped through. The track record reads like a litany of complete heartlessness, with measures that have resulted in withdrawn payments, breaches, debts, complicated income-reporting arrangements, and regular, lengthy and invasive reassessments. These measures have impacted upon some of the poorest in the community, including the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, the mentally ill, single parents, students, the homeless, older Australians and working families—and all of this for payments that, in most instances, do not even meet the most basic costs of living.
As reported in September by Roy Morgan International, a family of four needs $541 per week to keep in health and to live decently, significantly more than the families of 800,000 children are receiving, with two-by-two families currently eligible for just $473 per week plus rent assistance, if they qualify. Why has the government pursued this agenda? At its base is the desire to cut costs at a time when unprecedented expenditure has occurred in other areas, such as the war in Iraq and to fund the Pacific solution. The government has simply argued that these cuts are necessary because we can no longer afford to sustain the current system. Even so, the government was able to announce tax cuts of a few dollars per week, although several polls indicated that the vast majority of Australians would much rather support trading-in the minister's hamburger and coke windfall for increased social spending. 
Nevertheless, the government has the audacity to then accuse the Senate, and we Democrats in particular, of being obstructionist for refusing to support these measures. We have been obstructionist, it is alleged, for arguing against pushing people with disabilities off the pension or restricting the pension education supplement, removing the Student Financial Supplement Scheme or forcing students and their families to pay more for their higher education or more to go to the doctor. How can the government respond to this so-called obstructionism? By announcing another larger than expected budget surplus. The truth is that, rather than preventing the government from prosecuting its agenda, we have brought some heart and social responsibility to it. Further, we have pressed the government to push ahead with those parts of its welfare reform agenda that would create a simpler, fairer and better targeted system. We have argued that the solving of the problem of poverty traps involves significant tax and welfare reform and we have outlined options to raise as much as $5 billion as a contribution to funding them. These measures include means-testing the private health rebate, reform on negative gearing and fringe benefits tax concessions on company cars. 
The Democrats will continue to push for broader reforms because we do not believe that entrenched issues of poverty that we are now experiencing in this country will be resolved through minor changes that merely tinker at the edges of the problem. We call again on the government to support the notion of a national poverty summit with targets for income, employment, health, education and community services and to work towards the immediate development of measurable targets that enjoy cross-party support and longevity, and against which all future safety net decisions are assessed.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance about the terrible situation of poverty and financial hardship facing an increasing number of Australians and Australian families. To go back to discussions in this chamber in the last hour or two, I think it is very significant that we are here on Thursday evening discussing this most important issue, and I am pleased that this matter of public importance moved by you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, has been able to be debated here this evening. 
I acknowledge that Senator Humphries in his remarks acknowledged that there is a problem of poverty, and I believe that he accepts that there is an increasing difficulty for many Australian families, particularly the working poor. Whilst we may debate some of the statistics and so on, I think Senator Humphries, through his involvement in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into poverty and financial hardship, has been one from the coalition side who has taken a responsible and, indeed, a caring attitude to this issue.
There have always been poor people, and no doubt there will always be poor people, who are in desperate circumstances. But there have also always been charitable organisations and governments which have sought to assist those people who have been unable to escape the poverty trap—organisations like St Vincent de Paul, the Uniting Church, the Smith Family, the Red Cross and so on. We all know them and I think all of us have had many years of contact with those organisations. I, indeed like all other members of parliament, know people who have worked as volunteers for those organisations. But what is startling today and what has come through the poverty inquiry that has really struck me is hearing evidence from those volunteer workers, those ordinary men and women who devote their spare time to helping those agencies, that the situation is far worse than it has ever been. 
I remember particularly the hearings in Lismore and being struck by the evidence from people—decent, humble, caring people, not academics, not experts, not agencies, not people who may want to talk about definitions of poverty, and all of those issues are terribly important—who said to us, `It is just getting worse and worse all the time; we cannot cope anymore with the number of people and families who we have to provide assistance to.' They told us that the demands placed upon them are now more complex and far greater than they ever were.
Senator Hutchins mentioned the situation of kids in this country who go to school without breakfast. This is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with one of the best health systems and one of the best education systems. Why is this happening? Why are children going to school without any food in their stomachs? Elderly people in Hobart are going to bed early because they cannot afford to pay the heating bill to keep themselves warm. This is what we were told—and those people were telling the truth. You could see it; you could hear it. They did not come along with fancy prepared submissions to argue some academic treatise. They told us real stories about how they were impacted by poverty and severe financial hardship, and how they constantly dealt with it. 
Mention has been made of services that increasingly have to be provided by groups like St Vincent de Paul and others. They are no longer just the organisations that would help out a family in a sudden crisis or help the desperate alcoholic on the street or a person with a drug problem. They are constantly having to deal with families that are facing financial catastrophe. The committee was told in Lismore that the financial counselling service there has a six-week waiting list for people to see them to try and sort out their problems. Often these people's only solution is to go into bankruptcy. 
If you look at the figures that have been released today by the Reserve Bank, you can see that credit card debt in this country has now reached $24.8 billion. The government lectures and boasts about its record of low interest rates. Sure, interest rates are low in the housing market—but look at credit card debt. Families who cannot afford to pay their education expenses, their health expenses or all the other expenses that they are facing are increasingly going more and more into debt just to survive. This is happening today, and the problem is skyrocketing.
When you talk about housing, housing interest rates might be low, and that is okay if you have a decent family income and you have got yourself established and you have got your land and your loan, but try getting housing in Sydney if you cannot get on the first rung of the ladder. Try raising a deposit to buy a house. Try to even get decent rental accommodation at an affordable price. In many parts of Australia, particularly rural and regional areas, it does not exist anymore. We could talk about this issue for hours and hours, and I am sure we will get more opportunities as the months go on. But I think all of us on that committee have come away with an understanding that there is a really severe problem out there in Australia. It is a problem that should not exist today with the wealth and prosperity that this country enjoys. It is our job to do something about it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Social Welfare   Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,37,1,speech
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2003-10-16,"—I rise tonight to speak on Senator Hutchins's matter of public importance on poverty and the elimination of poverty. I am intrigued to find that Senator Hutchins is interested in the elimination of poverty because this is a subject on which it is recorded that someone made a demand about 2,000 years ago. I think the answer to that particular demand was salutary as well. Possibly Senator Hutchins was affected by his recent success in his preselection, getting the No. 1 position on the New South Wales ticket and knocking off someone who is rather more important in the opposition ranks that he is. Perhaps it has gone to his head and he is moving on to the next level of achievement.
—What number will you get in Victoria?
—Probably fourth! However, poverty is a real issue; it is not just an issue for someone to come into this house and make a lot of noise about. I think Senator Forshaw unfairly reflected on Senator Humphries in saying that his attitude was unusual. In fact, Senator Humphries's care and concern and his knowledge about poverty issues are quite common amongst coalition members. Senator Forshaw was talking about the people we met and the volunteers in the community—the decent, caring people who help people who are unfortunate. I am sorry that Senator Forshaw did not talk to these people in more depth. He would have found that most of those people are in fact coalition voters.  
However, Senator Forshaw is quite right in saying that poverty is a real issue and we recognise it. The real issue is not that these people in the community cannot pay for essentials. The real question we need to ask is: what are these people paying for that does not leave them enough money to pay for essentials? As Senator Forshaw and Senator Hutchins said, Australia is a First World country. So why do we have this problem of the Third World countries?
The coalition believes that the best way of eliminating poverty is to make sure that everyone has a job. This government has set out to achieve this and has succeeded in providing employment opportunities for more Australians than ever before—certainly many more than during Labor's 13 years. For the benefit of Senator Hutchins, who brought this matter of public importance to the chamber, can I remind him that in Sydney's central western statistical region, the region in which his office is based, unemployment reached 20.7 cent under the previous Labor government. According to the latest quarterly regional labour force statistics update issued today, unemployment in his region is now at 5.8 per cent—about a third of what it used to be. For the benefit of Senator Forshaw, who just spoke on this matter, in the region where his office is located, the St George and Sutherland shire, unemployment in the Labor years was 8.8 per cent. Obviously Senator Forshaw lives in an area of much more affluent suburbs. By comparison, today's figures show that unemployment in the St George and Sutherland shire has dropped to a low 3.3 per cent. Overall in New South Wales, where these two worthy senators come from, unemployment is roughly half the rate it was when it peaked under Labor at 10.8 per cent. So this government has achieved a great deal in making sure that people do have jobs. But let me acknowledge that poverty is a perennial problem and we can never get rid of it. 
There are two kinds of poverty in the community: absolute poverty and relative poverty. I want to talk about one group of people in Australia who are living in absolute poverty, however you measure it—people who live in Third World conditions in this First World country. I speak of the Indigenous community. The wellbeing of Aboriginal people in Australia has improved in absolute terms under the Howard government in areas such as school retention and tertiary education. There is no doubt about that. We heard this afternoon from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, that record amounts of money and effort are going into trying to solve the problem of Indigenous disadvantage—rising from $1.2 billion in real terms in 1995-96, the year before we took over, to a record of $2.72 billion in this year's budget. We are targeting the key areas of employment, education, health and housing and are spending almost 30 per cent more than in 1996 in real terms.
This investment is delivering results that make a real difference to people's lives and opportunities. In education, for example, the government is committed to increasing the literacy and numeracy of Indigenous Australians. It is well known that children who can read and write have the best chance of going on to complete high school and tertiary education and to secure employment. That is the area we are focusing on. Evidence shows that there has been a significant improvement in that area since 1996. The proportion of Indigenous adults who left school before their 15th birthday has fallen from 44.2 per cent to 33.4 per cent—a one-third decrease. The proportion of Indigenous children who stay at school through to year 12 has increased by 30 per cent. Nearly 60,000 Indigenous people registered for post secondary vocational education and training in 2002. That is a record. It is double the 1996 figures. We have also seen Indigenous students enrolling in bachelor or higher degree courses increase by nearly 25 per cent. These are real achievements. 
In the employment area, between July 1999 and August 2003, under the government's Indigenous employment policies, over 18,500 Indigenous job seekers gained access to accredited training and employment through structured training and employment projects. Over 8,500 have found jobs through wage assistance. Things are getting better, but this is not to say that everything is good and we can sit back and be complacent. The living standards for Indigenous Australians have certainly improved markedly under the Howard government, and we will continue to work on that.
Earlier I was talking about relative poverty. Senator Hutchins was talking about comparing the top 20 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent of incomes. But Senator Hutchins does not take into account the fact that the actual difference is much less than his raw figures show, because of our tax structure. People on incomes in the bottom 20 per cent rarely have to pay any tax, whereas, on the marginal tax rate that those in the top 20 per cent are paying, half their income goes in tax. So it is not a real measure.
However, I can understand why the Labor Party think they have a solution to resolving the poverty problem by just taking this top 20 per cent and bottom 20 per cent comparison. The Labor Party have a simple solution: if we increase the number of people who are on low incomes—which they achieved in their 13 years, with no real growth in wages—then obviously the difference between the higher incomes and the lower incomes will decrease. The gap will decrease because, if you make everyone poor, there will be no relative poverty. North Korea has achieved that. Is that the Labor Party's policy—that we should have an economy and society like the North Koreans?

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-10-16,"—In the very short time I have I will go right to what we should be doing about this issue—that is, cooperating. Instead of arguing across the chamber about who is right, who is wrong, whose stats are right and whose stats are wrong, and talking about mind-boggling concepts such as moving the culture towards that of North Korea, we should be listening to the people who are working in this area, and most speakers have mentioned these people. What we have now, in Anti-Poverty Week in Australia, is an acknowledgement by the people who work in the community that there is poverty and that there can be achievements to overcome it in our society.
A wide and diverse group of church groups, as part of their action for this week in raising awareness and focus, have written to every government in the country—the federal government and all state and territory governments—telling us that it is about time that we did our job. They have said that there is poverty in our community and that, rather than arguing about what it is and what the stats are, we should be working cooperatively to address the issue. That should be the focus of our debate, rather than judgments about what causes poverty and whether it was worse in 1994 than it is now. When you talk to people who are suffering, you find that they do not really care whether it was worse in 1994 or 1954 or, in fact, whether it is going to be any worse in 2004. They are busy trying to survive.
I think that governments can achieve some kind of solution. The idea of a national forum which brings people together to work through the issues and identify how there can be a whole-of-government response is one that has absolute value. However, I have to admit that, having heard the debate we have had and the rationale that has been put forward, my fear—which we have raised through the committee—that it is going to degenerate into a lot of hot air and argument has been raised again. Certainly, I hope that through this debate we will be able to acknowledge that there are people who are suffering disadvantage in our community. 
We can take heart from the work that is being done, mainly by the volunteer organisations that Senator Greig and Senator Forshaw talked about and whom we have met—we know them. We can look at the statistics and at the argument and the definition that UnitingCare put up. Perhaps we can consider this definition:
Poverty exists. It's more than just income deprivation; it's about being vulnerable, excluded, different and feeling like you don't matter. The aim must be to empower and support individuals, families, communities and governments from the ground up, as we work together to build a just and compassionate society where everyone has access to the social opportunities and basic goods required to live a decent life.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-10-16,"—I seek leave to incorporate my remarks on this matter of public importance.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
The Australian Greens congratulate the community groups and religious leaders who have organised the first national Anti-Poverty Week. Their efforts remind us of the continuing injustice that exists in this wealthy land.
The Greens support the call for governments to convene a national forum to develop strategies for poverty reduction. We believe it is possible to eradicate poverty, not only in Australia but everywhere in the world. All that is required is the political will.
The Greens moved a motion earlier this week supporting a national forum and calling on the Commonwealth Government to lift its official development assistance to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product. We were disappointed that Labor could not support our motion.
Australia's overseas assistance contribution now sits at almost half the rate it was three decades ago—down from 0.48 per cent to 0.25 per cent. In constant 2002-03 prices, the monetary value of our assistance is a mere $400,000 million more than it was in 1971-72.
There are pressing needs overseas—to eliminate hunger and malnutrition; to provide access to safe drinking water; and to provide shelter. There is also much need in Australia.
Australia has recorded almost 12 years of economic growth and yet the proportion of our fellow citizens who live in poverty remains virtually unchanged from the time of the landmark Henderson poverty inquiry three decades ago.
Community groups estimate two million, four hundred thousand Australians live in poverty. That is more than one in every ten Australians.
There is debate about how we measure poverty and it is important to establish an agreed benchmark, but conservatives have used this matter as a diversionary tactic to turn the debate into one about numbers.
The fact of the matter is that members of our community are struggling every day to provide for their most basic needs of shelter and nutritious food.
They are excluded from the kind of life that many of us take for granted, and they are excluded from participating fully in the economic, social and cultural life of our nation. They are denied the right to live with dignity—a fundamental human right—and they are denied the right to be full citizens.
The Greens are working for a socially responsible society where everyone contributes according to their ability and resources, and where the community ensures that no-one need do without the necessities of life. 
We want a world that shares its resources equitably, within and between nations, and from one generation to the next. We will achieve such a world when citizens support these objectives, when they demand governments do likewise, and when governments commit to achieve them.
Economic growth, measured in conventional terms, has made no appreciable impact on poverty in this country. Left to the market, it never will. That is why governments must intervene to redistribute wealth and to fund basic services such as health, education, income support and public housing.
The most fundamental change required to eradicate poverty in Australia is tax reform. We need progressive taxation—not a regressive goods and services tax.
We need an end to the loopholes, tax concessions and rebates that go to those who do not need them. We need to find a way to reduce the tax levels on people moving from income support to paid work, particularly on low wages, whose marginal tax rates are as high as 80 per cent.
We don't need more $4-a-week income tax cuts like the ones this year that squandered $2.4 billion worth of public funds. Surplus Commonwealth funds should go to assisting those most in need, not fiddling with the top tax bracket, and they should be invested in the social wage—those services that benefit all of us directly or indirectly, like education, health care, childcare, and public transport.
Instead, the government is trying to privatise health and education: pushing people into private health insurance, turning Medicare into a safety net, channelling more funds to private schools, and foisting a higher burden of debt on university students.
Joblessness is the major cause of poverty yet in 12 years of economic growth we have made almost no inroads into the unemployment rate. While official unemployment has dropped slightly to 5.8 per cent we know that this measurement does not reflect reality.
Close to one million Australians are discouraged job seekers. Almost half the workforce is employed part-time or as casuals, with few entitlements and little or no security.
The government wastes the parliament's time introducing bill after bill aimed at making it more difficult for working people to maintain and improve their working conditions and pay while it does nothing to rein in obscene executive salaries and options, and continues to provide corporate tax breaks.
Those without paid work are vilified, and subjected to a punitive breaching regime that has deprived people of $1 billion since 1996, an approach that creates not one more job—which is the real issue.
We need a concerted effort to generate employment, to improve the security of work, and to fund the many socially useful and environmentally beneficial tasks that need doing.
We need to provide adequate income support for carers, to fund a national paid parental leave scheme, and to make childcare more affordable and more widely available.
And we need to provide adequate financial and other support for those who cannot work or who choose to make their contribution to society in other useful ways.
We can create a society where everyone's needs are met; where everyone is able to participate fully in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the nation, but we need to change our priorities and make a firm commitment that we desire an Australia free of poverty.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-10-16,"—Since this inquiry completed its public hearings, there have been significant developments in relation to uranium mining at Jabiluka. Two months ago the Northern Territory government approved an application by mining company Energy Resources of Australia, or ERA, to return over 50,000 tonnes of uranium ore extracted during Jabiluka's construction and to seal the mine opening. Whilst these steps do not eliminate forever the possibility of the mine proceeding—against the wishes of the traditional owners; in the heart of a World Heritage area—they are significant steps towards this end.
Since the proposal to mine uranium at Jabiluka was first touted, there has been tremendous opposition from both the traditional owners and the broader community. The election of the Howard government—with its support for the nuclear industry—prompted the latest push for mining in the area, which has been the focus of a 30-year conflict between the proposals to mine uranium at Jabiluka and the rights of traditional owners to control their land. Community opposition swelled and at its high point in 1998 around 5,000 people camped in Kakadu at the invitation of the Mirrar traditional owners as part of the campaign to stop the mine proceeding. I was fortunate enough to be able to spend four months sleeping under the stars and surrounded by the beauty of the Kakadu world heritage area, adding my voice to the call to stop mining on Mirrar land. Opinion polls at the time showed that two-thirds of Australians opposed the uranium mine. 
To be at the point that we are now in the struggle to stop uranium mining at Jabiluka is testament to the fervent and continued opposition of the Mirrar traditional owners, the countless environmentalists, peace activists and others who banded together to fight this proposal. They demonstrated that the collective voices of committed and passionate individuals can ensure that community concerns triumph over powerful interests. Negotiations between the traditional owners and the mining company are proceeding towards ratification of an agreement to give the Mirrar people legal veto rights over any future development at Jabiluka. The Mirrar have been resolute in their opposition to mining. Last year Yvonne Margarula, the senior traditional owner of the Mirrar people, declared:
We will continue to resist more mining on Mirrar country. We have no choice—this is our land and our life, we can never leave, we must protect it.
The Senate inquiry was my first inquiry since becoming a senator. Having spent so long campaigning against uranium mining, specifically at Jabiluka, the issues involved continue to hold a personal significance for me.
Visiting the in situ leachate mine in South Australia was a very different experience, with no open-cut sore on the landscape. But the wells across the minefield that pump dissolved uranium and other metals into the aquifers below are of little comfort to anyone concerned about the sustainability of our environment and natural water reservoirs. The committee's report contains many important recommendations to improve environmental regulation of uranium mining, including that uranium mining at Honeymoon not proceed unless and until conclusive evidence can be presented to demonstrate that the relevant aquifer is isolated from the aquifer below it. The terms of reference of the inquiry were not broad enough to address the question of whether the industry that I consider the most dangerous and destructive industry that humans have devised has any place on our planet. The inquiry was initiated following leaks and spills that had occurred at uranium mines in Australia. The report found:
The frequency of leaks and spills is evidence that self-regulation by the mining companies has failed to prevent incidents which have the potential to cause significant environmental damage.
Just one day after the tabling of the report on Tuesday in the Senate, there was a spill at South Australia's Olympic Dam uranium mine. At 7.30 p.m. yesterday, around 110,000 litres of radioactive liquid spilled at Olympic Dam. The South Australian environment minister, John Hill, was reported in the media today as saying that the liquid left over from the extraction process contained 29 parts per million of uranium. The EPA Chief Executive, Paul Vogel, was reported today saying that it would take some weeks before his agency's investigation was complete and the cause of the spill would be known. He said details of the spill would also be included in the EPA audit of Western Mining Corporation, scheduled to occur next month. He said:
We are treating this as a serious incident, but the fact that it's a radioactive spill I guess raises the concerns to another level from a community aspect. The worst case scenario in a significant spill would be that the ground would become contaminated and, in turn, the ground water would become contaminated. This did not happen in this instance. The environmental harm is negligible.
Yet this spill just one day after the tabling of the report in the Senate clearly indicates that this continues to be an industry for which self-regulation is not resolving these continual instances of leaks and spills.
In the Australian Greens additional comments to this report—which were also supported by Senator Allison—we sought to deal with the broader issues of the rights of traditional owners to control their land, especially with proposals to mine uranium on their land. Many of the comments received by the inquiry related to the Commonwealth Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and its implementation. The act continues to be the focus of a range of Indigenous organisations looking for improvements to the role of Indigenous people in shaping and controlling the future of their communities and their land. The Australian Greens believe that we should be shutting down the nuclear industry in Australia and this committee report, the spill at Olympic Dam and recent developments relating to Jabiluka take us in this direction. Australian governments must heed this call and give Australians the nuclear-free future that we all deserve.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I also rise note to take note of the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. Our terms of reference were to look at the way uranium mines in the Northern Territory, being Ranger and Jabiluka, and in South Australia, being Beverley and Honeymoon, are monitored and regulated and at whether or not the legislation and the regulations that control what happens are adequate. We as a committee took the time, went to those mines and had hearings in Darwin and Jabiru. We went down to Adelaide and out to both Beverley and Honeymoon. It was an extensive Senate inquiry and one into which everyone put a lot of effort.
There has been some suggestion in the media, particularly in the Northern Territory, that this inquiry was manipulated by those who would like to see no uranium mining happen in this country. This is an inquiry that was initiated by the Labor Party in response to the numerous leaks, spills and accidents that occurred in early 2001, to the extent that as a party we were not satisfied that the analysis, the explanations, the reports and particularly the follow-up in relation to those spills and leaks were adequate.
Through the course of the estimates process, it came to my attention that there were instances where the Office of the Supervising Scientist had asked and relied on the mining company ERA to provide it with advice on the adequacy or otherwise of the aftermath of the spills and where recommendations concerning the environmental regulations of Jabiluka could have been more stringently applied—that is, the environmental regulations controlling Jabiluka are not in any sort of legislated form. In reviewing some of the accidents that have occurred at Jabiluka, the independent body of the Office of the Supervising Scientist could have made the recommendation that those regulations become a legislative requirement. As a result of the gaps and holes in the way in which these mines were being regulated and monitored, the committee set about its task.
It is fair to say that in the course of our inquiry we found a lot more holes and a lot more gaps in what was happening in the mining of uranium, but not to the point where—and we were never going to suggest this—that uranium mining in this country should cease. In fact, the executive summary clearly says that. It says:
Uranium mining is contentious but the Committee was not asked to examine the validity of the industry's existence.
We did not do that. We simply looked at whether or not the current system of environmental regulation for these mines was effective or adequate. We found in some areas that it is not effective and certainly not adequate. There were patterns of underperformance and noncompliance. There were gaps in knowledge. There was an absence of reliable data. More particularly, the operations and the environmental regulations of those mines look more at short-term considerations of the here and now rather than any potential and permanent damage to the environment in the long term. That, I think, is one of the significant flaws. 
I notice that my colleague from the Northern Territory continues to say that there has never been any proof that the environment has been severely damaged. There has never been any evidence that it has been well maintained and well kept by these mines either. The fact of the matter is, time and time again, the environmental regulations controlling these mines are breached and nothing ever happens. There are no penalties and no prosecutions. The companies are never taken to task other than the OSS wandering out there, taking a look at what happened and writing another report with a couple of recommendations on it, which a couple of months later the federal government may or may not adopt. The whole compliance regime needs an overhaul. Certainly it was the view of the committee that there needed to be in place sanctions, penalties or some form of more stringent control to ensure that, if the environmental regulations were breached, something could be done about it.
We picked up the recommendations of the Northern Territory Department of Business, Industry and Resource Development, which just prior to our hearings in Darwin had conducted a review of their department. Even their own internal review—to their credit—had said that there needed to be the development of a comprehensive enforcement policy for Jabiluka, which the committee has accepted, recommended and adopted. The Northern Territory government department had also said that the mine management plans and authorisations for the mines needed to be better devised and that information strategies for government agencies designed to address public perceptions needed to be introduced. Even the Northern Territory government had done a review of what happens and had come up with some recommendations for improvements. So to simply say that this report is a whitewash—that there was a predetermined outcome at the beginning and that the industry is doing fine, needs 10 gold stars and a big tick—is not the case. There was evidence and departments, like the Northern Territory industry and resource development department, have identified that there are holes and gaps in the process.
We also identified that joint and separate responsibilities need to be spelt out clearly for the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments with respect to the monitoring of mines in the Northern Territory and for the committees that oversee what happens in the Northern Territory. The roles and responsibilities of committees—such as the Alligator Rivers Region Consultative Committee, the Alligator Rivers Region Technical Committee and the mine site technical committees—clearly need to be outlined and defined, and that is not the case. There is a lot of duplication and there are a lot of areas where some of these committees have no oversight or fail to coordinate what they are doing. As I have already mentioned, the environmental requirements attached to the mining lease and the land rights agreement for Jabiluka need to be updated and need to be enshrined in relevant Northern Territory legislation.
We also had a look at, and made some comments about, the relationship that these mining companies have with the traditional owners. Clearly one of the things that came out of this inquiry—which, I must say, is to the credit of ERA and Rio Tinto—is that there have been improvements in this area to establish a better relationship with the traditional owners in respect of the two mines in the Northern Territory. We suggested there needed to be a culturally appropriate forum for the traditional owners and the Aboriginal people to be able to sit down with the mining company and get a clear understanding of what happens when there is a leak or a breach of the regulations. That information needs to be conveyed to them as easily as possible so that there is an understanding of what it all means. 
I think there also needs to be, and the committee has picked this up, the capacity for the traditional owners to commission independent research because—although the Kakadu Regional Social Impact Study had been conducted and a committee had been set up, that committee has pretty much come to a standstill now—there is still much work to be done in relation to the social and environmental impacts of mining operations in the Northern Territory. Also, there needs to be improvements in the relationship with Indigenous people when it comes to the two mines in South Australia.
In closing, I do note that the mining company, in consultation with the Mirrar people, have agreed to backfill the stockpile at Jabiluka. I understand that process is well and truly on the way. That is a very positive sign of a mining company working with traditional people to respect their decision to not mine on their land unless they are ready to give approval. It has also been a very good example of where mining companies can sit around the table with Indigenous people and come to an agreement with a win-win outcome. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I also rise note to take note of the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. Our terms of reference were to look at the way uranium mines in the Northern Territory, being Ranger and Jabiluka, and in South Australia, being Beverley and Honeymoon, are monitored and regulated and at whether or not the legislation and the regulations that control what happens are adequate. We as a committee took the time, went to those mines and had hearings in Darwin and Jabiru. We went down to Adelaide and out to both Beverley and Honeymoon. It was an extensive Senate inquiry and one into which everyone put a lot of effort.
There has been some suggestion in the media, particularly in the Northern Territory, that this inquiry was manipulated by those who would like to see no uranium mining happen in this country. This is an inquiry that was initiated by the Labor Party in response to the numerous leaks, spills and accidents that occurred in early 2001, to the extent that as a party we were not satisfied that the analysis, the explanations, the reports and particularly the follow-up in relation to those spills and leaks were adequate.
Through the course of the estimates process, it came to my attention that there were instances where the Office of the Supervising Scientist had asked and relied on the mining company ERA to provide it with advice on the adequacy or otherwise of the aftermath of the spills and where recommendations concerning the environmental regulations of Jabiluka could have been more stringently applied—that is, the environmental regulations controlling Jabiluka are not in any sort of legislated form. In reviewing some of the accidents that have occurred at Jabiluka, the independent body of the Office of the Supervising Scientist could have made the recommendation that those regulations become a legislative requirement. As a result of the gaps and holes in the way in which these mines were being regulated and monitored, the committee set about its task.
It is fair to say that in the course of our inquiry we found a lot more holes and a lot more gaps in what was happening in the mining of uranium, but not to the point where—and we were never going to suggest this—that uranium mining in this country should cease. In fact, the executive summary clearly says that. It says:
Uranium mining is contentious but the Committee was not asked to examine the validity of the industry's existence.
We did not do that. We simply looked at whether or not the current system of environmental regulation for these mines was effective or adequate. We found in some areas that it is not effective and certainly not adequate. There were patterns of underperformance and noncompliance. There were gaps in knowledge. There was an absence of reliable data. More particularly, the operations and the environmental regulations of those mines look more at short-term considerations of the here and now rather than any potential and permanent damage to the environment in the long term. That, I think, is one of the significant flaws. 
I notice that my colleague from the Northern Territory continues to say that there has never been any proof that the environment has been severely damaged. There has never been any evidence that it has been well maintained and well kept by these mines either. The fact of the matter is, time and time again, the environmental regulations controlling these mines are breached and nothing ever happens. There are no penalties and no prosecutions. The companies are never taken to task other than the OSS wandering out there, taking a look at what happened and writing another report with a couple of recommendations on it, which a couple of months later the federal government may or may not adopt. The whole compliance regime needs an overhaul. Certainly it was the view of the committee that there needed to be in place sanctions, penalties or some form of more stringent control to ensure that, if the environmental regulations were breached, something could be done about it.
We picked up the recommendations of the Northern Territory Department of Business, Industry and Resource Development, which just prior to our hearings in Darwin had conducted a review of their department. Even their own internal review—to their credit—had said that there needed to be the development of a comprehensive enforcement policy for Jabiluka, which the committee has accepted, recommended and adopted. The Northern Territory government department had also said that the mine management plans and authorisations for the mines needed to be better devised and that information strategies for government agencies designed to address public perceptions needed to be introduced. Even the Northern Territory government had done a review of what happens and had come up with some recommendations for improvements. So to simply say that this report is a whitewash—that there was a predetermined outcome at the beginning and that the industry is doing fine, needs 10 gold stars and a big tick—is not the case. There was evidence and departments, like the Northern Territory industry and resource development department, have identified that there are holes and gaps in the process.
We also identified that joint and separate responsibilities need to be spelt out clearly for the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments with respect to the monitoring of mines in the Northern Territory and for the committees that oversee what happens in the Northern Territory. The roles and responsibilities of committees—such as the Alligator Rivers Region Consultative Committee, the Alligator Rivers Region Technical Committee and the mine site technical committees—clearly need to be outlined and defined, and that is not the case. There is a lot of duplication and there are a lot of areas where some of these committees have no oversight or fail to coordinate what they are doing. As I have already mentioned, the environmental requirements attached to the mining lease and the land rights agreement for Jabiluka need to be updated and need to be enshrined in relevant Northern Territory legislation.
We also had a look at, and made some comments about, the relationship that these mining companies have with the traditional owners. Clearly one of the things that came out of this inquiry—which, I must say, is to the credit of ERA and Rio Tinto—is that there have been improvements in this area to establish a better relationship with the traditional owners in respect of the two mines in the Northern Territory. We suggested there needed to be a culturally appropriate forum for the traditional owners and the Aboriginal people to be able to sit down with the mining company and get a clear understanding of what happens when there is a leak or a breach of the regulations. That information needs to be conveyed to them as easily as possible so that there is an understanding of what it all means. 
I think there also needs to be, and the committee has picked this up, the capacity for the traditional owners to commission independent research because—although the Kakadu Regional Social Impact Study had been conducted and a committee had been set up, that committee has pretty much come to a standstill now—there is still much work to be done in relation to the social and environmental impacts of mining operations in the Northern Territory. Also, there needs to be improvements in the relationship with Indigenous people when it comes to the two mines in South Australia.
In closing, I do note that the mining company, in consultation with the Mirrar people, have agreed to backfill the stockpile at Jabiluka. I understand that process is well and truly on the way. That is a very positive sign of a mining company working with traditional people to respect their decision to not mine on their land unless they are ready to give approval. It has also been a very good example of where mining companies can sit around the table with Indigenous people and come to an agreement with a win-win outcome. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-10-16,"—I rise tonight to totally reject the claims that were made by the Australian Labor Party in this place today that the government is considering cuts to child care. The Australian government's commitment to supporting child care remains at the record level of $8 billion for the next four years. We have spent 70 per cent more on child care over the last six years than Labor did in their last six years in office. Today Senator Collins asserted in question time that a consultant's report commissioned by the government has recommended that operational subsidies be cut to family day care. Senator Collins said:
... now that this report has been released, we do know that it recommends stripping operational support for family day care. There is no way the government can move from that now.
I challenge Senator Collins to point to where in the consultant's report the words `recommends stripping operational support for family day care' are mentioned. They are not—not once. Senator Collins needs to explain herself to the Senate and to the 85,000 Australian families who are using family day care.
By way of background, in September 2002 the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony, announced that the Australian government was to look at the funding arrangements for child-care services and for support services other than child-care benefit. This funding allocation is known as the child-care support broadband and was around $180 million last financial year. A process of widespread consultation was undertaken to ensure that all stakeholders had the opportunity to put their views as to how this funding should be focused. While these processes can take some time, Minister Anthony made a commitment to take this approach because it was very important to this government that everyone be given the chance to have their say. More than 450 formal submissions were received and there were meetings held around Australia. The report from the consultants was released today.
—How long have you had it? How long has the minister sat on the report?
—The Australian Labor Party had every opportunity to participate in this process but chose not to. Madam Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to the remarks I am making, and suggest that Senator Crossin might learn something if she listens to them.
—Predictably, the Labor Party have taken the easy road over the last 12 months. Even in the Senate today, instead of making a meaningful contribution they chose to try to scare Australian families who use family day care. This government has consistently said that this review is not about cutting costs, trimming budgets or spending less on child care.
—Nothing was quarantined from consideration, no preconceived ideas were taken into the review and there is no hidden agenda. It is about providing greater support to the child-care sector as a whole to ensure the needs of families and children using child care are able to be met. Policy development and serious contributions to debate are all too hard for the opposition—other than a constant stream of interjections to try to reinforce negative comments made in the Senate that I have already pointed out were substantially misleading. 
This government is committed to supporting the range of child-care choices it has made available to Australian families, and Minister Anthony has reaffirmed that a number of times. Parents and carers should be reassured that, contrary to the claims made in this chamber by Senator Collins today, the family day care system is a valued care choice for families. This government has no intention of making decisions that are not in the best interests of children, their parents and the availability of quality child-care services. Child care is, and always has been, an important component of the government's work-and-family policy development. The broadband review must also be considered in the context of other developments in this area. Family day care makes a great contribution to the lives of families and their children in Australia. There are 123,000 Australian children in family day care. The Australian government values and supports the work they do around the country. 
—Senator Marshall, who has just come into the chamber and clearly has not heard the first half of this speech, would do very well to listen to the remainder of my speech so that he too will not get up in this place and mislead the chamber as Senator Collins did earlier today in question time. I reaffirm that this government has no intention of abandoning family day care or taking any steps that will not be in the long-term interests of children and the availability of quality, accessible and affordable child care that is valued by parents and the rest of the community. Senator Collins should come into this chamber at the earliest opportunity and explain herself to the Senate and to the tens of thousands of Australian families who use family day care and whom she misled in this chamber today.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Family Services: Child Care</title>,Adjournment,42,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-10-16,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1) and (2) Sea 1405 comprises five phases:
	Phases 1 and 2, approved before the 2000 Defence Capability Plan, are currently in progress and will provide electronic support measures and forward-looking infra-red capability for inclusion into the aircraft. The original contract stipulated prototype acceptance in 2001, with final production aircraft to be delivered in 2003. Acceptance of the prototype helicopter is now scheduled for early 2004, with the final production aircraft to be delivered in 2005.
The remaining phases include:
	Phase 3 (year of decision 2002-03 and currently scheduled to be completed during 2003-04) is a Defence Science and Technology-sponsored project definition study to consider options for the later phases.
	Phase 3B, (year of decision 2003-04, and, subject to the phase 3 study outcomes, currently scheduled to be completed during 2003-04) is an initial design activity, which will lead to the implementation of the approved outcomes of the Phase 3 project definition study.
	Phase 4 (year of decision 2004-05, with delivery currently scheduled for 2007, subject to the phase 3 study and design outcomes) will provide a mid-life upgrade to the Seahawk addressing aircraft capabilities, life cycle costing, operational availability, commonality and life-of-type issues. The requirement for the current planned delivery date will be considered in the current review of the Defence Capability Plan.
As foreshadowed in the Defence Capability Plan Supplement 2002 (at page 15), Defence plans to include Sea 1405 Phases 3, 3B and 4 within the structure of the ADF Helicopter Strategic Master Plan - Air 9000. A decision on this approach will be taken in the context of the current Defence Capability Plan review. 
(3)	Sea 1405 Phases 1 and 2 were approved before the 2000 Defence White Paper, with estimated expenditure of the order of $170m.
The Defence Capability Plan 2001-2010 shows the estimated expenditure for the remaining phases:
	Phase 3 is less than $10m.
	Phase 3B is $10m - $20m.
	Phase 4 is $450m - $600m.
These estimates have not been varied.
(4)	See response to part (2).
(5)	No, although the requirement for the current planned delivery date will be considered in the current review of the Defence Capability Plan.
(6)	A schedule change may delay the enhancement of the S-70B-2 Seahawk capabilities.
(7)	No.
(8)	See response to part (3).
(9)	Expenditure to date on phase 1 and 2 has been of the order of $135m. Phase 3 expenditure to date has been less than $5m.
(10)	No, other than the normal adjustment for price and exchange variations.
(11)	Phases 1, 2 and 3 are approved and are in progress.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Sea 1405 Projects</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,44,1,answer
