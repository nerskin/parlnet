"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-05-09,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Maritime Crew) Bill 2007. The bill creates a new class of temporary visa to be known as a maritime crew visa. The application process for the new visa will enable crew to be appropriately security cleared before they enter Australia.
In 2005, approximately 585,000 maritime crew travelled to Australia. The maritime crew visa will enable crew to be appropriately security cleared before they enter Australia. The new requirement under this bill will become mandatory as of 1 January 2008. Those requirements must include a valid passport, a maritime crew visa and documents establishing the crew member’s employment on the vessel. This measure, which Labor has been demanding for some time, will ensure that this area does have something in place. Our national security is far too important to have a regular point of border entry through which people who have not been subjected to appropriate security checks can enter. Labor welcomes the fact that the maritime crew visa sets in place a reporting regime for foreign maritime workers coming to Australia, but the fact that shipping agents will be able to apply on behalf of members of crew indicates that ASIO and Australian Federal Police assessments that will occur may not be as comprehensive as required.
Currently, foreign non-military maritime crew and their families are not required to make a formal application for a visa before coming to Australia. Special purpose visas are currently granted by operation of law. At present, maritime crew are granted special purpose visas on arrival in Australia, following checks against the Department of Immigration and Citizenship movement alert list. This process does not permit security checks to be conducted before the crew of these ships are allowed to enter Australia—an issue that Labor has been saying for some time now does need to be addressed.
The delay by the government in introducing a security checked visa for maritime crew is hard to understand. It has taken almost 6½ years since 11 September 2001 for this government to act in this regard. The government has only now adopted what has been a longstanding Labor Party policy to vet foreign maritime workers. Labor has consistently raised concerns about foreign vessels whose crews have not been security vetted and which potentially carry—and do carry—thousands of tonnes of explosives around coastal Australia. In 2005, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute published a damning report on the state of Australia’s security arrangements called Future unknown: the terrorist threat to Australian maritime security. That report identified the dangers of foreign flagged vessels carrying dangerous goods around the Australian coastline. This is a warning Labor has repeatedly made to this government. We have specifically warned about the dangers of foreign crewed, foreign flagged vessels, for which there has been no security check, carrying ammonium nitrate around the Australian coastline. We have also pointed out that Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah have acquired the skills and opportunities to launch a maritime terrorist attack. These groups operate in South-East Asian waters near to our borders—waters in which the incidence of piracy is the highest in the world. On the last available figures, there are two acts of piracy per week in the waters just to our north-north-west, exactly in the area in which those terrorist organisations operate.
Labor’s spokesperson on homeland security has reported that United States intelligence sources observed that the al-Qaeda group is suspected of owning or having a long-term charter fleet of between 15 and 18 bulk general cargo vessels. Whilst it is believed that they are used to generate revenue to support the group or to provide logistics for the terrorist network, it is not far fetched to imagine that one of these vessels could be used as a floating bomb on a suicide mission, making use of explosives like ammonium nitrate.
Against that background, there is the failure of the Howard government to ensure that these dangerous chemicals are handled by crews who have been properly checked and cleared. At the moment, that applies only to Australian crews. It is something that needs to be addressed. It is a disgrace that it has been allowed to go on for so long. We know that al-Qaeda has access to maritime vessels, expertise in maritime terrorism, expertise in explosives and access to those explosives, and yet we find that the Howard government has dragged its feet in upgrading maritime security.
Australian maritime workers, in contrast, must apply for an Australian Federal Police and ASIO background check to acquire their maritime security identification card, commonly known as an MSIC. Under the Howard government, though, foreign maritime workers do not undergo similar checks when they carry thousands of tonnes of explosives into and around Australia. It is dangerous and irresponsible that that has gone on. It has been a disturbing national security failure of the Howard government not to have this concern addressed. While the government has improved security among Australian flagged ships, it is still of great concern that invasive security and criminal background checks are not conducted on foreign crews.
Furthermore, this government has misused the process of giving permits to foreign crewed ships to travel around Australian ports. There has been a system in place for many years to enable foreign crewed ships to operate the Australian coastal route by special permit. While that appears to be nothing short of a sensible process, this government has actually used it as a tool to attack the Australian crewed ships and their economic viability around Australian ports. As the shadow minister for homeland security and territories has repeatedly said, this government has seemingly handed out these permits like confetti. The government has not done the security checks on the foreign crews that are done for Australian crews, and that is, to this point, unacceptable.
While the government needs to provide more support to the Australian shipping industry, this bill at least goes some way in addressing the issue of security checks on foreign maritime crews. While the bill will enable crews to be appropriately security cleared before entering Australia, it also contains some sensible measures to allow the visa to be ceased by declaration where it is considered undesirable for a person or class of persons to travel to, enter or remain in Australia. The bill also includes an express power to revoke such a declaration to allow for situations where additional information may come to light about a person’s suitability to travel to or remain in Australia.
Labor understands that the detail governing the new maritime crew visa will be set out in the migration regulations. We will have a look at those when they become available—the earlier the better. The government, though, has allocated $100 million over five years for the introduction of the visa. In a media release dated 22 December 2005, the government announced the $100 million maritime crew visa system for all international seafarers visiting Australian ports after July 2007. The breakdown of that was announced as:
... $55.3 million for IT systems associated with the new visa and to record sea crew movement records; employ 19 additional Regional Seaports Officers to assist industry with the new visa, conduct vessel boardings and manage compliance and employ additional staff in DIMIA’s Entry Operations Centre to support the shipping industry.
The media release also detailed:
The Australian Customs Service will receive $39.5m for 66 new Customs Officers to enforce the new provisions as part of Customs’ vessel clearance process and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will receive $5.5m under the package.
The cost of the proposed visa, in particular $30 million for an additional 66 Customs officers, was of course queried by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and it was explained this way by the Australian Customs Service:
[Currently] seventy-five per cent of all first-port arriving vessels will be boarded by Customs on a risk assess basis. That is the minimum. However, there is no time restriction. Under these new arrangements ... there is a requirement to undertake the physical checking within one hour of the vessel actually arriving. In order for us to meet that requirement in some of these ports we need to increase our staffing accordingly. Around Australia we have quite small ports where we need to increase our staffing to achieve that aim.
It is imperative that this money is being spent to improve Australia’s national security at our ports along our coastline. It is overdue and much needed.
Despite the fact that this government regularly claims to be tough on border security, we not only have the long delay that the government has had in introducing this bill; we have a situation where Indonesian fishermen are regularly illegally entering Australian waters. There was a period of increased sightings of illegal fishing operations in the Australian exclusive economic zone by Coastwatch and the Australian Defence Force assets. More recently it has been reported that there has been a fall in the number of sightings, but we will be able to have another look at that at estimates. However, there has been a reported shortfall in aerial surveillance by Coastwatch over our northern waters. This has combined with the unavailability of the Navy’s Armidale class naval vessel patrol boats, which have been struck with problems and are apparently in repair dock.
The Armidale class naval vessel patrol boats are used by the Navy to intercept illegal fishers. They work in conjunction with Customs. In September 2006, problems were detected with the fuel system and the Armidale fleet was sidelined. In February 2007, it was confirmed that the problems were still occurring and were proving difficult to fix. According to the Navy’s website, the Armidale class was supposed to improve Navy’s capability to intercept and apprehend vessels in a greater range of sea conditions, increasing surveillance, which will better protect Australia’s coastline. It is disturbing news to find that the ships are having problems. It represents some five months that we have been relying on stopgap measures. We have had to use the Fremantle class patrol boats to assist in patrolling our northern waters.
It is clear this government is simply not on top of its responsibilities with regard to border security in our northern waters. More needs to be done. After examining the bill, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee recommended that the Senate support the bill. The committee report noted that all submissions to the committee expressed in principle support for strengthening Australia’s border security arrangements. However, concerns were still raised. The Maritime Union of Australia queried the effectiveness of the maritime crew visa in closing a gap in maritime security.
The Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Australian Customs Service advised that the proposed maritime crew visa had a number of features that would improve security over existing arrangements. These features would include: the visa application would require more comprehensive information against which security organisations could make checks; and the applications would be an ongoing source of information on individuals seeking to travel to Australia as crew on non-military ships, thus allowing more cross-checking with other information sources. There would be an ability to infringe the masters, owners, charterers and operators of ships for carrying improperly documented passengers and crew to Australia and there would be an increase in the number of Customs officers assigned to ports to enable all ships to be physically checked within one hour of the vessel arriving.
The Department of Immigration and Citizenship responded to some of the concerns of the MUA but also stated that for the first six months following the implementation of the proposed maritime crew visa the department would be encouraging people to use the visa but not penalising those who did not. So it seems that any unexpected problems could be resolved during that time.
Labor has been critical and continues to be critical of the government’s careless and widespread use of single and continuing voyage permits for foreign vessels with foreign crews who do not undergo appropriate security checks. It has also criticised the government for permitting foreign flag of convenience ships to carry dangerous goods on coastal shipping routes and failing to ensure ships provide details of crew and cargo 48 hours before arrival. It is clear that more needs to be done. Despite its delayed introduction, this bill, as I have said, is a welcome measure. It is not the comprehensive solution the government touted that it might be back in 2005 when it was first mooted. However, as I have said, it does go some way to addressing some of the problems.
I take this opportunity to thank the secretariat, the Chair and the Deputy Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for the work they have done. Perhaps this is also the first opportunity in the chamber to recognise that the previous chair of the committee has moved to a different committee and we now have a new committee member. I place on record my appreciation of the work of the previous committee chair, Senator Marise Payne, who worked diligently and tirelessly on the committee over many years, representing the coalition’s interests on that committee. She also ensured that the minor parties and opposition received a fair go at the witnesses. I put that on the record for those who might be interested.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (MARITIME CREW) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-05-09,"—I start by noting the Democrats’ support for the Migration Amendment (Maritime Crew) Bill 2007 and by concurring generally with Senator Ludwig’s remarks about the outgoing Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Senator Payne. I am not sure that all her colleagues would always think she was representing the coalition’s interests collectively in every action she took, but, much more importantly, she was representing the interests of the Senate, and the public more broadly, and she is widely acknowledged as doing so. That committee is a good example, and one I have often pointed to, of a Senate committee that does the wider job of examining legislation on its merits rather than coming to it from a predetermined political position of an individual political party. I am sure the new chair will follow in the same vein.
As I said, the Democrats support this legislation. It is one case where the terminology ‘strengthening the integrity of Australia’s borders’ is being accurately used because it does actually do that. The phrases ‘border protection’ or ‘border security’ are catch-all, feel-good labels that get attached to a lot of things, in many cases in circumstances where they are not appropriate. Border protection and border security are about knowing who comes into the country and what they might bring in with them, whether it is goods, diseases, pathogens, fire ants or all sorts of things. That is what border security is about. The phrase ‘border protection’ is often used in the context of asylum seekers. But, as the now departed Senator Vanstone used to say sometimes when she was using her capacity for straight talking that many people have acknowledged favourably in recent times, asylum seekers want to be found. They arrive here and say: ‘Here we are; come and get us. Please get our details and listen to us.’ This is completely different from people who come into the country unauthorised—trying to get in without other people being aware of it—and about whom we simply do not have details.
That is really what this legislation goes to—actually having the necessary and accurate processes in place to determine the details of people who are coming here. That is what real border protection and integrity are about. As indicated in Senator Ludwig’s contribution, a lot of these measures have been in the pipeline for a while. The issue more broadly has needed to be identified. If we are talking genuinely about the need to step up the security around who enters the country—an issue that people have looked at more closely following September 2001 and the World Trade Centre attacks—then this is the sort of thing we should be looking at. The fact that we have had so many resources, so much political frenzy and so many legislative changes railroaded through here with regard to people who did not present any border security or border integrity issue at all and so little done in this area where there are issues that need addressing shows how much the government’s priorities are driven by purely partisan and often quite nasty politics rather than by genuine concerns about security.
The current arrangements are that the crew of non-military ships are granted special purpose visas by automatic operation of the law. As part of maritime crew, they do not have to make a specific application for a visa to come here. That process did not and, as it currently exists, does not permit security checks to be conducted before the crew of those ships are allowed to enter Australia. I do not wish to create an impression that they will just waltz in once they get here, but if we are looking at security checks and properly determining the details of people we are letting into the country then this area is not operating as well as possible. Again I contrast that with the asylum seeker issue where every single person is assessed in terms of security and, indeed, much more forensically than just about anybody else that enters this country. Not one of them has had a visa rejected in many years. So it is a reminder of both the importance of security checks and their misdirected focus in many cases.
Even at the height of arrivals of asylum seekers in Australia the numbers were much lower than the numbers of people coming here every year without security checks through maritime crew arrangements. Without in any way wishing to cast aspersions on people who are part of maritime crews, there are obvious security issues with what arrives in Australia in ships through our ports. There are obvious issues just in terms of the goods that come through our ports and how well we are able to oversee that movement. If we are genuine in using terms like border security and border protection and the integrity of our borders then resources need to be directed there, because that is where the real risks are. There are not just the security risks with the people coming in as part of maritime crew but the risks with what they may be bringing in either consciously or, in the case of quarantine related matters, unconsciously.
These reforms are welcome. They will add some extra red tape to maritime crew arrangements and it is important that we get the process flowing as smoothly as possible to minimise any extra disruption that occurs from doing that. On balance, I think it is a necessary disruption for the reasons we have all been outlining, and the Democrats are prepared to support it. It raises the importance of being accurate in our language when we are talking about the integrity of our borders and border security and we need to direct resources to these areas. Frankly, we should stop using terms like border protection when it comes to asylum seekers. They are not a threat; they are simply not a border protection issue. They are always identified and always checked out. There is not an issue there in terms of anything unknown entering into the country.
The security of what comes into our country through our ports is important, whether it is crew, as is dealt with by this legislation, or goods or other things. It is a continual balancing act, as it is through our airports. We know that millions of people enter Australia every year on temporary visas, visitor and tourist visas and the like, and the vast majority of them enter through our airports. You cannot run stringent character checks on every single one of those. I suppose in theory we could, but we would soon find that we would not have millions coming in through our airports; we would have significantly reduced numbers because people would not bother coming here if we had stringent character checks for every person wanting to come here as a tourist. So we have to strike a balance between adequate levels of assessment of people coming into the country versus ease of access, whether we are talking about the tourism industry or any other industries involving the movement of people. Many businesses involve a lot more international travel these days. From an economic point of view, it is very important for people to be able to move around the world as freely as they do within our own country. Rather than putting up unnecessary barriers to people going to different places, seeing different places, experiencing different things and engaging in different activities—whether economic, cultural or anything else—I think that, from a philosophical and what I might call a genuinely ‘liberal’ point of view, we should try ensure as much freedom as possible.
But it is always a matter of balancing those things. This is one area, rightly, where putting some extra security checking arrangement in place would enable that to happen before people arrive here, and it is a necessary change and, in some respects, probably an overdue one. Once it is in place and operating smoothly it will allow these sorts of things to be done in advance and any potential problems to be flagged before people arrive. That is obviously far better than having people arrive and then doing spot checks or in-place checks and then finding a problem. That can cause a lot more hassle for the individual concerned and for the shipping line and the crew than would occur if it were done in advance via security checks. I suspect there will be some teething problems along the way, but once it is bedded down and in place it should operate without major extra inconvenience. Indeed, there might even be reduced inconvenience when problems do arise. It is welcome, although it will obviously need continued monitoring as it is put in place and as the regulations are put down. I am sure that monitoring will occur.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (MARITIME CREW) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2007-05-09,"—Before I make some brief remarks on the Migration Amendment (Maritime Crew) Bill 2007 I acknowledge and thank both Senator Ludwig and Senator Bartlett for their generous remarks in relation to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and my previous chairmanship of that. I also indicate to the chamber that Senator Barnett, the new chair of the committee, is unable to be here today due to a commitment in Tasmania. I am pleased to participate in this debate as a member of the committee and as a former chair.
The bill before the chamber today will amend the Migration Act to create a new maritime crew visa. As part of the measures which will improve Australia’s border security, all crew of non-military ships will have to apply for a visa prior to entering Australia to enable security checks to be conducted. This maritime crew visa, or MCV, is to replace access to the special purpose visa, or SPV, regime which now applies to the crew of non-military ships, their spouses and dependent children. This is a visa which will apply from 1 July 2007. The explanatory memorandum says:
Currently foreign crew and their families are not required to make a formal application for a visa before coming to Australia. The grant of a maritime crew visa will require a formal application to be made, which will allow each foreign crew member and the spouses and dependent children of such crew, to be subjected to an appropriate level of security checking before visa grant.
The coalition government has a very strong record—reinforced by last night’s budget—on border security. In fact, to protect our borders and our security, this government has in recent years funded major expansions in new technology used by both Customs and the Australian Federal Police to increase border protection measures, implement more efficient processing of passengers and assist in the detection and prevention of terrorism and serious crime.
We have taken action to protect the people of Australia from what are seen as developing criminal trends, such as identity fraud, the manufacture of synthetic illicit drugs—we saw the recent enhancement of funding for fighting the ice epidemic prevalent in many of our cities at the moment—and money laundering. The government has undertaken significant initiatives in that regard, both in pursuit of the FATF recommendations and independently of that with counterterrorism financing. We have also developed one of the world’s toughest aviation security systems to protect both Australian and overseas travellers. That stands in accord with the remarks made by the Treasurer last night in his budget speech. After making some observations in relation to our obligations in the defence area, he noted that we continue to be absolutely committed to addressing emerging threats to national security. I note for the record that the Treasurer indicated that the budget provides a further $702 million over four years for national security initiatives to further safeguard against terrorism, including high-priority intelligence needs, an integrated e-security national agenda and further strengthening of aviation security. He indicated that this brings to $10.4 billion the additional funding the government have committed to national security over the 10 years to 2010-11. I think the record stands for itself.
Briefly, the main provisions of this bill include the creation of a new class of temporary visas to be called the maritime crew visa; the provision that the new visa will be permission to travel to and enter Australia only by sea unless a health, safety or other prescribed reason make it necessary for the person to enter Australia in another way or unless the entry in another way has received prior authorisation; and the replication of the power of the minister under the special purpose visa regime to make a written declaration that it is undesirable that a person, or any person in a class of persons, travel to and enter Australia by sea to remain in Australia. The exercise of the power would cease the visa in that case. The bill also provides that if such a declaration is revoked, the effect of it is as if it had never been made. It provides protection for the Commonwealth against any claims by persons who may have been detained while the declaration had been in force.
The further provisions of the bill enable the new maritime crew visa to be held with certain other types of substantive visas—for example, a transit visa or an electronic authority to enable a crew member wishing to join a ship in Australia to travel by air; provide that it will be an offence for an airline to carry a passenger whose only visa is a maritime crew visa; and make certain technical amendments so that an appropriate regulatory framework can be created to identify who may be granted a maritime crew visa and then to describe the events that will result in the cessation of a maritime crew visa.
I want to briefly outline the implementation arrangements for the new visa. I think it is also important to note for the record that details of this nature were also canvassed in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry, chaired by Senator Barnett, which was held into this piece of legislation to make sure that stakeholders who came before the committee and who made submissions to the committee were aware of and comfortable with the implementation arrangements.
The amendments in the bill provide a basic framework for the existence of maritime crew visas which, for crew on non-military ships, replace the SPV arrangements currently in place. The maritime crew visa arrangements are designed to cause the shipping industry as little disruption as possible. Consultations with industry indicate that they are indeed comfortable with the proposals. The major change for industry will be the requirement for foreign members of crew, including supernumerary crew and the spouses and dependent children of such crew, to make an application for a visa outside Australia to travel to and enter Australia. Currently, under the SPV arrangements, foreign crew and their spouses and dependent children are granted an SPV by operation of law when they enter Australia. The special purpose visas cease when those people depart Australia with their ships or in certain other situations to be set out in the regulations—for example, where a member of a crew works in Australia outside the scope of the duties they would usually perform on their vessels or when a ship leaves Australia without a crew member; obviously where the person is absent without leave or has deserted. Under the proposed regulatory framework, maritime crew visas will similarly cease in certain situations, as I have indicated in the above examples—for example, failing to sign on to a ship within five days of arriving in Australia by air or failing to depart Australia after signing off a ship.
I think it is also important to record in this debate the areas in which the proposed new visa arrangements for foreign seafarers will assist with Australia’s overall border integrity. Some of those areas were set out in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry, which noted:
the ability to security check applicants because crew will be required, through a formal application process, to provide relevant personal biographical data and other information including character information and employer details;
the inclusion of information, in DIAC’s visa database, about seafarers seeking to travel Australia can be cross-checked against crew information provided to Customs at the time of their impending arrival in Australia with their ships;
increased funding for relevant staff to be involved in the various checks to be carried out at the time of visa application and at the time of crew arrival in Australia;
an MCV holder would only be able to travel to Australia by air if they obtain an additional visa suitable for travel by air;
the ability to check the bona fides of sea crew arrivals when their ships arrive in Australia with the added ability to check crew of concern on non-military ships before they enter Australia’s migration zone;
the ability to infringe the masters, owners, charters and operators of ships for carrying improperly documented passengers and crew to Australia; and—
importantly—
the ability to more closely monitor, analyse, and respond to breaches of immigration compliance by foreign sea crew.
As the department’s submission to the inquiry observed, when you put all of those features together, we end up with a much more comprehensive process for deterring those who could be described as non-genuine crew from seeking to enter Australia for purposes which are not connected with the maritime industry and, hopefully, to generally address the future risk involved in dealing with foreign seafarers as a cohort of temporary visitors to Australia.
I also want to refer to the observation in chapter 3 of the committee’s report in relation to the consultation on this bill undertaken by the department with the various stakeholders. The committee has pursued the issue of consultation with agencies over the course of many years—not just with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship but with all that have come before the committee—and that continued during this inquiry. The representative of the department who was present at the hearing on the occasion of discussing this bill indicated in relation to consultation that the department had established an industry working group with Shipping Australia Ltd in early 2006 and that that industry working group had met on four occasions in that year to discuss the proposed arrangements for the maritime crew visa. It was also indicated that there was a meeting held in Canberra with representatives of the Maritime Union of Australia and the Australian Shipowners Association to broadly discuss the proposed arrangements. The departmental representative said that those meetings indicated to the department that the approach to this new visa was largely meeting the requirements of industry. The department also indicated that they undertook industry consultations which started in late November 2006. There were 11 industry seminars in capital cities and at major ports around Australia. The committee’s report noted in paragraph 3.4:
Shipping Australia Limited noted in its submission that it had been working with DIAC for some time to ensure that the Maritime Crew Visa (MCV) would result in minimal impost and cost to the shipping industry.
The consultation process is a very important matter for the committee, and it is good to be able to report that consultation has occurred and that there is general satisfaction with the approach being taken by government in that regard. The bill proposes important initiatives to enhance Australia’s border security. They are important initiatives for the Senate to consider today.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (MARITIME CREW) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-05-09,"—I thank senators for their contributions in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Maritime Crew) Bill 2007, and I thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs, which looked into this bill and, as usual, did a very good job. I think that would have been one of the last references that Senator Payne would have presided over as chair.

Senator Payne interjecting—

—I understand there might be one or two others. I want to acknowledge the great job that Senator Payne has done as Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. A heavy workload has been an attribute of that committee over a long period of time. I also thank the members of that committee. In my former role as Minister for Justice and Customs, I had a lot to do with that committee.
The bill before us, the Migration Amendment (Maritime Crew) Bill 2007, though a small bill, is an important bill. Under current arrangements, foreign crew are granted special purpose visas by operation of law. Prior to a ship’s arrival in Australia, ship operators are required to report all crew to the Australian Customs Service. Those crew names are checked against Australia’s movement alert list, which includes persons listed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. While these arrangements have been working effectively for many years, the government believes that the measures contained in this bill are needed to further strengthen the integrity of Australia’s borders.
The bill will create a new temporary visa, to be known as the maritime crew visa. It will provide the crew of non-military ships with the legal authority to travel to Australia by sea and remain in Australia in connection with the work on their ships. Significantly, the application process for the new visa will enable crew members to be subjected to more rigorous security checking before a visa is granted. For example, the application process will collect considerably more data on foreign crew than is currently available through pre-arrival crew lists and will also provide additional time for further security checks to be undertaken in the event that there is a match against Australia’s movement alert list.
As with most other visas, the detail governing the new maritime crew visa will be set out in the migration regulations. While there will be a small compliance cost associated with the introduction of the new visa, care is being taken to ensure that the regulatory framework accommodates the needs of industry. It is anticipated, for example, that the new visa will be able to be applied for online, and there will be no charge for the visa. Shipping agents will also be able to apply for the visa on behalf of crew members.
A number of points were raised during the debate and I think it is fair to say that speakers on this bill are all supportive of its intentions and what it does; however, there was a suggestion that the government has been slow to introduce these measures and that this has put Australia at risk of a terrorist attack. The first point that should be noted is that there are already security checking measures in place in connection with the existing special purpose visa and that these arrangements have been working effectively, without incident, for many years. Notwithstanding, the government continually reviews its security arrangements and has decided that the system would benefit from the introduction of the new visa. As I have said publicly and in this place many times, security is a work in progress and we are continually reviewing ways that we can improve the system to improve security for Australia. Therefore, the suggestion that there is a gaping hole in Australia’s maritime security is simply not correct.
The second point to note is that it is entirely appropriate for there to be a consultation process before any significant changes are made, even though meaningful consultation clearly takes some time. If that were not pursued, the opposition would be the first to attack the government and others for not doing so. The benefits of conducting such consultation are recognised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which concludes:
… the Bill strikes an appropriate balance between the need to strengthen security at ports whilst allowing for ease of use by industry and maritime crew.
In summary, the measures in this bill will help to strengthen the integrity of Australia’s borders while being responsive to the needs of maritime crew and the shipping industry as a whole. As such, it is a thoroughly worthwhile bill and I commend it to the Senate.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-05-09,"—The purpose of the Gene Technology Amendment Bill 2007, which we are dealing with today, is to amend the Gene Technology Act 2000 for a range of purposes. These include the introduction of emergency powers to give the minister the ability to expedite the approval of a dealing with a genetically modified organism in an emergency. It also includes the creation of the Gene Technology Ethics and Community Consultation Committee and amendments to the process for assessing applications for GMO licences.
Labor will be supporting the passage of the bill through the parliament. We understand there are strong views in the community both for and against gene technology; however, the debate on this bill is not a debate on the merits or otherwise of gene technology. Rather, the amendments to the act which are proposed in this bill are by and large designed to improve the operation of the act and will not change its underlying policy intent or the overall legislative framework. Further, the amendments proposed by the bill also represent the culmination of a long public consultation process and an independent statutory review process. They are also supported by the intergovernmental Gene Technology Ministerial Council. For all of these reasons, Labor will be supporting the bill.
The Gene Technology Act is the Commonwealth legislation which regulates genetically modified organisms in Australia. The object of the act is to protect the health and safety of people and the environment by identifying risks posed by, or as a result of, gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with genetically modified organisms.  Under the Gene Technology Agreement 2001, all states and territories have committed to maintaining corresponding legislation. In 2005-06, an independent review of the act and the Gene Technology Agreement was undertaken, headed by Susan Timbs. The review concluded that the act and the national regulatory scheme had worked well in the five years following their introduction. The review recommended a number of changes aimed at improving the operation of the regulatory scheme. This bill implements the recommendations from the review that require changes to Commonwealth legislation. The amendments contained in this bill reflect the ministerial council’s response to the statutory review and have been agreed by the states and territories.
I now want to turn to the specific amendments proposed by the bill. The proposed new emergency powers are the most contentious aspect of the bill. These new powers will give the minister power to expedite an approval of a dealing with a genetically modified organism in an emergency, in recognition of the fact that situations may arise in which approval of a dealing with a GMO may be required in a limited time. The issue of emergency powers was considered at length in the Senate committee’s inquiry and report on the bill. Some witnesses before the inquiry—including Gene Ethics and Greenpeace—expressed concern about the proposed new powers and whether they are necessary. While Labor is somewhat cautious about the proposed emergency powers, on balance we agree with the view of the majority of the Senate committee that there will be sufficient checks and balances in place to ensure the emergency powers are not used injudiciously.
The safeguards on the emergency powers that will be in place include: the minister will be required to have a recommendation from the Chief Medical Officer and/or the Chief Veterinarian before invoking the powers, and the minister will be required to consult with the states and territories before invoking the powers. We also note that guidelines for the administration of the emergency dealing provisions have been developed though a process of consultation with the states and territories. On the strength of these provisions, Labor is satisfied that the minister will not be able to act unilaterally and that the powers will be used with sufficient circumspection. However, Labor’s strong view is that the powers should only be used as an absolute last resort.
The bill will also establish a Gene Technology Ethics and Community Consultative Committee. This new committee will combine the existing Gene Technology Ethics Committee and the Gene Technology Community Consultative Committee into one body. The new committee will provide advice to the Gene Technology Regulator and the Gene Technology Ministerial Council on ethics and community consultations. The combined committee will also provide advice on risk communication and community consultation around intentional release licence applications. During the Senate inquiry, most stakeholders commented favourably on the proposed amalgamation of the ethics committee and the consultative committee into the one body.
The bill also proposes amendments to the process for assessing applications for licences for GMOs. There are two sets of amendments in this section of the bill. The first set of amendments will alter the order of events during the initial licence consultation process so that the regulator would no longer be required to consider whether an application poses a significant risk to the health and safety of people or the environment before developing a risk assessment and a risk management plan. These amendments are designed to improve the process by which licences are initially considered and give the regulator more time to consider whether dealings pose a significant risk. The second set of amendments would introduce a new category of licence for GMOs to distinguish between licences for a limited and controlled release and licences for intentional release. The object of these amendments is to increase the efficiency of the regulatory system by streamlining the application process for licences involving a limited and controlled release of a GMO. The issue of the new limited and controlled release licences was the topic of some discussion at the Senate committee’s hearing into the bill. Some stakeholders expressed concerns about the proposed new assessment process as it relates to limited and controlled release. However, the Senate committee supported the passing of the relevant provisions without amendment.
Other amendments to the act proposed by the bill will make various changes to the gene technology regulatory scheme. These changes include streamlining the process for the initial consideration of licences and the reduction of the regulatory burden for low-risk dealings, clarification of the circumstances in which licence variations can be made, clarification of the circumstances under which the regulator can direct a person to comply with the act, the provision of power to the regulator to issue a licence to protect persons inadvertently dealing with a GMO so as to enable appropriate disposal of such organisms and the making of technical amendments as proposed by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator.
In conclusion, as I said at the outset, Labor will be supporting the bill. While the proposed emergency powers are somewhat contentious, we are satisfied that there will be sufficiently robust safeguards in place to ensure that these powers will not be used unwisely. The remaining provisions in the bill are relatively uncontroversial and Labor is happy to support their passage through the parliament.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-05-09,"—I rise to support the Gene Technology Amendment Bill 2007. The application of gene technology is a contentious issue, and in Australia scientists, regulators and farmers have trod very warily in implementing this new form of technology. That is a very justified caution on the part of people in Australia. Some countries—such as the United States and countries in Europe—have gone more quickly. They have implemented new crops with altered genes. There is debate about whether that has been successful or not. A quick perusal of the internet will find examples of people who believe that there have been disasters as a result of the planting of altered gene crops. But these are refuted by others, so it is in fact difficult for the layman to get any clear indication of where this is heading and how safe alteration of genes in plants and animals is. I like to compare it to the biological controls which have been used for some time. I suppose a lot of people concentrate on some spectacular failures in biological control in Australia. One that continues to have its effects is the cane toad, which was originally introduced to control the cane beetle in Queensland. It was discovered that the cane toads ate not only the cane beetles but also a large number of other things and have spread all through Queensland in almost plague proportions and are now spreading in the Northern Territory and apparently in Western Australia as well and causing difficultly for native wildlife. There are other examples both in Australia and round the world of where scientists in a supposedly controlled environment have introduced an organism to control other organisms and it has gone wrong.
However, by and large that has been very successful in Australia. There are a number of examples that have been and are still being used very successfully in Australia, where biological organisms have been introduced to control plant or animal pests. One example is the use of nematodes, which are used to control slugs, for example, in agriculture. A more well-known example is cactus, which has been more or less wiped out in most parts of Australia. Biological controls over the years have proved to be very successful economically. Even where they have been less successful, they have proven to have a reasonable benefit-to-cost ratio in crop production. The new advances posed by gene technology are very much along similar lines.
We are fortunate in Australia to have the CSIRO and other organisations, such as SARDI—the South Australian Research and Development Institute—which have good expertise in biological control and crop research and other agricultural research. They have a long history of proven, concrete, reliable research and have proved to also have good regulatory controls. I think that gives us great comfort in allowing this slight loosening of the licensing requirement for gene technology and allowing gene technology to be used in emergency situations. We have that background of expertise in leading-edge research and development in our primary industries—which is something that is perhaps not so widely recognised—and in health, where Australian research and technology is very well recognised.
We have been quite right to proceed warily in this area. In general we should support this bill and the amendments to the current Gene Technology Act. Certainly we should not ever let our guard slip, and I suppose that is where the anxiety comes in, in terms of the emergency powers. One situation cited is where emergency powers may be used if there is an avian flu epidemic spreading quickly throughout Australia, causing loss of life or debilitating illness, and where governments and regulators may be panicked into allowing a genetically modified organism into our system that has far more adverse consequences than the original organism. That is a great threat that we should be very aware of and have in the forefront of our minds. Our experience with micro-organisms and the manipulation of micro-organisms is probably not as great as it has been with plant and human health and other large animal health, so I think we need to tread very cautiously in this instance.
There is still a lot we do not know about the behaviour of bacteria and viruses in the body and the way that they might cross over between species. There is still some debate about whether or not or how easily micro-organisms can cross between species and produce disease or various other effects. I think we should certainly err on the side of caution when considering human intervention in these matters. We should always have in the forefront of our minds those relatively few but still potent examples of where biological control has gone wrong in our environment.
That being said, I think a great deal of good work has been done in gene modification technology, both in primary industry and microbiology in Australia and the rest of the world. This is a very exciting new technology that may reap great benefits in our production of food sources, for example. We are all worried about climate change, and this technology may lead to the production of drought resistant crops, crops that are resistant to humidity in some areas and crops that are resistant to extreme cold or extreme heat. Unless there is an abrupt and sudden reversal of what seems to be a change in our world climate, it is difficult to see us juggling the requirements of an expanding population and expanding the need for resources without some form of gene technology to assist us. I know that this is anathema to some people who do not like to interfere to any extent in our ecology, but it is difficult to see how we might advance into the future without some use of that technology to relieve widespread problems in adapting to the change in our world climate and conditions, both in human health terms and in animal terms.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—The Australian Greens do not support the introduction of these specific emergency dealing provisions. We have serious concerns about their implications. We may be putting in place a cure that is far worse than the disease or the original problem. The Greens, as many people will know, have some very strong concerns with genetic engineering and its implications for our environment and human health. However, I am not going to dwell extensively on those specific concerns at this time. I am going to specifically deal with some of our concerns with these amendments. As they stand, these provisions would essentially enable the fast-tracking of potentially untested genetically modified organisms—alternatively called genetically engineered organisms—into the environment in an attempt to solve an emergency potentially unrelated to genetically modified organisms.
The proposal is to dispense with the full assessment process of the potential impact of the release of a GMO—not merely to expedite it or to speed up the process but to in fact dispense with it in some circumstances. We are deeply concerned that this means that an unknown and potentially harmful organism may be released without any fail-safe provisions or any understanding of how it may interact with other organisms or our environment, and that this could then be beyond recall. We could possibly do this—forever—without understanding the possible consequences. Genetically modified organisms released into our environment without proper assessment and testing may potentially have far-reaching, dangerous and disastrous consequences.
We need to take these potential dangers into account in a precautionary fashion when weighing up the risks and benefits of an emergency response to an outbreak of disease or a pandemic to be sure that the treatment does not end up being a much bigger problem than the one we were trying to solve in the first place. We already have more than enough examples in Australia of hasty interventions where the cure has in fact proved to be a greater problem than the disease. We need go no further than the already mentioned cane toad to establish this fact and to see that this has had huge environmental and economic impacts in Australia.
To summarise the Greens’ concerns, which I will go into in more detail in a moment: we are dealing with genetically engineered responses to a non-GE emergency, and we believe this goes beyond the scope of the original act. The decisions about emergency responses to disease outbreaks and pandemics need to be made by the relevant expert authorities. The release of GMOs, particularly untried and unassessed ones, should be the last resort and not the first one. We believe it should be restricted to medical emergencies only. There need to be very clear protocols within the act to define what constitutes a threat and to spell out what the triggers should be. We need a clear risk assessment process to carefully weigh up the potential costs and benefits of different emergency processes, and we need an assessment in place before the release of any GMOs.
We are concerned that this bill seeks to put emergency provisions in place within the Gene Technology Act 2000 that deal with non-GM emergencies. The changes proposed in the bill go well beyond the scope of the object of the act. The act states:
The object of this Act is to protect the health and safety of people, and to protect the environment, by identifying risks posed by or as a result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs.
It is very clear that the legislative intent of the Gene Technology Act was to identify and manage risks that are posed by gene technology. To the extent that the emergency declaration provisions relate to risks that arise as a result of threats not associated with genetically engineered organisms, they appear to lie outside the intended ambit of the act. An assessment of the level of threat posed lies outside the ambit of the expertise and the experience of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator.
In the face of an emergency, we need to have the most effective response possible. We know that and acknowledge it. This means that we need to have the most appropriate authority making the decisions and managing the response, which requires relevant knowledge, experience and expertise. We want the most effective and efficient response to get the best outcome for the least amount of risk. This means considering all possible responses, including GE and non-GE ones, to pick the best one. We do not want to have a system that assumes a GE response is necessarily the best one, or where the expertise on tap only relates to one subset of possible responses. Surely, if there were a medical emergency, the Therapeutic Goods Administration emergency powers would be the first invoked, and we would expect the TGA to have access to the necessary knowledge, skills and expertise to evaluate the threat to human health.
The relevant experts would look for solutions which might or might not include GMOs. We would not necessarily expect this expertise to reside within the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, and developing or retaining such expertise would be an expensive exercise. The same applies for animal diseases. If we are to have emergency provisions to allow rapid response to an imminent threat—and here I will define, as I have looked it up, what ‘imminent’ means: ‘instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means and no moment of deliberation’—then I have very strong concerns, if those are the criteria we are going to apply to releasing untested, untried, unassessed GMOs into the environment. We should be making sure that the most appropriate body assesses the threat and coordinates the response.
In the case of a human vaccine responding to a serious outbreak of a major disease this might, for instance, result in the TGA declaring a medical emergency and then requesting the GTR to make an emergency assessment of a genetically engineered vaccine. To give the health minister and the TGR the primary power to respond to an emergency with GMOs would shut down full consideration of all the options, which might include safer or more conservative solutions. In the case of a genetically engineered human vaccine in response to the threat of an outbreak of a particular disease—and this is one of the reasons put forward for the need for these provisions; for example, to deal with bird flu—it would be necessary to vaccinate a much larger number of people who have the potential to contract the disease than those who might actually be exposed and contract the disease in order for the epidemiological containment response to be effective. In other words, you would have to immunise a larger part of the population.
Where the vaccine contains a genetically engineered organism which is untested and may have adverse effects on some or all recipients, this has the potential to impact on a much larger population than would otherwise be affected. That is why there are currently such stringent assessment criteria related to vaccines and why we should not be considering bypassing these stringent rules without a very stringent risk assessment process. The existing provisions for testing vaccines and assessing genetically engineered and genetically modified organisms prior to release into our environment or into our community are there for a very good reason. They reflect widespread community concerns about genetic engineering and embody community standards, and they acknowledge that there are significant risks that have to be assessed and managed to protect the public. I am not convinced that the proposed emergency provisions are sufficient to do that.
I would like to look at what I have termed the triggers and levels of threat that apply to this legislation. The Greens are very concerned that the triggers and the level of threat necessary for declaring emergencies are not clearly defined. The definition of ‘imminent’ can include instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation. The Department of Health and Ageing said in the committee hearing that one of the triggers for such a declaration might be an economic threat, not just an emergency around human health. An economic threat is not defined. Who defines what an economic threat is, the level of it or the severity of it? This may be considered a trigger for these provisions. The Greens do not accept that an economic threat would be sufficient justification to release a genetically engineered organism that has not been properly tested or assessed and which may pose an unknown and potentially unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. We do not accept that argument. The notion that these powers could be invoked for purely economic reasons is unacceptable, particularly when the release of an experimental organism may in itself pose an unknown economic and environmental health risk.
We also question how the situation might arise where there was a vaccine for a serious livestock disease that posed a major economic threat to Australian livestock that was already in use or looked at overseas and yet Australian livestock authorities were not sufficiently forewarned of this threat to get the assessment process underway before there was a major outbreak or the need to invoke emergency powers. The Greens believe that, if this amendment dealing specifically with emergency dealing provisions proceeds, it should be strictly limited to medical emergencies only. This way you could deal with life-threatening issues for human health but not so-called economic threats.
The bill does not specify the level of threat required to trigger the emergency dealing provisions. We believe that what counts as an imminent threat needs to be clearly defined in the act. As I have already said, we have concerns about the definition of the word ‘imminent’. The worst threat is not explicitly defined, yet the bill proposes that the minister merely has to satisfy that a threat is imminent without requirements or procedures to prove that a significant threat really exists. As it stands, the concept of threat within the act relates to pests and diseases, but there is no requirement that the threat be of a particular imminence, severity or scale. This is supposedly in the ministerial guidelines that neither the public nor the Senate has seen. I tried to get them. They went to the ministerial council on Friday and I could not get them. So we are dealing with a bill now for which we have not seen the ministerial guidelines that define threats or triggers for this act that could potentially have disastrous consequences for the Australian community and environment. The act should be clear that any real threat of a specified scale, scope and severity to justify the use of the emergency powers is reviewed and confirmed by all jurisdictions and that the circumstances are so exceptional as to justify an emergency response to avert a widespread impact on human health. Given that the minister is being required to make a decision in response to a particular threat, which in itself also inherently contains an element of risk, it seems negligent to be introducing a system in which the scale of threat, the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the relative costs of acting or failing to act are not considered in light of the potential risks posed by the introduction of an unassessed, untried, potentially experimental GMO. We believe that this should be required in the legislation.
We understand from evidence that was given to the committee that the ministerial council has just considered guidelines relating to emergency provisions. This clearly suggests that the ministerial council still has concerns about the provisions which these guidelines are intended to address. As I said, we have not seen them, the public has not seen them and stakeholders have not seen them. Given the uncertainty that remains within the act about what constitutes a significant imminent threat and how possible response strategies might be assessed, it seems that the completion and approval of these guidelines would be a prudent and necessary first step before the introduction of this bill. The Greens believe that the ministerial guidelines should be a legislative instrument that is incorporated into this bill.
I would like to briefly touch on some of the horror stories that abound with genetic engineering to highlight the reasons for our deep concerns. There was the Klebsiella planticola case in which a GM microbe for producing ethanol on farms was approved by the USDA, but when independently tested just prior to release was found to continue producing ethanol in soil, where it would destroy susceptible plants—in fact, most of them. The release of this organism was stopped only at the eleventh hour. In Brazil, GE soya beans incorporating a nut gene produced severe allergic reactions in some people and had to be withdrawn. These were genetically modified organisms that had been tested and released and still had problems. They were not untested and unassessed GMOs such as are potentially going to be released into the environment. In the US the release of herbicide tolerant GE crops has led to an escalation of weed problems and there are a high number of people manifesting allergies to GE corn and soya products. Recent reports of the widespread death of bees and the collapse of bee colonies across Europe and the US are a cause of major concern not only for the honey industry but for food crops and ecological systems that are dependent on them as pollinators. We do not know at the moment what is causing this—it remains a mystery—but research is pointing to the total collapse of the immune system of the bees from unknown causes. There are a number of different and competing explanations about a multitude of possible causes, including agricultural chemicals and the uptake of GE crops. Those are some quick international examples.
In Australia just recently, and as I articulated in this place not long ago, there was the experience of research done on mice at the ANU. The ANU conducted research into feeding genetically modified peas to mice. The CSIRO modified the peas to contain a bean gene which was intended to produce resistance to pea weevils. This resulted in a substantial change to the protein produced by the peas. The mice developed a hypersensitive skin response and experienced airway inflammation and mild lung damage. This could have had serious consequences if it had been released.
And there is the example that we heard in the Senate inquiry from Jeremy Tager. He said:
I remember that my father was working for the National Institute of Health in the 1950s when they rushed through a polio vaccine with the notion that this was an emergency that needed dealing with. They ended up killing more people than they saved with that particular vaccine.
I go through these examples to highlight the dangers that we are facing if we circumvent what I think are very important provisions and safeguards in our legislation. That is why we are very concerned that these particular provisions are being brought in to cover a much broader range of circumstances than we believe is appropriate and that they do not properly outline the levels of threat and risk in which these provisions would be invoked.
When we asked about this in the committee we were told, ‘Of course it’s only going to be used in real emergency situations.’ Well, we need to ensure that that is in fact what is going to occur. We cannot rely on people in the heat of the moment making what may be inappropriate decisions when they think that there is no alternative and in a moment when supposedly there is no time for consideration or deliberation. We do not believe this is appropriate when we are dealing with such potentially significant consequences.
We believe that attempts to use the Gene Technology Act 2000 to specify a means of fast-tracking or bypassing the assessment of genetically engineered organisms to allow them to be released into the environment or our bodies in response to a non-GE related emergency go well beyond the objects of this act. While we believe there is a need for legislative provisions for dealing with emergency situations such as pandemics or the outbreak of serious disease, we do not believe that these amendments are the appropriate way to do that.
The Greens will be moving amendments in the committee stage to oppose these provisions because we believe they need to go back to the drawing board. If they are not supported we will move some amendments to define what we mean by threat and the triggers for the use of these emergency provisions.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—I thank Senator McLucas, Senator Hurley and Senator Siewert for their contributions. The Gene Technology Amendment Bill 2007 strengthens the Australian government’s component of the gene technology regulatory scheme. This scheme protects the health and safety of people and the environment from any risks that may be posed by genetically modified organisms.
These amendments are the response to the statutory review of the Gene Technology Act 2000 and the Gene Technology Agreement 2001 which was conducted in 2005-06. These amendments will refine the legislation and ensure that regulatory burden is commensurate to risk, introduce provisions to deal with unexpected situations and ensure the smooth operation of the scheme.
I note, and I think all senators agree with this, that we must always be judicious in our release of any genetically modified organisms into the community. I agree with all senators on that. Perhaps like Senator Hurley, however, I remain optimistic—perhaps more optimistic than Senator Siewert—as to the utility of GMOs. But only time will tell. Perhaps in the committee stage we will have more opportunity to flesh out that debate and look at future opportunities.
Senator Siewert spoke passionately about the emergency dealing determinations that are an integral part of the bill and that reflect, of course, the review that was completed in 2005-06. We will discuss this in greater detail in the committee stage, but can I just say—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that these are not unilateral powers that can be used by a minister. They are highly circumscribed. I will not go through all the provisions now, but the minister must receive advice from various officers, including the Gene Technology Regulator. He or she must be satisfied that there is an actual or imminent threat, and so forth. This is not a case of a unilateral decision by a minister; it is highly circumscribed.
I should also add that all these conditions and provisions were agreed to by states and territories. We will obviously get to that in the committee stage, but I just wanted to try to argue the case anyway, Senator Siewert, that we are not talking here about the unilateral decision of a minister. It is highly circumscribed. Also, you spoke about the definitions. Again, we can get into that in the committee stage, but the strong scientific assessment framework of the act will be maintained. That is why, in relation to the issue you raised about economic harm, that is not what the bill says and that is not what is contemplated. But, again, we will get to that later.
These amendments mean that the regulator’s resources may be more efficiently utilised in the evaluation of an application for the intentional release of genetically modified organisms and that the regulatory regime will be more able to respond swiftly to emergency scenarios where the use of a genetically modified organisms may be particularly advantageous. Furthermore, these refinements represent the collective input from all the states and the territories and will ensure that Australia has a world-class regulatory system that protects the health and safety of people and the environment as well as promoting research in this growing industry.
The amendments to the act serve to strengthen this link in the armour of protection afforded to the health of the Australian people and the environment by the Australian government. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, along with other Australian government regulatory schemes, provides a shield that protects the health of the Australian people and their environment.
Senator Siewert quite justifiably mentioned the guidelines for emergency response under the Gene Technology Act 2000 and the Gene Technology Agreement. She quite correctly referred to those. They were agreed to by the ministerial council last Friday and I table them. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-05-09,"—Today is an auspicious day, not just because it is the first anniversary of my swearing in as a senator but also because it is the 80th anniversary of the first sitting of federal parliament in Canberra. On this day in 1927, the first sitting of parliament in Canberra was opened by the Duke of York, later King George VI, in the Old Parliament House building. Since that time, Australia has clearly been on a path to prosperity. While some may consider me biased, I believe this is due in no small part to the fact that a conservative government has been in power in Australia for the majority of that time, particularly since World War II.
During this time, our successful journey as a nation has only been interrupted when Labor has been in government. History demonstrates that the Labor Party is simply a roadblock on Australia’s path to prosperity. It has been a long journey to get back on the path since we inherited the disastrous results of Labor’s 13-year prosperity detour. And what a detour that was! It created a nation with a net government debt of $96 billion. The unemployment rate was 8.2 per cent; today it is 4.5 per cent. We had average inflation under Labor of 5.2 per cent; today it is half that. Average mortgage rates were 12.75 per cent, nearly 50 per cent higher than those of today. And real wages growth after 13 years of Labor was only 0.2 per cent, whilst real wages have risen by more than 19 per cent since then.
All this was thanks to the previous 13 years of Labor in government. Mr Hawke and Mr Keating took Australia down a road towards the ‘recession we had to have’. We had high interest rates, high unemployment, low productivity and high personal tax rates—products of incompetent economic policies and complete disregard for the welfare of ordinary Australians. Still, this is the Labor way. We should not forget the legacy of the earlier Whitlam Labor government. Again we saw a declining economy, high unemployment rates and unprecedented inflation rates, all fuelled by the Whitlam government’s irresponsible spending.
Today’s succession of Labor leaders has offered more of the same. Mr Beazley, Mr Crean, Mr Latham, back to Mr Beazley and now Mr Rudd have all offered a carefully camouflaged version of the same doctrine: union control of Australia’s economy. Mr Rudd’s road to ruin for all Australians features a praetorian guard of union heavyweights, not to protect the interests of all Australians but to protect the personal interests of the union elite.
Let us have a look at Labor’s national conference. It was three days of stage-managed events. The whole show was produced, choreographed and staged by a declining union movement. Labor proved to the rest of the country who is really running the ALP—the unions. Indeed, the ALP’s relationship with the unions is becoming suffocating, both internally and in its outward effect on our economy.
But this is nothing new. Back in 1996 the unions were outraged to lose their control over the government. Who can forget the disgraceful riots at the front of this building in that year? It was the most forceful physical attack on the federal parliament in its history. The militant CFMEU had quite a lot to do with the group that caused the most damage that day and, if my sources are correct, at least one of Labor’s frontbenchers was working with that extreme group and was a key player in that shameful occasion. Has anything really changed within the union movement since then?
One thing is crystal clear. If the ALP gain power, the unions will once again jeopardise Australia’s continued prosperity. How else can we explain why the ACTU and not the shadow cabinet were left to approve Labor’s workplace relations policy? The more things change, the more they stay the same. Labor have once again capitulated to almost every demand of the union bosses who dominate their national conference. They are a clear and present danger to small business, job security and the continuing growth of the Australian economy. Not even the very special leadership of Mark Latham produced a workplace policy which represented such a capitulation to the masters of Labor’s universe at the expense of small business and jobs. In one single policy, Labor are prepared to derail our economy. By winding back the clock to collective bargaining and reinstating the union domination of every Australian workplace, Labor will make it harder, not easier, for small business to employ people.
It is just as well that Labor’s policy has drawn significant criticism. One newspaper editorial summed it up when it described the IR policy as having:
... all the hallmarks of being an old-style Labor, a smoky backroom deal between Julia Gillard, Greg Combet and the ACTU. It represents a return to the classic class warfare of the last century which pitted bosses against workers ...
Yesterday in the Australian Janet Albrechtsen outlined what could happen under Labor’s IR policy:
... a collective agreement will rule a workplace when agreed on by a majority of workers who turn up to vote. That means in a workplace of 1000 workers, if 100 workers turn up to vote and 51 workers vote yes to a collective agreement, that agreement prevails. The vote of 51 workers will bind all 1000 workers.
In the above scenario, the unions will charge the full 1,000 workers a bargaining fee. Of course, this bargaining fee will be higher than the cost of joining the union, so most workers, having to balance a household budget—as we all do—will likely take the less expensive option and join the union. Since the Labor Party gets a percentage of union fees in addition to the levies that are currently being fleeced from workers, it is a cosy little deal. It is unfair to expect a worker who did not participate in and neither wants nor needs a collective agreement to be bound by its terms and conditions. But that is the Labor way.
When Work Choices was introduced, the Labor Party together with the unions would have had us all believe the country was ready to fall apart. We saw a scare campaign of enormous proportions. We were warned of mass sackings and eroded benefits, none of which have occurred. Mr Kim Beazley warned us: ‘There will be more divorce.’ Mr Bill Shorten said that these laws will be ‘a green light for mass sackings’. Janet Giles, the head of Unions SA, said: ‘It is a pact with the devil.’ Mr Tony Upton, from the Transport Workers Union, boldly claimed: ‘This legislation is a direct threat to road safety in this country.’ Ms Sharan Burrow alleged: ‘Children won’t see their parents for Christmas.’
These alarmist and embarrassingly ridiculous predictions have been exposed as typical union scaremongering. The unions are today engaged in a desperate attempt to remain relevant. They will do and say anything to regain their dominance of Australian workers and the economy. Anything, that is, except reform their tired, discredited and obsessive agenda. That is why the average working Australian is turning their back on the trade union movement. Figures recently released by the ABS show that union membership has been declining steadily since 1976 when it stood at 51 per cent. Now unions represent just 15.2 per cent of private sector employees. It is no wonder the union bosses have more influence in the Labor Party than on the workers of Australia as they continue to lose relevance and power. In fact, ACTU Secretary Greg Combet last year stated in the Australian:
I recall we used to run the country and it wouldn’t be a bad thing if we did again.
Mr Combet, it was a bad thing then; it would be a very bad thing for Australia if you managed to run this country again.
But they are not content with running the ALP from the sidelines; the union elite are now clawing over each other in a mad scramble to get into parliament and gain a head start on their leadership rivals. We have union boss Doug Cameron, the National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, who stitched up the numbers in the New South Wales Left to knife his own mentor. It reminds me of a saying in politics: it is always those closest to you who sink the knife in the deepest.
We have got Mark Butler, the State Secretary of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union in South Australia, who is running for the safe Labor seat of Port Adelaide. He is a key part of the ALP factional machine in South Australia and a major behind-the-scenes player in the ALP at a national level. There is also Bill Shorten, the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, who is the Labor candidate for another safe Labor seat, the federal electorate of Maribyrnong. And, not least, there is Mr Greg Combet, the man who wants to run the country. He is set to enter federal parliament after winning preselection last week—although no-one actually ‘wins’ preselection in the Labor Party; everyone knows that preselections are determined long before the voting ever takes place.
This preselection push is part of a move by the ALP to install more high-profile uberunionists in safe Labor seats. So much for Mr Rudd’s fresh thinking. But if you think that is alarming, wait, there is more! According to media reports, we could see New South Wales Labor Council Secretary John Robertson, New South Wales Electrical Trades  Union Secretary Bernie Riordan and Transport Workers Union Federal Secretary Tony Sheldon all running for preselection in the next election. And just today it has been confirmed that South Australia’s godfather of factional politics, SDA Secretary Don Farrell, has staked his claim for a Senate seat.
The union elite not only determine preselection outcomes but also sit as unelected members of shadow cabinet, dictating the policy agenda. This is one of the great ironies of the Labor Party in Australia: they claim to represent all Australians and yet, in reality, their policies are dictated by a select few for their own benefit. Labor’s recent industrial relations policy, which I mentioned earlier, is a case in point. It is a policy determined by the unions, vetted by the unions and for the benefit of the unions.
But let us go back to the ALP national conference, that great bastion of democracy. It features 400 delegates, 73 per cent of whom are former union officials, current union officials, members of parliament or Labor Party staffers. It is much the same on the ALP front bench, where 27 of the 40 positions are occupied by former union officials. The unions have donated over $50 million to the ALP since 1996 in a desperate attempt to regain their power and take us back to the dark old days of union dominance.
Let us remind ourselves what life was like when Labor was in government and unions ran the country. Labor’s system was based on conflict between workers and employers. Under Labor, strike action was 13 times higher than it is today, damaging our nation’s productivity and growth. Labor prescribed a one-size-fits-all industrial relations system. There was less capacity to negotiate conditions around particular family responsibilities. And unions were able to force workers into unions—including the requirement that employers give preference to union members. This conflict based system was bad for jobs and bad for our economy.
For all their purported concern for workers, Labor did not even attempt to protect workers who were denied their wages or entitlements in cases of employer insolvency. Even though Labor created a recession that sent thousands of businesses to the wall, it ignored the plight of nearly 221,000 workers who lost around $1.25 billion worth of entitlements between 1983 and 1996. Labor certainly delivered during their 13 years in power. But it was a message none of us want to receive again.
They gave us the worst economic recession since the Great Depression, including record small business interest rates, high inflation and record unemployment. They gave us job-destroying unfair dismissal laws, new taxes and increased taxes. But Australia is now back on the path to prosperity. Under the Howard government, we have the lowest unemployment rate in over 30 years. We have kept the economy strong so that all Australians can plan for the future with confidence. This does not happen by accident but requires the difficult but necessary decisions that have to be made in the national interest.
Real wages under this government have increased by nearly 20 per cent. This is hardly the doomsday type predictions we have seen from the ALP and the union movement for the last 11 years. But their opposition to our important reforms is not about jobs, fairness or hope for the future. They are not concerned about rights and the interests of working Australians. The individual worker is doing well under this government. The only people who are not doing well under this government are the union bosses, and that is why the union movement is bankrolling a $30 million campaign against the federal coalition government. It is a campaign against jobs, real wage increases and a strong economy. It is a campaign not about a bright future but about returning us to a very dark past.
Labor remains controlled by the unions, thinking only of their sectional interest rather than the national interest. They threaten Australia’s continued prosperity. This prosperity is no accident. It requires careful policy development, and Labor’s challenge, after 11 years in opposition and six months from the election, was to show the Australian people it could develop such policies. It has failed the first important test. Labor has failed the Australian people whenever it has been in power. Its legacy of high interest rates, high unemployment, excessive spending and budget black holes we cannot forget. Australia cannot afford a Labor government captive to union, factional and vested interests. With last night’s budget, the government has continued to implement reforms to keep Australia’s economy strong, to lock in prosperity and to keep our nation secure so that Australians can plan for the future with confidence.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Australian Labor Party</title>,Matters of Public Interest,6,1,speech

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-05-09,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer. Can the minister explain why productivity growth, critical to our long-term economic prosperity, was zero in 2006-07 against a forecast of 2.25 per cent? Is zero productivity growth the best the government can do? If this really is a budget for the future, can the minister also indicate why it forecast productivity growth of only 1.75 per cent per annum over the last two years of the forward estimates? Isn’t this barely half the productivity growth rate achieved during the 1990s?

If the Minister for Finance and Administration reads page 1.5, table 2 of his own Budget Paper No. 1, he will see that productivity is zero. Doesn’t the same budget paper forecast declining productivity for Australia beyond 2007-08—after your industrial relations reforms? How can it be a budget for the future if the government’s own forecasts show productivity going backwards? Read page 1.5 of your own budget paper. Doesn’t this highlight that the government has squandered the once-in-a-generation $300 billion mining boom and instead has gone with a budget designed to be a clever, short-term election fix?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2007-08</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-05-09,"—I thank Senator Sherry for his question on productivity. Can I first say that at least there is something to be said for the opposition actually focusing on productivity and acknowledging that productivity is important to the Australian economy and important to the future living standards and welfare of the Australian people. In relation to productivity, the Labor Party has been seeking to make much of statistics, but of course there are statistics and statistics. I was surprised that Senator Sherry said, ‘In 2006-07, productivity was zero.’ As far as I can tell, we are in May 2007 and we have not finished 2006-07. So we do not know from the ABS what the productivity outcome for 2006-07 will be, and we will not know for some time.
The last year for which we have productivity figures is 2005-06, when GDP per hour worked in the market sector—that is, productivity—grew by 2.3 per cent, similar to the average of the past decade. According to those same statistics, we had a most peculiar and aberrant decline in mining productivity of some 19 per cent. According to the ABS, mining productivity in 2005-06 fell 19 per cent. That of its own wipes one percentage point off the economy-wide productivity growth figure. If you take the non-mining sector productivity figure for the economy, in the last full year for which we have figures, you have growth in productivity of 3.2 per cent—considerably above the average in Australia for the past four decades.
So the whole basis of the Labor argument about productivity is without any foundation. The statistics themselves establish that productivity is growing at the long-term rate, if you take out this quite aberrant behaviour with respect to mining—which most commentators assume is a function of the fact that you have a lot of investment going in without the output growth that will result from that investment yet coming on stream but you have an increase in employment. That is the cause of this aberrant drop in mining productivity. On that basis, there is no foundation whatsoever for the Labor Party argument on productivity.
This budget focuses on the importance of maintaining Australia’s productivity. We have invested substantially in education to ensure the future productive capacity of the Australian workforce. We have invested substantially in transport infrastructure in this country to ensure that we can sustain the productivity of the Australian workforce. Most importantly, we have brought in far-reaching industrial relations reform. If there is one thing that is an absolute prerequisite for productivity growth it is flexible workplace relations.
If the Labor Party were interested in productivity, the absolute last thing they would do would be to re-regulate the labour market. On that score, I will quote Heather Ridout, who I think would be acknowledged as one of the more modern of the employer group representatives. She said:
Kevin Rudd talks a lot about productivity, but this reregulation—
his re-regulation of the labour market—
will lower productivity.
So, Senator Sherry, if you are interested in productivity—and I accept that you are—go and talk to Mr Rudd about productivity.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2007-08</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-05-09,"—What we know for sure is that if Labor were to be elected at the next election, productivity would go backwards because of their disastrous re-regulation of the labour market. Listen to what Michael Chaney of the Business Council of Australia said:
Despite claiming to support policies that will lead to continued productivity, the ALP has clearly ignored consistent and strong business representations about how productivity and jobs growth is achieved in the economy.
That was the greatest slag the opposition could ever have from the business community, who are responsible for productivity—saying you know nothing about how to increase productivity in this country.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2007-08</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-05-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition Sernators today relating to the 2007-08 Budget.
Today’s debate reflects the very low opinion that the government have of the intelligence of the Australian electorate. The government seek to convince the Australian electorate that, after 11 years of neglect of some of the major challenges facing this country, there is some sort of short-term political fix to be found in throwing money at some of those problems. They think that those people who have suffered under the childcare crisis for the last 11 years, that those who have struggled to meet the cost of living as they try and balance work and family and that pensioners who have done it very tough as the GST and high food prices have affected their standard of living for a long period of time will somehow forget. They think that by sending them a cheque somehow those issues have goes away—that those people will not remember the serious neglect and the arrogance that the government have shown to their condition over a long period of time.
Senator Minchin is right: we endorse many of the payments that are contained in the budget, because at long last they provide some recognition and some compensation for some of those people who have been doing it tough. But, as I have said, there is a whole range of issues. The government go nowhere near compensating people for the pain and suffering they have had as a result of the neglect of the government in tackling the issues of Middle Australia.
The tax cuts are a classic example. For years the government has failed to deliver proper tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners but suddenly, six months out from the election, these are the people the government cares about. I think the reaction will be people saying: ‘Thanks very much for the money; we need it. It will be a help, but it is nowhere near enough. Quite frankly, it is far too little far too late. And we are not fooled. We can see the cynicism. The budget reeks of cynicism. It reeks of a short-term fix to a political problem.’ What the government fails to do—
—Which is exactly why you are supporting it.
—Because it addresses a lot of the problems that the Labor Party has been highlighting in recent years. It throws money at problems that have been identified and that the electorate is concerned about, but it does not seek to fix any of those problems. It does not resolve those problems; it throws money at them as a short-term fix because there is a large surplus. It throws money at those problems without really dealing with them.
You have to ask yourself: what has this done for climate change? What has this done for productivity? What has it done for the great need for new broadband infrastructure in this country? What has it done seriously for education, apart from the Higher Education Endowment Fund? What has it done to tackle the huge skill shortages and the huge need for further investment in education at all levels? Nothing. There is no strategy here.
The minister quoted Mr Chaney from the Business Council, but he did not quote what he said about the budget. People know there is no strategy here. They know there is no long-term approach to the major problems that confront Australian society. They know the government is tired; they know it is out of touch; they know it has run out of ideas. And the government’s response is to spend big and throw money, because that is its only way of hoping to convince the Australian electorate that it is worth being re-elected. The Australian electorate are very cynical about the government. They know that these are short-term fixes aimed to make them forget the failure to tackle the real issues.
In my portfolio, I am amazed. As shadow minister for resources and energy, I noted that the Treasurer never mentioned the resources boom, resources or mining in the whole budget speech. It is a sector that is contributing $55 billion this year to the growth of the economy and has added $300 billion to the economy over the last five years—and he did not mention it. Talk about a Melbourne-centric view of the world! He is in denial about it. The words ‘mining and resources sector’ will not pass his lips. The opposition know that a lot of that activity is driving our economy, but he is in denial about it and will not face up to the fact that he has failed to meet the challenges and use the mining boom resources and royalties to drive a long-term, strategic direction for our economy. He has failed to invest in climate change and failed to drive a more productive economy. This is a short-term fix. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-05-09,"—I thought the performance of the member for Lilley last night on the 7.30 Report was dismal. But I have seen a performance which even outdoes the member for Lilley. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate said that this budget does not fix the problems but he is going to support it; this budget does nothing for education other than higher education but he is going to support it; and the tax cuts do not go far enough but he is going to support them. This is extraordinary.
If you listened to the Australian Labor Party you would think that the government had a very easy time preparing the budget over the last 11 years. I suppose the government did have a very easy time if you ignore the fact that it inherited a $10 billion budget deficit. I suppose this government did have an easy time if you ignore the fact that it inherited a $96 billion debt. I suppose this government did have an easy time if you ignore the Asian financial crisis. I suppose this government did have an easy time if you ignore the one-in-100-year drought. I suppose this government did have an easy time if you ignore the dotcom bust. I suppose this government did have an easy time if you ignore the fact that Labor opposed every single measure designed to bring the budget into balance and that this government did not have a majority for the bulk of its time in government.
Unlike the opposition, we had a set of clear and simple goals. We wanted to see a broadly based economy, we wanted to lower unemployment, we wanted to lower inflation, we wanted to lower interest rates, we wanted to balance the budget and we wanted to repay debt.
The Australian Labor Party would have you think that fiscal policy, budget policy, is too complex, too hard, for the average member of the public to understand. Fiscal policy is actually pretty straightforward. Yes, there are complex assumptions behind budget forecasts and budget modelling but it is actually a fairly straightforward thing. As a government you should live within your means. As a government you should provide for health, education, defence and welfare. Once you have done that, if you have money left over you retire debt. Once you have done that, if you have money left over you give it back in the form of tax cuts. As a result of this approach we have seen the government deliver the longest period of economic expansion since Federation. We have seen this government deliver 10 budget surpluses compared with nine budget deficits under Labor. We have eliminated government debt and we have secured Australia’s economic fundamentals and social services. We have delivered five rounds of tax cuts and a sixth round of tax cuts has been announced, and we are saving $8 billion a year in interest payments, which can go to hospitals, schools and defence.
It was extraordinary last night watching the member for Lilley. He said:
Well, I think we ought to be running surpluses like this, given how good world economic conditions are. We have to be running surpluses like this.
This struck me as extraordinary. Mr Swan is saying that running the economy is easy, having a growing economy is easy and running budget surpluses is easy when the world economy is growing. It is clearly not that easy because under Prime Minister Keating we had a budget in deficit and an economy in recession at a time when the OECD countries were booming and the tigers of Asia were roaring. Clearly, it does not follow automatically that a booming world economy leads to a booming Australian economy and a budget which is in surplus. During the Asian financial crisis the regional economy was in recession but in Australia we were still growing. We still managed to have surplus budgets. Running the economy does not take care of itself. We do not just run off the back of the international economy. Good policy settings in Australia do make a difference.
What I particularly like about this budget is that we have Labor proofed future surpluses with the Future Fund and the Higher Education Endowment Fund so that Labor cannot waste that money as they have previously. What I also like about this budget is that we have now created the expectation that, when a government has the means, when it has the surplus, when it has paid the debt and when it has paid for essential services, it will cut tax. That is an expectation that if Labor were ever to win office they would be bound by. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-05-09,"—I used to defend Senator Fifield in the past. In his previous life he worked for the Treasurer and I knew that he would have been in there trying to convince the Treasurer to take the smirk off his face. But after that display of smugness and arrogance I am drawn to an article today in the Australian Financial Review. Senator Fifield, you should stay in the chamber for a moment because it talks about the ceremonial ironing that has evolved over the Costello era. It is the duty of one senior adviser to press the Treasurer’s shirt just before he steps into the House of Representatives. I am not surprised that Senator Fifield has run from the chamber in embarrassment because I understand it was his job to iron the shirt of the Treasurer just before he gave the budget speech.
The smug and arrogant government, as you have seen from last night’s budget, is alive and well because this is—do not misunderstand this—a very clever election budget but it is a budget that fails the future test. This is a budget that does little to build Australia’s productivity. We asked the government in question time: where is productivity growth? The government even managed to leave out of the budget papers the actual outcome of this year’s productivity growth because it is zero. It is a big fat zero. We listened to all the claims about the government’s IR reforms and how they are going to fuel the economy into the future. What do we find in the government budget papers? The long-term forecast for productivity growth is the long-term average. There is no increase in productivity growth forecast from the government’s IR reforms.
This is a government that has failed to address the future. It has failed when it has the most improved terms of trade in 30 to 40 years. We have had a long-term decline in our terms of trade and our economy has had to really pull its weight. But because we have had the biggest increase in the terms of trade in 30 to 40 years we have a complacent government that is coasting along. Fifty-five billion dollars was injected into the economy by this government last night for the next forward estimates period. That comes off $300 billion of growth in the economy from the mining boom. This is a massive injection of cash, and what it is masking is a low productivity growth. The government has failed to address our flagging productivity. It has failed to invest in a genuine education revolution. Today we had Senator Minchin and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, talking about the use of the $5 billion taken from the Future Fund.
—It’s not taken from the Future Fund. You haven’t got a clue.
—This government promised that all future surpluses—and there was your own promise—would go into the Future Fund. You have taken that money from the Future Fund. You have said that you are going to use the interest earned to spend on productive investment. We say that is a good thing; we believe in that principle.
Six or eight weeks ago when Labor proposed a national fibre-to-the-node network to build our productivity base—which according to the government’s own figures last night is impoverished—we were accused of economic vandalism. We had big stories about it. Now we have the Treasurer with his paws in the honeypot. Senator Minchin has spent the day wiping the honey off the Treasurer’s paws and the Treasurer has spent the day wiping the honey away from his mouth. Eight weeks ago this government said that it was economic vandalism to do exactly what it did last night. This government has not delivered a national high-speed broadband network. If you go through those budget papers you will find that again it has not faced up to that great challenge of climate change. It is smug and arrogant and it has not addressed the issues. There is nothing on clean coal innovation. There is nothing on an emissions trading scheme. There is nothing on renewable energy to encourage Australian made greenhouse technology. (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-05-09,"—What a pathetic effort from Senator Conroy in his response to the budget and the issues raised in question time today! Contrary to what Senator Conroy claims, this budget exhibits a strong long-term vision on the part of the government. Perhaps more than any other, this budget demonstrates that the government does have a long-term vision. It is looking to the next decade rather than just the next year. It is possible to do that because of the strong economic management on the part of the Howard government in the years we have been in government, since 1996. This has made Australia a very different and much better place than it was in 1996.
It is worth reminding the Senate what has been achieved over the decade or so that the Howard government has been in office which now provides the springboard for the next decade of economic achievement. Over that period inflation has been halved. Ninety-six billion dollars of government debt was built up year after year by the previous Labor government because they could not manage the government’s finances and they had year after year of deficits. That $96 billion of government debt has been eliminated. We have had 10 budget surpluses replacing those continual Labor deficits. We have got an extra two million Australians employed and real wages have increased by 20 per cent in a non-inflationary way. That gives the lie to what Senator Conroy claims about productivity growth. You cannot have real wage increases of 20 per cent and halve inflation unless you have substantial growth in productivity. That is exactly what has been achieved under the policies of the Howard government. That provides the basis now for the government to springboard policies into the next decade.
These achievements are not merely serendipitous. They have happened as a result of the hard work of the Howard government and the tough decisions that it took in its early years in government, and that has been built on with continuing prudential management of our finances over the years since those hard decisions were made. Again, they are characteristics that were never exhibited by previous Labor governments and would not be exhibited by a Labor government if we had the misfortune to have a Labor government elected later this year.
We can now secure those achievements to face the challenges of the next decade by building Australia’s economic capacity. That is what this budget does. It focuses on skills development, on infrastructure, on the environment and on the health and welfare of ageing Australians. One of signal initiatives of this government, which points to the fact that it is taking a long-term view rather than a short-term opportunistic view, is the establishment of the Higher Education Endowment Fund with an initial government investment of some $5 billion. That is a perpetual capital fund that will generate earnings year after year to provide money for capital works and research facilities in our universities. It mirrors the Future Fund that we established two years ago. Two years ago we were looking to the long term. At that time we were looking to the unfunded liability which the government had for the future payment of Public Service superannuation and we established the Future Fund to ensure that those unfunded liabilities could be met in the future. We have now established the Higher Education Endowment Fund to ensure that the education which is so important to our productivity growth is achieved and that the money is there, set aside as a capital sum, to earn income which can be applied for that purpose.
That is not the only long-term initiative we have taken in this budget. There are initiatives with regard to land transport, ensuring our water security, renewable energy and further encouragement for retirement savings. And of course, importantly, yet again the government has reduced taxation quite significantly, to the extent that now the top marginal rate, which we reduced in the last budget to 45c in the dollar, will not cut in until an annual income is reached of $180,000. That is three times the level of income at which the top marginal rate —which was substantially high than 45c in the dollar—was reached when the government came to office. Then it was an amount of $60,000. In this budget not only have we increased that threshold but, importantly, we have also increased the threshold applying to lower income earners. The rate at which the 30c in the dollar tax rate cuts in will not be achieved until an income of $30,000 per annum is reached, compared with the previous level of $25,000. So there are enormous incentives provided there in terms of returning to workers the surplus that this government’s sound financial management has generated. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-05-09,"—I rise to speak on the motion of Senator Evans to take note of answers provided by the government in question time in relation to budget matters. I want to start with what the budget papers, the government’s own figures, tell us about the government’s performance to date. This issue was raised with Senator Minchin during question time and also with Senator Abetz. Senator Abetz, as per usual, did not really answer the question. Senator Minchin said, ‘Damned statistics and lies’, in effect, suggesting that the budget parameters, which are set by the government and which indicate that productivity growth is forecast to be zero for 2006-07, were somehow irrelevant.
What the budget papers tell us is that the government’s own figures confirm their failure to engage in long-term investment in the productivity of the Australian economy over their 11 years in office. That is what the budget forecasts confirm. To have productivity forecasts at zero per cent growth for 2006-07 simply confirms that the government have not been doing what they ought to have been doing in terms of investing in human capital and infrastructure to increase the productivity of the nation.
And why is it that we talk about productivity? Is it just some statistic that people throw around for political purposes? It is not. It is a measure of the future prosperity of the nation. Today’s productivity is tomorrow’s prosperity. It is a maxim that economists and politicians for many decades have been talking about. You look to the future prosperity of the nation by looking to today’s productivity. That is why one of the important functions, tasks and priorities of a government must be to keep an eye on where Australia’s productivity is. We know from the government’s own figures that, at this stage, their forecast for the 2006-07 year is zero per cent.
It is an interesting proposition because when the government talk about productivity they like to talk about labour market deregulation and their Work Choices legislation. Of course, it is not quite clear whether they are talking about the new Work Choices regime, their current backflip, or the one before when they say Work Choices is the great saviour of the Australian economy. At this stage, the government’s forecasts confirm no productivity growth as a result of the introduction of Work Choices.

Senator Kemp interjecting—

—They are your figures, so you deal with your Treasury and Finance statisticians and you tell them why they are wrong, because their statistics clearly do not measure up with the story you want to tell the Australian people about what is happening to Work Choices.
But let us talk about what the government have failed to do. They have failed to wisely invest the proceeds of the resources boom. They try to dismiss it. As Senator Evans said, there was no mention of the mining and resources boom in the Treasurer’s speech. Let us look at the facts, though. Saul Eslake of the ANZ has stated that the resources boom is responsible for an estimated $283 billion increase to federal government tax revenues above its original estimates over the 2002-03 to 2009-10 period. That is $283 billion more flowing into federal government coffers than previously and over the forward estimates period, and yet we have a situation where their own forecasts are zero per cent productivity growth for the 2006-07 year. That is the reality.
Since MYEFO alone, an additional $53 billion has flowed into government coffers above what the original estimates were. That is the reality of the impact of the resources boom on government revenue. That is a good thing. But what is not a good thing is your failure in previous years, in particular, to invest in the Australian economy in terms of long-term productivity. Where has your investment in education been until the electorate and the opposition started talking up this education revolution? That is what this budget is about. It is responding to political pressure. All of a sudden in an election year, after having cut investment in universities and in R&D, in 1996 and onwards, as a proportion of GDP, magically you wake up to the fact that education investment is important to Australia’s economic future. And do you know what? Australians are alive to this. (Time expired)

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2007-05-09,"—It is with regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 14 April 2007 of Mr Alan Ritchie Cumming Thom. Mr Cumming Thom was an officer of the Senate for 33 years, from 1955 to 1988. He served as a distinguished Clerk of the Senate from 1982 to 1988. He was Clerk when I was first elected, and I will always remember his kindness and professionalism. On behalf of all senators, I tender my profound sympathies to Mr Cumming Thom’s family in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr Alan Ritchie Cumming Thom</title>,Condolences,10,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2007-05-09,"—by leave—I was on the staff of Dame Margaret Guilfoyle from 1977 to 1982. Alan Cumming Thom was a senior member of the Clerk’s office during this time and I came into contact with him from time to time. The President of the Senate has outlined the very distinguished career of Alan Cumming Thom, who spent the last five years of his 33 years in the Senate in the very significant and substantial position of Clerk of the Senate.
The creation of the Senate committees is certainly one of the high points of the Australian parliamentary story. As the officer in charge of the Senate committee secretariat, Alan Cumming Thom is regarded as being largely responsible for the shaping, as I understand it, of the modern Senate committee system, after the establishment of the new standing committees in 1970. He was rightly very proud of his work. He believed that the Senate committee system was ‘the best constructed committee system in any legislative chamber in the world’.
If he was associated with some of the high points of our parliamentary story, it is also true that he was associated with rectifying one of our low points. I refer to the very unhappy story regarding the publication of the 6th edition of Odgers. In essence, in 1982 some members on the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure objected strongly to the publication of the 6th edition of Odgers on the grounds that Odgers’ views on the constitutional background to the events of 1975 were unacceptable to them. By this time, Alan Cumming Thom was Clerk of the Senate. Not to be defeated by what was obviously very partisan behaviour, he arranged for the 6th edition of Odgers to be published by the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration. This volume finally appeared in 1991, about a year after I entered the Senate. Peter Durack then tabled the 6th edition of Odgers in the Senate and copies were distributed to all senators, and I proudly retain my copy. Fortunately, this attempt at ‘book burning’ by some members of the Senate failed, and we can be thankful for the assistance of Alan Cumming Thom on this very important issue.
The issue of Odgers which so clearly transfixed a limited number of senators in the 1980s has not caused any concern, I might say, to those who came after. I am pleased to report that the subsequent five editions of the Odgers guide—we are now up to the 11th edition—were published by the Senate and edited very well by the current Clerk. Alan Cumming Thom’s successor as Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, recently gave what I believe was a most interesting eulogy at the service of Alan Cumming Thom at St Andrews Church in Canberra. I will quote a couple of lines from this eulogy which I think give an excellent picture of Alan Cumming Thom as a man and as Clerk of the Senate:
More than procedure, he influenced the culture of the Senate Department. It was, first of all, a culture of the work ethic. Whenever I see committee staff, particularly, beavering away in their offices late on a non-sitting day, I think of the pattern Alan set. It was also a culture of integrity. Alan gained a reputation as something of a puritan because of his constant concern with questions of probity and propriety. I well recall an occasion when committee members were proposing to do something which was only slightly dubious, but they were anxious that Alan should not get to hear of it and raise those questions of propriety which he always raised and which they were not too keen to have raised on the occasion.
Above all, he instilled in us a belief that we were there to serve the institution, as well as those temporarily in charge of the institution. He always reminded us that our duty was to the institution, and that the Senate was more than merely the sum of the people in it and the people serving it. We were made aware that devotion to the institution could sometimes cause conflict with those in charge, and Alan never shrank from such conflict if he thought that some proposal was contrary to the best interests of the institution.
Harry Evans concluded his eulogy by saying:
We who worked with Alan for so long feel a great sense of loss, but we cannot know the loss sustained by his family. I hope that they will draw some consolation from the fact that we have a better Senate and a better Commonwealth than we would have had without him.
As you can tell from these remarks by the current Clerk of the Senate, Alan Cumming Thom was certainly a Senate partisan and proud of it. He was quoted in the press when he retired on 15 February 1988 as saying:
The biggest mistake you can make working here is to have the impression that you’re here to get something out of it, whereas you’re not, you’re here to give something to the institution.
Alan Cumming Thom lived his life by these precepts. The Senate is a better place as a result of his tireless work.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr Alan Ritchie Cumming Thom</title>,Condolences,10,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-05-09,"—by leave—I offer my condolence on the passing of Mr Alan Cumming Thom. I rise today to give my personal thanks for the enormous contribution made to the Senate by the recently deceased Alan Cumming Thom. I commence by saying that Mr Cumming Thom was a personal friend of mine and a man with whom I had maintained some contact since he retired as Clerk of the Senate back in 1988 until his death recently.
He contributed greatly to my ability to do my work in this place over many years, and his knowledge and dedication cannot be questioned. I got to know him quite personally as a result of an overseas delegation to Europe, where we developed a strong friendship. I was very impressed by his professionalism. Each morning he made sure that each member of the delegation was fully briefed on their responsibilities for the coming day. That is an important thing for people travelling with delegations.
Alan Cumming Thom arrived in Australia as a boy with his family, who had migrated from Scotland. He graduated in arts and law from Sydney university and was employed by the Attorney-General’s Department from 1951 to 1955, when he was appointed as Clerk of Records in the Senate. His career after that appointment followed a progression which was well deserved by someone who took his work very seriously. Alan Cumming Thom once described himself as an ‘institutional man’ as his career was dedicated to the smooth running of his institution—our Senate.
From 1970 to 1979 he was Clerk Assistant and had administrative responsibility for the Senate committee system at a time of rapid growth in the system we now know. The successful establishment of the committee system was largely due to his profound advice and assistance. In this task he was helped by his long experience as a secretary to committees, including major select committees such as those on medical and hospital costs.
In 1972 he was awarded a Churchill Fellowship to allow him to travel overseas, where he strengthened his knowledge of committee systems and helped improve his reputation as a leading authority on parliamentary committee operations. In 1982 he was appointed Clerk of the Senate, a position he retained until his retirement at the age of 60 just before the opening of the new Parliament House in 1988.
I mentioned that Alan Cumming Thom was of immense help to my work during my first decade as a senator. His characteristics of a deep knowledge of the traditions and working of the Senate combined with his calm approach to problems made him the first person a young senator would approach for advice. Mr Alan Cumming Thom also took on the mammoth task of updating and republishing the bible of our chamber, Odgers’ Australian Senate Practice.
In his later years of working here there could have been no more suitable person to take charge of keeping us up to date on the procedural matters of the Senate than Alan Cumming Thom. I note that praise was widespread on the occasion of his retirement in 1988. The Hansard of that time records speeches of thanks from Senators Button, Haines, Stone, Harradine, Brownhill and Michael Baume.
Those of my colleagues who were here in early 1988 would well remember the challenges we faced in the move to this new Parliament House and the regret we faced knowing that Alan Cumming Thom would no longer be at our beck and call to answer our questions about how to conduct proceedings in the new chamber and the new building. That we survived that move so well was due in no small part to the institution Alan Cumming Thom and his colleagues put in place during his many years of sterling service to the Senate.
To simply say that Alan Cumming Thom was a ‘true gentleman’, which he was, or was a ‘dedicated servant to the Senate’, which he also was, would be to miss the point that he was essentially a very special man whose strength of will and depth of knowledge ensured his success in his important role. I join honourable senators in passing on my personal thanks for the life of a fine man and a good friend. To his family, I add my sincere condolences at the passing of Mr Alan Cumming Thom. The Senate will not forget him.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr Alan Ritchie Cumming Thom</title>,Condolences,10,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2007-05-09,"—by leave—Alan Cumming Thom, as has been mentioned, was Clerk of the Senate from July 1982 to February 1988. His term as Clerk was the culmination of 33 years of long and dedicated service to this parliament and particularly to the Senate. He was, as Senator Watson said, a Scot who came to Australia as a young boy. He studied arts and law at the University of Sydney and worked at the Attorney-General’s Department before he came to work in the Senate—after applying for a position, I think, as Clerk of Records. He went on to serve in a variety of positions.
From 1970 to 1979, I think it was, he served in the role of Clerk Assistant in the Senate, and in that role he had administrative and advisory responsibility for the Senate committee system. He was particularly involved in the Senate’s establishment and expansion of standing committees, and his sage advice, based on his service in the Senate, had a significant influence on the outcome of that process, which is, as has been acknowledged publicly and internationally, one of the best committee systems in the world. He ensured that that was made public through writing journal articles and academic papers, and through presenting papers and making sure that students of politics and parliament were aware of this committee system and aware of the function of the Senate. As Senator Watson said, Alan Cumming Thom was awarded a Churchill Fellowship during which he visited America and studied legislative committee systems, and that added to his understanding of and expertise in the operations of parliamentary committees.
He was involved in the very challenging task of moving the Senate from Old Parliament House to the new Parliament House—I do not know whether we should still be calling it ‘new’ 20 years on—and he faced numerous challenges in that move, although I am not privy to those challenges. But he used his knowledge, his skill, his wisdom and his grace, I would say, to ensure that the Senate’s interests were protected in that move and not undermined. Senator Harradine said in this place, on the occasion of Alan Cumming Thom’s retirement:
I am sure it was not those pressures that led to his retirement.
It was in some ways a premature retirement. He was still a fit, active man, full of vim and vigour, and at the time I was surprised when he retired.
He was the Clerk when I came into the Senate. I look around and I realise that there are not many of us left, Senator Watson, who were here when Alan Cumming Thom was the Clerk—in fact, I think you and I and Senator Ray are the only ones in the chamber at the moment.
—And the President!
—Oh, and Senator Calvert; sorry, Mr President! But he was incredibly helpful and gave me very good advice. I had one situation which was a constitutional issue and could have affected me personally, and he spent a great deal of time seeking appropriate legal advice and appropriate assistance. When he gave me that advice I was sure that it was sound and appropriately sourced and I took his advice, and he ended up being correct. It was a time when I needed his advice and he gave it to me.
Like many other servants of the Senate, and I said this previously of Anne Lynch—and there are others who are still here but, to avoid the risk of offending anybody, I will only speak about those who have left the Senate—he would patiently answer, with the same grace and dignity, the same question that you had asked three or four times, instead of sarcastically telling you to read Odgers or to remember what you had been told the last three times you asked that question. The same question would be answered patiently and politely. It always amazes me that the Senate staff can be so patient with those of us who sometimes fail on the details of Senate process. Alan Cumming Thom was very much a Senate man. He believed in the role of the Senate, he fought for the role of the Senate and he served senators well.
He had interests outside the Senate: he was a keen cricketer in his youth, and a hockey player. I do not think he would have thought it was cricket when his wife, Mary, was taken from him. Some time after she died, I happened to meet him in Manuka and he told me how much he missed her and how different his life was without her. But, having said that, he told me about his family, focusing in typical Alan Cumming Thom style on the positive rather than the negative, and the positive was his family.
He was a gentle man and a gentleman. He had strong views, strong convictions. He was a dedicated servant of the parliament. I think the public often do not understand the incredible role that members of the parliamentary staff, particularly the clerks, deputy clerks and the committee secretaries, in both houses, play in ensuring we have a stable democracy. We take it for granted. When this place was opened—it is appropriate to talk about it because it was 20 years ago this week—Sir Ninian Stephen got up and said, ‘We share with only a very few other countries in the world the longest unbroken democracy on this planet,’ something that took me aback, because we forget that so often; we take it for granted in Australia. People groan about voting, but we do have a stable democracy, and one part of that stable democracy is the role that people like Alan Cumming Thom have played over the history of this place, a tradition that is continued by the staff of the Senate and the staff of the parliament. So often, until a time like this when somebody leaves us, we forget to express our gratitude and also to explain to the public just how important a role these people play in ensuring that we have a stable democracy and that it works to the best of all our ability.
So he was a gentle man and, as I said, he played an important role in ensuring that we have this strong, robust parliamentary system. With apologies to Shakespeare, I say: his life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world, ‘This was a Senate man.’",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr Alan Ritchie Cumming Thom</title>,Condolences,10,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2007-05-09,"—by leave—On behalf of the opposition I would like to join Senators Watson and Patterson in paying tribute to the former Clerk of this place. The Senate is basically configured by a provision in the Constitution and controlled by its standing orders. But, if that were all it had, it would not be a successful institution. It also runs on convention and runs on continuity, and some of the people who provide both that convention and that continuity are the clerks of this place. Alan Cumming Thom was very much part of that tradition that has continued for the entire time I have been here, and it existed long before. They never saw their role as being to dominate; they saw it as being to facilitate.
He was a very avuncular man, a very charming person and a person who obviously, if you look at the various successes he had and the success stories since, nurtured a lot of people, including new senators, through this place and was always open to that sort of advice. I only ever clashed with him once and that was over the reprint of Odgers in 1981-82. It was known as the ‘great standing orders massacre night’, in which John Button and I, and eventually Sir John Carrick, decided not to reprint Odgers in its current form because it had made some enormously provocative statements about 1975 which we did not believe the Senate should pay for. As a result of that, the Clerk did get around us very easily. He had it printed by a private printing company and then used Senate funds to buy all Odgers back, so we were done like a dinner on the subject. As it turned out, eventually Odgers became what we regarded as a slightly less partisan volume and it has been reprinted by the Senate ever since.
He will be missed and we should never undervalue the great contribution that he made to this place. We all appreciate it and we all appreciate the fact that maybe he did go a bit early in his career. But 33 years was a long time to spend in the service of his country. He did it well and he will always be remembered for it.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr Alan Ritchie Cumming Thom</title>,Condolences,10,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-05-09,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and pursuant to notice given on 29 March 2007, I now withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for five sitting days after today.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,11,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-05-09,"—The matter of public importance that I have moved today deals with aspects of last night’s budget. Naturally, the day after the budget there would be a focus on some aspects of it. I intend to touch on these in my contribution.
First and foremost, as the Labor Party have indicated, we welcome the tax cuts and one-off payments that were announced in last night’s budget. The tax cuts will apply from 1 July, generally to low- and middle-income earners. Those earning between approximately $10,000 to $26,000 receive a tax cut ranging between $3 and $6 per week and those earning between $27,000 and $70,000 receive a tax cut of between $10 and $14, but the tax cut peaks at about $21 per week for those earning between $30,000 and $40,000. There are further tax cuts for middle- and higher income earners from 1 July next year. Labor broadly welcome those tax cuts.
Frankly, it is about time that low- and middle-income earners did receive a tax cut, because what has been a contrast in previous budgets is that group of low- and middle-income Australians—the battlers—who have been doing it tough in many respects. They have had increases in petrol prices, food prices, rent and mortgages. There have been four interest rate increases since the last election. I would remind the chamber and those listening of the promise of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that interest rates would remain low under a re-elected Liberal government—a promise made and broken. So low- and middle-income earners do deserve some tax relief, and that is delivered from 1 July. Unfortunately it is a bit late and was not given great consideration in previous budgets.
However, looking at the value of those tax cuts, many of the taxpayers in the low- and middle-income bracket who receive a tax cut from 1 July are receiving back little more than bracket creep. Bracket creep occurs when the increase in wages takes you into a higher tax bracket. It varies from income tax payer to income tax payer, but a large proportion of that tax cut effectively represents the increase in bracket creep that has occurred over the previous few years.
Looking at the budget papers from last night, one of the interesting aspects of the tax cuts is that after those tax cuts are delivered to that group of battling Australians the individual taxation from income tax still increases. Income tax collection still increases even after those budget tax cuts: in 2006-07, it is $107,000 million; in 2007-08, $110,700 million. This is an outcome of two things. It is an outcome of bracket creep, which I referred to earlier, and also of economic growth.
Turning to the issue of economic growth, one of the fundamental drivers of a strong economy for the long term—sustaining economic growth, sustaining growth in the economic cake, in wealth creation, so that we can either have tax cuts or important expenditures to support health, dental care and like matters—is productivity growth. That is a key fundamental to the economic equation and to the long-term strength of the Australian economy.
I want to refer to a couple of aspects of productivity growth that I think should be of concern to the Australian people. If you look at last night’s budget papers, in table 2 on page 1-5 of Budget Paper No. 1, you can work out productivity growth for the 2006-07 year. You may recall that I asked Senator Minchin a question about this in question time. With not much of the year left to run, the calculation for productivity growth is zero for the current financial year. If you look at last year’s Budget Paper No. 1, the forecast for this current financial year for productivity growth was 2 1/4 per cent. So the forecast for productivity growth, which is important for underpinning long-term economic growth, was forecast 2.25 per cent but is going to come in at zero.
If you look at the forecast for productivity growth in 2007-08 on page 1-5, it is approximately 2.25 per cent. It is then projected, over the following three financial years, to drop away to 1.75 per cent. That highlights one of the lies around the so-called Work Choices legislation. That legislation is not going to be a major feature of my contribution today. But if the argument from the government is—and it has been their mantra—that Work Choices is about contributing to productivity growth, why is it that, for the three years from 2008-09 through to 2010-11, productivity growth is projected to fall if Work Choices continues in operation in the event that a Labor government is not elected at the end of this year?
Even more disturbingly, the long-term average productivity growth over the last three years has been below that which Australia enjoyed in the early and mid 1990s. This is a worrying sign for sustainable economic growth in the long term, because we are heavily dependent at the moment on a mining boom. I think I saw a figure from the ANZ Bank showing that the mining boom had delivered approximately $300 billion, although that may have been updated today. Indeed, while I am on the ANZ Bank and their well-respected economic commentator, Mr Eslake, the bank notes its disappointment at the low productivity growth that is implicit in the budget productivity forecasts; however, I am not sure if that should be attributed to Mr Eslake. Frankly, the government has run up the white flag on productivity growth, which is so necessary to ensuring our long-term economic future.
The best way of summarising the budget is that it is a clever political document designed to assist the government in securing re-election. It is a clever political document. We have seen it from Mr Howard and Mr Costello—but particularly from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard—time after time: clever political calls which are exemplified in a number of ways in the budget. I refer to one: the income tax cuts for low and middle-income earners who have largely been ignored in budgets in recent times. The government knows that it needs to lift its support amongst this group of battlers, so it delivers a tax cut for them on 1 July. The government is finally giving them some attention.
There are a couple of other interesting measures that are one-off payments. There are two in particular I want to refer to. One is the $500 that is to be paid to senior concession card holders—pensioners and seniors who are eligible for that card. They are to receive a $500 one-off payment. They are receiving some attention—rightly, I think. If you look at the battlers in our community, full age pensioners are really doing it tough. In Braddon on the north-west coast of Tasmania, where there is a high proportion of full age pensioners, I receive regular reports about food prices and petrol price increases in recent times. I even receive reports about things as basic as paying the rates on their homes. Where I live, the majority own their own homes and it has become a real battle for them. But I would pose a basic question about this one-off $500. You cannot help but think that this is yet another clever short-term payment, to a group in the community who deserve a payment, to help secure re-election of the government. What happens next year?
—Shouldn’t they get it?
—No, they should get it. That is exactly my point, Senator Ronaldson. They have largely been ignored and they should get it. But what happens next year to the battlers—the basic age pensioner receiving about $13,700 a year? A pensioner came into my office a few weeks ago with a rate bill for $1,200. She owned her own home but was sadly widowed. She was really battling to pay the rate bill. It is $500 one-off, but what happens next year and the year after? If there is a logic to paying the battlers like the full age pensioner $500 because they are doing it tough—and I think they are doing it tough—what happens next year when there is no one-off payment?
—It’s not an election year.
—Of course, as Senator Carr reminds me, there is no election next year; it is this year. Maybe that is why a bit more attention is being paid in this budget to the basic, battling age pensioner.
The other one-off payment that I want to touch on is the one-off superannuation co-contribution payment of $1,000. Labor supports the co-contribution scheme. If Labor is elected to government, it will continue. It is a watered-down version of Labor’s original co-contribution scheme, which the government signed up to and then dropped. It made a promise it would implement it but dropped it in 1997. Nevertheless, the co-contribution scheme will continue under Labor. Labor welcomes the additional $1,000 going into the individual superannuation accounts of slightly more than one million people. Labor welcomes that extra up to $1,500—the payment varies depending on your income and your level of contribution—but it is going into the superannuation accounts of people who made a contribution in the 2005-06 financial year. It is rewarding past saving. It does not deal with some critical threshold issues that need attention in the co-contribution scheme to encourage future saving.
I note that a number of commentators from the financial services sector have mentioned this. It is not just commentators from the financial services sector; according to an inaccurate budget leak some weeks ago, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton—to his credit—was purportedly arguing that the parameters of the co-contribution scheme should be changed going forward, particularly to assist under-45s, the younger group in our community. But he obviously got done over by Mr Costello and probably the finance minister, Senator Minchin. What have they come up with? Rather than redesigning the scheme to lift superannuation savings going forward into the future, there is up to $1,500 placed in the superannuation accounts of people who have already saved. Whilst there is an extra $1 billion going into super—that is fine; that is extra moneys—the fundamental design issues of the voluntary co-contribution scheme to give encouragement and incentive going forward were not dealt with, and that is unfortunate.
My colleague Senator Carr is going to comment expansively, I am sure, on some issues relating to the new part of the Future Fund that is being created for higher education. Five billion dollars is being placed in that section of the Future Fund, and the revenue is to be used for various capital purposes at universities. We have seen this before—smoke and mirrors, I call it. We saw it with the first sale of Telstra, where there was an environment fund set up with the proceeds from the first tranche of the Telstra sale. This was to support extra environment expenditure. But what happened on the expenditure side? In following budgets, the Commonwealth government cut expenditure on the environment in other areas. They gave a boost on one side of the ledger and cut environment spending on the other side of the ledger—smoke and mirrors. That occurred after the election, and I suspect we will see something similar if this government is re-elected at the next election. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-05-09,"—If that had been the focus group testing of the budget reply, it would have to be viewed as a remarkable failure. The focus group has viewed that as a remarkable failure. In 15 minutes we did not hear one policy from the Australian Labor Party. It is the day after the budget, and we did not hear one policy from the Australian Labor Party or Senator Sherry. Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, while you were reading out the letter from Senator Sherry proposing a matter of public importance, I thought it probably should have read: ‘The utter incompetence and all too obvious inexperience of the ALP’s economic spokesmen and spokeswomen and the danger to Australia’s future were the ALP to be elected to government.’
Today we have heard probably the most enthusiastic endorsement of the budget we have heard from anyone. The Australian Labor Party thinks this is a good budget. But, prior to that, Senator Sherry—so that his master in the other place did not get too antsy with him about the whole thing—had the gall to talk about the potential threat to tax cuts. This is coming from the Australian Labor Party, and Senator Carr may well hang his head in shame because he remembers it. What happened to the Keating government’s l-a-w law tax cuts? They just disappeared. It was the Labor Party blatantly misleading the Australian public in relation to a tax cut. In the last five budgets, we have delivered tens of billions of dollars in tax cuts to Australian families.
The Australian Labor Party has the gall to talk about battlers. When did you suddenly reinvent concern for battlers? Where was your concern for battlers when interest rates were at 18 per cent? Where was your concern for battlers when unemployment was at 11 per cent? Where was your concern for battlers when you saddled every Australian family in this country with $96 billion—$96,000 million—worth of debt?
Senator Carr, you are virtually the only one left in the chamber, and that reminds me: this is so important that how many ALP senators were here to support Senator Sherry? Twelve. The day after the budget, 12 ALP senators came to support their colleague on a matter of public importance relating to the budget—
—It wasn’t very important.
—I think they voted with their feet, and they thought this budget was so good they stayed in their rooms and dreamed about next time. Senator Carr, $96,000 million is $160 million per week that the Australian people are not having ripped out of their pockets. The government has paid off $96 billion. As Senator Scullion said during question time today, that is $160 million per week, $23 million per day, that the Australian Labor Party would have ripped out of their pockets if it had not been for us repaying $96 billion.
It is extraordinary that the only response you can give to the budget is to talk about productivity. Are we talking about productivity in 2004-05? No. But yes we are, indeed: it grew 2.4 per cent. Senator Sherry has come into the chamber today and alleged that there has been no productivity growth in 2006-07 and that is the result of Work Choices. I looked at my calendar this morning, Senator Sherry, and guess what, my friend? The year 2006-07 is not finished. ABS will not release their data until the end of the financial year. What an incredibly ignorant line to run about the budget. How utterly desperate are they?
If you want to talk about productivity, I will revisit a couple of things that Senator Minchin talked about today. He quoted some comments from Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group, who said:
Kevin Rudd talks a lot about productivity, but this reregulation will lower productivity.
This reregulation, of course, is the Labor Party’s new IR laws. What about Michael Chaney of the Business Council of Australia? He said:
Despite claiming to support policies that will lead to continued productivity, the ALP has clearly ignored consistent and strong business representations about how productivity and jobs growth is achieved in the economy.
The editorial in the Australian said that Mr Rudd’s reregulation of industrial relations will increase business operation and compliance costs and reduce productivity. It is very interesting if you listen closely enough in this place. When Senator Sherry asked Senator Minchin a question about productivity today, he quoted Heather Ridout’s comments and Senator Evans leaned across the table and interjected, ‘Oh, was that before last week’s changes?’ In other words, by their own admission, the Australian Labor Party have said that regulation of IR will dramatically impact on productivity—out of the mouths of babes.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—That is right! What the Australian people are going to have to make a decision about in five or six months time is whether they are going to allow the Australian Labor Party to dramatically reregulate the IR that has put up this very productivity that they are crying crocodile tears over today. Senator Carr, you are no friend of business but I invite you to listen to the comments of those in the business community. You might even want to ring the fellow that you have suddenly apparently dropped, Sir Rod Eddington—your conduit to the business community. How many phone calls did Sir Rod get in relation to industrial relations policy? None. Your conduit into the business community, so proudly trumpeted by the Leader of the Opposition, did not get one phone call from anyone in the Australian Labor Party in relation to IR. Not one phone call! This engagement with the business community—well, I think I have a rough idea of what Sir Rod Eddington thinks about you people and quite frankly I share his views: you are not worthy of his time.
There is only one group of people who dictate ALP IR policy and that is the ACTU and the union bosses, who are single-handedly responsible for the destruction of the small business sector in this country under the last Labor government and who have clearly dictated to the Australian Labor Party that they must return to their traditional roots. There is this line that has been run by some in the union movement that they have had to make concessions: well, there have been no concessions and they are charging you the full fare, my friend, for their $30 million in advertising. There are no concessions; this is a full fare and you are paying 100 per cent of the debt that you owe the ACTU.
You are only there for the protection of sectional interests. You have no interest in the wider Australian community. Your past indicates that you have no interest; your new IR laws indicate that you are hell bent on ripping apart the engine room of the Australian economy, which is the small business sector. Your IR policy, Senator Carr, is designed to allow your union mates to once again go into every small business in this country and enforce and impose on them your philosophical views on life. You have always hated the small business sector; you have bowed to the ACTU, which is determined to make sure that you make the lives of small business absolute hell. I think you get some perverse enjoyment out of it. And you get enjoyment out of it because you simply cannot control it. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-05-09,"—That was another fire and brimstone performance from Senator Ronaldson, although there were some valid points in amongst the finger-pointing. I think that it is important to bring some balance back to the debate before the Senate today. Productivity is an important issue and for that reason it is understandable that the productivity implications of workplace relations have found their way into the debate, and I would like to follow on from Senator Ronaldson’s remarks in that area.
He has pointed to the criticism that any form of shift from the coalition’s extremist Work Choices legislation would somehow harm productivity. Yet last week we saw Mr Howard make some of those changes. I recall the last federal election and the workplace relations legislation that was in place up to 2005. At no stage did Mr Howard go around in the election campaign saying: ‘Our industrial relations legislation is far too constrained. It is harming our productivity. Business is not able to operate effectively under our workplace laws.’ Indeed, if I recall correctly, the government used to talk quite proudly about the positive impact of its workplace laws. These workplace laws, I remind the Senate and the community, were shaped and maintained in a balanced form by the Democrats. It was only because the coalition obtained control of the Senate that they were able to wipe out the Democrats’ workplace relations regime and put in place their own extreme measures.
Suddenly, when the ALP put forward a policy—one that does not even go back to 2004—there is an outcry. Labor’s policies only go part of the way. They have accepted part of Mr Howard’s unfair dismissal changes. They have accepted the secret ballot. If the Democrats had allowed the secret ballot through this place at any time in the previous 10 years we would have been ripped limb from limb by various senators here and people in the union movement for daring to support such a travesty. Yet Labor have adopted that. Now it appears that there are 11 allowable matters—down from the previous number. So Labor’s policy is actually far closer now to Mr Howard’s, in many respects, than Mr Howard’s own laws were in 2004. Yet we are expected to believe that any change back is going to destroy productivity and lead to union hordes marching in and chaining up the whole Australian economy.
Minister, it is a ludicrous debate. It is about time we pulled it back to the facts before us. It is important to have more productivity, and adequately flexible workplace laws are an important part of that. But they must be tempered and flexible with adequate protections against exploitation. I believe that the Democrats did very well in shaping the workplace relations laws over the previous periods the Howard government has been in office. Since the loss of the Senate and the Democrats’ ability to put in place a balanced approach, we have seen great change. There was a balance between the undoubted pull of the union movement on the Labor Party and the extremist ideology that we are now seeing governing those that count in the coalition. But now the ability to find a middle path to deliver that balance has been lost. That is why this issue has caused such damage to the government that they have started to put in place the Democrats’ safety net that they so gleefully shredded at the first available opportunity. This was despite giving no warning of it during the 2004 election.
It is important in taking a balanced view to note that there are positive measures in this budget. I think that it is churlish and unreasonable and inaccurate to simply nitpick the bits that are bad and ignore some of the positives. For the first time in a few years the income tax cuts are directed at areas where they are most needed—at lower income earners—and they are directed and operated in a way that should enable and encourage lower income earners to engage in more work, including part-time work. That will assist productivity and the real capacity constraints that currently exist in the Australian economy. So it is a good measure.
But the trouble with budgets is that they are always one-offs. There is always a mad frenzy about one budget and then we all forget it and look at the next one—and of course we will have another mini-budget pre-election ‘bribefest’ later on this year and we will focus on that and forget what has happened now. We have not made the structural changes needed. A long-term policy of the Democrats, and one that we will continue to push for, is not to continually battle budget after budget to get tax cuts delivered back in a fair way to assist lower and middle income earners but to index the tax thresholds so that people continually maintain the real value of tax cuts. Whilst these income tax cuts for lower income earners and the hike in the low-income earner offset are welcome, in many respects this is just returning bracket creep. If we could do just one thing it would be to index or even partially index the tax threshold. Then we would not have the government raking in large amounts of extra revenue largely because of bracket creep and CPI impacts and then expecting a huge round of applause when they are just belatedly handing money back a few years later. We need to be putting in place some of those structural reforms that will have a lasting impact rather than just these temporary one-off bursts of largesse. That is a failing in this budget; the positives have not been locked in.
Another failure indicating lack of vision in this budget—and it also goes to issues of productivity—is the total failure to address housing affordability. As National Shelter have indicated today, even with the $15 a week tax cut for lower income earners—which is very much welcome—that is about how much rents have gone up in the last year in many parts of the country, and in some cases they have gone up more. People have already had to cover that just for the rent hikes without anything else regarding their cost of living. The whole issue of housing affordability has been left in the too-hard basket. It does not even need money spent on it to fix it. I acknowledge the government’s adoption finally of the Democrats’ longstanding calls for rent assistance to apply to people over 25 receiving Austudy. This was a ludicrous anomaly that has finally been fixed. It is not even going to cost significant amounts of money to address housing affordability, but it needs vision and structural reform. That has been left in the too-hard basket and that, frankly, does impact on other measures like productivity.
Another measure that should have been in the budget is addressing Indigenous disadvantage, and Indigenous health in particular. It was not, which goes to a lack of vision in core issues of productivity and key areas where capacity could be injected into the Australian economy. I simply cannot believe the total paucity of extra measures that have been put in place to deal with Indigenous health. At best count, about $35 million a year of extra measures for Indigenous health has been allowed, when we all know how much extra funding is needed for that. That is not only a matter of justice; it is a matter of delivering better results for productivity and capacity in the Australian economy. Those are just a few key areas. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget 2007-08</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2007-05-09,"—The hallmark of this government’s performance in the last 11 years has been unswerving attention to the state of the Australian economy and the capacity to manage the basic economic conditions facing Australians in a way that builds up the resilience of the Australian community through having a strong and secure fiscal outlook. What we have done with that has also been a very important part of our economic management. It is important to state that we have never seen the maintenance of good budget circumstances, the reducing of debt, the elimination of deficits or other good hallmarks of economic management as ends in themselves. We have seen these things as ways of delivering opportunities in two senses: firstly, opportunities for individuals, families and businesses in the Australian community to pursue ways of creating wealth, making those organisations and individuals self-sufficient and self-reliant; secondly, opportunities on the part of government to generate stronger safety nets for those people who are unable to take advantage of those marketplace opportunities of which I have just spoken. That is what this budget, I believe, demonstrates very clearly.
The matter of public importance before us today makes reference to tax cuts and payments to strengthen or support Australian families and carers. We look at this document, this budget, and see very clearly that we have pursued that philosophy. We have strengthened the economic conditions to continue to create opportunities out there but we have also strengthened the Australian safety net. As far as tax is concerned, this budget continues the trend of the last five Australian budgets, which have delivered tax cuts to the Australian community. That is on top, of course, of the very important tax cuts delivered in the 2000 budget, which was part of the new tax system around the GST.
The aggregate impact of personal income tax since 2004-05 is that a taxpayer on $30,000 has had their tax liability cut by 45 per cent since that time, and a taxpayer on $40,000 has had their tax liability cut by 23 per cent. That does not just compensate for bracket creep; that goes beyond bracket creep and delivers real buying power into the hands of Australians. It has done so as a pattern over the last six or so budgets. Since 2000, every tax rate has been cut and every threshold has been increased. It used to be the case that once their income exceeded $50,000 a taxpayer faced the top tax rate, but from 1 July next year that top tax rate will be incurred at $180,000.
This budget has been described as a budget that delivers a number of benefits to the Australian community, but they have been described in the matter of public importance debate as one-off. I want to run through some of the things the budget delivers to strengthen the support available to Australian families, to carers and to those people who are unable to take advantage of the good economic conditions. Let me run through them. There is $2.1 billion for childcare incentives, an increase in the rate of childcare benefit of over 13 per cent. That is not a one-off benefit. Payment of the childcare tax rebate has been brought forward. Necessarily, that is one-off, but there is also an additional $71.3 million for the inclusion support subsidy program for children with high needs. That is not a one-off initiative. There is $43.8 million to provide further financial support to kids in rural and remote communities. That is not a one-off initiative. There is $1.4 billion for seniors. There is $406.8 million for carers, which includes a one-off bonus of nearly $400 million, but an extra $6 million is in there for people needing immediate and short-term respite. That is also not one-off. There is $81.1 million to support volunteers, with an extension of the volunteer small equipment grant program. There is $128 million for disability services. There is $12.2 million over four years to increase the level of services delivered through the National Disability Advocacy Program. That is also not one-off. There is $116 million to ensure that up to 18,000 people with disabilities will be able to access employment services. That is also not one-off. The list goes on.
I think we make the point that these provisions are sustainable, are continuing and are about strengthening the support that Australian families and carers receive. That is all important. It is very important to have an effective safety net but, as I said before, it is also important to make sure that the general economic conditions sustain a sense of people being self-reliant and able to fend for themselves in an active and vital Australian economy. In a sense it is like the drought. What would you rather have to fix the drought—good measures to provide for emergency assistance to those who need it or rain? The Australian government has, in a sense, provided that rain through strong economic management over the last 11 years, but we also have an effective emergency net.
Our record has been outstanding, and I think it is fair in those circumstances to again contrast what we have done with what the Labor Party in office did in the same circumstances. Their record was falling real wages, high interest rates and high unemployment. How did any of that help families under financial pressure—the ones referred to in this matter of public importance debate? How did it help them? Of course, it did not. It created more families under financial pressure. There is nothing more important in our environment today than relieving financial pressure on families by creating opportunities for jobs, and that is what we have obviously done in spades.
A strong economy and fiscal discipline provide jobs, provide the capacity to increase services and family payments, and provide the ability to make sure that there is a real dividend to communities. Unlike what the Left of the Labor Party would have us believe, a strong economy is not only compatible with social justice but also essential for it. Productivity is important as part of that debate, but again I ask: where is the Labor Party on that issue? Where has the Labor Party been on all the big productivity issues and debates in the last decade? Where was the Labor Party, for example, on the critical question of water? (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget 2007-08</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-05-09,"—At least Senator Humphries made an attempt to defend this government. He made an attempt to argue the government’s case, unlike Senator Ronaldson, who thought that he could bluff and bluster his way through his presentation and talk about his own arrogant contempt for working people, in a manner which highlights just how out of touch he has become, why he was driven out of the seat of Ballarat and why it is he finds the red seats in this chamber so comfortable.
The budget that the government brought down last night and presented to the Australian people is essentially a poll driven exercise—a big-spending budget, an election year budget. Unfortunately, it is also a budget of missed opportunities. Labor takes the view that what we require at this time is a comprehensive plan to build Australia’s future capacity for productivity. We need to tackle the challenges of climate change and our crumbling infrastructure and we need to address the bottlenecks within our economy, which are putting such pressure on our productivity and on inflation and may well lead within the next 12 months to further interest rate rises. Unfortunately, the government failed to deal with those matters.
It failed to deal with the huge problem of what we do in this country once the mining boom is over. The Labor Party argues that there needs to be a determined effort by government to build our capacity for innovation through education and building our national innovation system. But we need to start from the very early times, from early childhood, and go right through to schools, vocational education, universities and university research. We need to be able to ensure that prosperity is sustained at the same time as social justice is maintained. We need to be able to build a fair and just society. What we saw with last night’s budget was the government’s neglect of those fundamental concerns. It failed to deal with those issues. And it cannot be argued that there is a shortage of money. After all, $71 billion was thrown around last night. Senator Humphries talked about rain. Well, it rained money last night! But this government failed to deal with those basic challenges facing the country and failed to develop a long-term vision for where this country is going.
I am particularly concerned about the failure to take up the opportunity that so much money provided to deal with the whole question of social exclusion in this country, which has now become a dominant feature of this government’s term in office. We have seen it through 11 years. This government has essentially sought to divide Australians. It has not sought to deal with the question of social inclusion but has sought to exclude people from the benefits of prosperity—for instance, with respect to housing. In last night’s budget there was no real effort to deal with the fundamental concerns that relate to the capacity of Australians to be able to join in this society and to share productively in the benefits of an advanced country such as ours. If we look at some basic propositions regarding our capacity, we see that our national investment in education in literacy and numeracy for four-year-olds leaves us at the bottom by international standards—at the very bottom of the international table. You would expect that Australia would seize the opportunity to provide real and meaningful access for four-year-olds right across the country. Labor has a proposal to do that. This government did not pick up that opportunity.
I have already spoken on the housing crisis and the failure of this government in relation to access to and equity in our education system. There could be nothing that is more damaging to the capacity of Australians to do well at school than homelessness. Every night in this country there are 100,000 who are homeless, and a majority of those people are under the age of 12. But what did this government do about that last night? There was not a word about it—not one word. The government said nothing about the need to allow people to have the equality of opportunity that you would think would be fundamental in a society such as ours. If we look at the broader approach this government takes to equity, we again see this government’s fundamental failure. The higher education statistics show that there is a decline in the number of Indigenous students, a decline in the number of students from low socioeconomic groups and a decline in the number of students from rural and isolated areas. What a fine achievement! We have more money than this country has ever had, but the government has failed to deal with these basic questions about the capacity of this country to come together and enjoy the benefits of that prosperity.
We have seen a failure to seize opportunity. We have seen the government’s failure to face up to the challenges of the future. As a result, what we saw last night was a piecemeal, erratic budget, with no coherent plan to deal with the big questions facing the country. What we saw from the government was a response to a whole lot of focus groups. The government sought to plug political gaps in its campaign to catch up with the policy initiatives that have been announced by Kevin Rudd. We had basic facts being neglected by this government in its quest to seek short-term political advantage.
Let us take another fundamental issue with regard to productivity—that is, the contribution this country makes to innovation, particularly research and development. This is an area where the government should hang its head in shame. Australia’s gross expenditure on research and development sits at less than 1.8 per cent of GDP—well under the OECD average of 2.3 per cent. But what did this government do about that? Nothing. After 11 years of this government, business spending on R&D has grown as a percentage of GDP—true enough—but it remains at a very low base by international standards. It is well below our international competitors. What did the government seek to do last night about expenditure on research and development? We did not see any movement from this government. If you look at government expenditure on research and development, you see that, in terms of our OECD position, we slipped from about third to about ninth in the period from 1996 to 2004. As a share of our national economy, expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP has declined by about a third under this government.
We have a government that has failed to deal with these fundamental questions. We are seeing a disinvestment in the future needs of this country and in facing the challenges of the future. We have a government that has failed to appreciate the significance of these issues when it comes to productivity. It has failed to appreciate the importance of research in ensuring that prosperity and the diversification of the Australian economy are maintained. What we have got is a cynical, cunning, clever budget which is aimed at the survival not of Australian industry, not of Australian economic security but of the political future of a particular government. The government seeks to beguile the Australian people, to buy their support and to present a position that it is concerned about these issues—but it has failed to deal with them for 11 years.
If you think about what is happening in terms of our international position, one simple measurement is the number of PhD students. We talk a lot about a skills shortage in this country but we hardly ever talk about the problems at the skilled research end of the labour market. Taking OECD figures produced in the 2007 fact book as an example, Australia produces 7.8 PhDs per 1,000 members of the workforce. Canada produces 8.2, the United States produces 10.7, Germany produces 21.1 and Switzerland produces 27.7. If you look at the number of PhD students per 100 graduates, in Australia it is 2.3; in Canada, 3.9; in Germany, 11.2; and in Switzerland, 10.1. By international standards, we are actually slipping behind. We are failing to measure up to our international competitors. This is in a context where we have an ageing academic workforce within our universities. With respect to the next generation of researchers, we have a serious long-term problem with replacing those people. This is at a time when we have also got limited opportunities for young people to join our universities because of a failure to develop the necessary research infrastructure. We have a problem with mid-career researchers and, at various levels throughout the university system, we have got major challenges before us. But what did we hear from the government about this last night? Stony silence. Nothing. We heard not a word about research training. We heard not a word about grant funding for the Australian Research Council.
We hear of additional money being spent for a new centre to be established in Queensland, around the research of Professor Ian Fraser—which in itself highlights the great benefits of Professor Fraser’s 20-year career and public support for his research. His vaccine for cervical cancer will probably earn him a Nobel prize. This underscores the importance of public investment in long-term basic research. But do we see that in this budget? No. We see a proposition for a special fund to be established: some $300 million per year—the equivalent of less than $10 million per university. In the case of a number of universities, this will not even begin to scratch the surface of the backlog of requirements for replacement of capital and research infrastructure in this country. We have a situation where the government is now suggesting that this money will be available only to some universities and only to universities that sign up to its industrial relations agenda.
What we have is an agenda where the government is seeking to present a clever and cynical political exercise. It is more sophisticated than Malcolm Fraser’s old ‘fistful of dollars’ approach; nonetheless it is essentially the type of approach that assumes that people will be able to be beguiled. I have a lot more confidence in the Australian people than this government perhaps does. We will wait to see whether or not the Australian people buy these arrangements.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget 2007-08</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2007-05-09,"—After that extremely high-flown rhetoric by Senator Carr, I would like to concentrate particularly on the education segment of this matter of public importance. The actual terms of the MPI before us today talk about investment in an education revolution. I would like to suggest to the Senate that that is exactly what the Howard coalition government have been doing since our accession to government in 1996. When you think back to Labor’s New Schools policy, which put a cap on the number of schools that could be established under the Australian education framework, when you think about the way in which Working Nation was managed—which offered a dead-end road to people who were not fortunate enough to have a job but were enrolled and were recycled around and around in meaningless training programs—I think everyone would agree that, in the 11 years of the coalition government, we have done a great deal more than that.
It is no accident that cumulative budgets have put us on a much stronger economic path. If you take, for example, the population’s investment in superannuation and the government’s investment in education, it is no accident that higher employment has led to higher wages. With the addition of tax cuts, it means that people are now able to put more money into super, which in turn will benefit them in their old age and will mean that the government bears less of a burden. If that is not investment in a good economic framework, I would like to know what is.
I probably do not have time to encompass the three areas of education that I would like to talk about this afternoon, but I want to refute a couple of the myths that were posited by Senator Carr. In almost every education inquiry in which I have been involved in my 14 years in the Senate, two measures that were dealt with in last night’s budget have come up time and time again. The first is eligibility for rent assistance to Austudy recipients. As we know, many university students, particularly if they come to capital cities, have to find rental accommodation a long way from their homes, which imposes extra costs. We are providing $87 million over four years to give rent assistance to Austudy recipients, and that benefits around 11,000 students aged 25 years and over. In addition, another criticism of our education policy has been that those students undertaking master’s degrees by coursework have not been eligible for the youth allowance and Austudy in their turn. We are now spending $43 million over four years to extend eligibility for youth allowance and Austudy to those students studying for qualifications that are a minimum entry requirement to a profession or part of a restructure of existing course requirements. That money in turn will help those students maintain their studying regime so that they are able to finish their course.
As well, our package A Better Future For Indigenous Australians means that in last night’s budget there is additional support and improved access to school and tertiary education for Indigenous students. The number of Indigenous students in tertiary education is very low for a variety of reasons. We are going to provide financial assistance, scholarships, training and employment opportunities for Indigenous young people from rural and remote areas, as well as education and job placements in urban and regional areas. When you think about the fact that we are also providing increased Commonwealth learning scholarships at a cost of $91 million to assist talented students from low-income backgrounds to attend university, this is not the social exclusion that Senator Carr talked about; it is social inclusion. We would like to help every student who wishes to go to university to do so. Some may think that that is an unattainable ideal, but we have certainly moved a long way along that road in 10 years of trying to help them to do that.
I will now quickly move to apprentices and technical colleges. We have made enormous strides in the number of apprentices we see in Australia. That number has increased three or four times since we came to office. It is important to recognise that only 30 per cent of school leavers go on to university. The rest find a trade, get a job or do other study. We want to support them, because the shortage of skilled workers which exists in most Western countries at the moment means that tradespeople are very strongly required. We need to encourage students to take up apprenticeships in the first place and employers to keep them on. Eligible Australian apprentices under the age of 30 will get an additional tax exempt payment of $1,000 per year as a wage top-up. That is again something that has been raised with me time and again around the countryside. They will also receive a voucher to reimburse the course fees payable to their registered training organisation by up to $500 per year. This is something that was mentioned to us in the transport inquiry being undertaken by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education at the moment.
I wish I had more time to talk about the Investing in Our Schools Program, which has been such a success for primary and secondary schools that we are extending it to the end of the year 2008. I wish that I could talk about the literacy and numeracy initiatives that we have undertaken, the encouragement of teachers to gain better qualifications—particularly in literacy and numeracy—and the way in which our capital grants will continue for schools. As well, at least we have managed to persuade state governments to bring together core curricula for basic subjects such as English, maths, history and science. But never forget that that is the responsibility of state government.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-05-09,"—On behalf of Senator Robert Ray, I present the fifth report of 2007 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 5 of 2007, dated 9 May 2007.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The statement read as follows—

In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No 5 of 2007 I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007, the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007, the Liquid Fuel Emergency Amendment Bill 2007 and the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2007. Each of these bills includes provisions declaring that an instrument is ‘not a legislative instrument’ but fail to provide an explanation of what is meant by this statement.
Under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 instruments that are legislative in nature are automatically subject to the disallowance and sunsetting provisions outlined in that Act. If an instrument is not to be subject to these provisions, then the enabling legislation must provide for a specific exemption.
On numerous occasions since the Legislative Instruments Act commenced, bills that have come before the Committee have included a statement to the effect that an instrument or determination is ‘not a legislative instrument’.
Where a provision specifies that an instrument is not a legislative instrument, the Committee expects the explanatory memorandum to explain whether the provision is:
merely confirming that the instrument concerned is not legislative in nature, and therefore not subject to disallowance and sunsetting; or
expressing a policy intention to exempt an instrument, which is legislative in nature, from the usual tabling and disallowance regime set out in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Where the provision is a substantive exemption, the Committee expects to see a full explanation justifying the need for the provision.
If the Senate is being asked to forego an opportunity to review and disallow a legislative instrument, then it is essential that Senators are provided with the information necessary to allow them to make an informed decision. In the absence of such information there is a risk that legislative instruments will become exempt from parliamentary scrutiny, not because the Senate has made a conscious choice to exempt them, but because Senators were not cognisant that this was the intent of the provisions of the bill. It is therefore essential that statements to the effect that an instrument is ‘not a legislative instrument’ are clearly explained in the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill.
On 29 March 2007 the Government tabled its response to the Committee’s Third Report of 2004 —The Quality of Explanatory Memoranda Accompanying Bills. The Committee welcomes this response, in which the Government has agreed to implement a number of the Committee’s recommendations. In particular, the Government has agreed that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will review and update the chapter in the Legislative Handbook which sets out the requirements for preparing explanatory memoranda. The Committee trusts that the revised Handbook will include information about declarations in respect to legislative instruments and will facilitate the production of explanatory memoranda which are of adequate quality and detail to inform the reader about the nature and intent of each provision.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2007-05-09,"—On behalf of Senator Robert Ray, I present the fifth report of 2007 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 5 of 2007, dated 9 May 2007.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The statement read as follows—

In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No 5 of 2007 I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007, the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007, the Liquid Fuel Emergency Amendment Bill 2007 and the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2007. Each of these bills includes provisions declaring that an instrument is ‘not a legislative instrument’ but fail to provide an explanation of what is meant by this statement.
Under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 instruments that are legislative in nature are automatically subject to the disallowance and sunsetting provisions outlined in that Act. If an instrument is not to be subject to these provisions, then the enabling legislation must provide for a specific exemption.
On numerous occasions since the Legislative Instruments Act commenced, bills that have come before the Committee have included a statement to the effect that an instrument or determination is ‘not a legislative instrument’.
Where a provision specifies that an instrument is not a legislative instrument, the Committee expects the explanatory memorandum to explain whether the provision is:
merely confirming that the instrument concerned is not legislative in nature, and therefore not subject to disallowance and sunsetting; or
expressing a policy intention to exempt an instrument, which is legislative in nature, from the usual tabling and disallowance regime set out in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Where the provision is a substantive exemption, the Committee expects to see a full explanation justifying the need for the provision.
If the Senate is being asked to forego an opportunity to review and disallow a legislative instrument, then it is essential that Senators are provided with the information necessary to allow them to make an informed decision. In the absence of such information there is a risk that legislative instruments will become exempt from parliamentary scrutiny, not because the Senate has made a conscious choice to exempt them, but because Senators were not cognisant that this was the intent of the provisions of the bill. It is therefore essential that statements to the effect that an instrument is ‘not a legislative instrument’ are clearly explained in the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill.
On 29 March 2007 the Government tabled its response to the Committee’s Third Report of 2004 —The Quality of Explanatory Memoranda Accompanying Bills. The Committee welcomes this response, in which the Government has agreed to implement a number of the Committee’s recommendations. In particular, the Government has agreed that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will review and update the chapter in the Legislative Handbook which sets out the requirements for preparing explanatory memoranda. The Committee trusts that the revised Handbook will include information about declarations in respect to legislative instruments and will facilitate the production of explanatory memoranda which are of adequate quality and detail to inform the reader about the nature and intent of each provision.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-05-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to take note of one of these reports. There are a lot of documents that have been presented that were tabled out of sitting since the end of March. I want to take note specifically of the report from the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts committee on Australia’s national parks, conservation reserves and marine protected areas. As the Senate would know, these reports will all go across to Thursday afternoons when people can talk to them, but I thought that on a report as significant as this it was appropriate to note it at a time in proceedings when people pay a little bit more attention than they do on Thursday afternoons, when they are usually halfway to the airport.
It is an important report; it is, as the title indicates, about our protected areas and national parks, including marine protected areas. It was tabled nearly a month ago now and has received some attention. I hope it receives more attention. It is an overview report rather than a forensic examination of the finest detail of what we need to do, but I think it provides some good guidance. The report was initiated by the Senate back when I was chair of the environment references committee. As the Senate would know, the government took control of all of the Senate committee chairs and the reference and legislation committees were merged in about August last year, so Senator Eggleston was chair of the committee for the final stages of the inquiry. Without reflecting negatively on any of us on the committee, I think that significant shift halfway through the inquiry, plus the fact that it went on for so long that many people moved in and out of the committee and went on to do different things, as well as changes in the secretariat, meant that there was a bit less continuity to the whole proceedings than would have been desirable. Having said that, I hasten to add that I still believe it is a solid and very important report.
I want to emphasise a couple of the recommendations that were in the report but, before I do that, I must say that on the whole it was a unanimous report. Senator Siewert put in some additional comments and dissented from one of the recommendations but, apart from that, the report is a unanimous one and it has some important recommendations in there. Firstly, a recommendation that I particularly want to emphasise is the recognition of the need for more resourcing at federal level for World Heritage areas. As with many areas of inquiry, there is a constant battle between whether funding should come from the federal level or state level, and there is no doubt that national parks and many other protected areas are primarily the responsibility of the states. The federal government provides some backup funding in other ways through the Natural Heritage Trust and other things, and particularly through the National Reserves System program. There is a very credible argument to say that when it comes to World Heritage areas, the listing of an area on the World Heritage List is something that is done by the federal government at federal government level. It is listed on the international stage that there is a credible argument to say that there should be more consistent funding from the federal government into those World Heritage areas.
I am thinking about my own state of Queensland, which has some crucial World Heritage areas. There is, of course, funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park—and I should note in passing the very positive increase in funding that was announced for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in last night’s budget. But among other incredibly important areas is particularly the Wet Tropics World Heritage area centred around Cairns but going quite a way to the north and to the south of Cairns, which does not have adequate funding in my view and does not even have reliable funding. It relies year to year on what it can get from the Natural Heritage Trust. I do not think that is a good enough and reliable enough mechanism to use in ensuring the management of what is an incredibly important area, both in terms of its ecological diversity and, as the committee received evidence to demonstrate, its cultural diversity as well. As a Queenslander, I am rather prone to pointing out that, despite the attention that is sometimes received by areas such as, for example, the forests in Tasmania, without trying to get into a competition about these things, the ecological values of the Wet Tropics World Heritage area and Cape York to the north of that far outweigh virtually anywhere else in Australia as the most mega-diverse area within Australia. It is incredibly significant ecologically and it is also very important culturally. The Cairns region is an area that has very heavy population pressures, draws in an enormous amount of money to Australia through its tourism and has a lot of people living in and around those World Heritage areas. It merits better resourcing than what it gets and there is a clear responsibility, I believe, of the federal government to do that, as they should also with other World Heritage areas.
I also want to emphasise the recommendation for more resourcing for Indigenous protected areas. The inquiry found that the Indigenous Protected Areas program is a very important one and is very valuable. It has delivered a lot with quite a small amount of money. It was not just the Senate committee inquiry that found this; it was also in the Gilligan report, which was a separate report that occurred around the same time and specifically examined Indigenous protected areas. This report also found it to be an immensely valuable program: immensely valuable in delivering ecological benefits and in maintaining and building biodiversity, immensely valuable in delivering a valuable role for Indigenous traditional owners in working on their country, and immensely valuable in making use of those skills that traditional owners have in land management that are not adequately being made use of in many parts of our environmental management. In recognising culture, in employment opportunities, in showing respect—in all sorts of areas it delivers positives. It is one of the best examples I can think of of a multiple win program and it is one that the federal government deserves credit for establishing. Like many government programs at state level as well as federal level, they have relied a lot on using CDEP labour on the cheap to be able to do the program without properly funding it.
Another positive measure from last night’s budget, I note, was the funding to transform some CDEP jobs into full-time government service delivery jobs. The largest area that it applies to is in the environmental service delivery area. I certainly hope and expect that some of those will apply in areas of Queensland but also obviously in states other than my own where it will deliver results. There is still a lot of potential for expanding in that regard with further government resourcing of environmental service delivery through Indigenous people, both traditional owners and others, and also through further funding and expansion of Indigenous protected areas. That is a very important recommendation.
That links to another recommendation which calls on both state and federal levels of government to make much more meaningful use of the expertise in environmental management that Indigenous people around Australia have. It is not just some sort of feel-good measure; it is a simple fact that one of the reasons we are not doing as well as we could in managing some places around the country is that we do not know well enough what we are doing, and we have genuine expertise in many traditional owners in many parts of the country that is not being tapped into. In many cases, it is—even if inadvertently or unconsciously—pushed aside.
I note in particular the evidence that the committee received in Cairns from both the Aboriginal Rainforest Council and the Cape York Land Council about how, when things are done badly, setting up national parks or other protected areas can actually be another form of dispossession for Indigenous people. That is not only unjust but also, even from those who simply see the need for ecological management, cutting off our nose to spite our face, because we are excluding the expertise that we should be making much more use of.
I hope this report serves as an opportunity to enable that expertise to be used, and I urge the government to pick up on those recommendations and some other key ones, such as those on invasive species. One thing I have to emphasise is that it was a pretty poor reflection, frankly. The first two recommendations of this report acknowledge that the report on invasive species from 2004 has not been responded to. Finally, I thank the secretariat. In particular, I thank Jacqueline Dewar, the initial secretary to the inquiry, and Ian Holland and the many others who worked on this very important report, which I hope will be beneficial in further focusing on and making improvements in what is a very important area of environmental activity—that is, our protected areas.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,23,1,speech

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—I thank the senator for tabling the guidelines—it was very helpful. I am seeking some further clarification around certain issues that relate to the amendments that I am moving. I want to go to the issue of threat again. I am trying to seek some clarification around the definition of threat—imminence, severity and scale. Let me use an example. In the guidelines they use the example of an oil spill. We have had many oil spills in Australia, and I would hate to think that a genetically modified organism would have been released in relation to any of these oil spills. I have a level of nervousness, as do I think a number of people, around what you would define as an imminent threat in relation to an oil spill or an industrial spillage, and I seek some guidance around those issues. It is not contained in the guidelines and, while the guidelines clarify some detail, they do not clarify that level of detail.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—The honourable senator raises an interesting point. The word ‘threat’ is not defined in the legislation—you are quite right. It is an everyday, ordinary English usage term and it is simply to be read as that. In relation to the relationship with the emergency, if you are looking at section 72B(2)(a), it says:
... that there is an actual or imminent threat to the health and safety of people or the environment ...
We are talking about imminent threat to the health and safety of people or to the environment. Subsection (3) talks about, among other things, a threat from industrial spillage. It all has to relate back to the head provision, which is ‘an imminent threat to the health and safety of people or the environment’. Clearly, a threat from industrial spillage would be a threat to the environment. It would be imminent and it would be actual. You are quite right to raise the question about whether a genetically modified organism would assist in that process. It may or it may not but, if it is a possibility and would assist in that sort of emergency, the government would like to be able to use it.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,—I have articulated in my speech on the second reading debate the concern we have about the release of an unassessed genetically modified organism into the environment. The issue of scale and severity goes specifically to the issue around industrial spillages. When does an industrial spillage such as an oil spill become such a threat that it requires these extraordinary provisions? That is what I am seeking to clarify and get some guidance on because I cannot think of a spill—and I come from a very strong environmental background—in Australia that I have been involved with in some form or another that I would think would be severe enough to trigger these amendments. I am not aware of any where I would think that the threat was so severe that you would release untested—and here we are talking about potentially untested and unassessed—GMOs.,SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—I think it is fair to say that an example might be if for some reason, hypothetically, an oil tanker was wrecked off the Great Barrier Reef and half a million tons of oil leached out onto the reef. That would qualify as an emergency under the legislation—that is the first issue; that is an example. You raise a question about unlicensed GMOs. As I have said—and I know we are going to come back to this later in terms of your amendments—it is only in highly prescribed circumstances that the minister can seek a licence. We will come back in a minute to have that debate but there may, for example, be examples where a GMO has been tested in another country and for various reasons it has not been tested in Australia. The emergency is appalling. It is a shocking oil leak but, for example, they have used a GMO to combat the spillage in, let us say, the United States. Sometimes governments have to act very quickly. All this legislation is about is the capacity to act very quickly to stop huge environmental damage.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—I thank the senator and I understand the example you are using. I must admit it sends shivers up my spine that at one of the world’s icons we might be releasing untested GMOs. That gives me further cause for concern, but it still relates to the fact that in the guidelines and the bill there is not a boundary around what the scale of the threat is that we are talking about. I appreciate the example that you have used. I would prefer it to be in guidelines, which it is not. I have read them and it is not in the bill, which is why I will be moving amendment (4)—to put some regulations around that. I thank you for giving me some examples.
I have another question, and it also relates to some clarification around a definition. It may be that I do not understand the legislation or have misread it. Am I correct that the guidelines say:
The Minister may declare a thing to be a GMO by regulation for a limited period if the Minister believes on reasonable grounds that the thing is an actual or imminent threat to the health and safety of people or the environment and there is doubt that the thing meets the definition of a GMO in the Act.
Is it designed to ensure that this in fact meets the object of the act and that a thing that causes the damage may not be a GMO but has been declared a GMO for the object of the act?

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—It is important that I should state at the outset that the guidelines, which I tabled earlier today, are simply guidelines. They do not have any legal status per se; they are simply an aide-memoire for consultation. The bill provides the legislative framework for ministerial discretion. It is probably best just to refer to the bill as it is at the moment because that will simplify our discussion.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—I do take your point but the question remains nevertheless because for me it is a bit unclear. A thing can be defined as a GMO even if it is not, so therefore it technically comes under the bill. One of the issues I raised during my speech in the second reading debate was the fact that we believe that some of these provisions could be outside the object of the act.

the ministerial council—

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-05-09,"—If the debate has concluded between Senator Siewert and Senator Mason, I should indicate that Labor will not be supporting the amendments moved by the Greens—that is, amendments (2) and (3) on the sheet we are dealing with. The condition that the bill requires, which I think is particularly relevant here, is that the states and territories will be consulted before these emergency provisions are enacted. That gives me some comfort that, if someone spills a can of oil, we are not going to release a whole heap of GMOs. There is going to be a proper process of analysis, finding out, and doing the balancing act. We will have answers to questions such as: is the loss of the Great Barrier Reef a bigger risk when compared to that of the release of these GMOs, given they have been tested in these ways? I feel confident that the sort of decision-making processes that would be applied in that circumstance, which I certainly hope will never have to be contemplated, are in place in the legislation. We also note that the states and territories agree with the guidelines as have been tabled. I want to put that on the record.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—I would like to clarify if there is the potential that these organisms will not have been assessed or tested—which is why we wanted to put some boundaries and definitions around severity, scale and imminence. There are also scales of threat. For example, the guidelines say that the states and territories will be given 48 hours, I think, to respond. Depending on the scale of the threat, that time line may be essential. It may not be, though. That is why we would prefer to see a clearer definition of ‘threat’ in the guidelines in the regulations or in the bill. The other issue in defining the threat is that the bill says:
An actual or imminent threat of a kind mentioned in paragraph 2(a) or (b) may include, but not be limited to ...
So while we have talked about the examples that are in subsection (3) it is not limited to that. That gives us some concern, which is again why we were trying to limit this provision specifically to medical emergencies.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—I know that by picking up on Senator McLucas’s point I am traversing some of your other proposed amendments, but can I do that just briefly, because it is important to do this and to go through section 72B, which outlines the discretion. It is highly prescriptive. As I mentioned in the debate this morning, it is not unusual for regulatory bodies of this nature to have an emergency dealing provision. The difference in this particular bill is that it is far more prescriptive than usual. It is not a discretion that a minister can unilaterally take up. Moreover, it is not one of those discretions that are simply subject to consultation—and we have all seen them. This is far more prescriptive than that.
To make an emergency dealing determination the minister responsible must follow the processes set out in the bill and the minister must have received advice from the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Veterinary Officer, the Chief Plant Protection Officer or a person prescribed by regulations that there is an actual or imminent threat and that the proposed dealings of the GMO are likely to adequately address that threat. If the minister does not receive that advice from the CMO, the Chief Veterinary Officer or the Chief Plant Protection Officer then the minister cannot exercise that discretion for that emergency licence.
Secondly, the minister must also have received advice from the regulator that any risks posed by the proposed dealings are able to be managed safely. So again—and Senator McLucas touched on this—if there is a horrible oil spill on the Great Barrier Reef, the regulator would have to be satisfied that the risks posed by the proposed dealings of the GMO are able to be managed safely. Again, it is another safeguard. Again, it is not the exercise of unilateral discretion by a minister.
Thirdly, before issuing a determination the minister must be satisfied that there is an actual or imminent threat, that the proposed dealings would help to respond to the threat and that any risks can be managed safely. Finally—and it is the point that Senator McLucas made—in addition, the states and territories must have been consulted before the emergency dealing determinations are made in any case.
If you compare these provisions with other emergency provisions in similar regulatory bodies, these are far more prescriptive in outlining the consultation procedures. I just want to make the point that this is not a discretion that can be exercised by a minister unilaterally. It is highly prescribed and a minister must abide by that advice.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—Except that there are stronger guidelines in this legislation than in other pieces of legislation that relate to emergency powers—and I would hope so, given that you are potentially releasing an untested, unassessed genetically modified organism into the environment and potentially giving it to humans. I accept that—which is why we are concerned that they still do not go far enough. Yes, they have to seek advice, but we are not entirely convinced that the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator have the necessary experience or expertise to advise on some of the issues that may potentially come up, particularly as they relate to untested or unassessed organisms. They may not have the information to make those assessments. That is why we would like to be provided with further guidance on what basis the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Veterinary Officer and the Chief Plant Protection Officer, for example, provide advice on the degree of threat around imminence, severity and scale. We do accept that there are strong provisions here; we just do not think they go far enough because of the potential, literally, for disastrous outcomes if it goes wrong.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—Let me refer you again to the legislation. If the regulator must be satisfied before recommending an emergency dealing determination that the risks are able to be managed in such a way as to protect the health and safety of people and to protect the environment and if the regulator is not satisfied that those risks are able to be managed in such a way—if the regulator does not know about the GMO sufficiently—then the regulator is not able to give the minister that advice and the minister could not exercise his discretion in favour of an emergency declaration.

72F
 
 Guidelines for emergency response

                  The Minister must, by legislative instrument, issue guidelines for emergency responses under the Gene Technology Act 2000 and the Gene Technology Agreement.
The guidelines for emergency response have been tabled, as we know. These guidelines from the ministerial council came up during the Senate committee hearings; they had been developed to give some clarification to how these provisions would be implemented. The Greens believe that these should be stronger than guidelines, that they should be a legislative instrument. That is why we are moving this amendment—to in fact require the guidelines to be developed further because we are a little concerned that they do not provide some of the information that we believe is needed. We would like to see these guidelines become a legislative instrument for emergency response under the Gene Technology Act. They need to be beyond guidance; they would be requirements to be met when the emergency dealing provisions are in fact invoked.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—Can I make a few points about the guidelines. I thank Senator Siewert for raising the issue. The guidelines that I tabled this morning work alongside the provisions of the act, and they set the administrative procedures for implementing the emergency dealing determinations—in particular, as you pointed out, Senator Siewert, the consultative process that the minister and the government must go through. As the bill is already very prescriptive about the process for making an emergency dealing determination—and I went through that before—the government does not believe that there is any need for the guidelines to be a legislative instrument. In other acts that I have referred to in relation to other regulatory bodies, there are no such guidelines for emergency response—and, as you say, perhaps in this case, given the great seriousness of the issue, that is appropriate. But these guidelines really are a technical document subject to practical implementation in the workings of the legislation. They really tease out the procedural process. I am not sure, from reading the guidelines, that they are appropriate for legislation. They really are an aide-memoire to consultation rather than strictly a legislative document.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—I am sorry; I may have slightly misled you. I do not think that these precise guidelines should necessarily be the guidelines that become a regulatory instrument. Our amendment says that ‘the minister must, by legislative instrument, issue guidelines’. I would hope that they would be more prescriptive than these guidelines here. They should be more along the lines of helping to define the scale of the threat in terms of severity, which we have already been over, and providing perhaps more detailed examples of when and in what situations these emergency provisions would be implemented—oil spills et cetera or where emergencies occur in environmentally sensitive areas, for example—so that there is more guidance provided through a legislative instrument.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—I now understand your point more fully, Senator Siewert, but the government believes the process outlined in the bill for an emergency dealing determination is very prescriptive. And, as I mentioned before in relation to the other amendment, not only is it very prescriptive but I do not think that anyone could argue that the minister could exercise any unilateral discretion. It is highly circumscribed and prescribed, and the government does not believe that any further consultative pro-cess per se needs to be put into legislation. I think it is fair enough to raise the argu-ment—and you have, Senator—that it is good to have the guidelines there, and I think you are right. But I do not think they need to be fleshed out, teased out or, in any case, reformed for a legislative purpose. I think they better serve their purpose as an aide-memoire.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-05-09,"—I should indicate that the Labor Party will not be supporting Greens amendment (4). I think that the explanation from the parliamentary secretary is quite clear. Given that the bill itself—and, if passed, the act itself—has a very clear explanation of what would occur, the status quo is quite supportable. We have had arguments in this place about legislation being put into regulations that should have been in the act, but I think in this case the legislation is in the act and these guidelines are simply a working document to tell people how the emergency response would in fact occur. Therefore we will not be supporting Greens amendment (4).",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-05-09,"—I have a question about the guidelines in terms of the process. The parliamentary secretary would be aware that we raised this issue during the committee consultative process. I know that the guidelines were tabled this morning, and we welcome them, be-cause it is fairly important that guidelines in any form come at the same time as the legislation so that we can see the whole pro-cess that will operate. As you would be aware, during the committee hearings people talked consistently about the need for the public to have an understanding of and security in this process, because it has a long history in our community. I would just like to get some clarification of the consultative mech-anisms that were used to develop the guidelines. What knowledge, if any, did the large number of people and stakeholders who have been involved in these consultative processes have of these guidelines before they were tabled today, and do they have access to them now? Will those who raised concerns during the committee hearings about how the process would operate have a chance to question what is in those guidelines?",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—The guidelines are of course a result of the review that was undertaken after five years of the Gene Technol-ogy Act being in operation. Senator Siewert raised that question this morning about the guidelines, and it is a fair point. But they were only finally approved last Friday in Brisbane by the ministerial council, and that is why they were not available to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs during your inquiry. I think it is fair to say that there has been exhaustive consultation with the states and territories on the development of these guidelines, simply because it is an aspect of federalism that these potential emergencies cross all boundaries. The document now of course is public and, as a public document, people are quite entitled to comment on it—and I am sure they will.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-05-09,"—We acknowledge that the public now have the ability to comment. During the very short time that the committee had to consider this process, we were aware that there were still some concerns amongst some people and consumer groups in the community about how this process would operate. It would be fair to say that the groups that took the time and effort to submit to our committee were those that have concerns about the process. If there are issues about the guidelines that people do not understand, will there be a facility to change the guidelines and not just comment or raise an opinion? What process is there for change?",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—It is a living document so, yes, it can change. It would be done by simply communicating with me and the government. There may be real concerns about the consultative process in relation to the guidelines. We do not want to confuse this. The bill has been out for a while and it is quite clear about what it says. That is a different issue. There is no question about that; it has been a public document for a long time. In relation to the guidelines, you are right. They were approved last week. I have just been informed that the guidelines will go on the Department of Health and Ageing website and also on the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator website. Any issues will be raised through the department and, no doubt, through state and territory governments. If people want to use those mechanisms, they would be able to have some input into the document, and that will hopefully address any concerns.

We think they are, despite the precautions in this legislation, an acknowledgement that they are greater than others. We do not think they go far enough. We think they are too extensive. The threat is not defined enough and neither are the triggers, which is why we sought to limit them to medical emergencies. At this stage we would prefer that these amendments do not proceed and that the provisions that are even tighter are introduced.

Without recanvassing my speech in the second reading debate, I think there are protections in place in the legislation that ensure that, if any emergency dealing were to proceed, the appropriate level of scrutiny would be applied. Here I am speaking personally: I am not a person who thinks that GMOs are the bee’s knees and that we should pursue them in any great way but, if we are faced with the option of using a GMO that could potentially save many lives or the environment, I think we would do our community a disservice by not using that option. I think that allowing this legislation to proceed with the conditions that are applied is the only reasonable thing to do. If there is the potential that a GMO could clean up an oil spill or assist in a pandemic of some sort, and we as a legislature do not allow that opportunity, I do not think we are doing the right thing by our community. But we have to make sure that the protections are in place and that the risks are managed, and I believe that the legislation covers that.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—I thank Senator McLucas for making the point far more eloquently than I could. It is ultimately a balance. Senator Siewert was right to raise the concern, because it is a concern that is reflected right back to the review process in 2005-06. In the end it is a balance, and governments have to make decisions about when they should take difficult action. You may say it is risky, but we tried to minimise risk through the highly prescriptive process. I accept that it is a power that we hope we will never have to use. Secondly, in relation to the environment—and we are recanvassing some of those issues—I understand your point about wishing to limit this to simply human health. But, if there is an oil spill, I think it is incumbent on all of us, particularly someone from the Greens party, to use GMOs if necessary to clean up an oil spill—an environmental disaster. It is a balance, but I think this bill is about as close as we will get to finding that balance.

(5)    Schedule 1, item 39, page 22 (line 28), at the end of subsection 50A(1), add:
    ; and (d)    on the basis of a full written assessment, the release of a genetically engineered or genetically modi-fied organism into the environment poses no risk to the environment.
This amendment adds to section 50A(1) an additional provision for limited and controlled release applications by requiring a full written assessment for the release of a genetically engineered or genetically modified organism before it is released into the environment to ensure that it poses no risk to the environment. We seek to add point (d) to address the requirement for full assessment. If we release a GMO into the environment in non-emergency situations, we believe that we should be very clear about the risk that may pose and ensure that it does not impose a risk.
Again, I repeat: we are dealing with organisms that we do not properly understand that have been genetically modified and we do not know the impact that they are going to have on the environment. I will not bore the Senate with examples, yet again, of the disasters that have occurred with the near release of genetically modified organisms or with issues that we are already seeing with genetically modified organisms. Although I personally have concerns about genetically modified organisms, this is not about trying to stop it; it is about ensuring that if anything is released, it is subject to full assessment.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—The review recommended that dealings involving intentional release licences should be split to distinguish between, on the one hand, field trials and, on the other hand, commercial releases. That is what we are talking about here. I should remind the Senate that the regulator will still need to prepare and consult on a risk assessment and risk management plan for a limited and controlled release. This is provided for under sections 50(1) and 50(2) of the existing act. What are being streamlined are the requirements in section 50(3) of the act. The government simply argues that this amendment is not necessary; it is to streamline field trials and so forth.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-05-09,"—Labor will not be supporting the amendment. I think it goes against the intent of what was proposed in terms of the treatment of an intentional release, which requires the full set of assessments and processes, as opposed to the treatment of an experimental release. The original bill, as I recall from back in 2000—a long time ago—did not make that distinction. I think that was a recommendation from the review: that there be a distinction between the two types of releases that are allowed under the act.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-09,"—I appreciate that that was one of the recommendations. The Greens do not support the scaling down of some of the assessments of limited and controlled releases. I remind the Senate that there have been escapes from trials and from limited releases. There are examples of that which we are very concerned about, and we are concerned about the potential for that to increase if we streamline too much the process for limited and controlled releases.

This amendment relates to the consultative and ethics committees. The bill proposes to combine the two committees into one consultative and ethics committee. The Greens believe that it would be more appropriate to continue to have two separate committees. The issues in this area are very significant and we believe that the two committees are more appropriate. Combining the two committees will reduce the number of people involved in the consultative process. By limiting the number of people on the committee to 12, you are basically reducing the number of people involved in those consultative processes. The feedback we have had from stakeholders is that they would rather see the two committees remain. I acknowledge that the stakeholders we have heard from are not all the stakeholders, but they are a significant number of them.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-09,"—Senator Siewert is right: the bill does combine the Gene Technology Ethics Committee and the Gene Technology Community Consultative Committee into one advisory committee. The review recommended the amalgamation of the two committees to increase efficiency by reducing the overlap between the roles of the two existing committees. The experience has been that there is considerable overlap between the two committees. The review did not recommend that any changes be made to the eligibility for membership of the new committee from that of the existing committees. It is desirable that no limits on eligibility be imposed in order to ensure that a cross-section of the community is represented on the new committee. This will ensure that the committee performs its role more effectively and ensure public confidence in the committee and its role in the gene technology regulatory scheme.
The government believes that the amalgamation of the two committees is not a reduction in consultation, given that the review identified that their roles overlap. This remains a critical element to the regulatory scheme. Senator Siewert is quite right to point out that consultation is vital. In fact, the new committee will have an enhanced role with two new functions. The act requires extensive consultation before the minister may appoint members to the statutory committees. These consultation provisions will ensure that a good balance of interests is achieved.",SENATE,<title>GENE TECHNOLOGY AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1,speech

I understand that most submissions to the inquiry process were supportive of the notion of joining the ethics committee and the consultative committee into one body. The reason for that is that the agendas of each overlap quite considerably; that there was no clarity between the roles of the two existing committees as they stood in the original legislation. It is certainly supported by the states and territories. We will not be able to support the amendment.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-05-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The annual report on the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s report to the Attorney-General on the results of inspections of records under the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, which was the previous report, reveal what I consider a disturbing trend under this particular government, that is, a preoccupation with understanding our every move.
I know that the government is claiming that its results in the telecommunications annual report highlight the effectiveness of telecommunications interception. In fact, these two reports reveal a government that is increasingly at ease with the notion of eavesdropping on private conversations, watching its private citizens and encroaching on civil liberties.
Last year, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, in its report into the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill, cited a calculation that, by comparison with the US for 2003-04, Australia issues 75 per cent more warrants than the total number of US wiretaps warrants, and that this represented 26 times the rate on a per capita basis. So prolific is snooping activity that the Victorian Law Reform Commission is investigating surveillance in public places, and there is work at the Council of Attorneys-General level for a CCTV code, which will surely lay the infrastructure for blanket surveillance.
I have looked at this year’s Attorney-General’s media release that states in the 12-month reporting period the Commonwealth got to almost 1,500 convictions. Last year, there were more than 1,533 convictions in which lawfully obtained intercepted information was given in evidence; as if 1,500 is the magical number by which to justify interception powers. Absent from the media release is the number of warrants issued and interceptions undertaken in the past year which were not of any forensic value. That figure, I am sure, is in the thousands. Absent also is the volume of information which is being produced as a consequence of this interception, which incidentally is likely to have swollen as a result of shameless amendments last year to interception law, which has provided for the interception of ‘B-party’ communications; that is, communications of persons not themselves under suspicion but in contact with a suspect. Perhaps this explains why the government has been forced to inject $65.2 million over five years to upgrade the AFP’s operational and intelligence systems and existing technical infrastructure to cope with all this additional surveillance material of innocent Australians.
Another interesting issue highlighted in these reports is the broad powers the AFP and Australia’s intelligence agencies have to obtain information without a warrant and without any reporting. I wonder—I am happy to put this on notice for the government—how much information has been obtained without a warrant.
I recall in 2005 the AFP being given new ‘notice to produce’ powers which provide them with a means of access to information without a search warrant when investigating any serious offence, not just terrorism. Significantly, that power overrides not only privacy laws but also legal professional privilege, duties of confidence and other public interest, and also prevents someone served with a ‘notice to produce’ from informing another person, other than those involved in responding and the person’s own legal advisers.
So the picture that these reports paint is one in which the government is creating a climate of fear through broader use of interception and surveillance powers, dobbing on neighbours through additional funding this year for its terrorism hotline, plus plans for an identity card in the form of the access card.
I call on the government to have a look at its own reports and, as a matter of priority, commission urgent independent research into the state of surveillance in this country, to judge whether or not the potential intrusion into people’s privacy is outweighed by its benefits. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-05-09,"—I want to take the opportunity in the adjournment debate this evening to make some remarks about the Investing in Our Schools Program, which I regard as being one of the most creative and imaginative programs for schools funding offered by any federal government at any time since Federation. This program was offered at the time of the 2004 federal election, and provided for a billion dollars to be made available to government and non-government schools for small-scale infrastructure projects.
It is significant that this fund is to be made available in addition to the $1.7 billion that the federal government has already provided to state and territory governments through capital grants programs. This is unusual because the states are supposed to fund schools—certainly the infrastructure and building activities in schools—but clearly the states are not funding their schools in ways which are reasonable and to be expected. Notwithstanding all the money that states get for these purposes and all the additional funds that they get from GST revenue, many schools, certainly in my own state of Queensland, are failing to get the kind of infrastructure support that they need from the state government. Indeed, in 2005-06 only 52 schools in Queensland benefited from a fund of about $10 million for building facilities. That was clearly well below the expectations and needs of the Queensland school community.
The Investing in Our Schools Program had very significant advantages for those schools that chose to participate, the first of which was that the money was provided directly to the schools themselves. That meant that schools could avoid having their money siphoned through state educational bureaucracies. The grants that they sought were the grants that they received and they could put them towards the purposes for which they were intended. The second great advantage was that it gave schools a high degree of autonomy. They were able to decide what the particular funding priorities were in their school community. They could decide the things that were important to them and, provided they came under the program guidelines, they could make an application if they chose to do so. The third great advantage of this program was that it provided opportunities for government schools and non-government schools—from the Catholic sector and independent sector—to seek grants up to $100,000.
Not surprisingly, it was a program which was very attractive to a large number of schools across the country. In the first two rounds of the program in Queensland, there were over 1,000 government schools that received funding of around $122 million. Nationally, in the third round of the program, there was an amount of $650 million in grants to over 6,000 government schools for 15,000 projects. There were a large number of schools across the country that chose to participate in the program and a large number of beneficiaries, and they covered a wide range of activities. In the south-west of Brisbane, where my office is, a large number of schools applied for and were successful in getting grants for a range of activities. For example, Harris Fields State Primary School received $97,000 for an ICT upgrade. The Redbank Plains State Primary School received $83,000 for a multipurpose activity court. The Durack State Primary School received $13,000-odd for the purchase of musical instruments. There were a range of other grant applications for classroom refurbishments and playground upgrades that were successful, and one school was successful in getting a grant for a stage for its large hall so that it could undertake drama activities. These grants were only relatively small, up to $100,000, but they made a very significant difference to the school communities which were successful in receiving them. They vastly improved the learning and teaching environment for the pupils in those schools and so, not surprisingly, there was a huge amount of enthusiasm for this program within school communities. In all the schools that I visited where these grants were received, there was a great degree of enthusiasm. The school communities were delighted to have had the opportunity to apply for the program, and all of them—every single community—felt that the program had served the purpose for which it was originally intended.
Perhaps not surprisingly, it was in that context that the government decided in February of this year to extend the Investing in Our Schools Program with an additional $127 million in funding for state schools and another $54 million in non-government funding. That means that, over the life of the program since 2004, $827 million has been provided to government schools and $354 million to non-government schools. That is a figure of about $1.2 billion spread across schools across the country in addition to the large-scale capital expenditure of $1.7 billion already provided by the Commonwealth.
This year’s budget, announced last night, continues this very strong tradition of the Commonwealth funding school communities through a range of a new programs. I think this is one of the most significant federal education budgets since Federation. It will provide, for example, $121 million over four years to more than 400 regional and remote non-government schools to attract and retain teachers. It will provide an additional $53 million to improve literacy and numeracy skills, particularly in years 3, 5, 7 and 9. It will provide $50 million to assist non-government boarding schools, particularly those that cater for remote areas and accommodate Indigenous students. Finally, there is a figure of $15.3 million in the budget that has been allocated to the urgent upgrades and repairs of boarding schools across the country.
These programs—the programs announced in the budget last night and the program that existed, the Investing in Our Schools Program—underscore a very strong commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to supporting our school community. The Investing in Our Schools Program has provided an excellent physical learning and teaching environment for pupils and teachers in our schools, and the commitments that the budget made last might underscore the need for continual improvement in our school programs by providing strong support for quality teaching, strong support for quality teaching outcomes and an opportunity for schools in some of the more remote parts of the country—that is particularly attractive in Queensland—to take advantage of these many programs. I commend these programs to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Investing In Our Schools Program</title>,Adjournment,37,1,speech

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-05-09,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
In June 2006, Airservices Australia’s consultation process led the organisation to conclude that some elements of the aviation industry and government needed more time to consider the costs, timeframe and implementation issues associated with the introduction of ADS-B technology in lieu of enroute radars.
Airservices therefore made the decision to cancel the Request for Proposal (RFP) process for the purchase and installation of a quantity of ADS-B avionics.  Airservices felt that it could not in good faith continue with the RFP while important issues about the introduction of ADS-B technology in lieu of enroute radars remained unresolved.  Steps have since been taken towards resolution of these issues.
Airservices Australia is developing alternative arrangements for ADS-B implementation through a wider consultation process. This began with an inter-agency workshop on 15 September 2006, and will continue with development of an inter-agency Aviation Industry Discussion Paper to be released in the first quarter of 2007. Such discussion paper is likely to consider options such as small-scale demonstrations of ADS-B technology.
No.
Airservices Australia made a decision to terminate the RFP process on 23 June 2006. Airservices Australia was of the view that the aviation industry and the Australian Government needed more time to consider the costs, timeframe and implementation of ADS-B technology.  Airservices Australia was restricted by the Conditions of Proposal regarding consultation and notification of termination.
No.
Airservices Australia did not notify industry of termination of the RFP prior to 23 June 2006 as Airservices Australia was required to comply with the Conditions of Proposal by notifying all respondents of the termination and the wider industry through a notice placed on the Airservices Australia website.
Yes, respondents to the RFP were provided correspondence which included the following statement:
“Airservices Australia wishes to advise of recent developments in relation to RFP 05/06-17. Due to delays in the implementation of ADS-B in Australia, Airservices will not continue to finalise the acquisition of ADS-B avionics at this time.
In accordance with the Conditions of Proposal, Airservices Australia advises that the RFP process is hereby terminated with immediate effect.  The original of your Proposal will be archived in accordance with our obligations under the Archives Act 1983.  All copies of your Proposal will be destroyed by Airservices Australia within 10 business days of the date of this correspondence unless you advise otherwise.
Airservices Australia acknowledges your company’s efforts in support of the ADS-B program to date.”
There was no application process associated with the RFP.  The RFP documentation was freely available for download from the Airservices Australia website.  Airservices Australia received seven responses to the RFP.
No, it is not expected that the RFP process will be re-opened.
The approach now being taken to the wider application of ADS-B as outlined in (2) above, means that Airservices does not have an immediate requirement to investigate the development of ADS-B avionics for general aviation at this time.  In addition, the offers received in response to the RFP have expired.  A future tender (if any) is likely to be subject to a new procurement process.
Airservices did not provide any grants and is not aware of any grants that may have been made through Government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Airservices Australia: Avionics Tender</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,39,1,answer
