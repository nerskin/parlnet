"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-12,"—We had just about got through this last night. These amendments are about making sure that we are helping independents—a lot of them are basically small businesses—to collectively bargain, streamlining the process, lightening their load and making it easier for them. The reason this is so important is that if this Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 goes ahead, it will see the independents being squeezed out of the market even more because of very few restrictions placed on the regulation of service stations across Australia.
I appeal to senators to think about this particular amendment, which is all about collective bargaining, making it easier, streamlining it. The Senate had voted on something similar in a previous Trade Practices Act amendment, and it thought that streamlining collective bargaining for small businesses made sense. This is all about pursuing that at a time when we are discussing legislation for petrol stations and retailing of petrol, which is a very important issue for Australian families.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-12,"—These two amendments moved, by leave, together—items (1) and (2) on 4928 revised—indeed have merit. They are principles which were recommended and implanted in the Dawson bill. The problem is that they replicate, for a specific industry, principles which are established at law generally. The difficulty I have is that the Senate has in fact already passed these amendments to the Trade Practices Act; it passed them with the Dawson bill. What happened was that schedule 1 was excised as a result of a combination of non-government senators and a brave and lonely coalition senator, and the Dawson bill then passed through the Senate. Those collective bargaining initiatives in the Dawson bill now await their passage through the House of Representatives. All the House of Representatives has to do is accept the Senate amendment excising schedule 1—if the Treasurer is so attached to that schedule 1, he can reintroduce it in a different bill—and pass that Dawson bill. These collective bargaining arrangements, which would apply for the whole country, would then be in place.
The difficulty we have with these amendments to the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 is that these would only institute that principle for the petroleum industry. It would be odd if the government, through the House of Representatives, were to finally accept the amended Dawson bill, which is what it should be doing, only to then have another set of amendments pass dealing with the same issue. That is my concern. Of course these can only pass if there is a majority. It would be useful to see what the views of other participants in the debate are. For instance, if Senator Joyce were to support these amendments, it would make a difference. If the government were to support them, it would make a difference. If Labor were to support them, it would make a difference. I would like to hear the views of participants in the debate because, as I said, the intent has merit, but we have a conflict in law if both these amendments and the Dawson bill amendments were to pass.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—I understand completely the intent of Senator Fielding’s amendments and, like Senator Murray, my concern is that we have already passed the piece of legislation that deals with these amendments. For whatever reason, they have gone down to the lower house and been sat on, but we will have a problem because we will have two pieces of legislation contradicting each another in the passage of the Senate’s Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1). However, that does not detract for one moment from the intent of what Senator Fielding is endeavouring to do, and I agree absolutely with his sentiment.
On looking at it further, my concern is that it means one or the other would stand and, in support of this, would draw into question which one we wanted it to be. My obvious choice is that the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1), as amended, should be the one that gets passage, because it deals with everybody—all facets of small business and not one in particular. The right of protection that small businesses should have and the right to grow should be manifest throughout all sections of the economy and not designated to one section of the economy in particular. I agree with the intent of this and that it should be there. I agree that it should be in place, but this gives us an overlap and would cause a legislative issue that people could knock edges off in a debate.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,"—The opposition essentially agrees with the views put by Senator Murray and Senator Joyce in relation to these amendments. We think it is incumbent upon the government to give passage to the Dawson bill. We do not want to provide the government with an excuse to further delay the passage of that legislation; they have the opportunity to give effect to these measures. If they are serious about these issues for all business sectors, as Senator Joyce puts it, not least the petroleum retail sector, they would expeditiously give passage to that legislation. Indeed, if they wanted to deal with this issue specifically for this industry only, they could support Senator Fielding’s amendments. As I understand it, they have indicated that they are not going to, and that is a test of their bona fides, I suspect, in relation to how serious they are about these measures. We will not be supporting these amendments. We continue to support the Dawson bill measures which have been passed in this chamber. We encourage the government to pass them in the House of Representatives, and we will continue to press that.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-12,"—I think that, generally, there is consensus on the perspective of the intent of Senator Fielding’s amendments. The government has a position with relation to the Dawson legislation which came through this place earlier in the year, and we have a view as to what we would like to see passed. Obviously, that will be dealt with at the same time. Certainly, the issue that Senator Fielding raises is not one that we are dismissive of. It is something that is contained within the Dawson legislation, and we would like to see that passed. Perhaps that is something that could be discussed with Senator Fielding down the track. Given the reasons that have been quite well articulated by others in the chamber on this matter, the government will not be supporting the amendments.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-12,"—In case a number of people are listening who may be a bit confused, the Senate has agreed that the idea of being able to allow small businesses to collectively bargain on a much easier basis makes sense to everybody except, it seems, the government. It is relevant to this particular issue because people have raised it. We as a Senate have already sent the signal that we want collective bargaining, but the government are refusing to pass collective bargaining provisions that make it easier for small business. If a political party were pro small business they would do all they could to make sure that what we have all agreed here makes sense; they would not be tying it unnecessarily to something called the ‘Dawson changes’. Let us be specific here so that everybody can understand what was said here previously on this issue: the government is tying in collective bargaining with allowing big businesses to merge together. The Senate said, ‘We’ve got some questions about making it easier for big business to merge even more,’ so the Senate rejected that part and then voted for allowing collective bargaining to go ahead.
The government looked at that in the lower house and decided not to proceed with allowing collective bargaining for small businesses on the basis that they cannot get easier provisions for mergers for big business. The two are totally non-related, and I think that, if the Senate does not agree today to reinforce the message that we need to have collective bargaining streamlined for small businesses—that is what this provision does; it makes it easier for independents and small businesses to collective bargain—we are sending the wrong signals, especially when we are talking about petroleum retailing service stations. If this repealed bill goes through, it will make it even harder for independents, and we need to level the playing field with collective bargaining. Again, I appeal to senators to support this in principle and make a statement again that we are for collective bargaining.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-12,"—by leave—I move amendments (3) and (5):
(3)    Schedule 2, page 4 (after line 13), at the end of the Schedule, add:
4  At the end of section 51AE
Add:
Oilcode
These amendments that Family First are putting forward are to ensure that no one company owns or operates more than 25 per cent of service stations. The reason for this provision is that we know that petrol for cars is an essential item for Australian families. There is not a lot of choice. That is another issue we can talk about another day; we will get to that one somewhere else. There is not a lot of choice and so we need to do what we can to make sure that we have real competition and more competition in petrol retailing and not potentially less. What we are looking at with the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 is that any restrictions that were placed on petroleum giants, going back many years ago, to prevent them from controlling any more than a certain number of sites across Australia were put in place for a very good reason, with both the government and opposition at the time agreeing that they made sense.
In 2006 we are realising that those provisions are not working the way they should, they are not serving the intended purpose and so it makes sense to change them. But to just throw them out and have no real regulation on how many sites certain players can have does not make sense. It made sense in principle many years ago, and so Family First is proposing to put some regulations in place that allow not only the big end, oil giants and large companies, to survive but also the independents by restricting any one company to owning or operating only 25 per cent of the market. This allows competition. It means that we do not end up like we have with the food and grocery sector, where we have two players controlling and dominating the food and grocery market across Australia. No-one believes that is a great idea, and there should have been some restrictions put in place to ensure that we did not have that situation. We have an ideal opportunity today to put some restrictions in place to allow competition.
I note that Senator Joyce has got an amendment that has merit that is looking at allowing 25 per cent of the market to be apportioned off for independents. I think our amendment works very well with Senator Joyce’s amendment in making sure that no one player can control more than 25 per cent of the market and also in allowing 25 per cent of the market to be earmarked for independents. I think our amendments are worthy of support, especially considering that Senator Joyce also has an amendment that is trying to achieve the same thing. I think that using both his and ours would serve Australia very well.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,"—The opposition appreciates the sentiment that lies behind these amendments and the concerns that Senator Fielding expresses, which are concerns held within the community, about market control and market dominance. With this legislation we are dealing with the removal of legislation that effectively capped site control. On the one hand, we have taken the cap off and, on the other, this amendment seeks to reinstitute a cap of perhaps a different nature. We also looked at the amendment in the context of the practicality of how it would operate. We have seen a reduction in the number of sites from 20,000 to about 6,000 over the last recognisable period of change in this industry. We perceive that there are a couple of problems with this approach. Let us say that there was not a massive dislocation when you put this into effect—and that is a big ask—and you did not force the closure of sites with this proposal, which is a distinct possibility. If then there is a further rationalisation, a player could find themselves holding more than 25 per cent without acquiring additional sites simply by holding onto the sites that they had.
Another concern would be that, in those circumstances, which sites would those who dominate the market hold onto? It would be the sites that were the most profitable and serviced the biggest markets. Perhaps Senator Fielding might say, ‘If you roll Senator Joyce’s amendment in with mine and you control volume as well, then we might be able to deal with that problem.’ But if you have the two limiting factors in the market and a player has to say, ‘I can’t have more than 25 per cent of the sites by number and I can’t have more than 25 per cent of the volume of fuel sold but we would determine that on a month by month basis,’ the mind boggles when you think of the sites that might have to close because volume has changed over months. I am not sure how the amendments would handle that.
I apologise to Senator Joyce for in part dealing with his amendment at the same time as Senator Fielding’s. The point that I am making is that there is a distinct problem with giving effect to the sentiment that he proposes. I am not saying that we should rule out the concept of devising a mechanism to ensure that market dominance does not completely take hold in the petroleum retail market, or whatever fuel market we ultimately end up with, given that we are talking about a model which, in essence, should go for a decade or more into the future. We have looked at the legislation and we have seen that there are some very serious practical difficulties with giving it effect.
In saying that we have sympathy with the idea that market dominance ought to be prevented, we are not certain that this is the best mechanism with which to do it. I suppose if the amendments that we all supported had been carried last night, it would be easier for us to have an expectation that the ACCC might have played a role in that. That not being the case, it is going to be incumbent on this government or a government in the future to come up with a workable solution and to work with industry on this matter.
The other concern we have is with the proposition that the legislation would compel the promulgation of a regulation which would compel an annual review, which is a somewhat clumsy way of going about it. If you wanted to require a review, why would you then ask the regulation to require a review? You would put it in the legislation. But, as we understand it, the Oilcode contains provision for a five-yearly review. We think that, if there were an annual review of the Oilcode, there would be a distinct lack of certainty in the market, given that there could be an expectation of change on an annual basis because of that factor.
So we are not comfortable with the idea that there ought to be an annual review. We were comfortable with the idea that there ought to be annual reporting, which would have given the parliament the option to accelerate the review if circumstances justified it, but to require a review on the basis of nothing other than a desire to be kept up to date with what was occurring in the market we think would give the industry the idea that the review would, almost of necessity, lead to almost annual change in the industry. I do not think that sort of uncertainty is necessary.
We are comfortable with the review proposed in the Oilcode. We would be more comfortable with a Treasurer who was keen to look at imbalances in the industry and to empower the ACCC to do the work that it can do to investigate fully the operation of that market and to report publicly, and we will continue to pursue that. Clearly the government has the majority in this place, and even if all the other senators vote together, and even if we see what occurred last night when Senator Joyce crossed the floor, we still cannot carry the amendment. So, if the government wants to proceed down this path, of course the amendment will succeed. But we think that the appropriate course of action in relation to this is that we look at the implementation of the Oilcode and we will continue to pursue the amendments to the Trade Practices Act which the Senate narrowly failed to support last night.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-12,"—The concept of a 25 per cent market measure has quite a good pedigree. The Fair Trading Act 1973 in the United Kingdom was altered to ensure that there was a warning mechanism measure inserted in regulatory practice whereby companies or organisations which reached a 25 per cent market share were put on notice that they were subject to competition law or a competition regulator watch and had enhanced reporting requirements put against them. Of course, 25 per cent is an arbitrary figure, but it was a recognition that 25 per cent delivers very substantial market power.
One of the great criticisms I have had of this government in the 10 years I have been pursuing these matters in depth is that they have failed in trade practices matters to take note of advanced, flexible and workable mechanisms which operate in similar overseas jurisdictions, which are effective in assisting the restraint of any abuse of market power and in ensuring that corporate operators in the market, particularly in intensely concentrated or oligopolised markets, are appropriately restrained and regulated. There is a lack of similar mechanisms here. I continually describe our Trade Practices Act as weak. It is intentionally weak, because the government will not take action in these matters. The Labor Party, to their credit, have recognised the way in which competition law needs to move and consistently over the last few years have joined the Democrats and others in the Senate chamber arguing for a strengthened Trade Practices Act.
I note in debate that the coalition often get annoyed with being told that they are overly subservient to big business views in the matter of trade practices law, but I am afraid that is the distinct impression that legislators, policymakers, small business observers and many media and expert observers have. One of these days, hopefully, the coalition will act to correct that perception. So once again—because I have done it over many years—I draw the attention of the government to the United Kingdom processes and procedures established under the Fair Trading Act, particularly what is appropriately regarded as a warning mechanism for a trigger percentage which alerts one to market concentration.
Having said that, of course, I can see that the danger of the design of Senator Fielding’s amendment was picked up by Senator Joyce in debate. It could, in practice—as opposed to the intent of the designer because the intent is a good one—lead to oligopolisation: namely, the creation of a number of major players, each approximating 25 per cent. It is certainly not the intent of Senator Fielding to end up with four companies running the entire petroleum market, each with a 25 per cent market share of retailing. I have not got the impression that is his intent, but it is why Senator Fielding has reacted well to Senator Joyce’s flip side, which is to reserve a portion of the market for non-major players. He commented on that in his earlier remarks. But I see a fatal flaw at the heart of this: the way in which the amendment is designed could lead to more concentration rather than less—an unintended consequence, I think.
There is a difficulty with industry specific regulation. I am not entirely averse to industry specific regulation—in other debates on other bills at other times I have supported it—but I am of a view that we should move more and more towards general law provisions rather than specific industry provisions. I have noted that the Commonwealth have followed that practice—with respect, for instance, to the criminal code, extracting elements and clauses out of individual pieces of legislation and putting them in the general legislation which covers criminal law to do with issues of fraud or where there is a penalty or other issues. I think we would need far less industry specific regulation in areas like Telstra, the media—or, as we dealing with here, petrol—if our general law were strengthened.
That is one of the reasons I have persistently, consistently and in detail, argued in this place for the assumption of divestiture laws being the flip side of merger and acquisition laws. They work exceptionally well in the most dynamic capital market in the world, which is the United States. The fact that the coalition government, and the coalition at large, will not accept the value of anti-trust or divestiture laws overall, is to their discredit because it is part of the law in the dynamic USA capital market. And once you introduce the flip side to merger and acquisition—which is the ability of the regulator to insist on divestiture in the appropriate circumstances—you can afford to back off from industry specific law because the regulator has a mechanism available.
It is no good saying to me that section 81 covers divestiture, because it only covers divestiture in very limited circumstances. I note, again to the credit of the chair of the committee, and to the credit of the Labor Party, that support for divestiture laws was included in the majority views spelt out in the Senate Economic References Committee, in its report The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business.
Let me tell you, if there is one constituency that does not want effective divestiture laws it is big business. As I said, it is to the discredit of the coalition government, which has been quite brave and gutsy in other areas of corporate law reform, that it will not take on this major policy issue. If divestiture did exist, you would be able to parallel with it the UK early warning system of, when you reach a sizeable market share, being put on watch. Then senators would not need to take the initiative—as Senator Fielding has—to try to introduce a minimum mechanism in a particular industry to serve a particular need at a particular time, because the general law would be sufficient.
That is not Senator Fielding’s fault; it is the fault of a failure of broad political principle and policy by the coalition. If the government loses government next time, or the time after, I look forward, shadow minister, to the Labor Party taking up these issues and bringing forward the sound recommendations that are supported in the Senate Economics References Committee report.
The shadow minister raised the issue of review, which is covered in these amendments. I agree with the shadow minister and Senator Fielding that the Oilcode needs to be reviewed, and probably on a regular basis. It is a moving market and it is an extremely dynamic market. It is a complex and very sensitive market from the perception of consumers and businesses, and if the Oilcode is to be the principal and mandatory regulatory mechanism to keep the oil industry honest—I will not use the pejorative word—then the Oilcode needs to be kept constantly under review, and independently so.
The shadow minister made the remark that the role of monitoring and reviewing the oil code is currently contained in section 3 of the draft Oilcode, and that the review and monitoring role will be shared by the ACCC and the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. I consider the ACCC, in law, to be an independent statutory authority. I do not accept the minister’s version of it being part of the executive, although I accept that it is part of the broad government area of responsibility.
I tend to see the executive as the coalition government cabinet or, if Labor are in, the Labor cabinet. They are the executive to me. The bureaucracy and agencies are separate. And, of course, independent statutory authorities are, and should be, at arm’s length. Anyway, those two bodies—the ACCC and the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources—should be sufficient under the Oilcode, as I understand it, to achieve the appropriate review of the way in which the code may work. Therefore Senator Fielding’s amendments could cross with that.
I am concerned that a non-expert body may be given the role of reviewing regulatory competition matters and I am of the view that these matters need to be given to the ACCC as the experienced and concurrent reviewer and regulator. So overall I am concerned that Senator Fielding’s amendments—once again, with the right intent, and reflecting a genuine concern that he has and that is present in the community—will deliver an effect or an outcome which is contrary to his intention. So I must join with my shadow minister colleague from the Labor Party in informing the Senate that the Democrats will not support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—Although, once more, I agree with the intent of what Senator Fielding is trying to achieve, and I understand completely how difficult it is to work with the resources he has, I have some concerns about a couple of issues. I have had a discussion with Senator Fielding and I agreed that, if his amendment went to volume, I would strongly consider it. But the amendment goes to sites. The problem we have with sites is that you could hold 25 per cent of the sites and 75 per cent of the volume. That could pose a serious problem. The number of sites is not a determinant of the amount of the market that you hold. You can have Big Bill’s discount sideline petrol station that sells 100,000 litres a year next to a major site on a highway that may sell a couple of million litres, 10 million litres or even 100 million litres. The number of sites is not the crucial issue here; it is the volume in the market.
I thank Senator Fielding for his support for a following amendment which goes to volume. We really need to change this and make it a volumetric statement which is part of the same amendment, because there is the possibility of getting only one through. If Senator Fielding’s amendment went through as it stands and mine failed—and I know that is not going to happen, but let us presume it does; we can always hope for miracles—we would have a position where four petrol retailers could control 100 per cent of the sites. We know there are six retailers—the four majors and Coles and Woolworths. So it is quite possible that we could have complete saturation of the marketplace without any independents.
The aim—and this is where I agree with Senator Fielding’s intent—is to find a section of the market in which the independents can live. It was the intent of the 1980 act to do that and the intent remains. People do not change that much. The principle of fairness does not change over time. Modern Australian freedom should include the principle of freedom to go into business. That principle does not change over time, or I hope it has not changed. If we all end up working for business, we may as well work for government. The conservative side of politics believes that it is an absolutely fundamental principle that you have the freedom to go into business and be master of your own ship. That is what I am trying to address when I seek a section for those operators to exist in, because we do not all want to work for somebody else. Some of us like to work for ourselves. It is a basic principle to be able to do so.
I agree with the intent of what Senator Fielding is trying to achieve. My concern is that we are talking about sites, not volume. When we talk about sites we make no statement whatsoever about the volume that can exist in the market. In addition, the amendment starts to cross paths with the ACCC and the role of the ACCC. I believe in having a stronger ACCC. I believe—and I place this on the record—that Professor Fels had a much stronger and more partisan view of being an arbiter in the ACCC than possibly that body’s current incumbents. But that is an issue for another day.
When I look at this amendment I see two issues. Firstly, four retailers can control 100 per cent of the sites. This would leave no room for independents to exist. Secondly, the amendment talks about sites, so you could have one retailer having 25 per cent of the sites but possibly 75 per cent of the volume. Obviously, you would ensure that you set off on a path of taking over the major sites that sold most of the petrol, which could have an arbitrary effect. The reason the 25 per cent figure is in the amendment is that it is roughly the figure used now in relation to independents, non-branded and branded, and franchisees. It is a section of the market that we know will not create a great disturbance. It is really drawing a line and saying, ‘This is where we are at,’ so it will not create great turmoil in the market. It is just going to protect the position of the existing independents. The 25 per cent figure applies monthly. Some time period has to be given to do a review, otherwise it has no effect.
I agree with the intent of Senator Fielding’s amendment. If a few things were done to it it could be something that I could support, but in its current form I cannot do so. It is the detail I cannot support, not the intent.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-12,"—The 25 per cent concept is something that we have obviously heard about from a lot of quarters, but the government does not support it. As Senator O’Brien notes, the government sees this amendment providing all sorts of problems in relation to its practical application, and I think that has been indicated in the comments of others this afternoon. The concern is that it would in fact lead to increased price pressures—I am certainly aware of Senator Fielding’s concerns about the price of fuel and his entreaties in relation to that and certain elements of the price of fuel—so the government has concerns in relation to that and also in relation to potential investment in the sector. I think this could have a negative impact. More importantly, I think some of the pressures that could be imposed, certainly from some of the issues that Senator O’Brien raised, could see a negative impact on availability in regional areas.
In respect of the comments that have been made regarding the review, I note that the government has reaffirmed its commitment to a review of the Oilcode 12 months after its implementation. Senator O’Brien mentioned five years, but the government have also indicated that we would review within that time frame as appropriate, not necessarily in the standard time frame of five years.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-12,"—I have some concluding remarks on these amendments. We are moving to a situation where we have two players that are going to dominate petrol retailing in Australia. I do not know anyone who thinks that is a great idea. In removing regulations that made sense in their day but do not make sense today, we should be replacing them with regulations that do all we can to make sure we have more competition, not less. I understand that the intention of these amendments is right and honourable—and maybe some of the content is not—but how do you get a government to sit down and genuinely look at the interests of Australia and have a fair dinkum debate and tussle about whether 25 per cent is right or whether 20 per cent is right or whether it should be based on volume or on sites? But to stand by and do nothing and allow the independents to be squeezed out of the market—and that is what we are talking about here—rather than trying to allow real competition to happen, is ludicrous. We are in danger of going down the path we went down with groceries in Australia—having two players dominating the whole grocery market and also dominating petrol retailing when we have an opportunity to stop it. It is absolutely crazy.

I note that amendment includes references to 51(1)(f), which refers to an earlier amendment—item 2—which was knocked off by the Senate in committee, so I would assume that this amendment therefore cannot be put in this form.
—As I understand it, Senator Murray, your Democrat amendment—
—No, it is not a Democrat amendment. I refer you to sheet 4928 revised. If you have a look at item 2 of Senator Fielding’s amendments which have been dealt with and voted against, you will find that it refers to ‘at the end of subsection 51(1)’ at (f), (g), (h) and (i). Subsection 51(1)(f) does not exist, as I understand it, in the bill; it exists in Senator Fielding’s amendment, item 2. If that item 2 has been rejected by the Senate in committee, surely you cannot move an amendment which includes a reference to an amendment which has been rejected.

So that is the subparagraph (f) to be added on. It is on sheet 4928 revised. As Senator Murray has indicated, amendment (4) moved by Senator Fielding does actually refer to that clause. Seeing that clause does not exist, it would be very hard to pass an amendment that refers to it.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-12,"—On a point of clarification, what has been pointed out is actually technically correct and it would not stand on its own. The point was about prohibiting refusing to supply independent retailers. Because the previous amendments have not got up, this would not be able to stand in its current form. You are right, Mr Temporary Chairman.
—So do you wish to withdraw or amend?
—If I had time, I would like to amend. As I do not have the time and as the previous amendments have not gone through, then I will need to withdraw it.

—Yes, Mr Temporary Chairman; I seek leave to do that.
Leave granted.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—I move amendment (1) on sheet 5045:
(1)    Schedule 2, page 4 (after line 13), at the end of the Schedule, add:
Trade Practices Act 1974
Oilcode
One thing that we have seen in the chamber today is that everybody seems to have a great desire to protect small business. They believe in it. Now it is a matter of putting that desire into effect. We have gone through a number of amendments that have been trying to control from the top down—that is, putting controls on sites and suchlike. But this amendment says that we should look at what is actually there at the moment as being part of the independents, the family businesses—the businesses that we intend to support. Our rhetoric is that we believe in and support the right to be in business. According to the Motor Trades Association, who I have been in consultation with, those types of businesses represent about 25 per cent of the volume at the moment. What this amendment is doing is quarantining the section of the market that is currently being used for that section that we want to protect.
BP, Caltex and Shell put their hands on their hearts and say: ‘We have got no intention to ever remove those families from those businesses. We have got no intention to go into their area.’ If that is the case then this will not worry them, because it is no more than stating their status quo. The other 75 per cent can do what they like. They can have all the rearrangements they like. This amendment says to the Australian people that we believe there is a section of this market which must be left behind—if we say that we are a government that believes in small business. It does not cross paths with the ACCC; it purely and simply talks to a section of the market that we want to quarantine.
People have asked, ‘Why a month?’ They have said, ‘It is going to be outrageous—every month!’ Not really. You have to find some sort of time frame in which to deal with these issues. You could say a year. But you do not have to worry about anything monumental at the moment, because currently we are abiding by that. There are no problems whereby they have to go to the market now and change it. It does not make any prescriptive comment about who is what, who is going to have a competitive advantage, which of the oil majors is going to leave and which is going to follow. It does not talk about them at all. They have 75 per cent of the volume of the market to deal with.
I am going to read my tea leaves here: I do not think the Labor Party are going to support this. I think they are going to come up with another reason not to support it. I think they are right on board with the bill. But it is going to be fascinating to hear what they have to say—’Why this time?’—about why they are not going to when they have got a chance of actually doing something. I wonder if they have been got at. I wonder if someone has had a little knock on their door. Today the Labor Party have actually got a chance to achieve something. They have always talked about the outrageous power in the Senate, saying that it is this and it is that and it is something else. For once in their life they have got the chance to do something about it and they are going to fold. We can see that coming today. Today is their chance, today is their Waterloo. It just goes to show that the knock on the door has happened: ‘Hey fellas, you are going to fall into line.’ We know that all the other times it is just Labor Party theatrics before a Labor Party fold.
It is going to be fascinating for the people in the gallery today to see what Labor are really like. Never again listen to Labor’s rhetoric about the extremism in the Senate, about the Senate being out of control, because they are part of the problem. They will fall into line today. It is going to be marvellous to watch. The big boys have knocked on your door and you are going to do what they tell you to do, because that is your job. Around about question time, you will go back to your old rhetoric, expecting people to believe you, and they will not. After this, they will fail to believe you on virtually anything. What you will show is that you are an absolutist power in the Senate, that you believe in the rights of big business to reign supreme, that you do not believe in small business and that, when you get the chance to make your mark, you fold.
It will be interesting today to see who are the so-called backdown people. Who will be the doormats today? I hope that we get the voices on this one, because I want to see them drawn out. I want to see what it looks like to see some doormats cross over to protect their mates in the big oil companies. That is what you will be doing, because they have got your number.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-09-12,"—I rise to support the amendment proposed by Senator Joyce. I was not in support of Senator Fielding’s amendments, for all of the reasons that were cited, but I am certainly in sympathy with the principle that we have to keep the small business operators, the franchisees, in business. It is absolutely fundamental, especially coming from rural and regional Australia, as I do. All of Tasmania could be classified as rural and regional.
—Hobart is very sophisticated.
—I agree that Hobart is very sophisticated, but some people still regard it as regional. Having said that, and as I said in my second reading speech, I think it is absolutely essential that we support small business in Australia. The tragedy is that small business operators continue to support the coalition in spite of the fact that, day after day and week after week, the coalition tramples small business. We have seen an example of that in the last week or so with the reneging on the promise of a mandatory code. Fruit and vegetable growers in particular are outraged. They were promised things about labelling that went nowhere and then they were promised mandatory criteria. People as high as the Deputy Prime Minister, eight days before the last federal election, absolutely promised growers in Australia that they would get this mandatory code that would govern their relationship with the wholesalers and retailers—that they would get a decent go. Instead of that, after two years nothing has been done.
The coalition absolutely reneged and now it has been flick passed to Minister Macfarlane, who is saying that it is a voluntary code. It totally flies in the face of what the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, said. Rural and regional Australia have a right to ask whether they can take the word of the Deputy Prime Minister on its merits. The former Deputy Prime Minister has been hung out to dry in front of the whole of rural and regional Australia. As the current Leader of The Nationals in the Senate was saying, the National Party has been dudded in front of the whole of rural and regional Australia. The fruit and vegetable growers across this country have been let down by the coalition in terms of the promise of a mandatory code, and now we have rural and regional Australia being let down again in relation to supporting small business.
We have never rejected the notion that we should be able to quarantine certain volumes to certain sections of the market, and I think that this is certainly one way in which we can support the small business operators in Australia and support rural and regional Australia. That is why I am supporting this amendment. I think it is significant. You only have to read the submissions from small business operators to see their awareness of what is going to happen to them as a result of this legislation. We have already seen the market dominance of the four major oil companies in Australia. We have seen what happened with the introduction of the supermarket schemes and we can see the writing on the wall. I think this is, as Senate Joyce has just said, a red-letter day for small business in Australia. In fact, it has been a red-letter week for small business because of the backdown that I referred to a moment ago. For all the words that have been spoken on this bill, it is essential that people actually stand up at this point and vote to support those small business operators throughout Australia, because they are not going to be there forever.
The people who are going to suffer the most are the people who have the least amount of power when it comes to lobbying the government. For all the government’s promises about standing up for the battler, standing up for the little guy, it is about big business, writ large. It has been big business writ large for the coal industry in holding up any movement on climate change. It is big business in terms of the government ignoring moves to ban the television advertising of junk food in children’s television hours. They are out there totally supporting big business in blocking the moves to do that. Now we have yet another example of it.
I am pleased that Senator Joyce has brought forward this amendment. I urge the Senate to support it as a very strong signal to small business and to rural and regional Australia that we believe these services are essential, that we support families in small businesses in rural communities and that we support allowing those communities to continue to be sustainable. There will come a day when the four big oil companies will withdraw from the so-called uneconomic sites. What is going to happen to those communities when that withdrawal occurs? When it occurs, the people to blame will be those who are sitting right here in this chamber. It should be taken up to them at the next election.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—It is very important, for a range of reasons, that we keep independents in the market. Obviously, regional areas are absolutely crucial in that. You can go to any small town and find independents there. That is one of the issues I had with the legislation that talked about sites. They are usually smaller volumetric sites—small sites in what they produce—but they are vitally important to the lifeblood of the town. One of the great fears that we have with this legislation is that we may end up with oil companies deciding not to supply them because it is uneconomic. What we are going to have is complete social dislocation.
Just imagine a small town like Surat, in Queensland, which is 75 kilometres from Roma to the north and 120 kilometres from St George in the south. You can forget about the closest towns to the east or the west; they are about 200 kilometres in each direction. There is one fuel station. What are you saying about the lifestyle of the people in that town when you close the fuel station down and their cars have to have the fuel capacity, and enough fuel, to go 75 kilometres to Roma and 75 kilometres back? They have to take a 150-kilometre round trip to possibly cover the five kilometres around town to do the shopping and such things. It is a vital part of life. I suppose you could tell them to walk. You could say, ‘People in these towns do not deserve the right to own a vehicle.’
—You could go back to the horse and buggy!
—That is right. So you only deserve the right to own a vehicle if you can afford to fill it with enough petrol to take you 150 kilometres out of your way to fuel up the car! That is one of the things that is wrong in this legislation that we have to deal with. We have to put in some protection mechanism for these people.
It is the height of absurdity to expect that BP will develop the conscience that we are supposed to be developing in this chamber. We are going to leave it to some corporate entity to develop that conscience: ‘Oh, you know, Caltex will look after you. BP will look after you. Shell will look after you. Coles and Woolworths will look after the people of Surat.’ I do not think so. I do not think that is going to happen, unless we have a section of the market that they have to supply—independents—and that is because we know that they have volume at the refinery that they have to move. They have to find the sites and, if some of those sites are independents, they have to go out and supply those sites—it is our best intention of trying to look after those people. People might say, ‘It’s naive. It’s got this wrong; it’s got that wrong,’ but where is your solution? Where is the solution in the current piece of legislation that looks after those people? Where is it? Take me to it and you will have won me. But you have not got it there.
It is a statement about fairness and what is primarily unfair. I do not think anybody in this nation should be just dropped off. We are talking about people—generally, pensioners—who do not have a lot of money, who probably have a vehicle that is not one of the latest models and is not very economical with fuel. It may be a bit old-fashioned, but I think we should look after them. I think we should give them something that says, ‘I believe you have a right to fuel up your car in your town.’ I am going way out on a limb on that one, but we will give it a shot and see how it goes; we will put up the flag and see who salutes on this one.
That will be interesting. We will come up with a few platitudes, and the Labor Party will have a good reason why they cannot. There will be some reason: it will be a bit too complicated, there will be something technically not right, the wind is not blowing in the right direction, the sparrows are not facing south today. There will be something—something fascinating—as to why they do not want to look after pensioners in small towns or other people except the oil majors who knocked on their door. They will be looking after them today; they will not be looking after their own.
This is one of the issues where we really have to give ourselves a bit of a wake-up call about what we are trying to do here. The only people we know who will supply people in those small towns are independents. Why? Because you just do not make a lot of money out there. Where the major oil companies want to be is on strangulated sites on major arterial roads. That is where they want to do business. They do not want to do business on the edges of suburbs, from corner stores and from independents. And, if they do—if they are telling us the truth—they will not be worried about this amendment because it will not affect their game plan. They will be saying, ‘We always intended to keep independents in the game, so we have no problems with the amendment because it’s what we’re doing already.’
But, if they do have a problem with that, it spells out clear as a bell that they are getting out of it—they are getting out of there, they are going to go back and we are going to have some beautiful new petrol stations around strangulated sites on the Gold Coast, putting out of business independents that are already there and putting out of business families that are already making a buck there. We are going to have some big sites up on the M1 and around the edges of Sydney, probably putting people out of business there, and big sites down the Gold Coast putting families out of business there. But, if they are not going to do that, they will have no problems with this amendment—none whatsoever.
There is a whole range of things that go away from the purely dry economics of this resolution. It talks about looking after people. It talks about the protection of that manifest belief that you have the right to go into business in Australia, to be master of your own ship, to determine your own destiny, to think your own thoughts and not be scared of what you have to say. One of the things that attracts me to this place is that you should be able to protect that in all the ways, shapes and forms in which it comes.
I have had some questions about my amendment (2) to add (f) to section 95A. We have to be able to review petroleum products and we have to have the capacity in that act to add in petroleum products as one of the mechanisms of review, because we are talking about a monthly period. If somebody says, ‘I don’t like a monthly period,’ I will meet you halfway. If you have a different period—two weeks, two months or three months —I will go there. We do not need to stumble around it, but you have to have the mechanism with the power of review, and that is where 95A(f) comes in.
It is vitally important that we get a fairer outcome. This amendment is all about fairness. Fairness is a simple word. What is this amendment about? It is about fairness. It is about fairness to people who are in business. It is about fairness to the aspirations of the Australian people and their ability in the future to go into business. It is about fairness to people in regional towns and their ability to source fuel. It is about fairness in giving people the right to jump in their car and be a part of a community. If you do not have a car, you do not have a community.
We cannot be sending people in regional towns back to 1911. It is not fair. We cannot be saying: ‘Mrs Smith, we know you’re 87 and you’ve got an old Commodore in the garage and it’s probably not the most economical car but, from now on, we expect you to ride a bike.’ I do not think that is fair. When you need to see a doctor in another town, you will have to drive to that town first, before you can see the doctor, because the only fuel station will be the big corporate site back in a major town. So you will somehow have to get yourself to the town to buy the fuel to get to the town. I do not think that is a fair outcome, but it is going to be fascinating to hear the arguments as to why it is fair. We will hear today some arguments about why it is fair. It will be interesting. The arguments about why this is fair will be something that we can put on with Monty Python tonight.
It is going to be an absolute expose of the power of major oil companies. People will be looking after themselves because it will be a case of, ‘If you guys get into government, you have got to be on the right side of us.’ The Labor Party will be saying: ‘We’re going to do that today. Don’t you worry, you can count us in. Don’t you worry about that. We’ll look after you today, Mobil, Caltex, BP, Shell, Coles and Woolworths. The Labor Party are going to look after you today, because all that other stuff we talk about is just rhetoric. We just spin that out—it’s a yarn. We’re programmed to say that sort of stuff; we don’t mean it. You don’t honestly think for one second that we believe in that? You don’t think we believe in looking after people in regional towns! You don’t think we believe in fairness! It is just theatrics. We’re with you, Caltex, Woolworths, Shell and Coles. We’re with you all the way.’ Maybe that is fair enough. There are a lot of people in the shop stewards union—maybe it will help union membership. I do not know. But it will be interesting. It is going to be a fascinating expose of the power of the major oil companies.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I found that a remarkable contribution. We are on broadcast, so I suppose Senator Joyce has to take his opportunities where they fall. It is a bit rich for Senator Joyce to ascribe motions to the opposition on how it votes on this legislation. I have just one word to say: Telstra.
—I can tell you about the amendments you have there, if you want to run through them.
—If Senator Joyce wants to debate how he changed his mind from the commitment he gave before the election to vote against the sale of Telstra to the metamorphosis that brought him to the point of voting for the government’s legislation, I am happy to debate him at the appropriate time. I just say that it is a bit rich to ascribe to the opposition all sorts of motives, without hearing what we had to say on this legislation. I found that a remarkable contribution.
Some interesting questions ought to be asked about this amendment. What does the term ‘prescribed independent fuel retailer’ mean? How will it be interpreted by the courts? Can Senator Joyce assure us that it will be interpreted in the way that he intends? Is there a definition in the legislation which the courts would rely upon? Senator Joyce sets out sites in subclauses 4 and 5 of his amendment. I am not certain, but I take it that they are operated by Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd—Caltex—BP Australia Holdings Ltd, Mobil Oil Australia Ltd, Shell Australia Ltd, Coles Myer Ltd and Woolworths Ltd. If they have been supplied their 75 per cent of the market, say, 20 days into the month and the independents have not taken up all of their 25 per cent, I have interpreted this to mean that there would be a breach of the law if the oil companies kept those sites supplied. If those sites that had been supplied ran out of petrol, they would simply have to shut down while the suppliers waited for the independents to take up the balance of that supply—that is, the 25 per cent. So, for the next 10 days in the cycle, if they did not take it up, those sites would shut down. Is that what Senator Joyce is saying? Or would they be fined, would they have to pay a penalty to be able to continue to operate their businesses? What would happen—and perhaps this is the intent of the proposed amendment—if those independents said, ‘We’re not buying the fuel unless we can get it for 50c a litre less, so your sites will have to shut down unless you sell us the fuel for a massive amount less than the market rate’?
It is all very well for Senator Joyce to come in here with good intentions but, when he does not do his homework and he does not put up a proposition which is supportable, it really is not appropriate for him to cast aspersions on other parties in this chamber which try to get a workable piece of legislation through. I am happy to have a debate. Senator Joyce wants to ascribe motives to everyone. Let me suggest that many people could ascribe the motive that this is just grandstanding. It is something that Senator Joyce knew would never get up, it is something that Senator Joyce knew he could have a rant about while we are on broadcast and it is something about which Senator Joyce could say: ‘I’ve defended the faith; I’ve defended the independent wholesalers.’ Frankly, that is just a hoax.
Here we have a provision which, if implemented, would be totally unworkable. I understand that, in Goulburn, not far from here, there are 12 service stations. There are a variety of service stations. What would happen if three-quarters of those had sold all the petrol that their supplier would give them under this measure because they decided they could do better with margins in other places? Let us say that nine of the 12 service stations had to close while three remained open. This is really sounding like the old soviet state command economy. We are talking about saying to businesses: ‘Lay off your staff, close your doors, lock up the pumps. Those three businesses remain in town. They can keep trading for the rest of that month, until the others start at the beginning of the next month.’
There will have to be some massive policing of this, so we can understand just when the 25 per cent limitation kicks in. When in the month do you stop supplying the stations that are run by these companies? Which parts of the community will run out of fuel because they are only supplied by these companies and not by the independents? Which of these places where you have to drive 75 kilometres each way to get fuel will be on the receiving end? The petrol stations in their town are all closed and they have to drive 100 kilometres up the track to an independent who will sell them fuel at $2 a litre, because that is all that they can get. These are the sorts of unintended consequences—I am certain that Senator Joyce did not intend this—that ill-considered drafting can lead to. Frankly, if Senator Joyce wants to cast aspersions and suggest that people are motivated by improper motives, he had better have a good, hard look at the proposition that he puts before this chamber and asks people to vote for and then castigates them for not voting for it.
We are happy to consider reasonable amendments and, indeed, we support reasonable amendments. Senator Joyce voted for Senator Murray’s amendments yesterday and then had himself paired, so that he did not have to vote for an almost identical amendment last night, and walked out of the chamber. Frankly, I was prepared to let that go through to the keeper. But, after that performance, I do not think it is fair of Senator Joyce to expect us to ignore the way that he behaves on legislation if he is going to ascribe the sorts of motives he ascribed to the Labor Party in relation to this matter.
Our bona fides are clear. We have been proposing improvements to the regulatory regime through amendments to the Trade Practices Act. We have supported—as has Senator Joyce—certain other propositions going through in terms of the competitive model through the Trade Practices Act, and we continue to support that and we are expecting the government to give effect to the legislation that has been passed through this chamber which will have some effect in this regard. We think there are further improvements to be made. But we will not be supporting a proposition which is totally unworkable.
It does not matter that the legislation might be passed through here with the best of intentions. If it is not workable, if it leads to catastrophe in the market and to chaos in the marketplace, if it leads to the closure of businesses and to towns shutting down, and to the sorts of consequences that Senator Joyce referred to—the inability of some markets to be supplied—how can we vote for it? That is the reason we will be opposing this amendment: it is not workable.
It is well-intentioned but, frankly, Senator Joyce needs to put up a better-thought-out proposition—one which has behind it enough detail to give it a chance of success. I suspect the difficulty that Senator Joyce faces is that that is a very difficult thing to do—even for an opposition party, let alone a member of the government who is taking his own path on a particular piece of legislation.
I respect the fact that Senator Joyce is well-intentioned, but I think he ought to think very carefully about how he addresses the intentions of others in this place when it comes to amendments such as this. There is no way that this could be given effect without major rethinks and major bureaucratic intervention at every step of the way and, subsequently, major change after it had been trialled. By all means, Senator Joyce should pursue his intention of making sure that independents have a place in the market. This is not the way to do it.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-12,"—I do not want to prolong the debate, because I hope we get to a division before question time, but I want to make three points. The first point is that I would caution anyone against ascribing motives in this place. I am aware that, within the Labor Party and their caucus, there have intense debates and different opinions about many matters, and my information is that they have had some contested views on this bill. But I do not ascribe to them a weak belief with respect to Trade Practices Act amendments; they are on the record in quite a formidable manner in that regard.
The second point I would make is on the amendment itself. Whilst I recognise that the criticisms of the shadow minister have some validity, the great saving point of the amendment is that it actually leaves the detail of management to the Oilcode; the detail can be developed and the practical measures can be introduced through the Oilcode.
My third and last point is that I see this as a holding proposal until such time as the Labor Party are in power and can introduce divestiture provisions—because, of course, once you have divestiture provisions you have proper market management and you then do not have to hold to particular percentages in the market as a whole. So, recognising the validity of some of the criticisms, overall the Democrats think that both the intent and the design are sufficient for us to support this proposal.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—It is interesting. We have just heard a good expose by Senator Murray, basically setting out exactly what this is—a holding pattern—so that we do not crucify those who are currently in the market. Why it is 25 per cent, and why it is not going to bring about the so-called moment of doom that has been talked about by the opposition, is that, if that were the case, it would be doing it now, because that is the portion of the market that is currently being described by the Motor Traders Association as ‘independents’. You asked for a description of what an independent is. It is right there in front of you. It is there in the legislation. The independents are all the fuel stations except the four major oil companies and Coles and Woolworths. It cannot be any clearer than that.
If this proposal were about to bring about this complete dislocation then we would already be suffering that complete dislocation because the sites and franchise acts have been in place since 1980; and, while we all agree that they need to be amended and fixed, we are not seeing that doom at the moment. So I do not know why this amendment is going to bring it about. It was a great exercise in spin, and it was great to see that, when their number is called, the Labor Party have the ability to fall into line. I do not think that Government Whip Jeannie Ferris could have done a better job on the Labor Party members than the job they have just done on themselves. It was brilliant. They have fallen into line. They know what they have got to do. They have to support the oil majors. They have got to make sure that those horrid independents and family businesses go broke. They have got to make sure they screw them down, because their number has been called today and they have all answered.
And it is all right. There are no protections in there for independents—none. The Labor Party obviously believe that the market should reign supreme and that there should be no controls—basically, that the biggest shall survive and the small shall die. That is an interesting position. But, anyway, we will continue this debate later on. We are going to make sure that this is carried out.

In fact there have been seven interest rate rises in a row, and three of these have occurred since John Howard promised to keep interest rates at record lows. Following the Prime Minister’s lead, today we saw Senator Minchin attempting to pass the buck on the issue—trying to blame everybody else but the government itself. Unfortunately for him, he is also on the record—and Senator Minchin is still with us here, perhaps he could advise us as to why this is the case—in February this year as saying that interest rates are the most important factor in relation to housing. Now, of course, we have a situation where the government is seeking to blame the states and blame anyone else for the increasing deterioration in housing affordability.
One minute we are told that interest rates are the most important factor and then when they go up, causing pain for many hundreds of thousands of hardworking families, suddenly someone else is held responsible. Senator Minchin’s somewhat condescending response has demonstrated that this government has simply run out of ideas when it comes to the question of housing repayments and meeting the cost of keeping a roof over your head. They simply do not care about the fate of hundreds of thousands of Australian families in the face of skyrocketing default rates. All they offer is condescending financial advice. Senator Minchin, in a somewhat desperate manner, resorted to arguing that the first home owners grant scheme was introduced to help first home owners into ownership. Of course this response directly conflicts with what Senator Minchin has said in the past. I have referred already to the fact that, back in February, he said that the first home owners grant was:
... introduced at the time of the new tax system’s introduction was very much and overtly in recognition of the consequences for home purchasers of the introduction of the goods and services tax.
We heard Senator Minchin go on to say that the grant:
... was and is a grant which acknowledges the one-off impact of the goods and services tax on the purchase of a home.
Then we were told that this was a grant to compensate for the GST; now we are told it is a device by which the government seeks to address the question of housing affordability.
We know that the pain being felt by Australian families is real and is not just a fantasy which the government seeks to dismiss in its rather cavalier manner. The Supreme Court of Victoria’s figures on mortgage repossessions show there has been a massive 58 per cent increase in the number of writs issued between 2004-05 and 2005-06. There was an increase in mortgage repossession writs from 1,948 to 3,084. In South Australia the Supreme Court figures indicate that the number of repossession summonses lodged increased by more than a third over the same period: from 371 to 476. In New South Wales, Supreme Court mortgage repossession statistics show an incredible 59 per cent increase in judgments between 2004-05, which is the fastest increase in 16 years—a jump from 3,061 in 2004 to 4,873 in 2005.
What we are seeing, of course, is the dark side of the housing boom—a boom described by the Prime Minister on 17 March 2004 as being ‘fantastic for the economy’. At that time, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were happy to take the credit for higher house prices when they thought they were good news. Of course, now that we see clearly that the housing boom is far from being fantastic for the economy, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been trying to shift the blame for this pain to state governments.
In yesterday’s motion in the House of Representatives, they went one step further and tried to shift the blame to local governments. One minute they are shifting costs; the next moment they are shifting blame. It goes to show how hollow the resolution on local government that they passed just last week was. Labor does agree with Peter Costello on something; at least, we agree with something he said in 2003, where he— (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2006-09-12,"—I have never, ever accused Senator Carr of being ineloquent but today he has simply demonstrated the pervicacious nature of the Labor Party and their entire policy-free zone. He has demonstrated to me exactly why the Australian people have rejected the Australian Labor Party at four successive elections. We are talking about home ownership today, and specifically about affordability of home ownership and the burden upon regular Australian families. The dream of home ownership remains a uniquely Australian dream. It is a dream that, in this great country, allows all Australians the opportunity to own their own home. And it begins, let me tell you, with having a job.
This government has lowered unemployment to such a level that every Australian in this country who wants a job can actually get a job. We can only contrast this with what happened under the Labor Party. In 1992 the unemployment rate across this nation was 10.9 per cent, and it in fact averaged 8.5 per cent under the Labor administration. How do you buy a home or afford to pay for a home when you do not have a job? The answer is: you cannot. How can you afford to buy a home, if you have a job, at 17 per cent interest rates? The answer is: most people cannot. You want to talk about home loan affordability and how many people defaulted on their payments; you need to go back to the high point in this country—the high point of defaults. In fact, it should not be the high point: it is actually the low point in economic mismanagement in this country, and it occurred under a Labor government.
We need to remind people that this government—and I remind Senator Carr—has reduced the tax burden on the regular taxpayer so that 80 per cent of the taxpaying public pay 30c or less in the dollar. This is a very important point because, under the Labor Party and under their administration, the top tax rate kicked in at around $50,000. Today it does not: today the average taxpayer pays around 30c in the dollar. This government has assisted first homebuyers by providing over 828,000 first homebuyer grants. This enabled a lot of people to put their foot on the housing market ladder—the ladder of opportunity—which, under this government, has every rung intact. It is not missing a few rungs along the way so it is only an opportunity for some, because it is an opportunity for every single person.
We have reformed taxation rates not only by reducing the marginal tax rates but by reforming our entire taxation system. By doing that, there were some agreements reached with the state governments that they had to fulfil in order to receive the rivers of gold in the GST. What has happened? We are talking about housing affordability. The estimated costs—the exact figure—escape me. I must be suffering from lethologica, I think, because the word was on the tip of my tongue. However, we have to decide here that the states have abrogated their responsibility. They have not cut stamp duty, which adds an unfair impost and an unfair burden to the new homebuyer. In fact, it adds to the cost of housing for any person upgrading, or even downgrading, their home ownership dream.
What else have the state Labor governments not done? Perhaps it is what they have done. They have fully loaded the costs of development of land onto private individuals and private developers. This is one of the tragedies that our developers are facing at the moment. Land banks are being released on an ever-diminishing basis by the state Labor governments. When they are released, the developers are expected to fully fund the infrastructure costs that go into them and pass those costs on to local homeowners and to new homebuyers. The cost of building a home has actually risen only marginally over the last 10 or 15 years in real terms—what we have are massive costs of land. This is the responsibility of the state Labor governments, I have to tell you, because the land is being released by them and they are failing in and abrogating their responsibility to support affordable home ownership for Australian people. Let us talk also about the level of investment, the level of asset growth and also the level of debt in the Australian nation. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I also rise to take note of the same answer. As reported in today’s Sydney Morning Herald, household debt has climbed to a record 171 per cent of household income, and regular financial obligations, such as mortgage repayments, are now soaking up more than one-fifth of all disposable income. In my home state, Tasmanians pay over 30 per cent of their income in servicing their mortgage. We have seen interest rates rise seven times since 8 May 2002, and many hardworking families right across Australia are feeling the impact as they deal with the pressures of financing a mortgage or their dream of buying their first home.
We are also seeing homeowners losing their homes at a record rate, forced out by massive mortgage payments, rising petrol prices and high personal debt. And, true to form, the Prime Minister has looked around to find someone to blame for this national crisis of housing affordability. This is what we have here: a national crisis in housing affordability. Unfortunately, Senator Bernardi seems to have fallen for the Prime Minister’s line. The Prime Minister has looked around to find someone in his blame game and he finds the states—‘I’ll blame the states for my neglect, I’ll blame the states for my lack of leadership and I’ll blame the states for my broken promise on interest rates.’ We have now seen three rises since that promise was made, taking the tally to seven in a row.
The Prime Minister blames the states for failing to release enough land for new constructions. But housing expert Alan Moran—the Prime Minister’s own expert—has confirmed that the PM’s only solution, massive land releases, would slash home values by $100,000. This would leave struggling families in financial crisis, owing more than their house is worth. We see figures confirming our worst fears: that the chance of young families owning a home—the great Australian dream—is diminishing; they are being locked out of homeownership.
According to figures, the proportion of first home buyers in the market has hit a 12-month low, with just 16.7 per cent of all loans being for first homes. Families are struggling with rising petrol prices, rising prices at the checkout, rising education and health costs. Families are simply unable to afford the loan repayments that are now required.
Families have seen the Prime Minister’s promise on interest rates go up in tatters, it having already, as I have said, gone up three times. They know they cannot trust the Prime Minister on interest rates. The government’s answer to those families paying off crippling mortgages, which are now taking up a massive proportion of the family household budget, is to blame the states and put forward a now discredited policy on land release—a policy encouraging a massive land release campaign that will erode property values. That is leadership! I support Senator Carr’s statement:
As a result of the Howard Government’s neglect of the housing affordability crisis, the proportion of first home buyers has been below the long-run average of 20.2% for over four years.
These figures show that higher interest rates are hurting everyone—those who have taken on a mortgage because they just couldn’t wait any longer, and those who want to buy their own home but can’t afford it.
The states and territories do have a responsibility and they have each taken action. By contrast, the Howard government has reduced funding for housing programs and abandoned Australian cities, including abolishing Labor’s Better Cities program, which had a return of four to one in terms of government dollars spent. States and territories have unanimously supported the development of the framework for National Action on Affordable Housing and are working together to implement it. The government had to be dragged to the table to sign up to the framework and it has not committed to taking any concrete action.
The Prime Minister needs to show leadership on this issue, an issue critical to all Australians, by taking responsibility for the crisis. Appoint a minister for housing and start working cooperatively with the states and territories to fix the problem, instead of playing the blame game for your failures and attempting to dump all the responsibility on the states. Australians will not be fooled. The government cannot take the credit for house prices increasing but dump homeowners now that housing affordability has reached a crisis.
Unfortunately, we have already seen evidence of homeowners unable to keep up repayments and being forced to sell their home for less than it is now worth. This leaves families with a large debt and no home. The Labor Party will have a minister for housing who can focus on the housing market and ensure that homeownership stays within the reach of hardworking families.
The Labor party knows that to address the problem of housing affordability we have to work together. These measures are vital if we are to address the growing problem of housing affordability and if we are to ensure that the dream of owning your own home is not simply a fairytale that is beyond the reach of everyday, hardworking Australians.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2006-09-12,"—I also rise on the matter that was raised in question time today and the answers given by Senator Minchin. Senator Carol Brown has highlighted the fact that Labor will introduce a minister for housing. I think before they do anything on that basis they should have a minister that will look after economic management, because that is how the housing situation in this country has become very strong. That is how our economy functions—we concentrate on economics, and that is the broad picture.
Turning to some of the minor detail, Senator Brown mentions interest rates. Interest rates fluctuate within bandwidths, and the interest rates under this government have fluctuated within an extremely low bandwidth. Under the Labor government, prior to this government taking office, interest rates fluctuated on a high bandwidth. I know because in 1990 I had a mortgage and mortgage rates went to just under 20 per cent. I still have a mortgage today, but mortgage rates are nowhere near that level. My mortgage rate is at a very affordable and manageable level. Also, from my family’s perspective, I have a son who recently married. They are saving for their first home. They have purchased a block of land. They have borrowed money to do so because interest rates are affordable to do that. That is a very important and significant factor: whilst interest rates move within bandwidths, they are relatively low. They have been a lot lower under this government than they have been in the past.
Senator Brown also blames the Prime Minister for blaming others. That is incorrect. The Prime Minister is not blaming the states; he is pointing out facts and stating the obvious. I quote the Reserve Bank Governor, who on 18 August this year said:
I think it is pretty apparent now that reluctance to release new land plus the new approach whereby the purchaser has to pay for all the services up front—the sewerage, the roads, the footpaths and all that sort of stuff—has enormously increased the price of the new, entry-level home. That is a supply-side issue, not a demand-side issue. I think there is a lot of evidence that, at the moment, those factors are becoming very important.
So it is not only the Prime Minister and this government but also people outside of this government who understand these issues who are saying that the state governments are a serious part of this issue. And the state governments are ensuring that housing affordability at the new entry level is too hard. It is just too difficult, because of those state costs.
That is not to mention stamp duty. We can look at stamp duty for forever and a day. State governments need to reduce stamp duty. If Labor were serious about low entry level into the housing market, the Labor Party would certainly be encouraging their counterparts at each state level to reduce and remove stamp duty. It is very important.
I will recap. Economic management: we have that, and the Labor Party need to pick up on economic management. Interest rates: we have low interest rates; within a bandwidth that fluctuates, they are still very low compared with the high, fluctuating bandwidths that the Labor Party had. It is not federal government issues that control the state government issues—and even, to a degree, local council issues—that affect the price of entry into new housing. These factors are all very important. I think the public of Australia understand that what we do, as good economic managers, is to ensure that housing affordability stays at the best possible price.
Then we come to first home buyers grants and subsidies. This government has been extremely proactive in introducing and maintaining these schemes. They enable people to have some offset when they first take up a mortgage. That is very important.
Housing affordability is a very important thing in this country. This government has a very serious approach to housing affordability. We can only ask that the state Labor governments follow the lead of the national government and reduce their charges to make it easier for those first-time entrants when they wish to move into their first home or, indeed, buy a block of land.
So I refute the allegations, made by Senator Carol Brown in the chamber a short while ago, that our interest rates are high; they are relatively low. And it is not only this government indicating that we have state governments to blame; outside experts are indicating the same. And I think we could find a long list of people who would also support that. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-09-12,"—What Senator Parry might also find is that this government has ignored five years’ worth of warnings from esteemed organisations like the Reserve Bank about housing affordability and the need to invest in skills and infrastructure to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is just a fact of life.
We can play the blame game as much as we want but, when there is a fundamental problem, we need some national leadership and a national government that will take action. If the government’s economic management was so rosy and if housing affordability was such a simple issue, why is it that, in 1996, when this government first came to power, people were spending on average 28.7 per cent of their incomes on mortgage loan repayments and yet, in early August this year, only a month ago, average repayments were consuming 32.3 per cent of people’s incomes? It is not only that a greater percentage of household income is being absorbed by the cost of housing. When you also bear in mind that people are actually earning more money these days, on the whole, then that says there is a serious affordability crisis in our community.
It seems we are going to play the game of blaming the states. As I say, that seems to be this government’s only solution or option in discussing this. Whenever we define a problem it is always someone else’s fault. There is never any national leadership to fix this problem for all Australians; instead we are going to blame the states.
In my home state of Western Australia, when the Labor government came to power—and they took over from the Liberal Party, when last I looked—there were only 7½ thousand blocks of land per year released for new homes. Some five years later, there will be over 16½ thousand new blocks of land released for homes, just in the Perth metropolitan area. If that is not the sign of a state government accepting its responsibilities and trying to do its bit to address the need for housing affordability, I do not know what is. Where is the action from the federal government to assist in that, in what is a booming economy? Nowhere. All they can do is just keep blaming others. That is hundreds of percentage points of increase: in five years it has gone up from 7,500 blocks of land released to over 16,500, with the aim to have released 20,000 blocks of land in this financial year. That is a significant contribution to easing the supply of housing. And those opposite then carry on about state government fees and charges.
—Yes!
—And stamp duty.
—I wonder how much those opposite know about how much of the fees captured by state governments actually pay for providing the infrastructure and the planning required to actually release those blocks of land. In my home state, the fees collected—including stamp duty—only make up 39 per cent of the cost of releasing that land. So 61 per cent of the cost of releasing that average block of suburban land is borne by the state taxpayers. It is not actually recovered in fees; the fees are not the significant issue.
When we look at housing affordability, we are not saying it is just the cost of land; it is also the cost of housing. I do not know anyone who says, ‘It is only the cost of land that is the issue.’ It is actually a house and land package that is the issue. And this government is doing nothing about it.
You cannot get away from the figures. We have looked at the percentage of average weekly incomes that are now spent paying off household mortgages. The latest figures that we have from the HIA-Commonwealth Bank quarterly review of housing affordability from June 2006, show—and there is no escaping this for the federal government—that first home buyers entering the market would have to commit at least 27.9 per cent of their incomes towards mortgage repayments. That is first homebuyers. That is a significant amount of their income that they would have to commit to just attempting to live the great Australian dream of owning their own home. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-12,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
In the light of the repeated failures by our society to protect children from serious abuse and neglect, the need for all political parties to make child protection a national priority and for all governments to urgently determine ways to significantly reduce the totally unacceptable levels of serious child abuse and neglect that is occurring in all sections of the Australian community.
I thank senators for their support for this important topic and what is, I suggest today, a matter of urgency. Last Thursday the Senate passed a motion urging the federal government to prioritise encouragement of uniform laws and strategies on child protection and urging all political parties to support child protection becoming a national priority. That motion, I should emphasise, was eventually passed without dissent.
It is one thing to make statements—I am pleased that that motion was passed; it marked Child Protection Week that occurred last week—but we need to make sure that we are not just making positive-sounding statements, that we are not just prepared to be involved where it is convenient or where it suits, but that we are actually prepared to take responsibility. My concern at the national level is that whilst the federal government has taken some specific actions and provided some funding for specific programs—and I am sure we will hear a bit about some of those over the course of this debate—we need to move from taking action from time to time, to taking responsibility and national leadership on this absolutely crucial issue.
We need to recognise that this is a major crisis nationally and that it affects all parts of the community. There has been a lot of focus, appropriately, on child abuse and neglect issues in some Indigenous communities around Australia. That requires action but we also need to recognise, firstly, that there are failings on the part of individual people or families. We should not blacken the name, reputation or culture of Indigenous peoples around Australia as a result of that; in the same way that we do not blacken the entire Australian culture and every part of our society because of the widespread amount of child abuse and neglect that occurs in the entire community. We need to be consistent about this and we need to show the same level of outrage and the same level of social responsibility for child abuse and neglect that occurs across the entire community. It must be recognised how widespread this is and that it occurs across all sections of our community.
As part of Child Protection Week there were a lot of reports, I am pleased to say, in the mainstream media, noting a lot of issues that need attention. One of the things that came forward was how significantly people underestimate the level of child abuse in Australia. For example, it was reported in the Canberra Times on 6 September that many people interviewed thought there would have been only about 5,000 reports of child abuse in New South Wales last year, when the figure was well over 100,000 and growing.
In the ACT alone, there were more than 8,000 reports of child abuse in the last financial year. These are reports—they are not all established cases—but they amounted to a 400 per cent increase on three years ago. As I said, in New South Wales there were over 100,000 reports in the last financial year and, according to a separate report, that number was going up even further. In the first three months of this year we had over 5,400 reports a week in New South Wales according to the Sunday Telegraph on 27 August.
In Western Australia we have had a lot of coverage about a few specific terrible cases but we need to look at the broader picture. According to the Australian on 6 September, hundreds of cases of suspected child abuse and neglect in Western Australia are being placed in queues and not followed up for weeks. There are up to 900 cases not allocated to case workers.
In Victoria, according to the Australian of 7 September, child protection workers were criticised for failing to investigate properly warnings of sexual abuse, chronic neglect and family violence against up to 20 children who subsequently died. The Hobart Mercury of 8 September reported that newborn babies suffering drug withdrawal symptoms were among the record 1,648 cases of suspected child abuse or neglect not being investigated in Tasmania. This figure had grown from 120, less than four years ago. In my own state of Queensland the Chief Justice, Mr de Jersey—as reported in the Courier-Mail of 8 September—warned of what he called ‘the sickening level of child abuse in Queensland’, which shows no signs of abating, with more than 920 higher court convictions in the last 16 months alone.
These are not all failings of government. Some of them are—because some of the cases involve children who have been placed in so-called care on the part of government—but it is a social responsibility. There has been a failing of parents and our society in general, because this serious abuse and neglect are carried out by people in the community. It shows how our approach to date has failed and the fact that we as a society—as well as, I believe, at a national level—have not given this the priority it deserves. It affects tens of thousands of children every year throughout Australia. A harmed child, an abused child, is often harmed for life. That costs all of us as a society. I think all of us need to look at ways to make this a matter of urgency and a matter of national priority. We need to take it on board as a community and we need to recognise that we are failing. Whilst it is appropriate for parents to have the primary say in what happens with their children, we have to look at wider issues. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-09-12,"—I am very pleased to take part in a debate on an issue of extremely great national importance, one which it behoves all of us, including governments across Australia, to take extremely seriously. The abuse of children is a phenomenon which is totally unacceptable in this or in any other society. The vulnerability of children imposes a special obligation on parents, carers and governments, which is to protect and nurture children. The failure to meet that obligation exacts a terrible price in this, as in any other, community—not only in terms of the immediate impact on children from that abuse but on the whole of society, which will bear the cost of that abuse over many years following the ending of the abuse. The cascading social and personal consequences and the problems which multiply from such abuse throughout the life of the abused child are serious and come with a cost which is borne by the entirety of Australian society. As such, it is extremely important that we take this issue seriously and that we design programs and responses which address the issue as fully as possible.
I understand that my colleague Senator Murray is not taking part in this debate. In a number of key inquiries which the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has conducted into the status of children in Australian society he was fond of saying that a hurt child equates to a hurt adult. There are a great many hurt adults in our society today whose hurt is traceable to their experience as children.
Of course, it is not possible for governments to be present at all times in the homes of Australians, in schools and in other places where there are children in order to prevent child abuse. To some extent a level of child abuse will be inevitable and unavoidable. What we as governments need to do is to create the circumstances where such abuse is less likely to occur because pressures on Australian families and individuals are mitigated and reduced—pressures which may in turn lead to child abuse—and create services which are comprehensive and accessible so as to prevent the harm of child abuse multiplying and continuing for long periods.
In this respect it is worth observing that state and territory governments in Australia constitutionally have a very important role to play in dealing with instances of child abuse and providing the sorts of services I have just spoken of. I know that is an issue which state and territory governments have taken more seriously in recent years. I do not think it assists us greatly in this debate to talk in terms that might be mistaken for buck passing. No child and no family of a child in this country that is subject to child abuse wants to hear that one government wipes its hands of responsibility and blames another level of government. What is important is that we properly assess the number of such cases that occur in our community, take steps to prevent those cases from recurring and provide full and appropriate services where they do occur.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported in 2005 that the number of notifications of suspected child abuse in Australia had more than doubled in the previous six or so years—from 107,000-odd in 1999-2000 to 252,831 in 2004-05. Of those reported cases, the rate of substantiation of cases of child abuse had also risen substantially—in fact more than doubled—from 24,732 to 46,154. That is partly a reflection of the creation of better reporting avenues and the creation of opportunities for people to come forward and report child abuse than were the case previously. Perhaps we are seeing more child abuse reported. But we cannot dismiss the possibility that more child abuse is occurring in Australia today. We need to make sure that if that is the case, we take serious steps to wind back that alarming statistic.
The Commonwealth’s responsibility as to this issue is fairly clear. We need to create a strong and secure environment in which families can operate in this country; that is, we need to give families every opportunity to deal with these problems in a constructive and effective way. We need to take pressure off families so that through factors such as poverty, unemployment, mental illness and a host of other indicators we do not inadvertently create the circumstances whereby Australian families turn to abuse of their children. It is worth reflecting in this debate on the fact that a significant number of cases of child abuse occur within the framework of the family. Indeed, the statistics available through the beyondblue website suggest that 3.3 per cent of perpetrators are natural parents, 2.7 per cent are step-parents, 4.5 per cent are siblings and 18.3 per cent are other relatives of the child. So a significant number of abusers of a child are members of that child’s own family. However, it is also worth reflecting on the fact that 47 per cent of abusers are acquaintances of the child and 23.4 per cent are strangers to the child.
This obviously suggests that some measures need to be taken to deal with the causes of the perpetration of such cases of abuse. It also suggests that a significant number of cases of abuse are happening within families, so mechanisms to strengthen the framework of families do need to be considered. The government can point to a number of measures which have been taken in recent years to strengthen the capacity of families to deal with such problems and, in particular, to strengthen the environment in which families find themselves generally. I believe that the lessening of unemployment in Australia, the strengthening of the social services available to Australian families and the proliferation of programs specifically designed to provide assistance to families are measures which ought to have in the long term a positive effect on the incidence of child abuse. It is very hard to demonstrate a link between those things, but I believe those sorts of measures are entirely appropriate. I will leave it to others in this debate, particularly colleagues on this side of the chamber, to talk about some of those programs, such as the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy and Local Answers, which are very important measures that the government has taken to strengthen families in a community context.
The inquiries which the Senate Community Affairs References Committee has conducted in recent years into child migrants, children in institutional care and the stolen generation are important steps to understanding the abuse of children in our community. Those are particular slices of community experience which deserve special attention because of the incredibly serious impacts on children in those three contexts. But we do have a broader responsibility, one which revolves around the need to strengthen services and to identify cases, and those are the areas where government programs need to be continually reviewed and strengthened. I believe that we can point to the successful rolling out of programs which have had that very effect.
I for one believe that the community needs to discuss these issues more fully, to bring them out into the open, and to be prepared to consider measures that will provide support to those people in the community working in these areas who may need assistance in getting protection into the places where child abuse is occurring. I commend the programs that I have referred to, but I particularly hope that cooperation between different levels of government is both possible and the order of the day, in order to make sure that we minimise the number of such cases in the future.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Child Protection</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,12,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-09-12,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we will be supporting the urgency motion moved by Senator Bartlett. I congratulate him for bringing the issue forward today, because I think it is important that a Commonwealth parliament concentrates on these issues on occasion, and particularly for his call for child protection to be seen as a national priority and to see what the Commonwealth’s role in this is.
Can I say at the outset that freedom from violence and freedom from abuse are fundamental human rights. All children have a right to the protection, care and support that will allow them to thrive. All children are entitled to the full protection of the law, and we are all responsible for the safety and protection of children in our community. We are not just responsible for our kids; we are responsible for all kids in our community. All levels of government have a responsibility to ensure that the law is applied and children get the protection they need.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report, Child Protection: Australia: 2004-05, notes that from 1999-2000 to 2004-05 the number of child protection notifications nationally increased, from over 107,000 to more than 250,000, and the number of substantiations increased, from 25,000 to more than 46,000. It may be, as Senator Humphries has pointed out, that the reporting, rather than the incidence, is increasing. But whichever way you view them, these statistics are appalling and they do tell us we have got a major problem. A large amount of abuse and neglect does go unreported, and I think statistics of this magnitude can only highlight what we are dealing with.
In my state of Western Australia, we have had the terribly tragic death of a baby. It has been very much in the public spotlight in recent weeks. It is a terrible tale that has upset everyone—and, quite frankly, on occasions I have skipped a couple of paragraphs in the newspaper because it is so distressing. I think all Australians are shocked and saddened when they hear of cases such as this where family dysfunction and the failure of child protection result in the death of a child.
All abuse has severe consequences. In addition to its physical effects, abuse can impair personal and social development; lead to psychological damage; result in poorer health, education and employment outcomes; lead to alcohol and drug abuse; and lead to a cycle of abuse in the next generation. It is an issue that we have to give greater attention to. Dr Fiona Stanley, from the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research in Perth, has noted that rates of abuse are higher among Indigenous and other disadvantaged children than they are among children from more advantaged backgrounds. These factors present a complex, multifaceted challenge which demands complex solutions, not simple solutions, which provide full protection to children and address the causes of abuse and neglect.
Recently, following the shocking stories revealed on Lateline by the Northern Territory Crown Prosecutor, Nannette Rogers, there has been a national debate on child abuse and sexual assault in Indigenous communities. Like all children, Indigenous children have the right to be free from violence and abuse and should receive the full protection of the law. In her 2002 Cunningham Lecture, Dr Stanley noted that Indigenous children experience higher rates of abuse, neglect and other areas of disadvantage than their non-Indigenous peers. The high levels of abuse, neglect and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous children are largely a function of poverty, not of race or Aboriginal culture, as some have claimed. Professor Stanley attempted to illustrate the complex web of social and physical factors that influence the broader health and welfare of Indigenous Australians.
Mick Adams, of the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Forum, has argued that the breakdown of the traditional role and status of Aboriginal men has contributed to abuse in their communities and that the poor health status of Indigenous men leads to suffering within Indigenous families and communities. There is no excuse for the abuse of children in Indigenous communities. But there is also a danger that the current debate is falsely painting all Indigenous men as perpetrators. Such dangerous stereotyping should be avoided at all costs. Abuse of children is not just an Indigenous problem; it is a community problem which is more prevalent in underprivileged groups but prevalent throughout society.
There has been community debate about how we ensure that Indigenous children are free from abuse, assault and neglect and about where ultimate responsibility for this lies. There are clear responsibilities here at both the state and federal levels, and no-one boasts a particularly proud record. The federal government has been told time and again about the nature and extent of the problems. There has been a stream of reports and at least three federal summits. We seem to be trapped in a cycle where every few years a shocking story prompts calls for immediate action, but, as the focus of public attention shifts, the issue disappears and little progress is achieved. This pattern is also present in relation to abuse, assault and neglect of non-Indigenous children. We are seeing it in Western Australia now; we have seen it in New South Wales; and, quite frankly, we have seen it all before.
The culture of blame shifting in relation to child protection is extremely unhelpful. We look to blame rather than to solve. Political point-scoring takes place by those not in government at the time. All this holds us back from focusing on how to get results, how to build systems that protect children and how to encourage broader community responsibility. There needs to be more openness and honesty and less blame so that we can develop stronger systems to better protect Australian children. It is an approach I have certainly tried to take in Indigenous affairs in trying to support this government in tackling violence and abuse in Indigenous communities. But I do not think it is helped if people seek to sensationalise issues or to make political capital out of really tragic cases. We have got to focus on the causes and on assisting Aboriginal people and communities to tackle these problems, not constantly blame or highlight the problems.
Labor supports Senator Bartlett’s call. We do think we need national leadership. We do think we all have to contribute. I think it is about us all renewing our commitment and our efforts to do much better as a society than we have done in the past. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-09-12,"—The Greens also support Senator Bartlett’s motion. Unfortunately, not all Australian children are raised in safe living environments. As citizens in a supposedly First World country with many privileges and advantages, we find that the current rate of childhood abuse and neglect is unacceptable. Healthy, positive and supportive environments in early childhood, from birth, are essential for the move into successful adolescence and adulthood.
As Senator Evans pointed out, the child protection report released in January this year notes that the number of child protection notifications in Australia has more than doubled, from around 107,000 in 1999-2000 to over a quarter of a million in 2004-05. As has been pointed out, some of these notifications would have been the result of changes in child protection policies and practices in jurisdictions across Australia and reflect increased public awareness of child abuse. However, that cannot be used as an excuse to say that the situation is okay.
The figures for those children placed in protection or removed from home and put in out of home care indicate a very worrying trend. The number of children in care and under protection orders is increasing. Nationally, the number of children in out-of-home care rose each year from 1996 to 2005, increasing by 70 per cent, from nearly 14,000 in 1996 to nearly 24,000 in 2005. Of these children, four per cent were in residential care, 54 per cent in foster care and 40 per cent in kinship care. The rates of children in out-of-home care in Australia increased from three per cent per thousand in 1997 to 4.9 per cent per thousand in 2005. This is clearly an unacceptable situation. As has also been highlighted by previous speakers, the number of Indigenous children in out-of-home care was six times that of non-Indigenous children.
In Western Australia the Gordon report of 2002 is well known. I think it is useful to look at the barriers to change that were highlighted then. I do not think many of them have changed. They include: ongoing paternalism in government policy; Aboriginal communities must be involved as architects of the solutions; the lack of services to adequately address violence; inappropriate models; inadequate funding; the lack of coordination between Commonwealth and state bodies; mistrust and uncertainty; historical loss of confidence in the justice systems; the need for restorative and reparative processes to counteract historical wrongs; fear of the police; concern that nothing will be done anyway; concern offenders will be imprisoned and die in jail; lack of knowledge about the law and access to legal systems; and an inability to protect women and children. There is a need to focus on actual service development on the ground rather than reassessing the problem. It is also important to look at the child protection workers and the trauma that they are facing in situations of severe overwork. They are suffering from burnout, are unable to cope with the levels of stress, and face a lack of support and training. Things have not changed very much since that report, and most of those issues would also relate to non-Indigenous communities.
The solutions have also been fairly strongly articulated a number of times. They include: promoting a safe family environment, taking the stresses off family related situations; looking at prevention and a whole-of-community response involving community members in child protection and antiviolence policies; involving community members in program design, implementation and assessment; looking at risk and resilience; looking at early childhood programs; and looking at alternative models that better involve communities in decision making and that are culturally relevant support services—services that respect cultural and familial obligations and ties and actually address the fundamental causes.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-09-12,"—I rise today to speak to Senator Bartlett’s motion. The protection of children from serious abuse and neglect is paramount in our society. The Australian government has great concerns about the continuing increase in the number of child abuse cases; however, responsibility for improving child protection services rests primarily with each state and territory government. In 2006-07 the Australian government will provide an estimated $17.5 billion to support families and children. Over $10 million a year is also provided for a range of early intervention and prevention programs.
The Australian government’s policy focus is on prevention and early intervention strategies, given the research showing children’s early experiences set the stage for their later development in many ways. Senator Bartlett states that there is a need for all political parties to make child protection a national priority. I can assure Senator Bartlett that the Howard government has made this very important issue a priority. There is no doubt that the best outcomes for children will be achieved if the Australian government and the state and territory governments all work together. Child protection is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments; however, there are areas of joint activity such as prevention and early intervention.
The Community and Disability Services Ministers Conference has agreed that a national approach to child protection—focusing specifically on prevention and early intervention, data development and workforce issues—will be progressed. A cross-jurisdictional working group has been established to progress this work. This will build on work already being done jointly by the Australian government and the state and territory governments, which includes the development and implementation of: firstly, the National Plan for Foster Children, Young People and their Carers, which aims to improve outcomes for children and young people in foster care, including Indigenous young people; and, secondly, the national framework for creating safe environments for children, which focuses on a national approach for increasing the safety of children in their dealings with community service organisations.
You might ask what the government is doing on internet safety. Last week was National Child Protection Week. Senator the Hon. Helen Coonan, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and Senator the Hon. Chris Ellison, Minister for Justice and Customs, launched a joint initiative to educate children about the dangers lurking online. Cybersmart Detectives is a joint initiative between the Australian Communications and Media Authority, known as ACMA, and Australian law enforcement agencies. It builds on the Australian government’s $116.6 million package Protecting Australian Families Online, which will provide every Australian family with a free internet filter. The online tool launched nationally last week uses the internet to teach young people key internet safety messages and helps them recognise the danger signs when using online services such as chat rooms. By using Cybersmart Detectives, young people learn about the dangers of giving out personal information on the internet, that they should never meet face to face with someone they have met on the internet without a parent accompanying them and that people in the online environment may not be who they say they are.
National Child Protection Week was an opportunity to remind parents and children about the dangers lurking on the net. I think it is important that parents become more involved and more vigilant in supervising their children online so that, along with the law enforcement agencies, we can crack down on predators and paedophiles, who use increasingly sophisticated means to groom their potential victims. Parents and children can protect themselves online by keeping their personal information private, learning how to save a copy of a conversation in a chat room and blocking people who make them uncomfortable. Children also need to speak up to their parents if they continue to be worried. The internet is just another public place; and just as crimes are committed in our communities they are also committed online. I am proud to be part of this government that remains committed to ensuring all Australians, particularly children and families, can access a safe and secure internet experience.
I would now like to speak about the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, which commits $490 million, between 2004-05 and 2008-09, for early childhood initiatives and resources that can be used to achieve better outcomes for children, their families and communities. The strategy has proven to be extremely popular, especially throughout Western Australian electorates.
There are four streams to this strategy. The first is Communities for Children, where non-government organisations are funded as facilitating partners in 45 community sites around Australia to develop and implement a strategic and sustainable whole-of-community approach to early childhood development. The second, Early Childhood: Invest to Grow, provides funding for early childhood programs for improved outcomes for young children and the development of tools and resource materials for use by families, professionals and communities supporting families and young children. Third, the Local Answers stream helps strengthen disadvantaged communities by funding local, small-scale, time-limited projects that help communities build skills and capacity to identify opportunities and take action for the benefit of their members. Fourth, Choice and Flexibility in Child Care provides Australian parents with flexible and innovative childcare solutions.
If we can teach adults to be better parents, we can drive down the incidence of abuse and neglect. The website raisingchildren.net.au provides expert, impartial information on raising children, from newborns to eight years of age, in an engaging and user-friendly format. The website has been developed by the Raising Children Network, RCN, a consortium made up of three early childhood organisations: the Smart Population Foundation, the Victorian Parenting Centre and the Centre for Community Child Health at the Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne. This government commissioned the website, providing $4 million over four years under its Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. The Raising Children website provides practical tools and up-to-date information on child health, safety—(Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I rise to speak on Senator Bartlett’s matter of urgency relating to the need for all political parties to make child protection a national priority and the even greater need for governments to work together to determine ways to reduce the completely unacceptable level of serious child abuse and neglect that is occurring across the Australian community. As we are all well aware, last week was Child Protection Week, and the Democrats’ motion, supported by Labor, calling for a nationwide approach to child protection was not supported by the coalition in its original form.
Child abuse is a scourge in our society that all too often remains hidden, and therefore it is a difficult topic for governments to tackle. Unfortunately, although the number of cases is on the rise and the incidence of abuse and neglect is growing, the subject seems, far too often, to fall into the too-hard basket. Recently I attended a forum on families and homelessness at Levi House in Launceston, which was attended by representatives from local community organisations. There, I was reminded of the many problems that are facing Australian families and the strain that is being placed on families, not just in Tasmanian communities but in communities nationwide. We all know that problems that are ignored do not just go away. What is needed is a national, bipartisan approach to child protection. The cycle Senator Evans alluded to—in which a terrible story of abuse draws calls for immediate action, only for the issue to disappear when the story vanishes from the newspapers—must end now.
Yesterday during question time we saw the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kemp, fail to explain why the government has failed to act on the recommendations of the 2004 Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Forgotten Australians and the 2005 Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Protecting vulnerable children: a national challenge. Senator Kemp said he would refer the question to Minister Brough, but the time has come for answers, not more questions. The time has come for a unified, whole-of-government approach to stopping child abuse and neglect before it occurs. Both reports by the committee recommended the installation of a national commissioner for children and young people.
Freedom from violence and safety from abuse are the basic rights of all people. Children are only different in that they often do not have the ability to stand up for their rights themselves. They require our protection. It is the responsibility of all levels of government to ensure that the law is upheld and our children are protected from abuse and violence. Recent figures relating to the incidence of abuse are alarming. Suspected cases have doubled in number since 1999-2000. According to Australia’s leading national child abuse prevention agency, the NAPCAN Foundation, in 2004, 220,000 reports of child abuse were made—a figure equal to one report for every 25 children in Australia.
Child abuse is arguably Australia’s worst social problem. The statistics are frightening. In Australia, a child is abused every 13 minutes. Adam Blakester, Chief Executive of NAPCAN, said in a recent statement:
The appropriate and urgent response required today needs to address the underlying root causes of child abuse, or else the cycle of abuse will only continue. This would form the basis of a National Child Abuse Prevention Strategy, targeting all Australian children.
Unfortunately, we all know that the figures are just the beginning. With every case that is reported, there are countless others that will remain unknown, and the problem will continue to grow. The time for action is now. Child abuse and neglect is not limited to Indigenous communities, although it is recognised that Indigenous victims are over-represented in statistics. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s Child protection Australia 2004-05 report found that not only is the number of victims of child abuse increasing but the seriousness of cases continues to worsen, particularly those involving substance abuse, mental health and family violence.
The AIHW report has also revealed an over-representation of sole parent families in confirmed abuse cases. In today’s society, the breakdown of the traditional family unit and the higher incidence of sole parent families may be a reason why the incidence of abuse is on the way up. NAPCAN stated that sole parent families are more likely to have low incomes, be financially stressed, be socially isolated or have less support from their immediate family. It also stated that these are all factors that have been associated with child abuse and neglect.
Intergovernmental cooperation is the only way to develop strategies to respond to these sorts of situations. In some cases, abuse occurs due to pressures being placed on parents who may be new to parenting or who may be suffering from their own ailments, including mental health problems or depression. In many cases, abuse can be avoided if appropriate support services are instigated before the situation degenerates. If we do not act and work together now to stop the incidence of abuse and neglect in our communities, the statistics will continue to rise. It is worth remembering that the statistics are not just numbers—behind every statistic there is a young person, a child, who deserves protection.
Labor supports this urgency motion to make child protection a national priority and calls for a whole-of-government approach to develop strategies to reduce the incidence of abuse. Australia’s young people are our future, and Labor is prepared to work with the Howard government and other parties to stop the abuse and neglect of Australian children. We need national leadership on this very important issue.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Child Protection</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,12,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2006-09-12,"—I do not think there is any doubt that it is an absolute priority for this government to protect children from serious abuse and neglect, and I do not think there is any doubt that there is not a person in this chamber for whom it is not a priority. I certainly take on board Senator Polley’s comments about working together with the government to ensure that we get the right outcome. That is the goal. It is not about politics. It is about ensuring that we protect those children right across this nation who are relying on us, not just as parliamentarians but as adults in this community, to ensure that they are safe. They deserve that, and we have a real responsibility to ensure that we deliver that.
This government has a very strong commitment to a national approach. Although the federal government has a significant range of measures in place, it is not just about the federal government. It is about working with the opposition, the states and territories, community groups, parents and organisations right across the country to ensure that we get the right outcomes. The government has committed around $17 billion to supporting families and children. About $10 million of that goes each year towards early intervention and prevention.
The government has a real focus on recognising that early intervention and prevention is vitally important in ensuring the safety of our children. We have a range of measures in place, such as the REACh program—Responding Early Assisting Children—which funds 41 services that support children and parents in vulnerable families, those who are experiencing significant transitions or those who are at risk of child abuse, neglect or other crises. We have the Indigenous children program, which emphasises early intervention and prevention and focuses on the delivery of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, families and communities and builds and strengthens their resilience and support networks. We have the National Child Protection Clearinghouse, which is provided through the Australian Institute of Family Studies to get information on child protection activities and research out to professionals and organisations in this field. It is important that we note all those programs, because they are only a part of what the government is doing to ensure that we have the right measures in place to do as much as we possibly can to address this issue.
One organisation I would like to focus on in the area of government working with community organisations is NAPCAN, which was founded in 1987 by Rosemary Sinclair and Christine Stewart. I congratulate them both on their vision, their dedication and their foresight in setting up NAPCAN and recognising the need for an organisation like that. It was created to establish lines of communication between government and organisations, agencies and professionals so that we could have a real focus on this very significant issue. In 2005, NAPCAN released its new strategic plan. It is important to note that because, again, it is not just about governments and what we are doing; it is about working together as a community to ensure that we get the right outcomes.
Last week was National Child Protection Week, and we saw funding of $250,000 from the government ensure that we raise awareness. Last week a report stated that about one in three people suspected instances of child abuse, but 43 per cent of those did not report those suspicions. I think it is so important to raise community awareness of this issue, and it is through things like National Child Protection Week that awareness will be raised and, hopefully, this very serious issue will be addressed.
Many of the mainstream programs that the government funds contribute to ensuring that we have a real goal of child abuse prevention. It is not just the direct programs—the sorts of things that I mentioned earlier—but the mainstream programs as well, such as health, social security, housing, disability services and family policy. We need to adopt a holistic approach to this. It is not just about specifically targeting child abuse and those very specific measures we put in place; it is about the broader environment that those children are living in. We know that, when families are under stress, that is far more likely, unfortunately, to be a factor in child abuse. It is about issues such as poverty, unemployment, illness and disability, so we need to have a very broad-ranging approach to that, and this government certainly has that.
If we do not address those things then we are not going to be able to address the issue itself. So I believe it is vitally important that we take a very broad view to make sure we encompass all those things. We need to recognise the factors that result in instances of child abuse and do everything we can to minimise those factors. If we do that and combine it with early intervention and prevention, working collectively with all sides of government and the community, then we can make sure we get the right outcomes in this area. The more we assist families to cope, the more they are able to raise their children in a caring environment.
I am a mother of two children. I know that many senators in this place are parents. You cannot help but feel it very deeply when you hear of instances of child abuse—and you do not have to be a parent to feel deep emotion when you hear about instances of child abuse. The onus is on us to work together, to work with the community and to work with the groups. The onus is on us to ensure that we have a plan together which does not get distracted by politics and that we have a very clear path forward to ensure that our children, in this wonderful country of ours, have safe and happy lives.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Child Protection</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,12,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-09-12,"—Senator Bartlett, I do not think you are going to get a lot of debate around your motion. Listening to anyone who has spoken this afternoon and looking at any review of the literature would show that the words ‘child abuse’ can be linked very clearly to commitment, outrage and anger. Over the years, there have been very many reports, debates and times that all levels of government, politicians, churches and institutions have come together and had the kind of discussion that we have just had in this place. The literature is dripping with statements about how terrible child abuse is and about the need to have reform and cooperative operations to work together to effect change.
One of the very difficult aspects of this discussion is about how you can appropriately balance the need for hope with the overwhelming frustration that in 2006 we are talking in very similar ways to those who spoke in these kinds of debates before. In some ways, I suppose, there is hope, in that people from all sides in this place can get together and restate that we need to accept that child abuse must be a national priority and that it should not be dismissed or pushed aside by whatever the next national priority is going to be. One of the failures of our system is that we tend to be provoked by sensation—that whatever is the sensation of the moment in the media gets the reaction not just of this place but of the wider community. The message for us—and I am sure it is the message in Senator Bartlett’s motion—is that this issue should not be displaced or stimulated by sensation. It is bigger than that, it is more important than that, and there is an opportunity for us to effect real change.
This year, 2006, we have seen a number of national conferences which have been stimulated by the work of a range of people in our community, including those in NAPCAN to whom Senator Nash has just referred. The people who formed that organisation did a wonderful job for us all. And, through the Senate Community Affairs References Committee process, which has already been mentioned, a series of reports was delivered in this place, stimulated very much by the hard work and tenacious efforts of Senator Murray.
By that process, we have come up with significant reports. I refer again to the report Forgotten Australians. I think there were 39 recommendations in that August 2004 report, and the supplementary report of March 2005 came forward with another 17 recommendations, not all of which were picked up by the government. Certainly, when the government response came out later, in 2005, there was the almost inevitable response that a great deal of the constitutional responsibilities for the area of child abuse lie with state governments. That was clearly pointed out by the national governmental response. But I think there has been a move forward, beyond that kind of national shaking around over who is mostly responsible. I think that out of that process has come an acceptance that there will be an effort at the national level to coordinate responses that can address the issues that end up in the horror of child abuse.
There have been two conferences this year. One of them looked specifically at the issues of those people who were victims of institutional abuse. Those issues were covered in the Forgotten Australians report. That report talked about kids who were in care who had survived that process, many of whom have gone on to be victims throughout their lives. They actually talked about how they could move forward and address their ongoing concerns. But that also stimulated the issue of the ongoing problems of people in foster care—families that are damaged in many ways and the kids who are the most immediate victims of that kind of process.
We are awaiting with interest the government’s responses to those conferences so that once again we can work together to see what the next step should be. Senator Bartlett’s goal of making this issue a national priority can be a living reality rather than just another talking point. I hope that, out of the process, this place could perhaps have some kind of ongoing role. It is not enough that we deliver a report, move away from it and not know where to go next; we tick that box. I think there is some hope that this parliament could have an ongoing responsibility to monitor the range of programs that are introduced, how they are going and whether they are working. It could ask: ‘Has there been an actual response to the heaps of commitment and rhetorical media-covered statements about how, this time, we are going to work together?’ I am hoping that, perhaps through the Senate Community Affairs References Committee process and back through the Senate, we can have regular updates—not just at Senate estimates time—where we talk to, in particular, the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to see how the programs that have been mentioned today are going. But that should be done in a much more coordinated way so that we can do a snapshot of how these processes are working, what advances have been made and what still needs to be done. That would put some action into Senator Bartlett’s statement about working well together and making this a real national commitment and priority.
There are very many people who are looking to this place for a response, and I think that we owe our community the respect of saying that we have heard what they have told us and that we accept our responsibility as people who are representing them in parliament. I think we can move together. I think there is a genuine opportunity arising out of the need of the community and also out of the wonderful commitment of organisations like NAPCAN and the various community agencies around the place that are working in the field on this issue.
We cannot just have another speaking opportunity or media release. This issue demands that there be action, not just another series of pilot projects. I think that ‘pilotitis’, the condition of giving short-term funding to areas, does more harm than good. This needs strong, systematic change and commitment. It also means bringing the people who most understand these processes into the discussion. Then, maybe, prevention of child abuse as a real national priority will be a reality and not just something that we can talk about in this place to release our frustration.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Child Protection</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,12,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-12,"—I thank all senators for their contributions on this motion. I would like to broadly concur with the statement by the NAPCAN foundation president, Teresa Scott, that child abuse and neglect is Australia’s greatest social problem, and it is the responsibility of all Australians to do everything they can to prevent it. That must include government and political parties, of course, but I should emphasise that it is a responsibility for all Australians. It is not something that government can somehow fix without the community coming along with it and showing greater concern for the issue. However, I slightly disagree with Teresa Scott in that I think the continuing gross inequality between non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians is our greatest social problem, and it is actually no coincidence that some of the ways that manifests itself are also through child abuse and neglect.
I acknowledge the contributions and the generosity of the contributions from everybody, but, frankly, I am not convinced that this is actually being given the priority it deserves from the federal government. That is not a criticism of them specifically. It is not being given the priority it deserves by state governments and it has not been given the priority it deserves by previous federal governments either.
I also acknowledge the impossible role of welfare workers in the field in this area. They make mistakes from time to time and occasionally they are very grievous mistakes, and they should be continually monitored. But, in many cases, they carry the can for society’s failures, and for decades they have been under-resourced by governments. They are in the impossible position of deciding whether to remove a child from a family situation—and having to deal with all of the grief and upheaval that goes with that—or whether to leave the child in a situation where they may be at risk, and having to face all of the criticism if that pans out badly. As well, they have the knowledge that removing them and putting them somewhere else in care is not necessarily always terribly safe for the child either. We need to acknowledge the work of many people at the community level who are trying to navigate through this.
I support the call of Joe Tucci for a national children’s commissioner. I think that is absolutely essential. That is a recommendation of the Senate committee report that has not been taken up by this federal government. I think it is absolutely crucial that it is taken up, and the Australian Childhood Foundation has pushed for that for a long period of time. Why can’t we have a parliamentary secretary with responsibility for this? We have a parliamentary secretary with responsibility for water. Even though we all know that it is a state issue, it has been seen as an issue of national priority. I think the same sort of thing can be done with this issue, where we actually hold ourselves accountable as a nation and report to cabinet. It does not make it a national priority by just funding some programs now and then. You have consistent follow through, time after time, with the person who has that core responsibility. It is only when the parliament and all political parties agree to take the responsibility that you actually get some action.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 7 February 2007:
Australia’s national and international policing requirements over the medium- and long-term, with particular reference to:
personnel and staffing needs of relevant Commonwealth agencies, particularly the Australian Federal Police;
the adequacy of existing workforce planning arrangements in meeting those needs;
the effectiveness of existing recruitment practices and training programs;
the impact of Commonwealth police personnel strategies on state and territory police forces; and
any other related matter.
There is a very simple reason why I am moving this motion for an inquiry into Australia’s national and international policing requirements over the medium and longer term. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Senate has not had the opportunity to look at this issue nor has there been a substantive inquiry by the government into this issue.
If you look at the Australian Federal Police, at its birth and its subsequent changes, you will see that it has changed in reaction to events. It was the bombing outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney back in 1978 that brought about the AFP’s creation. Then the terrorist attacks in New York, almost five years ago to the day, led to significant shifts in its role and an increase in its funding under the current government.
What has been lacking is a strategic assessment of our future policing needs to help guide workforce planning, not just at the federal level but also at the state and territory levels. A failure to have this forward-looking approach means you end up with the quagmire that this government finds itself in today. Look at the response of the Minister for Justice and Customs to a dorothy dixer that he took during yesterday’s question time. Senator Ellison was asked what this government had done to ensure Australia’s security interests. All he talked about were the laws this government had passed and the money it had appropriated. Strong laws and sufficient government funding are both important parts of the equation for a successful policing approach in the modern security environment. But on their own they are not enough. On their own, neither can put themselves to good use. Strong laws cannot enforce themselves and money cannot spend itself on what it was intended for, and sometimes it cannot even be spent at all.
To put the laws to good use two things are required: firstly, sufficient numbers of police officers who are appropriately and properly trained and able to enforce the laws; and, secondly, accountability and transparency mechanisms to help ensure that money is actually put to the use that was intended. Those two elements form the other half of the equation, and both are essential elements that are severely lacking under the current government. For one thing, the government has done away with the accountability mechanisms of the Senate ever since it took control in July last year. Its constant sabotage of the Senate, particularly in the estimates process and the committee structure, have made the task of holding this government to account more arduous. I might add that this does not mean that we never get to the bottom of the stench or that problems disappear, but, rather, that the problems fester away under the surface and it takes longer than necessary to find the solution that the public deserve and that this government should then address.
If you require particular proof that the government wants to hinder accountability when it comes to funding policing then look no further than its refusal to support this inquiry. I am aware of the numbers in this place. This inquiry will not get up, because the government will not support it, but it is an inquiry that should get up and the government should support it. When you look at the government in terms of police numbers and training, you will see that, perhaps more through negligence than intent, it has dropped the ball when it comes to recruiting and training sufficient numbers of police officers. The reason that the government is failing to make a strategic assessment of Australia’s longer term policing needs is that it is not in a position to put in place a plan to ensure that those needs can be met.
In many ways, passing laws and appropriating money, as I said, are the easy parts of the equation to get right, since all the government requires is having the numbers in the Senate. Finding suitable recruits, training them up and giving them plenty of field experience, on the other hand, is not something that can be done overnight. It is a process that takes some time. The government, from time to time, sets itself one-off discretionary targets, such as the recently announced increase to the AFP’s International Deployment Group, but the problem with discretionary targets that are not part of any universal goals is that, when the government comes under pressure to deliver them, they may just come at the cost of other areas of the agency.
So, in two years time, if the government manages to successfully boost the IDG—which is an important initiative that Labor, as I indicated at the time, fully supports—we will need to be sure that experienced officers have not simply been diverted or pulled from other areas of operations within the AFP, such as fighting drugs, crimes abroad, fraud, terrorism and sex-trafficking crimes. All of those exist for the AFP to fight.
The evidence to date causes me serious concern. We can go to some of the evidence that demonstrates that this government has failed in the five years since September 11 to put in place a forward-looking plan. Consider the manner in which the government has increased funding to the AFP over that period, even if we look at one of the things that it has tried to do. In the five budgets since September 11, not one of the significant increases to funding has been built into the forward estimates—not one. In fact, across each of the budgets, the forward estimates for out years projected an average annual decrease of 3.5 per cent and sometimes as high as 22 per cent. The problem facing the Australian Federal Police Commissioner is that, when he looks at his budget and sees a one-off increase of 16 per cent for the first year followed by a decrease for every year after that, he is hardly in the best position to grow the organisation by the actual average increase of 26 per cent. It is just not the right way to grow the Australian Federal Police.
If you look at the effects of not having a plan, you will see that it is of little surprise that the Australian Federal Police average staffing levels fell short of the projected growth in the last financial year by 421 personnel. The 2005-06 Budget Paper No. 1 showed that the Australian Federal Police had expected the average staffing level to rise from 4,865 to 5,191, but the table in the 2006-07 budget paper showed that it ended up falling to 4,717. In other words, the agency was unable to deliver what was projected in the previous year. The 2006-07 budget paper then predicted an increase of only 23 personnel. Not being satisfied with that, we had the opportunity of asking the Australian Federal Police about that at estimates. The AFP responded: ‘Those are the figures in the PBS’—that is, the portfolio budget statement. ‘Are those the figures that we expect? The answer is no.’ So, just three weeks after the budget figures were published, the Australian Federal Police were already contesting their accuracy. It is little wonder that they had difficulty in meeting the previous year’s target.
I had been concerned that the Australian Federal Police had difficulty in actually spending their appropriated money each year, so I put the question to them during the May hearing. The Australian Federal Police took the question on notice—No. 103, for those who are interested in reading the response for themselves. This is what they had to say about the receivables for the 2003-04 year:
A significant upward movement in receivables—
that is, $145 million—
in 2003-04 is due to the forecast surplus of $80m and deferred capital expenditure of $64m.
The main drivers of the surplus were delays in implementing new measures (particularly recruitment activities) and an underspend of $32m for PNG related activities …
I understand and accept the complications related to Papua New Guinea and recognise that the money concerned, a few hundred million dollars, was returned to the government in the last budget, but the Australian Federal Police itself chose to specifically mention, of all other activities, delays in recruitment. Yet the minister told the Australian public on national TV on 27 August that the Australian Federal Police has no trouble in recruiting. It just defies belief.
It is worth mentioning that, in their response to question on notice No. 103, the AFP failed to provide any explanation whatsoever for the additional $275 million in receivables as of the last budget. To be fair, I have asked the Australian Federal Police to provide further clarification on their answer, so I do not want to prejudice their response. But it is far from reassuring to see that it is now September and there has been no answer to date. What it amounts to is a 37 per cent increase in Australian Federal Police funding from the Commonwealth for that year which is as yet unexplained.
I turn to some of the other areas that have become newsworthy issues—for example, airport security and the Wheeler report. The Wheeler report recommended that the Australian Federal Police take control of airport security. The government has managed to put into place airport commanders but, as far as getting the full complement of community police officers together is concerned, it seems that achieving that is a little way off. What we have is airport commanders at airports but no community police officers to go with them.
Meanwhile, an analysis of the numbers in the most recent annual report for 2004-05 reveals that there are 4,770 AFP staff. If you break that down, you will find that 258 were stationed in overseas posts; at least a further 147 were on peacekeeping duties overseas; 1,205 are protective service officers providing guarding and not investigating services; 26 were on secondments to other agencies; a further 1,291 were unsworn; 608 were on ACT local policing duties; and 20 were on local policing duties in other territories. That means that there were fewer than 1,215 sworn operational police officers actively investigating domestic federal crime during that year—that is, less than one sworn officer concentrating on fighting terrorism, illicit drug distribution, money laundering and fraud against the Commonwealth for every 15,000 people.
It is not just the Australian Federal Police that has to deal with the consequences of this government’s failure to properly plan in the area of policing; it impacts upon state and territory police forces as well. To begin with, existing skills shortages across the economy mean that all police forces have a shrinking pool to recruit from. When the federal government bursts onto the scene and announces a massive increase in its own recruitment activities, this can throw a disproportionate burden on state and territory workforce planning.
There is another issue, though—that is, the Australian Federal Police may be forced to poach directly from state and territory police forces in order to achieve its target. The government has given assurances that this will not occur, but the fact that the minister could not say how many of the current applicants before the Australian Federal Police were existing officers in state and territory police forces suggests that he is not particularly worried about the impact it might have on any agency other than his own.
Now the government is about to defend its position of not having a Senate inquiry into this matter. The last inquiry was before September 11; it was a rather narrow inquiry, dealing with certain matters. There have been none from the government, unless you go right back to 1998—that was the last one. An inquiry like this will not get off the ground because this government will not support it. In the first week of the new committee structure, it is surprising that the government is going to knock over a reasonable reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to look at this issue. I think it is because this is an inquiry that this government does not want as it thinks that scrutiny is not good. You could say that it is because it might think that there are no serious concerns about the current state of affairs. The government might want to pretend that everything is rosy, but even the minister failed to deny Labor’s claim that average staffing levels fell 421 short of the target for the last financial year. He was given the opportunity yesterday to do that and he failed to take that up.
The reason is that the government are addicted to shutting down all avenues for holding themselves to account. They tried to argue that changing the committee system would mean that more inquiries would get up because the government would not have to worry about them being run by a hostile chair. That was one of the arguments that was put. I am not going to get direct about this, but they put up a number and range of spurious reasons as to why the new committee structure would provide a more streamlined and efficient system which would allow committees to deal with references. That has not come to pass, I have to say. On the second day into the new committee structure, here we are: the government are again seeking to reject this reference, despite the compelling need for it and despite the government’s claim to care about national security.
The Prime Minister likes to ask voters to judge him on his record. I have looked at the PM’s record on national policing and I have to say that I am far from reassured. If this government were proud and confident of its record on national policing then it would have nothing to be concerned about and nothing to fear from having an inquiry proceed, particularly given that it would be responsible for chairing it as well.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,15,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2006-09-12,"—I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this discussion of Senator Ludwig’s motion proposing a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is interesting that this is a matter concerning the Australian Federal Police and that the debate at this point involves Senator Ludwig and me, because both of us as members of this chamber have had extensive contact and engagement with the Australian Federal Police in a number of contexts over the last few years.
Certainly, as Senator Ludwig noted, there was a previous Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry, chaired, as I recall, by Senator Jim McKiernan. Although that was referred to by Senator Ludwig as a committee inquiry with a narrow focus, I have different memories. I remember it as a broad-ranging, comprehensive inquiry which explored far and wide the administration and operation of the Australian Federal Police and matters such as the one before us this afternoon. In fact, we were well supported by the Australian Federal Police through the information they provided us with during that inquiry. Perhaps we will have to agree to differ on that point.
I will come to matters of confected political exaggeration that Senator Ludwig has pursued in his remarks a little later, but let me deal with the substance of the reference, which is essentially AFP recruiting and, in particular, Australia’s national and international policing requirements.
Senator Ludwig was right about one of the observations he made this afternoon—that is, that the government does oppose this reference. The government opposes this reference because there are no particularly cogent reasons for it and none were advanced in this afternoon’s debate that would persuade us otherwise. Yesterday in the chamber, reference was made by Senator Ludwig to a shortfall, allegedly, of 421 people in the AFP’s recruitment planning for the 2005-06 financial year, and it seems that that assertion formed at least part of the basis for his proposed reference to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. It seems to me, however, on a closer examination of the figures, that that assertion itself is not correct. What I would like to present to the chamber is a more accurate representation of the AFP’s actual staffing levels and its success against recruitment plans. I also reject the assertion that the government does not have a plan and a strategic approach to these matters as far as the AFP is concerned.
Let me go through some of the numbers that have been discussed. In the 2005-06 Budget Paper No.1, the AFP projected a staffing level of 5,191 in 2005-06. In fact, the AFP reached an actual staffing level of 5,150 for the 2005-06 financial year. That indicates a shortfall of only 41—which was addressed, I am advised, by police recruit courses on both 17 July and 14 August this year. Senator Ludwig was referring to forecast figures published in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 budget papers No. 1. It is important to note, however, that the published figures for each year were determined on different bases. The figures for 2005-06 are a whole-of-AFP position which includes ACT policing, whereas I am advised that the figures for the 2006-07 paper do not in fact include ACT policing numbers. Having reviewed the data, the AFP acknowledges that there was an inconsistency in presenting the 2005-06 data in Budget Paper No. 1—an acknowledgement which it is entirely appropriate to make in this chamber. I am advised that there is a clear undertaking to ensure a consistent approach in the future. Staffing figures in the future will include those relevant ACT policing numbers.
The forecast AFP staffing level of 4,793 in the 2006-07 Budget Paper No. 1, published in May 2006, does not include ACT policing. Nor does it take into account the government’s more recent decision to increase the AFP’s International Deployment Group to 1,200 personnel over the next two years. Indeed, a more accurate description of the environment in which the AFP finds itself is that it has been in a period of continued growth over the past five years. So, rather than Senator Ludwig’s claimed decrease of 95, the increase between 2004-05 and 2005-06 in actual staffing was 372—that is, it rose from 4,778 to 5,150. The government has continued to show its strong commitment to the work of the AFP over the past five years, with the AFP workforce—not including the former Australian Protective Service—growing by almost 1,200 staff in that period.
I would also like to make some comments about the environment surrounding the International Deployment Group. Prior to the recent IDG announcement, the AFP had a total of 848 recruitment actions either in progress or planned for the next 18 months. That recruitment planning is being revised upward to incorporate the recent government announcement of the expansion of the IDG to 1,200. I also understand, and it has been a matter of some public discussion in recent days, that as at September 2006 there are over 2,000 people—in fact, 2,372 people—who have put in unsolicited applications for police and protective service officer positions in the AFP.
The AFP has in fact recently concluded an independent review of its recruitment structure and practices in recognition of the significant relevance of ongoing recruitment activity to AFP business outcomes. The recommendations of that review have been accepted by the AFP Commissioner and will be implemented over coming months. In addition, in late December last year, the AFP also introduced a new online recruitment system for police applications. That system has seen significant increases in the number of unsolicited applications received.
In late 2005, the AFP also began a strategic review of its medium-term financial outlook. A retired former deputy secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration, Mr Len Early, has been working with AFP managers and also the AFP finance area to map the emergent financial outlook for the organisation for the next four years and to develop strategies precisely to address those emergent issues. It is expected that that review will be concluded by the end of this calendar year and will form the basis of future financial planning.
So, in contrast to the observations made by Senator Ludwig, the AFP’s workforce planning is undertaken by a very dedicated workforce-planning unit. The work of that unit is overseen by a senior-level strategic workforce planning committee, which includes the deputy commissioner and the AFP’s chief operating officer. The committee meets monthly to review AFP workforce targets and strategies, and it monitors achievements from recruitment through to the completion of training.
The AFP is continually reviewing the demands they face. Senator Ludwig is also right on that point, as was the minister in the observations he made in question time yesterday. Those demands are significant and they are dynamic. That is the nature of the environment in which the AFP are policing. They review the resources and the personnel they need to meet those demands. On the basis of that ongoing review and—ironically, in light of some of Senator Ludwig’s observations—on the basis of the access that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and members of this chamber have to deal with the AFP on these questions, there is not a need to refer this matter specifically to a parliamentary committee. This government has quadrupled funding to the AFP since 1996 and, as I have demonstrated, it has increased personnel numbers in that process. The government’s commitment is to ensure that the Australian Federal Police have both the resources and the personnel they need to meet domestic and international obligations.
It is pertinent to note, perhaps, that there are other interesting organisations that do not appear to agree with Senator Ludwig’s proposition in relation to this reference. The ABC earlier today reported that the AFP Association has rejected the views put forward by Senator Ludwig and does not share the concerns that the force is struggling to attract new recruits. In fact the AFPA’s Jim Torr is reported as saying that he is confident that the federal government’s promise and commitment to boost numbers means that this is not the issue that is being presented in this chamber tonight. The ABC quotes Mr Torr as saying the federal government has just very recently made a ‘commitment for 400 more police into the AFP’. Mr Torr said that upon delivery of those numbers the issue would be put ‘beyond any doubt,’ and that the government had ‘made a commitment of around half a billion dollars to bring the members up to that level.’ The piece goes on to say that the AFPA said that it ‘is confident that the recent funding boost by the federal government will help the force meet its recruitment targets’. So not even the industrial association that supports the AFP is supporting this supposed reference in this chamber this afternoon.
I want to make some brief reference though to Senator Ludwig’s assertions—and in my view they are little more than that—that the government has in some heroic manner done away with the accountability requirements of the Senate. I think that Senator Ludwig said that the system was under constant sabotage, and that included the estimates process—an observation that I find interesting as I spend more hours with Senator Ludwig in an estimates room than I do with members of my family during most weeks. Hundreds and hundreds of questions are put on notice and questions taken across the table are put to agencies like the Australian Federal Police in estimates meeting after estimates meeting and are answered comprehensively in as timely a manner as possible. That did not change in May and it will not change in November, so that is not an accurate representation from Senator Ludwig as to the way in which the committees will work.
The senator asserts that the government is of the view that scrutiny is not good. If the government were of the view that scrutiny is not good, then we would not provide members of the committee with access to the Australian Federal Police, as we so often do, not just through the formal hearing process but also in an informal environment where constructive discussions and exchanges can take place and where members of the opposition can avail themselves of the opportunity. Members of the opposition do not appear to complain about it at the time. We would not invite the AFP and its associated agencies at the most senior levels to spend hours and hours in committee environments in public hearings, with material on the record, government and opposition senators asking questions and senior officers of the AFP answering those questions constructively and willingly if this government were in the business of avoiding scrutiny. We just would not do it. Why would we? That is what puts the lie to the assertions that Senator Ludwig makes this afternoon about avoidance of scrutiny and about constant sabotage of the system including the estimates process. It is simply not demonstrable on the evidence, particularly in relation to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. As the chair of that committee both in its new incarnation and previously, I absolutely and totally reject that. There is no question to the best of my recollection or knowledge that those opposite have ever been denied the opportunity to pursue matters of concern to them in relation to AFP policing and the associated issues.
I think that this notice of motion perhaps belies a desperate search, if you like, on the part of those opposite to find something constructive to do. It is not necessary to pursue it in this way. The committee has plenty of work to do. The committee gives those opposite plenty of access in relation to the Australian Federal Police, as do the minister and the government. I have never heard the Australian Federal Police decline an opportunity to appear before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee either formally or informally. I am sure that position will not change, notwithstanding the change in the committee process. For those reasons and the matters to which I have earlier referred, the government rejects this proposal for a committee inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,15,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-12,"—Unless there is anyone else to speak, I will close the debate. We have now heard a half-hearted attempt to justify why a Senate inquiry should not be had into this. The government hides behind its own committee to say that there should not be an inquiry in this place. In the committee estimates process last time, this government, with little notice, took away the spillover days. If you do not think that they were a valuable contribution to how the Senate works and how the estimates process works, I would ask you to reflect upon what it means. It potentially means that significant hours are removed from the debate during a committee process. This means that questions that would otherwise have been asked, with time allowed for a response, have to be put on notice, and there is then a wait for a careful answer months down the track. Answers are provided—there is no argument about that. But if those on the other side do not think that the estimates process has been sabotaged as a consequence of removing the estimates spillover days in May then I would ask them to reflect upon what that has meant and how the government has managed the committee process through the use of spillover days, which were used for the purpose of hearing certain issues such as the Vivian Solon matter.
One wonders whether the issue of Vivian Solon would have come out if spillover days were not available to be used. When you listen to the defence that has been put up today you hear that matters that go to the Australian Federal Police, such as what might be called the ‘early review’, will go ahead. Is there a guarantee that that review will be public? Is there a guarantee that the Australian Federal Police will provide that to the committee? I do not know. Do the government know? I am not sure they know that themselves. Is there a commitment from the Australian Federal Police to make that review available to the opposition? I cannot answer that.
A Senate committee would allow the Senate to look at those issues and examine them. The issue of numbers might be raised. There might be open debate about whether the information you have from the government’s perspective is accurate; there might be debate about whether my information is accurate. It is from the portfolio budget statements, so it would be interesting if it were not accurate. It might require an explanation from the Australian Federal Police—which they could have an opportunity to answer as an aside.
Was there a narrowly or widely cast Senate inquiry? There was, but it was prior to 9-11 and the significant increase in funding to the Australian Federal Police. If you are going to use figures which refer to quadrupling the size of the budget available to the AFP, I ask the government to reflect upon that figure and give me the base and the figure it has quadrupled to. These are all issues that could be debated and examined in an inquiry such as the one I am proposing. This is broader than simply looking at staffing numbers, as I indicated during the primary debate; it also looks at a national focus between state and federal police. There was no response from the government in respect of that issue or the impact that increasing the Australian Federal Police would have on state policing.
If the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth government are truly going to play a national role in fighting terrorism, drugs, crime and fraud, and in deployment overseas, they should also consider the wider implications of their recruitment in the short to medium term. The inquiry would also look at that, but there was no response from the government on that—there was no response from the other side in respect of that matter. Why? Because there is no argument against it. There is no argument to justify why a Senate inquiry would not be able to look at all of those issues and have access not just to the narrow focus of the Australian Federal Police but also to others who can make submissions, provide views and inform the Senate of what they think—not simply what the AFP might think or, for that matter, what I, Labor or other members of the committee might think—are the issues at hand. The strength of a Senate inquiry is to draw other submissions and parties into the debate to provide information and explanation. To discard that strength is to throw away a significant amount of scrutiny that this government would otherwise have. It is a poor response to say the AFP make themselves available—of course they do; they make themselves available to the legal and constitutional legislation committee now referred to as the standing committee. But that is not the point of an inquiry.
The point of an inquiry is to provide a much broader view, and everybody here knows that. In terms of the Australian Federal Police Association—I will not go to the specifics. To the senator who at least quoted from the document: look at where it mentions the reference to a review by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee or perhaps go there. I ask you to consider whether that is a viable position to advocate.
The broader issue is whether or not, after 9-11, the Australian Federal Police should have a broader inquiry into matters that go to national policing. There are, as I have argued, primarily cogent reasons why the Senate should have the ability to look into state and federal issues from a national and an overseas perspective. There is a strong argument for why this is so. To say that this place, since 1 July 2005, has continued to remain accountable in the same way that the Senate has been in the past is short-sighted and belies the figures that underpin it. When you look at the number of references that this government has accepted, the number of gags and guillotines shortening the debate, the number of amendments during committee stages and the shortening of Senate inquiries looking at particular legislation, you have to say in sum total: this government avoids scrutiny where it can. This is another example of this government avoiding scrutiny where it can.
Question put:
That the motion (That the motion (Senator Ludwig’s) be agreed to.) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,15,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 7 February 2007:
Australia’s national and international policing requirements over the medium- and long-term, with particular reference to:
personnel and staffing needs of relevant Commonwealth agencies, particularly the Australian Federal Police;
the adequacy of existing workforce planning arrangements in meeting those needs;
the effectiveness of existing recruitment practices and training programs;
the impact of Commonwealth police personnel strategies on state and territory police forces; and
any other related matter.
There is a very simple reason why I am moving this motion for an inquiry into Australia’s national and international policing requirements over the medium and longer term. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Senate has not had the opportunity to look at this issue nor has there been a substantive inquiry by the government into this issue.
If you look at the Australian Federal Police, at its birth and its subsequent changes, you will see that it has changed in reaction to events. It was the bombing outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney back in 1978 that brought about the AFP’s creation. Then the terrorist attacks in New York, almost five years ago to the day, led to significant shifts in its role and an increase in its funding under the current government.
What has been lacking is a strategic assessment of our future policing needs to help guide workforce planning, not just at the federal level but also at the state and territory levels. A failure to have this forward-looking approach means you end up with the quagmire that this government finds itself in today. Look at the response of the Minister for Justice and Customs to a dorothy dixer that he took during yesterday’s question time. Senator Ellison was asked what this government had done to ensure Australia’s security interests. All he talked about were the laws this government had passed and the money it had appropriated. Strong laws and sufficient government funding are both important parts of the equation for a successful policing approach in the modern security environment. But on their own they are not enough. On their own, neither can put themselves to good use. Strong laws cannot enforce themselves and money cannot spend itself on what it was intended for, and sometimes it cannot even be spent at all.
To put the laws to good use two things are required: firstly, sufficient numbers of police officers who are appropriately and properly trained and able to enforce the laws; and, secondly, accountability and transparency mechanisms to help ensure that money is actually put to the use that was intended. Those two elements form the other half of the equation, and both are essential elements that are severely lacking under the current government. For one thing, the government has done away with the accountability mechanisms of the Senate ever since it took control in July last year. Its constant sabotage of the Senate, particularly in the estimates process and the committee structure, have made the task of holding this government to account more arduous. I might add that this does not mean that we never get to the bottom of the stench or that problems disappear, but, rather, that the problems fester away under the surface and it takes longer than necessary to find the solution that the public deserve and that this government should then address.
If you require particular proof that the government wants to hinder accountability when it comes to funding policing then look no further than its refusal to support this inquiry. I am aware of the numbers in this place. This inquiry will not get up, because the government will not support it, but it is an inquiry that should get up and the government should support it. When you look at the government in terms of police numbers and training, you will see that, perhaps more through negligence than intent, it has dropped the ball when it comes to recruiting and training sufficient numbers of police officers. The reason that the government is failing to make a strategic assessment of Australia’s longer term policing needs is that it is not in a position to put in place a plan to ensure that those needs can be met.
In many ways, passing laws and appropriating money, as I said, are the easy parts of the equation to get right, since all the government requires is having the numbers in the Senate. Finding suitable recruits, training them up and giving them plenty of field experience, on the other hand, is not something that can be done overnight. It is a process that takes some time. The government, from time to time, sets itself one-off discretionary targets, such as the recently announced increase to the AFP’s International Deployment Group, but the problem with discretionary targets that are not part of any universal goals is that, when the government comes under pressure to deliver them, they may just come at the cost of other areas of the agency.
So, in two years time, if the government manages to successfully boost the IDG—which is an important initiative that Labor, as I indicated at the time, fully supports—we will need to be sure that experienced officers have not simply been diverted or pulled from other areas of operations within the AFP, such as fighting drugs, crimes abroad, fraud, terrorism and sex-trafficking crimes. All of those exist for the AFP to fight.
The evidence to date causes me serious concern. We can go to some of the evidence that demonstrates that this government has failed in the five years since September 11 to put in place a forward-looking plan. Consider the manner in which the government has increased funding to the AFP over that period, even if we look at one of the things that it has tried to do. In the five budgets since September 11, not one of the significant increases to funding has been built into the forward estimates—not one. In fact, across each of the budgets, the forward estimates for out years projected an average annual decrease of 3.5 per cent and sometimes as high as 22 per cent. The problem facing the Australian Federal Police Commissioner is that, when he looks at his budget and sees a one-off increase of 16 per cent for the first year followed by a decrease for every year after that, he is hardly in the best position to grow the organisation by the actual average increase of 26 per cent. It is just not the right way to grow the Australian Federal Police.
If you look at the effects of not having a plan, you will see that it is of little surprise that the Australian Federal Police average staffing levels fell short of the projected growth in the last financial year by 421 personnel. The 2005-06 Budget Paper No. 1 showed that the Australian Federal Police had expected the average staffing level to rise from 4,865 to 5,191, but the table in the 2006-07 budget paper showed that it ended up falling to 4,717. In other words, the agency was unable to deliver what was projected in the previous year. The 2006-07 budget paper then predicted an increase of only 23 personnel. Not being satisfied with that, we had the opportunity of asking the Australian Federal Police about that at estimates. The AFP responded: ‘Those are the figures in the PBS’—that is, the portfolio budget statement. ‘Are those the figures that we expect? The answer is no.’ So, just three weeks after the budget figures were published, the Australian Federal Police were already contesting their accuracy. It is little wonder that they had difficulty in meeting the previous year’s target.
I had been concerned that the Australian Federal Police had difficulty in actually spending their appropriated money each year, so I put the question to them during the May hearing. The Australian Federal Police took the question on notice—No. 103, for those who are interested in reading the response for themselves. This is what they had to say about the receivables for the 2003-04 year:
A significant upward movement in receivables—
that is, $145 million—
in 2003-04 is due to the forecast surplus of $80m and deferred capital expenditure of $64m.
The main drivers of the surplus were delays in implementing new measures (particularly recruitment activities) and an underspend of $32m for PNG related activities …
I understand and accept the complications related to Papua New Guinea and recognise that the money concerned, a few hundred million dollars, was returned to the government in the last budget, but the Australian Federal Police itself chose to specifically mention, of all other activities, delays in recruitment. Yet the minister told the Australian public on national TV on 27 August that the Australian Federal Police has no trouble in recruiting. It just defies belief.
It is worth mentioning that, in their response to question on notice No. 103, the AFP failed to provide any explanation whatsoever for the additional $275 million in receivables as of the last budget. To be fair, I have asked the Australian Federal Police to provide further clarification on their answer, so I do not want to prejudice their response. But it is far from reassuring to see that it is now September and there has been no answer to date. What it amounts to is a 37 per cent increase in Australian Federal Police funding from the Commonwealth for that year which is as yet unexplained.
I turn to some of the other areas that have become newsworthy issues—for example, airport security and the Wheeler report. The Wheeler report recommended that the Australian Federal Police take control of airport security. The government has managed to put into place airport commanders but, as far as getting the full complement of community police officers together is concerned, it seems that achieving that is a little way off. What we have is airport commanders at airports but no community police officers to go with them.
Meanwhile, an analysis of the numbers in the most recent annual report for 2004-05 reveals that there are 4,770 AFP staff. If you break that down, you will find that 258 were stationed in overseas posts; at least a further 147 were on peacekeeping duties overseas; 1,205 are protective service officers providing guarding and not investigating services; 26 were on secondments to other agencies; a further 1,291 were unsworn; 608 were on ACT local policing duties; and 20 were on local policing duties in other territories. That means that there were fewer than 1,215 sworn operational police officers actively investigating domestic federal crime during that year—that is, less than one sworn officer concentrating on fighting terrorism, illicit drug distribution, money laundering and fraud against the Commonwealth for every 15,000 people.
It is not just the Australian Federal Police that has to deal with the consequences of this government’s failure to properly plan in the area of policing; it impacts upon state and territory police forces as well. To begin with, existing skills shortages across the economy mean that all police forces have a shrinking pool to recruit from. When the federal government bursts onto the scene and announces a massive increase in its own recruitment activities, this can throw a disproportionate burden on state and territory workforce planning.
There is another issue, though—that is, the Australian Federal Police may be forced to poach directly from state and territory police forces in order to achieve its target. The government has given assurances that this will not occur, but the fact that the minister could not say how many of the current applicants before the Australian Federal Police were existing officers in state and territory police forces suggests that he is not particularly worried about the impact it might have on any agency other than his own.
Now the government is about to defend its position of not having a Senate inquiry into this matter. The last inquiry was before September 11; it was a rather narrow inquiry, dealing with certain matters. There have been none from the government, unless you go right back to 1998—that was the last one. An inquiry like this will not get off the ground because this government will not support it. In the first week of the new committee structure, it is surprising that the government is going to knock over a reasonable reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to look at this issue. I think it is because this is an inquiry that this government does not want as it thinks that scrutiny is not good. You could say that it is because it might think that there are no serious concerns about the current state of affairs. The government might want to pretend that everything is rosy, but even the minister failed to deny Labor’s claim that average staffing levels fell 421 short of the target for the last financial year. He was given the opportunity yesterday to do that and he failed to take that up.
The reason is that the government are addicted to shutting down all avenues for holding themselves to account. They tried to argue that changing the committee system would mean that more inquiries would get up because the government would not have to worry about them being run by a hostile chair. That was one of the arguments that was put. I am not going to get direct about this, but they put up a number and range of spurious reasons as to why the new committee structure would provide a more streamlined and efficient system which would allow committees to deal with references. That has not come to pass, I have to say. On the second day into the new committee structure, here we are: the government are again seeking to reject this reference, despite the compelling need for it and despite the government’s claim to care about national security.
The Prime Minister likes to ask voters to judge him on his record. I have looked at the PM’s record on national policing and I have to say that I am far from reassured. If this government were proud and confident of its record on national policing then it would have nothing to be concerned about and nothing to fear from having an inquiry proceed, particularly given that it would be responsible for chairing it as well.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,15,2
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2006-09-12,"—I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this discussion of Senator Ludwig’s motion proposing a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It is interesting that this is a matter concerning the Australian Federal Police and that the debate at this point involves Senator Ludwig and me, because both of us as members of this chamber have had extensive contact and engagement with the Australian Federal Police in a number of contexts over the last few years.
Certainly, as Senator Ludwig noted, there was a previous Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry, chaired, as I recall, by Senator Jim McKiernan. Although that was referred to by Senator Ludwig as a committee inquiry with a narrow focus, I have different memories. I remember it as a broad-ranging, comprehensive inquiry which explored far and wide the administration and operation of the Australian Federal Police and matters such as the one before us this afternoon. In fact, we were well supported by the Australian Federal Police through the information they provided us with during that inquiry. Perhaps we will have to agree to differ on that point.
I will come to matters of confected political exaggeration that Senator Ludwig has pursued in his remarks a little later, but let me deal with the substance of the reference, which is essentially AFP recruiting and, in particular, Australia’s national and international policing requirements.
Senator Ludwig was right about one of the observations he made this afternoon—that is, that the government does oppose this reference. The government opposes this reference because there are no particularly cogent reasons for it and none were advanced in this afternoon’s debate that would persuade us otherwise. Yesterday in the chamber, reference was made by Senator Ludwig to a shortfall, allegedly, of 421 people in the AFP’s recruitment planning for the 2005-06 financial year, and it seems that that assertion formed at least part of the basis for his proposed reference to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. It seems to me, however, on a closer examination of the figures, that that assertion itself is not correct. What I would like to present to the chamber is a more accurate representation of the AFP’s actual staffing levels and its success against recruitment plans. I also reject the assertion that the government does not have a plan and a strategic approach to these matters as far as the AFP is concerned.
Let me go through some of the numbers that have been discussed. In the 2005-06 Budget Paper No.1, the AFP projected a staffing level of 5,191 in 2005-06. In fact, the AFP reached an actual staffing level of 5,150 for the 2005-06 financial year. That indicates a shortfall of only 41—which was addressed, I am advised, by police recruit courses on both 17 July and 14 August this year. Senator Ludwig was referring to forecast figures published in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 budget papers No. 1. It is important to note, however, that the published figures for each year were determined on different bases. The figures for 2005-06 are a whole-of-AFP position which includes ACT policing, whereas I am advised that the figures for the 2006-07 paper do not in fact include ACT policing numbers. Having reviewed the data, the AFP acknowledges that there was an inconsistency in presenting the 2005-06 data in Budget Paper No. 1—an acknowledgement which it is entirely appropriate to make in this chamber. I am advised that there is a clear undertaking to ensure a consistent approach in the future. Staffing figures in the future will include those relevant ACT policing numbers.
The forecast AFP staffing level of 4,793 in the 2006-07 Budget Paper No. 1, published in May 2006, does not include ACT policing. Nor does it take into account the government’s more recent decision to increase the AFP’s International Deployment Group to 1,200 personnel over the next two years. Indeed, a more accurate description of the environment in which the AFP finds itself is that it has been in a period of continued growth over the past five years. So, rather than Senator Ludwig’s claimed decrease of 95, the increase between 2004-05 and 2005-06 in actual staffing was 372—that is, it rose from 4,778 to 5,150. The government has continued to show its strong commitment to the work of the AFP over the past five years, with the AFP workforce—not including the former Australian Protective Service—growing by almost 1,200 staff in that period.
I would also like to make some comments about the environment surrounding the International Deployment Group. Prior to the recent IDG announcement, the AFP had a total of 848 recruitment actions either in progress or planned for the next 18 months. That recruitment planning is being revised upward to incorporate the recent government announcement of the expansion of the IDG to 1,200. I also understand, and it has been a matter of some public discussion in recent days, that as at September 2006 there are over 2,000 people—in fact, 2,372 people—who have put in unsolicited applications for police and protective service officer positions in the AFP.
The AFP has in fact recently concluded an independent review of its recruitment structure and practices in recognition of the significant relevance of ongoing recruitment activity to AFP business outcomes. The recommendations of that review have been accepted by the AFP Commissioner and will be implemented over coming months. In addition, in late December last year, the AFP also introduced a new online recruitment system for police applications. That system has seen significant increases in the number of unsolicited applications received.
In late 2005, the AFP also began a strategic review of its medium-term financial outlook. A retired former deputy secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration, Mr Len Early, has been working with AFP managers and also the AFP finance area to map the emergent financial outlook for the organisation for the next four years and to develop strategies precisely to address those emergent issues. It is expected that that review will be concluded by the end of this calendar year and will form the basis of future financial planning.
So, in contrast to the observations made by Senator Ludwig, the AFP’s workforce planning is undertaken by a very dedicated workforce-planning unit. The work of that unit is overseen by a senior-level strategic workforce planning committee, which includes the deputy commissioner and the AFP’s chief operating officer. The committee meets monthly to review AFP workforce targets and strategies, and it monitors achievements from recruitment through to the completion of training.
The AFP is continually reviewing the demands they face. Senator Ludwig is also right on that point, as was the minister in the observations he made in question time yesterday. Those demands are significant and they are dynamic. That is the nature of the environment in which the AFP are policing. They review the resources and the personnel they need to meet those demands. On the basis of that ongoing review and—ironically, in light of some of Senator Ludwig’s observations—on the basis of the access that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and members of this chamber have to deal with the AFP on these questions, there is not a need to refer this matter specifically to a parliamentary committee. This government has quadrupled funding to the AFP since 1996 and, as I have demonstrated, it has increased personnel numbers in that process. The government’s commitment is to ensure that the Australian Federal Police have both the resources and the personnel they need to meet domestic and international obligations.
It is pertinent to note, perhaps, that there are other interesting organisations that do not appear to agree with Senator Ludwig’s proposition in relation to this reference. The ABC earlier today reported that the AFP Association has rejected the views put forward by Senator Ludwig and does not share the concerns that the force is struggling to attract new recruits. In fact the AFPA’s Jim Torr is reported as saying that he is confident that the federal government’s promise and commitment to boost numbers means that this is not the issue that is being presented in this chamber tonight. The ABC quotes Mr Torr as saying the federal government has just very recently made a ‘commitment for 400 more police into the AFP’. Mr Torr said that upon delivery of those numbers the issue would be put ‘beyond any doubt,’ and that the government had ‘made a commitment of around half a billion dollars to bring the members up to that level.’ The piece goes on to say that the AFPA said that it ‘is confident that the recent funding boost by the federal government will help the force meet its recruitment targets’. So not even the industrial association that supports the AFP is supporting this supposed reference in this chamber this afternoon.
I want to make some brief reference though to Senator Ludwig’s assertions—and in my view they are little more than that—that the government has in some heroic manner done away with the accountability requirements of the Senate. I think that Senator Ludwig said that the system was under constant sabotage, and that included the estimates process—an observation that I find interesting as I spend more hours with Senator Ludwig in an estimates room than I do with members of my family during most weeks. Hundreds and hundreds of questions are put on notice and questions taken across the table are put to agencies like the Australian Federal Police in estimates meeting after estimates meeting and are answered comprehensively in as timely a manner as possible. That did not change in May and it will not change in November, so that is not an accurate representation from Senator Ludwig as to the way in which the committees will work.
The senator asserts that the government is of the view that scrutiny is not good. If the government were of the view that scrutiny is not good, then we would not provide members of the committee with access to the Australian Federal Police, as we so often do, not just through the formal hearing process but also in an informal environment where constructive discussions and exchanges can take place and where members of the opposition can avail themselves of the opportunity. Members of the opposition do not appear to complain about it at the time. We would not invite the AFP and its associated agencies at the most senior levels to spend hours and hours in committee environments in public hearings, with material on the record, government and opposition senators asking questions and senior officers of the AFP answering those questions constructively and willingly if this government were in the business of avoiding scrutiny. We just would not do it. Why would we? That is what puts the lie to the assertions that Senator Ludwig makes this afternoon about avoidance of scrutiny and about constant sabotage of the system including the estimates process. It is simply not demonstrable on the evidence, particularly in relation to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. As the chair of that committee both in its new incarnation and previously, I absolutely and totally reject that. There is no question to the best of my recollection or knowledge that those opposite have ever been denied the opportunity to pursue matters of concern to them in relation to AFP policing and the associated issues.
I think that this notice of motion perhaps belies a desperate search, if you like, on the part of those opposite to find something constructive to do. It is not necessary to pursue it in this way. The committee has plenty of work to do. The committee gives those opposite plenty of access in relation to the Australian Federal Police, as do the minister and the government. I have never heard the Australian Federal Police decline an opportunity to appear before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee either formally or informally. I am sure that position will not change, notwithstanding the change in the committee process. For those reasons and the matters to which I have earlier referred, the government rejects this proposal for a committee inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,15,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-12,"—Unless there is anyone else to speak, I will close the debate. We have now heard a half-hearted attempt to justify why a Senate inquiry should not be had into this. The government hides behind its own committee to say that there should not be an inquiry in this place. In the committee estimates process last time, this government, with little notice, took away the spillover days. If you do not think that they were a valuable contribution to how the Senate works and how the estimates process works, I would ask you to reflect upon what it means. It potentially means that significant hours are removed from the debate during a committee process. This means that questions that would otherwise have been asked, with time allowed for a response, have to be put on notice, and there is then a wait for a careful answer months down the track. Answers are provided—there is no argument about that. But if those on the other side do not think that the estimates process has been sabotaged as a consequence of removing the estimates spillover days in May then I would ask them to reflect upon what that has meant and how the government has managed the committee process through the use of spillover days, which were used for the purpose of hearing certain issues such as the Vivian Solon matter.
One wonders whether the issue of Vivian Solon would have come out if spillover days were not available to be used. When you listen to the defence that has been put up today you hear that matters that go to the Australian Federal Police, such as what might be called the ‘early review’, will go ahead. Is there a guarantee that that review will be public? Is there a guarantee that the Australian Federal Police will provide that to the committee? I do not know. Do the government know? I am not sure they know that themselves. Is there a commitment from the Australian Federal Police to make that review available to the opposition? I cannot answer that.
A Senate committee would allow the Senate to look at those issues and examine them. The issue of numbers might be raised. There might be open debate about whether the information you have from the government’s perspective is accurate; there might be debate about whether my information is accurate. It is from the portfolio budget statements, so it would be interesting if it were not accurate. It might require an explanation from the Australian Federal Police—which they could have an opportunity to answer as an aside.
Was there a narrowly or widely cast Senate inquiry? There was, but it was prior to 9-11 and the significant increase in funding to the Australian Federal Police. If you are going to use figures which refer to quadrupling the size of the budget available to the AFP, I ask the government to reflect upon that figure and give me the base and the figure it has quadrupled to. These are all issues that could be debated and examined in an inquiry such as the one I am proposing. This is broader than simply looking at staffing numbers, as I indicated during the primary debate; it also looks at a national focus between state and federal police. There was no response from the government in respect of that issue or the impact that increasing the Australian Federal Police would have on state policing.
If the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth government are truly going to play a national role in fighting terrorism, drugs, crime and fraud, and in deployment overseas, they should also consider the wider implications of their recruitment in the short to medium term. The inquiry would also look at that, but there was no response from the government on that—there was no response from the other side in respect of that matter. Why? Because there is no argument against it. There is no argument to justify why a Senate inquiry would not be able to look at all of those issues and have access not just to the narrow focus of the Australian Federal Police but also to others who can make submissions, provide views and inform the Senate of what they think—not simply what the AFP might think or, for that matter, what I, Labor or other members of the committee might think—are the issues at hand. The strength of a Senate inquiry is to draw other submissions and parties into the debate to provide information and explanation. To discard that strength is to throw away a significant amount of scrutiny that this government would otherwise have. It is a poor response to say the AFP make themselves available—of course they do; they make themselves available to the legal and constitutional legislation committee now referred to as the standing committee. But that is not the point of an inquiry.
The point of an inquiry is to provide a much broader view, and everybody here knows that. In terms of the Australian Federal Police Association—I will not go to the specifics. To the senator who at least quoted from the document: look at where it mentions the reference to a review by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee or perhaps go there. I ask you to consider whether that is a viable position to advocate.
The broader issue is whether or not, after 9-11, the Australian Federal Police should have a broader inquiry into matters that go to national policing. There are, as I have argued, primarily cogent reasons why the Senate should have the ability to look into state and federal issues from a national and an overseas perspective. There is a strong argument for why this is so. To say that this place, since 1 July 2005, has continued to remain accountable in the same way that the Senate has been in the past is short-sighted and belies the figures that underpin it. When you look at the number of references that this government has accepted, the number of gags and guillotines shortening the debate, the number of amendments during committee stages and the shortening of Senate inquiries looking at particular legislation, you have to say in sum total: this government avoids scrutiny where it can. This is another example of this government avoiding scrutiny where it can.
Question put:
That the motion (That the motion (Senator Ludwig’s) be agreed to.) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,COMMITTEES,15,2
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—A couple of questions have been rightly asked in this committee stage debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006—and I now intend to answer them—about what happens if the independent volume falls below 25 per cent. Senator O’Brien put it that this would cause trauma in the market—if the independent portion of the fuel fell below 25 per cent, imagine the trauma that that would cause to the major oil companies! The major oil companies would have to reorganise all this stuff. I agree: if the independent section of the market fell below 25 per cent we would have a major problem, because it would mean that the overcentralisation of the oil retail market was absolutely imminent. It is about to happen.
We have drawn a line in the sand at 25 per cent because you have to draw the line in the sand somewhere. Somewhere in life you have to make a stand. Somewhere in life you have to stand up and say, ‘No, we can’t allow it all to go to the major oil companies and the major retailers.’ So, yes, it is a line in the sand, and it is there for a purpose, because below 25 per cent we know that the end is nigh. And when the end is nigh there are ramifications for the price of fuel. We will lose fuel discounters in the market. The price leaders in fuel discounting belong to the independent sector. Everybody acknowledges that. I do not know how many inquiries we have been to—umpteen?—where they have asked, ‘Who are the price leaders in discounting?’ and the answer has been, ‘The independents.’ The independents lead price discounting.
Beyond that, if it goes below 25 per cent, we will know there has been a disenfranchising of the Australian people of their right to be in the retail trade. We know that that manifest right that we hold to be so dear—your right to be in business—will be lost, if this goes below 25 per cent, from yet another sector of our economy. I will be saying to my kids: ‘No, you won’t have the opportunity to be the owner of your destiny, to be the owner of your business, because that was lost, that was in the past; in the past they put in legislation that actually protected that, but it is there no longer. You can have other jobs—you can work for one of them, but you cannot actually own and operate one. You used to be able to be in the grocery market, you used to be able to own a fuel station—you used to be able to do a range of things, but you can do those no longer.’ So there is a specific line there. Yes, if it falls below 25 per cent, there will be traumas for the major oil companies, but there will be a far greater trauma for the Australian people. I think it is right that this parliament draws a line in the sand.
We also heard that it is totally unworkable. Who told you that? We have a sites act and a franchise act that have been around since 1980—26 years—and all of a sudden you are won to the argument that something that amends them is totally unworkable. You have swallowed the line that that proposition is totally unworkable. Why would it be unworkable? We do not know what your argument is, but you are swallowing the line that it is unworkable because it suits your purpose and your purpose is predetermined. I suppose you can say anything today.
The thing is that it is not actually unworkable. It is totally workable because the current amount of fuel that is being utilised by independents—‘What are independents?’ they ask; well, they are actually defined in here—as advised by the NTAA, is around that margin, and that will not cause a problem. So it is a workable proposition. If it serves your rhetorical purpose to say that it is not workable, I suppose you can say that, but it is just not the truth.
They ask: ‘What is an independent?’ It has been clearly set out here: it is every service station that is not operated by one of the oil majors or one of the major retailers. In the future, if issues change, surely we have the acumen in here to change with them. Not for one moment do I say that the Oilcode does not need amending—of course it needs amending, but amending in a form that protects the right of the Australian people to go into business. That is how it needs to be amended. What we are going to get is an absolute approach that knocks the complete stuffing out of the independent sector. Where will they go? What protection do they have? What are we offering them? If we say we are a party of small business, let us put our cards on the table—let us show it.
If you own a small business and you are watching today, it is going to be a bit hard—the Labor Party are not going to support you; that is completely evident. Maybe they are proving their credentials to the big end of town. Maybe that is it. Maybe families have to realise that that is the price you pay: you will not get much support around here anymore. But it is a shame. We could make some minor changes to this that would make a clear statement that we take the role of small business seriously.
I suppose that, after this, there is going to be nothing to stop Coles and Woolworths buying up more stations. There is going to be nothing to stop BP taking over independents. I know that, as soon as leases become available in the appropriate areas, they are not going to renew them. They are not going to renew a lease in a valuable corner of the market to an independent, to a family—they are going to take it over themselves.
There are no guarantees in here of supply to regional towns—none. There is no guarantee that, if the company so wishes, they cannot just decide: ‘You’re an inconvenience, town of Surat. You’re an inconvenience, town of Tambo. We don’t need to supply you fuel.’ What do we say about the social structure of those towns? What do we do? Do we just say: ‘Oh, sorry, it’s just that we had to get the support of the major oil companies. We had to show our credentials for the next election. Tambo: you have to understand our position—we’re in a terrible position’? So we say to them: ‘If you want to go to the doctor, I suppose you’ll just have to catch a bus, get a lift or hitch—if you can find someone else.’ The fundamental concept of a pensioner having a fuel station in their town? We are moving past that. So it is going to be an interesting vote.
There is an amendment here. I can read the tea leaves. I know which way it is going to go, obviously, but there is an amendment here that would protect some of those rights, that would make a statement that, even if it is not perfect, at least we are making an attempt to look after them. If this is not the right attempt to look after the independents, I am willing to take suggestions from other people around the chamber as to what that attempt should be. It is a free debate. We are in committee—you are welcome to stand up, have your say and tell us how we are going to protect the independents.
—The Oilcode.
—You are welcome to stand up. You have a chance after this—in fact, I look forward to your standing up, Senator McGauran, and putting your position on the record. That would be a brave thing to do. So we are going to hear from Senator McGauran. He is going to tell us how the independents are going to be protected and how we are going to deal with this issue of protecting families in regional towns. It is going to be an interesting debate. I think I should let him have his say.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I cannot let Senator Joyce misrepresent reality, let alone our position, in relation to his amendment. I really think that Senator Joyce should sit down and read the proposition that he has put before the chamber and attempt to understand it:
… not less than 25 per cent of the volumetric supply of petroleum products in the market—
which I take it means the whole national market—
within each calendar month is available only to prescribed independent fuel retailers.
Is there a crystal ball to tell the suppliers that this is the cap and that they can supply no more to the so-called non-independents? Or do we take the liberty of saying that, if the major companies lease their stations and enter into a contract to supply their oil to an independent operator, they are then an independent? This has so many holes in it that it makes swiss cheese look like a very solid object. It is, as I said before, a prescription which is probably incapable of enforcement. I do not know what the enforcement is intended to be, looking at the amendment, but I just cannot see how this can be enforced. I say again: if Senator Joyce wants us to seriously consider this proposition, he is going to have to do more work on it rather than putting up the sort of proposition that he has put up. Frankly, the corporate world, if they wanted to, living under this proposition, could shoot holes in it.
Senator Joyce is apparently making an honest effort to do something, but he should not castigate people for not being prepared to vote for something which is demonstrably unenforceable, which demonstrably cannot lead to the outcome that he is talking about and which demonstrably, if it were interpreted as strictly as he would like us to believe it could be interpreted, would lead to some petrol stations and possibly some towns being denied fuel. It would lead to shortages in the country. As I said earlier, it would be like the Soviet command economy in some parts of the country, where the supply of fuel, depending on the predictions that the suppliers made, would be cut off because there would be a fear that they would exceed the 75 per cent limit on those companies set out in subclauses (4) and (5) of the proposed clause.
We notice sometimes that these statements are made when we are on broadcast, and if Senator Joyce needs to make those statements while we are on broadcast so be it, but please do not misrepresent our position and make things up to make your argument. If you have some facts we are happy to hear them, but I have not heard many so far.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-09-12,"—I have heard much better attempts by the Labor Party to cover its defence of the big oil companies and the big end of town than that one. Senator Joyce has brought forward a prescription for keeping independent petrol dealers in the business and is looking to the interests of small towns as a consequence of that. It shows he has a bit more experience there than the Labor Party. The first thing to be said about this is that the Labor Party, on my reading of it, is going to defend the cross-media ownership rules from changes proposed by the government, and that is all about percentages. That is all about sections of the market. That is all about how many media outlets big corporations can own. It restricts them from the city right through to the smallest places in the bush. So Labor is defending a prescription for what is, if I heard Senator O’Brien correctly, a Soviet style—
—No, I didn’t say that at all. I said we weren’t going to vote for it.
—He does not like it much, but the fact is that when it comes to the media you can have restrictions on the big corporations to defend the number of outlets but apparently when it comes to petrol you cannot, and that is nonsense.
—No, this is not about the number of outlets. It’s about volume.
—That is total nonsense.

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—Senator O’Brien is not taking this too well.

(Senator Troeth)—Order! Senator Brown, you have the floor. I will ask you to continue, and if Senator O’Brien wishes he may make a response later on.
—He is talking about volume. He needs to turn his volume up if I am to hear it—and I should not listen to it, should I, Chair? Thank you very much. The fact is that we in this country have lost track of the fact that parliament is here to look after small business. Parliament is here to look after those people who are prepared to set up shop in small towns to sell essential services. Parliament is here to look after people who are prepared to go with less—because that is what it means in the bush, in terms of income—to be part of a community, to service that community and, as result of that, as Senator Joyce was saying, to keep other entities and communities going. But the big parties have over a number of decades now simply pandered to the market as a whole range of small businesses got squeezed out.
I can remember being in the Tasmanian parliament when there was a perfectly good roster system for petrol stations in Tasmania—and Senator O’Brien will remember this. The local petrol stations in Hobart, Ulverstone and Launceston were on a roster system. This meant that family proprietors could get home to their families on weekends. Where you could go to get your petrol was in the daily newspaper, so you drove to one of the on-roster stations. And it worked well. The oil companies did not like that, I can tell you. They wanted a seven days a week grind for the business. They got their way. The legislation was brought in, this system was knocked out and now the big oil companies are serially buying up the independents, often simply to close them down as nothing else replaces them, and aggregating their petrol outlets.
In an age where we are concerned about the consumption of fossil fuels because of the huge impact it is having on the environment, we will end up with people from Tambo driving to the next biggest town, Longreach, to get their petrol. Either that or they will have to store it back in Tambo. The same applies to small towns. It is in the interests of these big petrol corporations; efficiency and profit is what they are about. So they close down the small businesses and make the public come to the centralised place. And of course when you get there you have groceries and a whole range of other goods, which deny other small businesses the ability to survive.
You can mischievously call this ‘Soviet command’ economy and ‘centralised’ economy. But that is what the big oil companies are into: centralising the economy in downtown Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and so on, with the profits going there, and everybody in the regions having to do what they say. I agree with Senator Joyce on this because I think it is this parliament’s responsibility to look after the people of this country and not leave it to the Stock Exchange and the big oil companies, who are preponderantly foreign owned.
A good debate is being had here, but the lowest common denominator would be to say: ‘Senator Joyce, your legislation’s got holes in it. There’s going to be difficulty if that is passed as is.’ That is not the argument. The argument being used here is that Labor and the government do not like the sentiment that Senator Joyce has brought into this chamber.
If there are problems with the wording of this amendment they can fix that. That is not the argument; that is a spurious argument. The reality is that they do not like the sentiment that 25 per cent of the product should be kept for independents. Whether you fix the figure at 20 per cent or 30 per cent or even 10 per cent, there should be some line. I have heard the argument that, if enough independents get out so that there are not enough to supply 25 per cent, woe betide us. Do we not have the facility to come in here and look at that situation and debate it again? Of course we do.
You do not legislate by buying in all the possible problems in the future. Parliament legislates for now, with the ability to come back and fix up things if new contingencies arise. So the sentiment is right. It is an honourable sentiment. It is a sentiment that is good for the people of Australia, particularly for regional Australia, and it deserves to get more support.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—The argument put forward by Labor would hold water if I could go through this pile of papers on my table and find the Labor amendment that talks about the protection of independent petrol station owners. But I have been through it, and it is not there. Maybe they do not feel that it is important. We have heard their protestations about why this amendment is not good enough. But their amendment is not there. They do not believe in this. It is a convenient argument to say, ‘Your one’s not right.’ But if my one is not right, your one does not exist. Yours is just a blank sheet of paper: tabula rasa.
Labor do not believe in the protection of independents and are all over the shop. The next week you will be back talking about how you think there should be controls on the cross-media laws. You are Arthur one day and Martha the next. Make up your mind. What do you want? If you believe that we should be protecting against the overcentralisation of the media market, what has happened to you today? Do you realise how foolish you look? Yes, you are on broadcast and the public are hearing this. It is good that they are hearing this. It is good that the Australian people are hearing what a completely mixed-up, all-over-the-shop ship you are. In the next couple of days, every time we hear you talk about protection to stop the overcentralisation of the media market, we will just laugh at you because you are not for real.
You have had your chain pulled by the right people in town and you have listened to them. You are going to look a complete and utter fiasco: insincere, no-one can take you for real. You have gone through with this and you do not realise the bind you have got yourselves into. You have got yourselves into a hole that you cannot dig yourselves out of. I disagree with it. At least these people are constant: they believe in no regulation anywhere or any time. But you: you are here somewhere today and somewhere else tomorrow.
Maybe somewhere, coming up, will be the Labor Party amendment to protect the independents. Maybe it is still on the way. Maybe if we hang around here for a little while longer it will turn up. I would love to be a fly on the wall at your next party meeting. It is just going to be fur and feathers everywhere, because you have made such an absolute fiasco of this one. The Labor Party has no motion on the books to protect the independents, but they are going to charge in here next week and start talking about the protection of the media market.
The whole of Australia will read about this tomorrow. Even your arguments do not hold water. When you say, ‘What is an independent?’ it is there: the independents are the ones who are not the major oil companies and not the major retailers. It will work in a similar fashion, I imagine, to the way it works at the moment in the sites act and the franchise act. It is a case which I think we have the competence to deal with. I really do think that. I think we are smart enough to do it. If we can build this building I reckon we can manage this. I know I am going out on a big limb, but if there is something slightly wrong with it I think we have the capacity to bring it back and amend it. I really do.
The Labor Party are of the view that you legislate from now until eternity. Everything that happens now will happen for eternity. That is an interesting proposition to have. It would suggest that if they ever win government they will not change anything: if they are ever given the power they will never change anything. Maybe they think they are not capable of changing anything; maybe they think they have not got the acumen to change anything; or maybe they think they cannot go through a piece of legislation and suggest better changes. It will be a very interesting time.
On the record is the fact that the Labor Party are going to vote against this amendment. They will be voting for the bill. They will be voting for the major oil companies who pull their chain. They will say that it brings about a socialist type of economy, or some other palaver that they have just dreamt up because they have not had time to have a good think about it. Next week they will all be back in here and trotting out, one after the other, talk about the evils of cross-media ownership laws. Here they come. It is going to be like a circus. It is going to be the funniest show in town.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,—Would Senator Joyce let the Senate know whether an entity—who is not named in subclauses (4) or (5) of the new part to proposed section 51AE—that leases a site from one of those named companies in subclauses (4) or (5) and contracts with them to purchase petrol is a prescribed independent fuel retailer?,SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—It says ‘a prescribed independent fuel retailer means any fuel retailer except those operated’—‘operated’ is the key word there.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I can read, but I wanted to be sure of what you intended, Senator Joyce. So you would accept that, if the oil companies arrange leases to other corporate entities to sell their petrol at a price they nominate, they will be able to fill that 25 per cent that you say should be set aside for the prescribed independent fuel retailers and that there would not need to be any other entities in the market for that 25 per cent to be satisfied. Do I understand you correctly?",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—It is the obscurum per obscurius—‘to get myself out of here’—type argument. That is an interesting way of doing it. Let us make life so complicated that we cannot possibly do anything but throw up our hands and commit harakiri. The same argument is going to be quoted back to you on the cross-media ownership laws. Are you suggesting that the major oil companies will try to take over all the independents? Are you suggesting that all the independents are going to disappear and that oil companies would devise such a plan? Pray tell, where would you get ideas like that from? That cannot be right. The Labor Party cannot believe the sentiment that all the independents are going to disappear. Are you suggesting that the oil companies would be so clandestine as to devise ways of pushing the independents out of business?

Senator O’Brien interjecting—

—If you are suggesting that, you should be suggesting a way to protect the independents. Rather than talking about the affliction, you should be thinking about the cure. It is an interesting approach to take. We will have a whole raft of these obscurum per obscurius suggestions of how we can possibly get around something that is quite simple and painted in black and white.
If the major oil companies or the major retailers operate the site that has been noted as a lease, then it is not written in stone. At some stage in the future, they can change it, amend it or do what they like to it. They are not the independent sector of the market. This amendment is the only suggestion that we have here at the moment. We looked at the Democrats amendment. Family First have put up some good suggestions, and there are possibly others to come forward. However, I have not seen the Labor Party suggestions; they are not there. But we do get a lot of suggestions about what is wrong with protecting independents.
That is what you are talking about today: what is wrong with protecting independents. It is because you do not want a socialist type economy; you want one that is controlled by about two organisations. Instead of big government controlling the world, you are quite happy for a couple of organisations to control the world. You do not believe in the freedom of people to go into business, and you are not going to protect them. It is quite obvious that you do not; otherwise, you would have put forward an amendment. I have answered your question, but I am waiting for the next obscurum per obscurius type suggestion—and here it comes.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I thank Senator Joyce for referring to the Democrat amendment that he thought was a constructive attempt to deal with these matters. I would remind Senator Joyce that the Labor Party moved an identical amendment, but he had walked out of the chamber and did not vote for it. This was after he had voted for the Democrat amendment. So I am not surprised that he has forgotten that the Labor Party had a proposition which was in identical terms to the one that he supported that was supposed to deal with some of the competition problems.
—Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. He said it was ‘identical’. I do not think it was.
 (Senator Troeth)—Senator Joyce, you will allow Senator O’Brien to explain and then, if you wish, you may respond.
—Senator Joyce is technically correct. There was an additional proposition. However, Senator Joyce is apparently saying that he did not want the ACCC to be empowered by a vote of the Senate or the committees of the Senate to inquire, but he has some prescription in his next amendment about petroleum products price monitoring. The senator asked what the Labor Party’s proposition was. In essence, on the competition model, it was identical, word for word—
—No, it was not.
—Yes, it was. In relation to the competition model it was identical, word for word, with the Democrat motion that he supported. If the senator conveniently forgot that, I am here to remind him.
If we put up some serious concerns about his proposition and he cannot deal with them, so be it. But for him to castigate the Labor Party because we cannot vote for a proposition that demonstrably will not have the effect that he is talking about is just grandstanding. Senator Brown came into the chamber to take advantage of the fact that we were on broadcast. He made a contribution, but clearly he did not understand that the proposition that we were putting forward was about a volumetric control on the market, not a control on the number of sites. He changed that during his contribution, so I accept that he has corrected the way that he had approached the matter.
But, frankly, the Labor Party’s position on this legislation and on competition in this industry stands up to every bit of scrutiny. The fact that we do not put up a proposition of this nature because we think it is unworkable does not demonstrate that we do not think small business has a role in this industry. We think that small business has a role in this industry through a proper competition regime. That is why we put up the amendments that we put up. Those amendments are in many respects amendments which have been requested by the ACCC to give them a stronger hand to deal with the competitive regime. The government voted against them. Senator Joyce voted for them when they were moved by Senator Murray, which therefore demonstrates that, to that extent, he supported the Labor Party proposition. So it is a bit bizarre for him to suggest that we did not have a proposition in relation to competition to assist small business in the industry. If he wants to imagine that that is the situation, I cannot dictate what goes on in his head, but I am here to tell the Senate and the Australian public that it is a fantasy.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—They are obviously in a spot of bother, aren’t they? You can see that they are in a spot of bother. Rather than going down this red-herring path, let us get back to talking about independents. But we will deal with the issues so they do not say we are avoiding them. Senator O’Brien has said that his amendment was identical, word for word, to the Democrat amendment. That is either going to be the truth—and I will check—or it will not be the truth. I stand to be corrected—I will read it—but I do not think it is. Nonetheless, let us go back.
First of all, if that is the sentiment then I have supported it. I have voted for it. I crossed the floor on it. You cannot support it much more than crossing the floor to support the sentiment. Secondly, the Democrats actually approached me—they rang up, went through it and well and truly discussed the issue. You have well and truly discussed this issue right now, so do not try and use that as an avenue out. You are telling me all the things that you think are possibly wrong with it, and we are proving you wrong on all of them, but the only thing you are proving to us is that you have never actually come up with an amendment to protect the independents. You have come up with an amendment to protect—and we have laid it on the line; in fact, I crossed the floor to bring about the Dawson review—provisions in the Dawson bill. So I am on the record there as well. I crossed the floor to support your sentiment then, and I also crossed the floor on the other issues—I voted with you to protect small business on the other Dawson provisions by taking out the mergers and acquisitions power. So my position is pretty clear on the record. I think everybody in Australia knows that.
Your position is also totally clear: you have absolutely nothing on the table, not one amendment, to protect independents, to protect regional towns and to protect the freedom of people to go into the business. You have nothing. What you have on the record is the fact that, when required, the Labor Party will play to the tune of the major oil companies and if they have to walk over a few bodies on the way they will do that. We know that absolutely. If they have to make hypocrites of themselves by calling for a certain argument, they say, ‘We must let the market reign supreme today, but—wait for it—next week our views will be different.’ But I am going to sit back, because you really have got my interest. I am going to grab your amendment and the Democrats’ amendment, and I am going to check them word for word. If they are word for word correct, I will happily stand up and say, ‘Yes, they’re word for word correct,’ but I have a funny feeling that they will not be.

(Senator Troeth)—The question is that amendment (1) moved by Senator Joyce on sheet 5045 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-12,"—It has been a very interesting debate to sit and listen to. We have heard a lot of discussion about the support for small business and also for regional Australia. I was fascinated to hear Senator Milne talk about her place in regional Australia, with her vantage point from the third or fourth floor of the Marine Board Building overlooking Constitution Dock in Hobart—but perhaps it is about perception from one’s own point of view. I do not think too many of us would consider that to be—
—Wow, that was a strong point, that one!
—And I might move to Senator Brown’s comments about the petrol market in Tasmania. It confounds me how little the Greens know about what is going on in their own state, particularly in relation to a range of issues we saw during the discussion on marine protected areas—in fact, the lack of engagement from the Greens in relation to marine protected areas surprised me. I heard in my conversations with the fishing industry, with whom we work very closely, that they never met with the Greens. The Greens did not seek a meeting with the fishing industry in relation to marine protected areas.
In relation to fuel sales, it has only recently been announced that Mobil sold all its sites in Tasmania to an independent, to United. So there has been a significant change in the market in Tasmania in favour of the independent sector. I think one of the largest petrol stations in my home town of Devonport, which sells fuel from Ampol Caltex, is a privately owned, independent service station. In relation to the rostering arrangements, that particular business took the opportunity to open 24 hours, seven days a week, and that is one of the things that has made it a successful business. It has taken advantage of the operation of the market. In fact, in the last two years, it has been one of the Prime Minister’s employers of the year for employing people with disabilities or people with return-to-work issues.
The Greens get up in this place to make comments about what is happening in their own state—quite sadly, uninformed statements. It is perhaps pertinent that Senator Brown has got up and made those uninformed statements on a day when parliament is broadcast and there is an opportunity to let people in my home state know that there are inconsistencies in the comments that the Greens put on the record. I also refer to the comments that Senator Milne made about her being in regional or rural Australia from the vantage of the capital city, in the centre of Hobart.
Commenting on the protection of independents: the mandatory Oilcode already contains provisions which will prevent wholesale suppliers from unreasonably refusing supply. That provision is currently in the legislation and provides the support that Senator Joyce in particular is looking for in relation to independents. If you consider the comments that I have made about where things are going in Tasmania, you will see there are movements in the retail sale of petroleum in regional Australia, in particular regional Tasmania, towards opportunities for independents and independent supply. In fact, the price of fuel in Hobart is very low at the moment, based on the competition that is being put out by the supermarkets and also on the entry into the market of the independent sector through United. That has made a significant difference to the price of fuel.
In relation to government support for the small business sector, as we discussed earlier in this debate, the government has already announced its intention to strengthen section 46 and it is very keen to see that legislation introduced as soon as the Dawson bill has passed through the parliament. We hope we can do this in a timely manner. We have already had one crack at it. We would like to see that done so that we can get those protections in place. We have a very clear and obvious view that we would like to see measures such as a small business capacity for collective bargaining. That is quite clearly contained in the provisions of the legislation that we have brought to this place once before. Obviously, we have a position on that and we would like to see it passed. That is our intention: we would like to see that passed. So I think it is a bit disingenuous for people to get up in this place to talk about our lack of support or otherwise for small business or for regional Australia.
One of the concerns that I would have about this amendment of Senator Joyce’s is that there is going to be a significant cost attached to monitoring and processing this whole deal. And guess who is going to pay? Regional Australia will pay the cost or the independent sector will pay the cost, because it is going to be applied, quite reasonably, to them. So much for the effect of trying to keep fuel prices down, which we have talked about in this place today! There is going to be a negative impact on that through the very significant red tape that will be tied around the proposals, such as those being discussed by Senator Joyce in this particular amendment, particularly in a climate where we are looking to reduce the amount of red tape that applies to the overall market. So there are some pretty significant questions that need to be answered in relation to this.
Senator O’Brien has raised, quite correctly, some of the very practical matters in relation to the operation and allocation of market share through the 25 per cent of the volume of fuel proposal that has been included by Senator Joyce in this amendment, but I think that it goes even deeper than that. There is no question that the independent sector will be made less competitive by a process such as this, because it will pay the cost. The cost of monitoring and the cost of application and the cost of managing this whole process will be applied, quite reasonably, to the independent sector. That is just a fact of business.
If, as Senator Joyce is implying, this is largely about small country towns in regional Australia, then the effect of this is that he will be imposing additional costs on fuel in those small country towns. I know that is not something that he wants to do—I do not apply any motive to him in that respect—but, in the context of this amendment, there are a range of issues that should have been much better thought out. I do not think that they were explained to either Senator O’Brien or the chamber effectively enough when he was putting this particular amendment to the committee.
So the government will not be supporting—and the opposition has expressed its opposition—this particular amendment. I think Senator Joyce already understood that that might be the case, but obviously he is intending to continue with his amendment. It is quite obvious that there is a range of practical and also business based issues that need to be resolved for this proposal to be effective and, quite frankly, I do not think that they are resolvable, particularly some of the issues that Senator O’Brien has raised in relation to allocation of the 25 per cent quotas. I think that really does create some very difficult situations. Senator Joyce really should have given some deeper consideration to the particular elements of this amendment before it was brought before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-09-12,"—Senator Colbeck does tempt one to look a little bit at his and his party’s record in Tasmania. I remember a couple of elections ago when at state level they promised they would protect shopping hours because there were hundreds of jobs at stake. But within six months of the Liberals getting in they had broken that promise and hundreds of jobs went west as a result.
It is interesting that Senator Colbeck has been supporting tax breaks for the huge combines which want to put in plantations, closing down small businesses—small farmers, potato growers and dairy farmers—right across Tasmania. They do not get the breaks but Gunns and the big plantation owners do—that is what Senator Colbeck supports. It is interesting to note that, when I brought legislation in here to have fair labelling so that ‘Made in Australia’ meant made in Australia, Labor and the Liberals voted down the anticheating legislation, so that people in supermarkets see ‘Made in Australia’ and buy a product thinking it is made in Australia when in fact very often the ingredients are not. Of course that puts farmers right across Australia at a disadvantage compared to the big combines, the multinationals who bring in cheaper produce from elsewhere around the world.
When it comes to the fishing industry, Senator Colbeck did not know that the government had in mind some reserves around Tasmania, and he was not consulted. When the government announced it, there was a backlash and he found himself in front of protest meetings by fishermen, trying to explain it and change it around. The Greens were not involved in dumping that without consultation with the community, but the government was, and he can defend that as best he can.
Everywhere you look in Tasmania, the Greens have a superior record to that of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in defending small operators, locally owned businesses, small farmers and small producers. But what is germane at the moment and what is testing the big parties—and what they do not like—is Senator Joyce’s amendment to give the independents some protection against the expanding market share of the big companies. When it gets down to it, they are not arguing against the rationale, because they know they cannot defend their position on that. They are arguing with the wording of his amendment. Senator Joyce has said, ‘Well, fix it up.’ The time-honoured practice is that, if there is a good amendment and it is accepted by the government, we pass it. If there is to be a terminological change to it or a closing of loopholes, that is done in the other place, it is brought back here and we accept it. That is the way it goes with private amendments.
There is a spurious debate going on here by the Labor and Liberal parties. They oppose this amendment. They oppose protecting the independents in this way. We will see that in the vote in a moment. When all is said and done, it is the vote that counts. Senator Colbeck can get up and take on the Greens. I am happy to debate him, because in the end he will lose on who defends small business and on who looks after Tasmanians at home. We can really get into some good debates on that—I would welcome it—but this is not the place to do that. We are debating Senator Joyce’s amendment, which has merit. I have not heard either Labor or Senator Colbeck state that they do not support the merit of his amendment. They are saying that it is not written the right way, it is not this and it is not that. That is a spurious argument. They are either defending the protection of independent retailing, which this amendment goes to, or they are not. And the truth is that they are not.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—I am not going to be pedantic, but it just goes to show: what have turned up here are the Democrats’ amendment and Labor’s amendment. Senator O’Brien, you are not right, mate. This part is in yours, and you can see that it is not in theirs. It is different. You cannot come in here and say that they are word for word, that they are exactly the same—everybody here heard you say it—when they are not. You are telling porky pies.

(Senator Troeth)—Senator Joyce, please address your remarks through the chair.
—Madam Chair, they brought these two sets of amendments in here and they are both on the record; they are quite obviously different. We all heard Senator O’Brien tell us they are exactly the same, word for word. They are not. The reason he says that is that he does not know what his own amendment is. He is just saying it for the purpose of the argument. He comes in and talks to me about my amendment, but he obviously does not know, word for word, what his was. That is fair enough. I know which way you are going, so we will not pursue it. You have had your chain pulled, you are voting with the big oil companies—good luck to you, God bless your cotton socks, off you go.
There is a belief that there are some big independents in Tasmania. Great! If there is a big number of independents in the market, then this amendment will have no effect and you will not have anything to worry about. This amendment only kicks in and has effect if there is not. It is the parachute if there is not.
Talking about parachutes, we have heard about the passage of the trade practices amendment bill No. 1. Give us protection so that before we jump out of the plane we have got the parachute on, and you will get that through. But do not tell us to jump out of the plane without strengthening section 46 and a range of other things when you leave people vulnerable. It is simple logic: get the parachute on before you jump out of the plane.
The other argument that has been brought up by Senator Colbeck is this case of red tape. When in doubt, say that the red tape will cause an increase in price—that is the line. It is like we have just arrived at Kafka’s palace and we are going to be subdued with red tape, and some poor old lady will be staying up until three o’clock every morning vigorously typing away as she monitors fuel services. I do not think it is like that at all. I think it will be easily handled. Companies that can handle things such as GST, diesel fuel rebates, grants schemes, tax returns, compliance measures and occupational health and safety officers probably have the capacity and the aptitude to handle this. We are talking about the major oil companies that sell fuel here. I think they have the capacity to know whether there is a fairly good suggestion that less than 25 per cent of their sales are going to independents. I am going out on a limb on that one, but I reckon I am going to back myself in. I reckon they can do it. If they can refine fuel, turn oil into petrol and get the sulphur content right, I reckon they can handle this. This idea that that will be moved on and, all of a sudden, the price of fuel—we are using Tambo or Surat—is going to go through the roof specifically because of this amendment is not correct.
Let us suggest there is a cost component. What is your choice—no fuel? Is that what we are going to put up instead? Are we going to say, ‘We do not want you to have the administrative component and the costs incurred with this process, so we are going to give you no fuel at all’? That is blatantly ridiculous. That is an absurd proposition. If the choice is nothing or the administrative component, I will take the administrative component every day of the week, to protect our position. Once more, what came out so clearly in the committee stage of the debate is that the Labor Party accused me of not understanding my own amendment when they obviously did not understand theirs and they have gone on the record saying something that is completely and utterly wrong about something they wrote themselves.
If we have got a strong independent sector, you have got nothing to worry about, because this amendment will not have any effect; the problem will be fixed. It is only there to protect you if it falls. As for the argument about red tape, I suppose it will do, but it is not right, because it is not going to sink the boat. If your choice is a slight administrative charge or no fuel at all, I will take the slight administrative charge.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-12,"—I hesitate to take up additional time, but if Senator Joyce was being accurate he would have reflected that the difference between the opposition amendment that I moved from sheet 5028 and that which was moved in a later prepared sheet—sheet 5038 revised—is identical in clauses 1 through to 6 but that we had a seventh clause which deals with a different matter. If Senator Joyce recalls, what I said was that we are identical on those matters and we inserted a provision in relation to the monitoring of prices. If Senator Joyce wants to hear what he wants to hear and try and make an argument from what he wants to hear, that is fine. I am satisfied, having put that on the record, that the amendments are identical to that extent and that is what I reflected—which was that our amendment in that respect was about the protection of small business and competition. That is all that I was attempting to put on the record. I will not be misrepresented. Frankly I do not think that it does any credit to have addressed the matter in the way that Senator Joyce did.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,16,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-12,"—We can go back to the Hansard and check exactly what you said. I am sure you said word for word, exactly the same. If that is the case then I support the Democrats amendment if it is word for word. That is all that needs to be said. It means that ultimately I have supported what you wanted.

That the Senate take note of the document.
Because of the size of this report and the fact that it has only been tabled today, I will speak further on it later, but, given the recent increase in the amount of public debate about housing affordability, I think it is worth drawing attention to it. I very much welcome the fact that there is some wider public debate about the problem with housing affordability in Australia. It is very timely to have this report on the Housing Assistance Act and the annual report for the last financial year. It has appeared more quickly than previous reports—although it is still more than a year past the relevant financial period—and that slight increase in speed should be noted.
When we are having these debates—and I hope that we continue to have debates about how to make housing more affordable and more secure in Australia—it should also be emphasised that it is not just a matter of interest rates. It is fine to recognise the role that interest rates can play—and we all make our political points about who has the best or worst record on interest rates—but interest rates are just one component of the housing market and the different types of housing available in Australia.
This report goes to the operation of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, which basically deals with public and community housing. The level of political attention to this area of housing is, sadly, very much diminished at state level as well as at federal level in recent years. It is now seen almost as a subsidiary welfare housing approach and as playing a residual role. I believe that is a great shame, because it has shifted from an era when it played a much more central role—although not sufficient in its own right, as no specific model is sufficient in its own right—in ensuring that Australians have the opportunity to afford a roof over their heads and, without chewing up the vast majority of their incomes, just keeping themselves in a home. We must continue to remember that, first and foremost, housing, as a policy issue, should be about ensuring that all Australians have access to secure, safe and appropriate housing.
As housing also is an investment for many, it is appropriate to have a debate on the wider issues of people’s rights and opportunities but the value and the direction of the property market should not take priority over the core issue of affordable housing. The property market itself, of course, particularly inasmuch it relates to the private rental sector, also has a role to play. So, not having had time to study the report in detail, I simply welcome the fact that it shows the important role that public and community housing does still play and that that should be a part of any proper systematic debate about affordable housing in Australia.
We saw the Productivity Commission bring down recommendations following our inquiry into the affordability of housing for first home owners a year or two back. We have seen the Treasurer repeatedly complain in recent times that the states did not pick up any of the recommendations of that report. He was perhaps right to point to that failure but, as he conveniently neglected to mention, nor did the federal government pick up any of the recommendations of that report that affected the federal sphere. It is time we moved past this selective blame-shifting and buck-passing approach to affordable housing and looked at all aspects of housing provision. That should include more attention being given to the very efficient role that public and community housing can play in ensuring affordable housing. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2006-09-12,"—The UNFPA last week launched its report State of world population 2006, a matter of some interest to a number of us in the chamber—in particular, Senator Moore. The report is entitled A passage to hope: women and international migration. I was very pleased to be involved in a very minor way with the launch and the associated seminar held in this building last week by the Parliamentary Group on Population and Development. I congratulate the leadership of the group, its members and the staff of the Australian Reproductive Health Alliance on their assistance in bringing that event about.
Although it is not often acknowledged, over half of all international migrants are women and children. That seems like a fairly obvious statistic but it does not often make up part of the popular debate on the question. And often immigration policy and debate ignores the specific rights and needs of those two groups in particular—ironic, given that, in so many cases, they are the most vulnerable parties in the migration process. Their concerns will be specifically taken into account when governments come together for the first-ever UN meeting on international migration and development in New York later this week.
The number of people living outside their country of birth has almost doubled during the last 50 years, reaching 191 million in 2005. And today, as I said, nearly half of all international migrants—over 94 million individuals—are women. They remain largely invisible in debate and policy, yet they outnumber male migrants in most regions of the world, and that includes the major destinations of Europe, North America and Oceania.
Well-managed migration, on any analysis, can be a win-win situation and more so, I think, when the contributions of women and children are maximised. Migrant women and children can be responsible for energising the economies of both their destinations and their countries of origin. It is interesting to note that female migrant workers contribute substantially to the more than $US230 billion in official remittances world wide as of 2005. Those are the funds that they send back to their countries of origin. This money can lift families and communities out of poverty, raise standards of living, improve education and health care for children and provide for impoverished ageing parents. Even much more fundamentally, it can serve as an investment to start up businesses, build houses and build community infrastructure.
It is true to say, without exploring this too far, that men and women spend very differently. When women control the use of remittances, they usually spend the money on their children before they spend it on themselves. They send a higher share of their earnings home than their male counterparts. But they still face discrimination. They face limited power when it comes to making financial decisions, or accessing credit and banking services, or even owning property and land. And that, consequently, limits their possibilities for investing in productive, income- and employment-generating activities.
Female migrants also contribute to the quality of life and productivity of what are known as ‘receiving countries’. They make payments into the tax collection and pension systems. For example, you might find that nurses—overwhelmingly, female nurses—migrate to fill critical health shortages in wealthier countries, many of which have ageing populations that further fuel the demand for their services.
It is fair to say, though, in any analysis of this very compelling report, that migrant women face double discrimination across the world, both as women and as migrants. Many, especially those who are low skilled, are subject to violence, are the victims of sexual exploitation, and are subject to poor working conditions and low pay. They often suffer from poor reproductive health and heightened exposure to HIV-AIDS.
Through the focus on women, this UNFPA report has paid particular attention also to the impact of trafficking upon women and their global movements. The realities and needs of migrant women highlight the persistence of poverty and gender inequality and the very dark side of this aspect of globalisation. Women may be desperate to find work, to look after their families and to maintain themselves, even if it means relocating to another country, and they end up being very easy prey for traffickers. Many trafficking victims are often very young women in search of employment, and they may also have children to provide for.
Trafficked women, it is clear from the evidence, are usually forced into sex work, hard domestic work or even sweatshop labour. Sadly, human trafficking is the world’s third most profitable criminal business after traffic in arms and drugs, and is a major source of organised-crime revenue. It is estimated that $US7 billion to $US12 billion annually is generated, which only reflects profits from the initial sale of persons. Once victims are in a destination country, traffickers are reported to net an additional $US32 billion a year, according to the assessments of the International Labour Organisation.
Between 600,000 and 800,000 women, men and children are trafficked across international borders each year, mostly for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. Of these, the majority—up to 80 per cent—are women and girls; in fact, up to 50 per cent are children.
These are the very heavy human costs of the dark side or the downside of migration, but they can be averted. It will take stronger measures which will empower migrant women and protect their rights, and many migrant women are completely unaware of their rights. They need access to information in their own languages to understand their legal entitlements and where they can seek support or protection or recourse to justice. Often, migrant women refrain from using health services or reporting abuse. Culturally sensitive community outreach programs and services, especially those targeted to reproductive health and rights, HIV and gender-based violence, are able to encourage and support them in making use of available resources that are critical to their safety and wellbeing.
Married women, whose visa status might even depend on, perhaps, an abusive husband, may be caught in what is known as the ‘dependency trap’. They fear that reporting an abuser in that situation can result in losing their visa sponsorship, or their custodial rights where children are concerned, and they can be unfairly forced to choose between their own safety and the risk of deportation and losing their children.
Migration is an extraordinarily complex issue. But one thing is clear, from this report and from so many other experiences: gender does play a key role in shaping the migration experience. In that story, though, women’s concerns and rights have remained mostly outside the purview of public laws and policies because so many abuses can be hidden in private homes, in workplaces and so on. What the report makes clear is that it is really time to make visible the invisible and recognise the very significant role that women play in international migration.
At last week’s launch of the report and the following seminar, Amanda Vanstone, as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, made some remarks. It is important that her observations in relation to the women at risk visa which Australia provides be reported and reproduced in the Senate. That was a visa which Australia introduced in 1989 in recognition of the priority given by UNHCR to the protection of refugee women. It is a visa specifically for female applicants who are subject to persecution or are registered as being of concern to the UNHCR. To qualify, an applicant needs to be outside their home country, to not have the protection of a male relative, and to be in danger of victimisation, harassment or serious abuse because of their sex. In my own office, I have explored this as a result of representations made to me on behalf of women in various parts of the world.
These women are granted permanent resettlement in Australia. They are eligible to receive a range of settlement services on arrival. They are given priority access to torture and trauma counselling services to help them rebuild their lives. That reflects some of the areas of challenge which I identified in my earlier remarks about the difficulties faced by many migrant women, particularly those who come from circumstances of crisis.
In 2005-06, a total of 995 visas—or almost 17 per cent of the total number of refugee visas in Australia—were granted to women at risk. That brings to over 7,000 the number of women at risk that the program has helped since its inception. I think that is a very important aspect of our humanitarian program.
I want to finish with some remarks about a visit I made some two years ago to Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya with two colleagues from the lower house. It is an extraordinary place where men, women and children every day face remarkable challenges. Meeting with the chairladies of the Kakuma refugee camp, who have taken upon themselves the coordination and leadership for the women in that area, showed me what can be done by the strength of women in most extraordinarily adverse circumstances. They were women of which to be proud.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>United Nations Population Fund</title>,ADJOURNMENT,18,1
