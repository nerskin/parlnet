That the amendments be agreed to.
Amendment No. 1, the government amendment, changes the commencement date of the bill from 1 July 1999 to the date of royal assent. The bill was due to commence on 1 July 1999, but the passage of the bill was delayed due to the backlog of legislation in the Senate. To avoid an unintended retrospective element, the bill will commence from the date of the royal assent.
With respect to amendments 2, 3 and 4, these are opposition amendments agreed to by the government and remove the family business linkage requirement that was designed to protect the interests of third-party members of a self-managed superannuation fund. To be honest, the government's preferred position is in the original bill. However, the amended bill will still ensure that all the members of a self-managed superannuation fund are trustees of the fund. It will also prevent one member of a self-managed employer sponsored superannuation fund from being an employee of another member of the fund except where they are relatives.
The government considers that, despite these changes, the bill will continue to improve the ability of members of self-managed funds to protect their own interests. On this basis, the government is prepared to accept these amendments, which I now commend to the House.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration has indicated, the government has agreed to Senate amendments to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 . It is not a very frequent occurrence that the government accepts opposition amendments and I suppose that on that basis, if no other, I would like to reflect on this a little.
We have ended up with a compromise situation concerning the issue of the structure of the do-it-yourself superannuation funds and 
 those who can be members of these funds. We did not accept the government's endeavour to effectively remove third parties altogether. We now have a compromise arrangement where, if you are going to be a member of a fund, you have to be a trustee. We also have a situation where employees will not be members of such funds. So we think that introduces another element of protection. There has been some concern that this could be used in a coercive way by employers.
The amendment that we moved and that the government accepted will ensure that workers are protected and that same sex couples are not discriminated against. The amendment will ensure that costs to excluded superannuation funds are kept to a minimum. It follows the finding of the Senate Economics Committee that the government introduced bill would have caused increased complexity and confusion for members, trustees and administrators of do-it-yourself funds. We believe that removing the requirement that members must be related ensures that many funds that may have had to fold up under the government's original legislation will now in fact survive, and it ensures that same sex couples are not discriminated against. We think that we have created more flexibility for existing do-it-yourself fund members and trustees, while allowing some arms-length members currently in do-it-yourself superannuation funds to continue with the current fund arrangements.
I make the point that once again it is Labor which is standing up for superannuation and retirement incomes. We have resisted and rejected other government attacks on superannuation and superannuation funds and we have acted in the Senate to protect do-it-yourself superannuation. I take this opportunity to issue a plea to the government, as it has considered our position in relation to Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) and we have been able to come up with an agreed outcome concerning the structure of the do-it-yourself funds, to think about, at the same time, Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4). We are concerned that its proposals for change here will create real difficulties for the small businesses which operate do-it-yourself superannuation funds.
I point out to the House, for example, that Philip Holt, the Managing Director of Australian Business, is on the record as saying that his members have commented that the inability to access superannuation funds for legitimate investment activities may force them to retrench staff and reduce outlays on innovative products and processes, and that the government has created massive confusion by waiting over 15 months to introduce this legislation and yet, after some three rounds of changes, still not having the support of small business.
We also have a situation that, while the government is amending the investment rules to make them tighter in some areas, it is letting some other small funds invest 100 per cent of their funds in one risky investment. So we have some ongoing concerns in this area of do-it-yourself superannuation, and we do hope that the government is prepared to examine these concerns when this legislation comes before the House.
The other issue that I think the government needs to be considering while it is looking at this is the question of the terms of reference of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services and the issues that it is going to examine. We had an extraordinary situation earlier this year when Senator Allison moved a motion to re-establish the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation with terms of reference which would examine the adequacy of the superannuation guarantee and the present complex superannuation taxation arrangements. That motion was waved around the superannuation industry as evidence of the Democrats' commitment to superannuation, and the government and the opposition were challenged to support it. In fact, Labor did support it and we proposed a couple of extra terms of reference for the committee. Those extra terms of reference could reasonably be described as the tail of the dog. What in fact has happened, now that this motion has come back, is that the tail is still there but the dog has disappeared.
The government never did like Senator Allison's proposal to examine the taxation treatment of superannuation, for example, 
 which would further expose, amongst other things, just what a disaster their superannuation surcharge has been. What is extraordinary is that Senator Allison has meekly acquiesced to the government by gutting her original terms of reference. Labor moved for the Senate superannuation committee to have terms of reference much like those that Senator Allison had originally proposed. (Extension of time granted) Extraordinarily, she and the other Democrat senators voted against the motion, which was in essence her original motion. Frankly you have to ask yourself just how much further up the government the Democrats can get.
The defeat of Labor's amendment in the Senate reveals quite starkly the fact that both the Liberal Party and the Democrats have no genuine interest in promoting superannuation and planning for decent retirement incomes for the millions of Australians presently in the work force. I am most concerned that the Senate superannuation committee does not have the sorts of terms of reference that Senator Allison originally proposed for it. The terms of reference originally proposed in Senator Allison's proposition were:
(2)	 The committee inquire into and report on:
(a) 	 the adequacy of the tax system and related policy to address the retirement income and health care needs of Australians into the new millennium;
(b) 	 strategies for building more effective national retirement income and long-term savings outcomes;
(c) 	 reforms that could be implemented following the completion of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge phase-in to 9 per cent.
(d) 	 the taxation of superannuation, particularly the Superannuation High Income Earners Tax Surcharge legislation and alternative payment mechanism . . . 
All those terms of references (a), (b), (c) and (d) have effectively disappeared, and the Democrats themselves and the government have rejected our attempt to reinsert those sorts of terms of reference. We are most disappointed at this. We feel this does not augur well for the Senate committee's work on superannuation. We hope the government rethinks this issue in the same way it has been prepared to rethink the legislation before the 
 House in relation to the structure of do-it-yourself superannuation.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to comment on the acceptance of the amendments moved by the Australian Labor Party which make the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999  fairer and better for small business and better for superannuation. These amendments stop discrimination against same sex couples, as one of the objectives was to raise that aspect of the legislation. The amendments will allow do-it-yourself funds to be set up with same sex partners as trustees of the fund, whereas the original legislation that the government brought before the House would have specifically excluded same sex couples. The government went out of its way to entrench discrimination in the original bill. I also participated in that debate.
I am pleased the government has chosen to accept all of the Labor Party's amendments to this bill. It is unfortunate that Senator Kemp, the minister in the Senate, put on record his reason for accepting these amendments. He stated:
We still prefer the approach the government took but the government recognises we do not have the numbers.
So it has nothing to do with principle, equity, fairness or improving superannuation funds. It is that the Australian Labor Party, with the support of the minor parties in the Senate for our amendments, had a majority on the floor of the Senate. When I spoke to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999  on Monday of this week, I indicated that, if the government failed to take up the opportunity to support my private member's bill on the Superannuation (Entitlements of same sex couples) Bill 1998 —which has been before the House for almost two years—I would be moving an amendment to a future SLA bill to ensure that discrimination was removed.
The fact that the government has accepted, however reluctantly, do-it-yourself funds for this legislation shows that, at the end of the day, it accepts that change is inevitable. It accepts, with regard to superannuation, that the current discriminatory provisions are 
 unacceptable to those people who have same sex partners, to the superannuation industry and to bodies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which, under Commissioner Chris Sidoti, handed down a report—tabled in this parliament—that showed it was contradictory to a number of conventions of the United Nations and also of the International Labour Organisation.
So the government has been dragged kicking and screaming towards a bit of reform and a bit of recognition for what is appropriate at the end of this century. I am pleased with this breakthrough and I congratulate the shadow minister, the member for Wills, and also Senator Conroy for pursuing fairness and equity on these issues. The shadow Treasurer attended the launch of a petition by the Body Shop about removing this discrimination. The theme of that campaign was `Same sex; same rights'. The shadow Treasurer in lending his support to that campaign also showed the substantial support there is from the private sector for equality on this issue.
I am pleased the government has accepted these amendments. I am pleased that reform is occurring and that discrimination is being removed. However, I remain dismayed that the government cannot even show a bit of goodwill by saying, `These are good amendments.' Instead, it resorts to saying, `It is just because we did not have the numbers.' That shows exactly what this unfair, uncaring, discriminating government is all about.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—The honourable member for Wills traversed a wide area, well removed from the substance of the amendments currently before the chamber, and no doubt there are more appropriate fora to address the matters he has raised. I place on record that the government is strongly supportive of the principle of superannuation. The fundamental goal of the government, in introducing this bill, is to ensure that the regulation of small superannuation funds reflects the needs of members of such funds as well as the government's retirement income goals. 
The honourable member for Grayndler constantly speaks in the House in relation to same sex partners. For his approach to be adopted, there would have to be a whole of government approach and, again, what he was saying does not directly apply to many of the provisions of the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999  before the chamber. I commend the Senate amendments to the House.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—In the time allocated to me to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  I will cover two basic points: firstly, the research infrastructure funding and, secondly, the issue of the phasing out of the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. The issue of research and development funding is causing some concern in Western Sydney. The federal government's research infrastructure program has two major components, and I quote from the Bills Digest  No. 39 1999-2000:
.	 the Research Infrastructure Block Grants Scheme which allocates grants to publicly-funded univer 
 sities on the basis of their performance in obtaining competitively awarded research funding; and
.	 the Research Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities Scheme which supports large-scale initiatives, usually involving two or more institutions.
The Commonwealth also supports research infrastructure through the research quantum, which is an element of the operating grants received by the institutions. The research quantum is allocated to universities on the basis of their research performance. This is measured by the complex index that encompasses their input, which is the success in attracting research grants from government and industry, and their output, which is the number of publications and research degrees completed.
The University of Western Sydney has written to Western Sydney MPs expressing concern about the impact of the Commonwealth green paper on research, new knowledge and new opportunities. UWS is of the view that the implementation of the green paper in its present form would do enormous damage to the university's research effort. According to the University of Western Sydney, the green paper would cripple their research and training program by reducing the number of highly qualified postgraduate students, supported directly by the Commonwealth or via the university, from 1,000 to a bare 280.
The UWS correspondence states that the green paper would make it close to impossible for talented researchers from Western Sydney and beyond to study for a research degree between Strathfield and the Blue Mountains. To emphasise the apprehension that the University of Western Sydney has about the green paper, I quote from its correspondence:
The green paper's dramatic impact on the university's research effort will also do immense damage to economic growth in greater Western Sydney. In just ten years since its foundation, UWS has built a $10 million per annum research program.
The university wins this income by successfully competing against universities with far greater resources built up over generations. It is a great achievement that places UWS in the top rank of young universities around Australia and generates 
 real economic and employment gains for the people of our region.
For example, the BHP materials testing laboratories are planning to relocate from Melbourne to UWS, which will make greater Western Sydney a world leader in new building technologies.
Despite this and many similar achievements the green paper specifically punishes UWS by cutting our operating grant and research funding. On current information, UWS will suffer an on-going loss of $2.3 million.
This is a one per cent cut on existing funding and by 2005 could reduce our government income by $11 million.
The UWS correspondence concludes by stating that the green paper transfers resources from young universities to older institutions that have had decades to build up their resources. The correspondence says:
It is an attack on the new in defence of the old.
I now call on the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs to ensure that the recommendations of the green paper are not introduced to the detriment of education research and employment opportunities in Western Sydney.
There are some other education issues that need to be mentioned. For example, a recent study of 120,000 students  who had started an undergraduate degree in 1992 indicated that 40 per cent had not completed their degree after five years, and one-third had dropped out completely. The study showed that the group most likely to drop out, in many cases, are older or disadvantaged students and students with lower university entrance marks. These people would have incurred a debt under HECS for their uncompleted studies. This is placing an unfair burden on these disadvantaged students. In the interest of fairness and equity, a case could be made out for the Commonwealth to pick up the tab for disadvantaged students who have originally met all the entrance requirements but are not able to complete their degree.
While the number of students from disadvantaged groups have increased in real terms, their relative representation has declined in recent years. The proportion of students from rural, isolated and low socioeconomic status backgrounds declined between 1991 and 1997. These groups, as well as indigenous 
 Australians, remain underrepresented in higher education.
In June of this year, when speaking on the budget matters in this House, I referred to the phasing out of the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. In this speech I said:
Another decision contained in this budget that will hit low income people in Western Sydney is the withdrawal of funding for the Merit and Equity Scholarship Scheme. This scheme was set up surprisingly enough by this government in 1996 and it was a good scheme. It provided exemption from HECS fees for financially disadvantaged students who were desirous of continuing their education which may have been interrupted by illness or lack of finance. There were some 146 students studying under this scholarship at the University of Western Sydney, which is the second highest number in Australia. The equity category under which students could apply for this scholarship were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, lower socioeconomic status, language other than English, women in non-trade studies, rural and isolated, and disability. In 1997 there were 63 applicants for this scholarship at the University of Western Sydney, in 1998 there were 120 and this year there were 85.
I referred then to the fact that this decision underlines the continuing underrepresentation of various equity groups in higher education. I know that many people were impressed by the table in the Bills Digest  on this issue, but I believe many were also depressed by what the table brought to the surface and the groups that would be disadvantaged.
I pointed out in June that decisions such as those I have referred to, while saving $39 million over the next four years, would in fact close the door to hundreds of low income earners, stopping them from pursuing a university degree. Over the many years since the early 1970s, Australians have known that rank and circumstance have absolutely no effect on the ability of talented young people to obtain university degrees. Prior to 1973, young people were excluded from university simply because their parents could not afford to meet the costs of higher education thus denying them the opportunity to achieve the advantages that a degree might bring to them.
When the Australian government finally recognised that education must be available to 
 all citizens irrespective of financial or social status, we began a great adventure. In the space of just four short but very painful years, the government has turned that expectation on its ear. This government's education policies are designed to ensure that education is, once again, the province only of the children of wealthy and socially successful parents. As a representative of the fastest growing area in Australia, in Western Sydney, I lodge the most strenuous protest about these policies, as they are going to have a very bad effect on the opportunities for many young people in my electorate and in other electorates in Western Sydney.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  sets out the maximum amount for operating and other grants to higher education institutions. It varies the amounts already legislated under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 for 1999 and 2000 and it inserts an amount for 2001. It also sets the maximum funding level for expenditure on the international marketing and promotion of Australian education and training services by Australian Education International for the 2001 funding year. The bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act to make provision for the funding of 60 medical places at James Cook University for 2001 and it provides funding for science lectureships of $14.7 million.
That is not the part of the act that I want to specifically address in my comments today. First of all, I want to speak a little more generally about funding trends in relation to higher education and, secondly, and most particularly, about the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme, which is being defunded under this legislation. To start with, I think it is important to recognise that the Australian Bureau of Statistics, when it released its Expenditure on education report on 17 September this year, noted that, in this government's first two years, total Commonwealth expenditure on education decreased by more than $500 million—from 1.99 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 1997-98. University funding specifically has fallen by a massive 12.7 per cent—from 0.94 
 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to 0.82 per cent of GDP in 1997-98.
When we look at those funding cuts, I think dollar figures are perhaps the most striking illustration. In the first Howard budget $840 million was taken out of university operating grants. The HECS burden for university students was increased by $1.1 billion. TAFE funding was cut by $167 million, $128 million was ripped out of public schools and student assistance was cut by half a billion dollars. Universities are finding that they have to shift the costs of education to students via the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and up-front fees because of the government's neglect of the tertiary education sector.
In 2001 the real level of Commonwealth contributions to operating grants will be about the same as it was in 1983—yes, in 1983, more than 15 years ago—although student loads will have increased by 57 per cent. Universities are being expected to do a lot more with a lot less. That means much larger class sizes than are manageable, it means run-down libraries and it means academics with workloads they find very difficult to manage. The Commonwealth contribution to operating grants per equivalent full-time student unit will have declined by 37 per cent between 1983 and 2001. Commonwealth grants will drop below 50 per cent of university revenue in the current triennium. This is similar to the proportion that existed before the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the funding of tertiary education in 1974. There has been a real decline in per student funding, resulting in emerging issues such as declining teaching standards, lower progression rates, postgraduate courses being little more than undergraduate courses with a fee, a reduction in the maintenance of infrastructure and equity and access issues.
Turning to equity and access issues, I do not think we can ignore what is happening now to the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. This scheme was introduced by this government; indeed, I am able to quote from a media release on 9 August 1996 by Senator Vanstone, the minister at the time, in which she announced the establish 
 ment of these HECS-exempt scholarships targeted at disadvantaged students. She said:
These measures are aimed at bringing higher education within the reach of ordinary Australians. They are a practical demonstration of the Government's real commitment to fairness and equity in higher education.
This practical demonstration of commitment certainly has not lasted very long. In 1997, 1,000 scholarships were offered, and this was to build to a pool of 4,000 by 1999. So it has barely begun to operate before being disbanded. I think, as the former minister said, it certainly is an illustration of this government's level of commitment to equity and access in higher education to be disbanding this scheme just as it is really beginning. The types of students who have been accessing these scholarships include indigenous students, women in non-traditional areas of study, people with disabilities, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, students from rural and isolated areas and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Of course, these are groups that must have better access to public education, particularly higher education, and they are dramatically underrepresented in the figures at the moment.
While the absolute number of students from these equity groups may have increased in the last few years because of the growth during the 1990s in the number of people participating in higher education, the proportion of students from these backgrounds has actually fallen, and it is this proportion that is significant for us to have a look at. For example, looking at the 1997 figures we see that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—who make up 1.7 per cent of our population—account for only 1.3 per cent of our student population.
 Looking at the number of students from rural backgrounds, isolated backgrounds and low socioeconomic income backgrounds we see that the numbers have fallen since 1991 from 18.5 per cent to 17.4 per cent for students from a rural background, from 1.9 per cent to 1.8 per cent for students from isolated backgrounds and from 15 per cent to 14½ per cent for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Minister Kemp said in his second reading speech that this scheme:
. . . had little impact on encouraging people who would not otherwise have enrolled to attend university.
I think that is a little unfair, given that 3,000 students received benefits of up to $5,682 per annum from this scheme and that the phasing out of this scheme actually reduces the money allocated to equity access in universities by $7.8 million in the year 2000 and by $10.4 million in the year 2001. Those thousands of people who have attended university who otherwise would not have would certainly disagree with the minister in saying that it has had little real effect.
Turning to issues of quality, it is important to note that the government has encouraged universities to offer a lower standard of teaching by encouraging them to overenrol students in order to receive the funding necessary for them to survive. The government pays an extra $2½ thousand for each undergraduate above the number allocated to each institution. Dr Kemp said in his second reading speech:
This makes it economic for universities to utilise any extra capacity they have. On early estimates for 1999 there are 36,000 undergraduate places that will be funded on this basis.
That actually means that 36,000 students are taking up places that have not been adequately funded, using university lecturers who are already overburdened and libraries that are poorly maintained and cramming into buildings that are stretching at the seams.
Funding arrangements have not always been expressed in the most transparent manner. In late August the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee was forced to access freedom of information laws to see a series of academic and consultant papers prepared for the minister relevant to university funding. All of the reports were commissioned by the Research Evaluation Committee, which includes members from DETYA and the Australian Research Council. In the past, the reports from the Research Evaluation Committee were published as a matter of course to help foster debate and ideas.
When Dr Kemp became the minister he ordered that they not be released without his approval. The majority—a total of six major 
 reports—have not been released, and this was reported in the Financial Review in August this year. The most important report was by David Phillips about university infrastructure requirements. The Phillips report surveyed universities about the best way to disburse infrastructure funding. Its recommendations were withheld from the freedom of information release, but it is understood—from leaks from the department reported in the Financial Review—that the recommendation strongly opposed abolishing the block grant scheme. Yet for the years 2000 and 2001 the research infrastructure block grant total is zero. It totalled $98.3 million in 1998 and $85.3 million in 1999.
It is a sad state of affairs when we see a minister bent on destroying the capacity of universities regardless of the information that is coming to him from the universities and from the people who are commissioned to report on these matters. The reports were commissioned externally because the department's capacity to undertake this research has been depleted due to funding cuts in recent years. While this bill contains a number of measures that Labor is prepared to support, we must remember that it comes after constant attacks on higher education from this government, years of decline in funding and a university system which has been stretched to its very limits.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I am very pleased to be involved in this debate today on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 . This bill implements the measures on higher education announced in this year's budget. I must say that, in researching this speech, I really wished that I had been around to enter into the debate on the budget measures of the last two or three years under this government because that is when serious damage was done to our higher education sector in this country. I am seeing the effects of that in my electorate, and I would have loved to have had the chance to have my say at the time when those very serious cuts were being made. It is not quite as drastic this time around, but there is no hiding from the fact that the government certainly has put higher 
 education in this country into a very serious decline.
Education is certainly a priority for the Labor Party. We are greatly committed to the proper funding of our universities to ensure quality of research, quality of teaching and quality of outcome for students. Also, a very important part of our philosophy and our policies are those measures that guarantee students equity of access to higher education. After entering parliament last year, one of the things that struck me while listening to the first speeches of the new members was the consistency of that theme—that education had been a major part of each one's development and that we put a lot of emphasis on that in terms of our own lives and careers and, having come through that experience, that we had each committed ourselves as members of parliament to making sure that those opportunities were available to all Australians, now and into the future.
Sadly, the government does not share our passion for education. We have seen that demonstrated over the last few years with $840 million being cut from higher education during that time. It has been manifested in cuts to operating grants for universities, amongst other things, and also in changes to the HECS system and to the assistance that is available to students. Today, I would like to talk about what I have seen in my electorate as a result of those cuts being made to funding to universities. I will speak specifically of the university in my electorate, Central Queensland University, but I will start first by talking about how those cuts have affected the students in my electorate.
In that context, I turn to the measure set out in this bill which deals with the abolition of the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme. On a number of occasions during this debate we have been told of the background of that scholarship scheme and the fact that the funding cuts introduced by this government in 1996 came in league with increased HECS charges for individual students—up to $5,682 per year for some courses. Also, there has been a lowering of the threshold for repayment to a mere $21,334. This is a huge burden on students both when 
 they enter education and when they try to meet those debts when they leave the institution.
These measures are emerging as a serious disincentive for students who are contemplating tertiary study. I would like to take this opportunity to tell the minister about the types of students who go to Central Queensland University, the types of students who are being affected by these measures. He can then judge for himself whether or not he thinks the merit based equity scholarship scheme was of value to these students. Certainly the people I talk to at the university, the students and the staff, are unanimous in saying that it was very valuable as an incentive—both a symbolic incentive and also a very practical incentive.
First of all, in DETYA's own higher education report for the triennium, Central Queensland University is listed as having the highest proportion of students from low socioeconomic groups. I suppose I was not terribly surprised by that. But, even so, 40 per cent is a very high proportion. The counselling service at the university in my electorate conducted a survey of 1,000 students at the university just to confirm the impression it was forming when it was being swamped by students seeking assistance. It found in that survey that 65 per cent of students at the university have an income of less than $125 a week. That signals the lack of assistance available for students under this government and also that their parents are struggling and are not in a position to help them. Another interesting figure to emerge from that survey was that 60 per cent of the full-time students at that university are working at least 12 hours per week just to make ends meet and survive during their studies. Effectively, students are being penalised for studying; they are being penalised for seeking better qualifications, even though the work they are doing at university will ultimately enrich our own nation.
The second group of students I would like to talk about are rural students. Clearly, Central Queensland University is a very significant regional university and, as such, has a high proportion of rural students. That group, as shown by DETYA's own figures 
 from December 1998, has declined seriously since 1992. A recent study by the Centre for the Study of Higher Education was reported in a paper entitled `Helping prospective students make informed choices—equity and quality in student decision making'. That study examined the attitudes of students of school-leaving age towards higher education. It found that rural students were more likely to be of the impression that their families could not afford the costs of supporting them at university, that the cost of university fees may stop them attending and that there is no point in their going to university. The study found that rurality and socioeconomic status combine to produce the greatest educational disadvantage.
Those results are no surprise, but obviously there is no great compulsion on the part of the minister to try to address the findings of those sorts of studies—studies, I might say, that are backed up by the comments of people in my electorate. It is becoming quite common to hear people say, `We're just an ordinary family; we couldn't possibly afford university.' I think that is very sad.
The other group at Central Queensland University is first-time students. Seventy per cent of students at Central Queensland University come from families in which they are the first member to attend university. Central Queensland University is very proud that it provides for those students, very proud of being a regional university that is obviously making a big impact on our region in attracting people to it. It has a First Students Club to help support those students. The important thing about students who are the first members of their families to go to university is that extra incentives are very important. Those families often will be of that low socioeconomic status; also, they often do not regard university as a normal course of development but more as a privileged activity. I believe that the merit based equity scholarship scheme went a long way in trying to overcome some of that and in providing opportunities for students from lower socioeconomic families.
Central Queensland University has the largest number of indigenous students of any 
 university in Australia. It does excellent work in incorporating their needs into the curriculum. The culture of the university reflects the input of those indigenous students. The Good Universities Guide recognised Central Queensland University as one of the leaders in indigenous education.
Central Queensland University is very proud of its achievements in terms of equity and promoting education to those students in our regional community who might not otherwise consider the opportunity. It also takes very significant steps throughout all areas of the university to promote equity and support students who need extra support because of either slight disadvantage or significant disadvantage in their lives and in their ability to study without being affected by those equity factors. I have a great quote from one of the staff of the university, whom I spoke to yesterday, which was that it regards itself as an enabling university; it sees its role in our region as providing opportunities to people who may find themselves prevented from participating in higher education if it meant that they were forced to leave the region.
The merit based equity scholarships were seen by all levels at the university—by the counselling services, the student representatives, the equity unit and the vice-chancellor —as an important part of the university's commitment to equity because the university gave them a chance to offer opportunities to students from those targeted groups. In 1999, 66 students received those scholarships. Each of those students had multiple disadvantages in terms of the target sectors. There was huge demand for those scholarships. How the minister can stand there and say that the scholarships were no big deal, people were not interested in them anyway and did not see them as important, is beyond me. At Central Queensland University we had six applicants for every merit based equity scholarship. The demand was huge. Everyone I spoke to at the university saw the scholarships as a significant part of what was offered at the university in terms of equity.
I have spoken about the impact on individuals. The impact on our region is also very 
 serious. In Tuesday's Courier-Mail, I was sad to see an article which listed Rockhampton and the surrounding area as a vulnerable part of Queensland in terms of our future economic outlook. The Central Queensland University is a very important part of our future. It allows individuals to see higher education as an opportunity that they can take advantage of. It means that they can improve their qualifications and then use those qualifications to stay in our region and build our future. The university is building fantastic partnerships with our local industries and businesses to play a leadership role in our community. I am very disappointed that the minister has, so far in his handling of this portfolio, failed to make a serious commitment to equity in education and recognise the important role that higher education plays in regional communities.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-09-23,"—I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  and set down a few of my concerns about the trends in higher education funding. I represent an electorate with a very strong tertiary education base, with Charles Sturt University and Sydney University, through Orange campus, providing a very wide cross-section of studies ranging from sciences, agriculture, nursing, communications, advanced policing, paramedical and education, to name but a few.
Distance education, as one might imagine, also figures strongly in the courses on offer from both these outstanding institutions. But the cracks are appearing under the strain of reduced access to funding. I know the full impact of changes to the HECS system are yet to flow through and enable further expansion of the higher education sector. I supported the changes in the HECS contribution when they were introduced, although I continue to seriously question the classification of some higher HECS courses, such as agricultural science, which has been an important and inhibiting factor on rural education.
It is one thing to place more financial burden on the recipients of higher education, it is another to, at the same time, withdraw Commonwealth funding in real terms from the 
 sector. The government is planning to make a statement on broad funding issues later this year and I certainly hope it takes full account of the recommendations of the West report. I would add at least one further one, which would be a scheme enabling those students who just miss out on youth allowance to be able to access low interest loans, backed by the Commonwealth, to enable them to undertake studies.
I have seen intelligent and keen young potential students miss out or have to leave university studies because they are simply unable to meet the cost and have parents who are unable or unwilling to meet these expenses. Children from broken homes or family split ups fall into this category when they are honest about family means and income. On the other hand, I have heard of students who arrange their affairs so it appears there are irreconcilable differences between child and parent or step-parent in order to access youth allowance. The system is still open to rort.
It is a fact that the Commonwealth funded student load has increased by 82 per cent since 1983. Efficiency gains have seen the operating grant per actual equivalent full-time student unit decrease by 20 per cent. So the institutions have made their efficiency cuts. While the HECS scheme will generate a significant increase in available funds in 2001, the real level of Commonwealth contribution to operating grants will be about the same as in 1983, although planned student load will have increased by 58 per cent.
As the Bills Digest so plainly states, `In terms of operating grants per planned equivalent full-time student units, the Commonwealth contribution will have declined by 37 per cent between 1983 and 2001.' The government will obviously say the increased HECS fees for overseas students, postgraduate students and domestic undergraduates have enabled higher education institutions to become much less dependent on Commonwealth grants. But there are some dangerous and worrying trends. I recently received a letter signed by 33 staff members of the School of Teacher Education at Charles Sturt University. It says:
We would like to draw your attention to difficulties currently being experienced in the Higher Education sector and specifically within the School of Teacher Education. As you would be aware the current Federal Government has reduced funding to universities by 6% since 1996. During this period there has also been one unfunded 12% salary increase for university staff and we are currently in rounds of enterprise bargaining for additional, and entirely reasonable, salary increases which again will be unfunded.
The dramatic decline in funding for tertiary education has meant a decline in the services provided to rural students, a worrying decline in the number of academic staff, increased class sizes and reduced time for research and consultancy.
Moreover, if this decline is not speedily halted and reversed, universities will find it increasingly difficult to attract high calibre staff. The school has recently lost two academic positions because of the funding cuts.
The current funding crisis has become increasingly problematic for academics, is stress-inducing and is affecting morale. We the undersigned would ask you to be a voice in the parliament for increasing funding to the higher education sector before the system falls into further decline.
If Australia is to become the clever country it needs to boost its investment in higher education. This applies especially in the case of teacher training given teachers are agents in the achievement of such worthy national aspirations.
Yours sincerely, Staff of the School of Teacher Education.
There may be some details in that letter which the minister may want to dispute, but the letter highlights the undeniable fact that the ratio of students to staff has increased an alarming 33 per cent in the past 10 years. Quality will undoubtedly suffer as institutions upgrade courses in the expectation of attracting higher fees. The results will inevitably be an inflation in credentials from both the universities and the TAFE sector as they both struggle for fees, among other things, to maintain staff salaries. If the trend continues, we will have highly credentialled but poorly trained graduates, especially in teaching, not unlike the American free enterprise mainstream university system, with their McDonalds degrees.
The other worrying trend, which cannot be explained away by pointing to increased fee revenue and increasing HECS revenue, is the question of equity and access. While the 
 number of students from equity groups has increased in absolute terms, their representation is declining. The proportion of students from rural, isolated and low socioeconomic status backgrounds has declined between 1991 and 1997, while indigenous Australians continue to be greatly under-represented in higher education.
The reductions of $18.2 million through the phasing out of the Higher Education Equity Merit Scholarship Scheme is a savage blow to rural and remote students. This is exactly the sort of subsidy, with some modifications perhaps for such students, that we need to avoid that slippage of representation which the figures so starkly show.
The government will say it surveyed universities through the department to see how effective the scheme had been. It was an informal survey. I will tell you how informal it was. No notes were taken, no papers were delivered, no statistics were collected; it was just a talk. And while there were concerns expressed about the way the scheme was offered by all sides—the government, the department and the university personnel—as an exemption from HECS, it was made patently clear during that so-called survey that the disadvantaged students needed the money up front.
In fact, I understand it was made very clear that the minister would not accept such a scheme. It was stated that higher education is too expensive for the most disadvantaged in our community and—wait for it—that any up-front payments would be an open admission by the government that higher education was and is out of the reach of equity groups. The minister was not prepared to admit that, and so there is no up-front assistance to 17- and 18-year-olds who do not need exemption from HECS but need to feed themselves from week to week, let alone get to university in the first place. That was the reason why the minister was not prepared to accept any sort of up-front process. If that anecdotal information is true, the minister stands condemned for that attitude because this is all about access.
I have argued consistently about the need for a low interest loan scheme to enable students from low income groups to access 
 higher education. I have also argued for the reintroduction of a Commonwealth scholarship scheme. There have been some moves in certain areas—medicine and so on—but I am talking about equity scholarships, with bonding if necessary. This is particularly applicable to the teaching profession, which I entered many years ago with the benefit of a teachers college scholarship and a three-year bond.
The government is quick to take on board the support of the National Farmers Federation for the business tax review. The Prime Minister has described the NFF support as `praiseworthy and lyrical'. Will the minister use the same words to describe the NFF's assessment of the University of Melbourne's report on higher education opportunities for rural and remote Australians? The NFF says the report `presents an alarming picture of the disadvantages facing country students seeking higher education'. The message is there. What premium do we place on higher education? Do we drive the economic wedge further between the haves and the have nots in education too? Forget the emasculation of social sciences, the arts and classics, and the corporatisation of universities. That is another issue for another day.
What I am talking about is equity of opportunity of access to higher education. The decline in opportunity for those of lower means is clearly demonstrated again in this bill and in recent policies of this government. I will be supporting the principle of the opposition's amendment in the second reading stage and look forward to substantial amendments in the area of access to higher education, by way of up-front funds, before this bill becomes law.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—I thank members who have taken part in the debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999 . As usual, the debate has been wide ranging—somehow even Badgery's Creek managed to sneak into this debate, but I think I will leave that without taking the matter further. This year alone through this bill the Commonwealth govern 
 ment will provide almost $5.6 billion to Australia's universities to support their teaching, learning and research work. The bill also makes provision for further funding of $5.7 billion in 2000 and $5.8 billion in 2001. This is a huge investment in the future of our young people and of our country.
The bill also delivers on the higher education commitments made by the government during the last election and announced in the 1999-2000 budget. The bill provides additional funding to the James Cook University for 60 medical places, which I am sure would be of particular interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl. This initiative honours an election commitment made in The best of health: a balanced plan for a stronger Australia and supports access to higher education for students from rural and isolated areas. It will have the end result of us having more rural doctors. This is about long-term planning to achieve just that.
The first intake of students is expected to start at the beginning of the 2001 academic year. In each year's intake five places will be earmarked for indigenous students and 15 for students from rural and remote areas. Our medical school in Townsville will also have improved health services in the local community as students will undertake their clinical training there.
The bill also provides $25 million over the period 2000 to 2002 for science lectureships. The initiative strengthens the important link between university and industry and fulfils a 1998 election promise. Development of graduates with the knowledge and skills to work in the emerging industries and technologies, particularly information technology and biotechnology, is vital for Australia's economic growth. The government anticipates that funding to develop innovative approaches to course design and delivery will enable universities to attract more school leavers into science courses and will help industry meet their education and training needs. The provision of additional funding for research infrastructure honours the government's commitment made at the last election to lift funding for research expenditure.
The government will provide an additional $93.3 million over the next three years to support research infrastructure in universities. Australia's higher education research infrastructure base underpins the success of our research performance. The government is investing in building and maintaining stronger links with the national innovation system. The bill supports the continued growth of Australia's education and training export through the provision of $4 million for 2001 for the international marketing and promotion of Australian education and training services by Australian Education International.
The government will be moving amendments to this bill. The amendments provide additional funds that will ensure that the holders of Australian postgraduate awards and Australian postgraduate awards (industry) are not disadvantaged by the impact of tax reform on prices. The increases to these awards are part of the government's commitment to ensuring that people on income support and related payments are more than compensated for the effect of the GST on prices. I commend this bill to the House.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1999  represents the third stage of the Wallis reforms. It is largely supported by the opposition subject to two substantial exceptions. Before I discuss those substantial exceptions, I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House condemns the Government for:
(1) 	 watering down the provisions which would enable the Treasurer to fully restore workers' superannuation entitlements which are lost through theft or fraud; and
(2)	 its continued failure to protect the accrued employee entitlements of working Australians"".  

I indicated that we have two substantial problems with this bill. The first relates to the government's attempts to water down the provisions which restore employee superannuation entitlements if they are lost in the event of theft or fraud. The second relates to the proposed provisions giving the Reserve Bank the power to exempt a corporation from complying with an information provision standard it makes under the Financial Corporations Act 1974. Indeed, Labor will be moving an amendment to make the exemption a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
The opposition will be moving amendments to this bill to address both of these issues, and our second reading amendment highlights this government's continued failure to adequately protect employee entitlements. Indeed, in this case the government's attack on the protection of employee entitlements is something we have seen time and time again, and this is another example. There is an old adage that you should not judge a book by its cover. In the case of the bill before us, this is an especially apt cliche. The short title itself appears to be innocuous enough—that is to say, the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1999—but what the long title reveals is an attempt by the government to yet again try and sneak provisions through the parliament which undermine the legitimate and hard-fought rights of working Australian men and women.
Those on the other side of the House are probably not even aware of what it is that their own government is seeking to do. If they were aware, I suspect they would be rather concerned. I want to spell this out to the House for their benefit and for the benefit of millions of Australian workers and voters. The long title of this bill is:
A Bill for an Act to amend laws, and to deal with transitional matters, in connection with the reform of the financial sector, and for other purposes.
Again, on its own that sounds fairly innocent but it is the `other purposes' part of this bill which contains a sinister, sneaky, watering down of the rights of eight million Australians 
 to have their accrued retirement nest eggs protected by legislation.
Schedule 9 of this bill contains amendments to the superannuation legislation relating to financial assistance to super funds. In particular, it contains reforms to the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993. Not many people will be familiar with this act as I understand that it has never been called upon. That is a good thing. It is a good thing because it shows that the prudential system of regulation that Labor put in place to ensure that superannuation savings would be safeguarded—held in trust in a secure environment, with employees and employers having a say in how they are invested—is working, and working well.
The Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993 was established by Labor to ensure that if a super fund containing the retirement nest egg of working Australians ever suffered a loss resulting from theft or fraud of the fund, then the Treasurer would have the power to apply a small levy to other funds to restore the moneys lost to the fund. This power is considered by Labor to be an important part of the protection of employee entitlements. So, if employees lose their superannuation moneys through no fault of their own, they are entitled to know that the government will step in and assist them to recover that money in full if the need arises.
The powers given to the Treasurer to levy the other super funds were deliberately broad to allow for the greatest opportunity for government assistance. The laws also place a collective responsibility on all super funds to ensure that the incidence, or even the suspicion of theft and fraud, is kept to a minimum. It is about Australians looking after each other, pulling together to make sure that our superannuation moneys are safe and sound. If the occasion arises, where moneys are lost through theft or fraud, it is about all of us making a tiny contribution to restore those superannuation funds that are lost. That principle has been an important feature of our world-class superannuation and retirement income system and it shows Australians for the compassionate people that we are. However, it does seem that not all Australians 
 think this way—and perhaps this includes the Treasurer.
I have mentioned that Labor introduced the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act to allow the Treasurer to impose levies on superannuation funds and approved deposit funds for the purpose of funding financial assistance to such funds that have suffered loss as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. The financial systems inquiry, or Wallis inquiry, apparently examined the provisions relating to the restitution of superannuation funds lost through theft and fraud. It concluded that a problem of what something economists call `moral hazard' existed. The moral hazard argument goes something like this: because members of superannuation funds have this levy arrangement to fall back on if their money is stolen, they will not appropriately keep an eye on their superannuation investments to ensure that they are not lost through theft or fraud. The Wallis committee accepted the moral hazard argument and recommended that the total restitution available to members of a superannuation fund which has suffered loss as a result of theft or fraud should be capped. They recommended that it should be capped at 80 per cent.
 Let me name the financial sector inquiry members: Stan Wallis, the former managing director of Amcor Ltd, now the deputy chairman—and former president—of the Business Council of Australia; Bill Beerworth, a solicitor and merchant banker and a principal partner of the corporate and financial advisory firm, Beerworth and Partners; Professor Jeffrey Carmichael, formerly a professor of finance at Bond University, now chairman of the Australian Financial Institutions Commission and chief manager of the Market Group of the Reserve Bank; Professor Ian Harper, who is director of the Ian Potter Centre for International Finance at the Melbourne Business School at the University of Melbourne; and Linda Nicholls, company director and adviser to Coopers and Lybrand, who has held senior banking and funds management positions in Australia, New Zealand and the USA. All these eminent, well-educated, well-remunerated people recommended that if a 
 fund falls over as a result of theft and fraud—which is likely to be in no way whatsoever connected with the fund members—the fund members should only be able to get back a maximum $8 out of every $10 that they lose. For those opposite who might like to refer to the Wallis report, that is recommendation No. 55.
I think that, on the issue of moral hazard, the Wallis committee failed to understand a number of important aspects. First, superannuation sits uniquely amongst financial products in the market, in that employers are encouraged through financial incentives to pay it on behalf of their employees. The extent of that financial encouragement is so strong as to amount to compulsion. That element of superannuation has essentially created the financial services industry in Australia. Indeed, without superannuation I suspect that the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation would not have a job because there would not be much in the way of financial services to regulate. The fact that superannuation is unique amongst all other savings vehicles means that it needs special arrangements to ensure that it is safe. It is different from the situation of the voluntary contributions. That is what Labor recognised when we established the levy arrangement, but it is something that the Wallis committee apparently did not understand.
Secondly, the moral hazard issue is minimised by ensuring that the trustees of superannuation funds, the people most likely to be aware of any suspicion of theft or fraud, are able and obligated to report such incidents to the prudential regulator. Fund trustees and administrators get together all the time at conferences and the like. I have had the opportunity to experience this first-hand. They get together frequently and they are much more likely than fund members to hear anything in the way of reports or rumours concerning shonky or unsavoury practices. They are the people who are likely to hear about these things. It is incumbent on them—and we need to maintain that incumbency on them—to make appropriate people aware of any potential problems. There is an incentive for trustees to do this—that is, to avoid their 
 fund being levied by the Treasurer to replace stolen funds—and trustees should consider that obligation to be a part of their fiduciary obligation to fund members.
The third point I want to make about the moral hazard argument is that we ought to be aware of the very cursory nature of the Wallis committee's examination of this issue. The report refers to this issue on page 359, and this is pretty much the extent of their consideration of it:
To minimise the moral hazard risk of such a scheme, it would be advisable to limit restitution to that necessary to restore the investors' funds to, say, 80 per cent of their value.
The language is unbelievably casual. There is no supporting argument about why 80 per cent is the optimum figure for limiting moral hazard, even if you do accept the moral hazard argument. It is as if the Wallis committee members simply plucked a number out of the air and decided to give it weight by including it in the report. That sort of cursory treatment should have appeared obvious to the government when it responded to the Wallis report. One would think that a compassionate government would have nothing to do with a recommendation which suggested watering down the restitution of something which is owned entirely by employees. But not the Howard-Costello government; not the `reform at all costs' Treasurer. The Wallis recommendation was accepted with relish.
We have read something this morning about the leadership credentials of the Treasurer and his view that he has only another budget or two left in him and then he would like to move on to something else—and it is pretty obvious what the something else is. But, if we are going to talk about leadership credentials, they have got to include compassion. Whether the issue is the GST or superannuation co-contributions or nursing homes or employee entitlements—which is the issue here—then the Treasurer needs to show leadership credentials which include compassion.
In the additional documentation tabled by the Treasurer in association with his statement to the House of Representatives in September 1997 in response to the Wallis report, the government accepted the recommendation to 
 limit restitution to 80 per cent of the entitlement of beneficiaries. There was no discussion by the government about how the 80 per cent figure was arrived at, no discussion about how employees would receive only $8 out of every $10 lost and, importantly, no discussion of the capacity of existing legislation to meet the Wallis report's main aim.
The existing legislation does not restrict the Treasurer from applying some sort of cap on the amount that is returned to beneficiaries who lose their funds through theft and fraud. The only two constraints are that the levy should not exceed 0.05 per cent of the total assets at the end of the preceding financial year and that the Commonwealth cannot recoup more than is owing to the beneficiaries. They are the only two constraints. Despite accepting the recommendation of the Wallis inquiry, the government has not legislated for this change. This may be in part due to pressure created by public statements that we on this side of the House have been making indicating our dislike of this proposal.
The bill does, however, attempt to limit the restitution provisions in two ways. The first is by restricting restitution to funds which have only suffered loss at the hands of `persons directly or indirectly responsible for their administration'. The current provisions do not apply that limit. The second is by requiring the Treasurer to seek and consider the advice of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, before making a decision to levy super funds to pay for restitution. This could be interpreted as giving effect to the 80 per cent cap, because APRA's advice may have to consider the systemic impact of providing full restitution to a super fund which has fallen over as a result of theft or fraud and APRA may advise that a cap on the restitution be applied. So this could be the vehicle for implementing that 80 per cent recommendation. In the current context, protecting employee entitlements, the provisions in this bill seeking to limit restitution to fund members are not only poorly timed by the government but also unfair and unjust. Labor is opposing them.
The bill also contains provisions which restrict the restitution powers from being 
 applied to self-managed or DIY funds. It can be argued that, with the passage of the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 , which I dealt with in this place this morning, all members of these funds are required to become trustees and they should be best able to protect their interests in the fund from theft and fraud. Labor will support this proposal. Where a fund is a defined benefit fund and their loss is suffered through theft and fraud, it becomes an eligible loss only where the employer sponsor of the fund is required to pay the fund but cannot pay the fund and remain solvent. The bill does make some attempt to limit the systemic risk to the superannuation system arising from the moral hazard problem. However, the restitution provisions have yet to be used and Labor will oppose any attempt to water down employee entitlements restoration.
I said at the outset that there was a second issue here, and that is that we have proposed provisions which give the Reserve Bank the power to exempt a corporation from complying with an information provision standard it makes under the Financial Corporations Act 1974. Labor will be moving an amendment to make the exemption a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 in order to increase parliamentary scrutiny of the exercise of the Reserve Bank's powers. This is an important step in improving the openness and information available to the parliament. I have to say that the issue of accountability and transparency is no mere issue at the margin. Saturday's election result in Victoria I think demonstrated that. We have even more concern in the light of the shameless document shredding taking place in the bowels of Spring Street by the perhaps outgoing Kennett government.
I have covered the two key components of the bill which from the opposition's perspective are controversial and concerning which we cannot agree with the government. The bill does include a range of other matters with which we do agree with the government, and I will briefly outline them. The bill is the third stage in the government's implementation of the Wallis reforms to the financial 
 sector. Labor has been largely supportive of these reforms, with some significant exceptions such as, for example, the four pillars policy.
The other amendments in this bill are intended to further refine the financial system. They are largely of an administrative and technical nature. For example, the bill will extend until 30 June 2000 the deadline for the qualification for tax relief for foreign authorised deposit taking institutions transferring assets and liabilities between branches, their subsidiaries and money market corporations. It will allow the electronic lodgment of information by superannuation funds, in accordance with the government's wider objective of establishing a business entry point. It will permit the Reserve Bank to delegate certain information collection functions to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It will exempt APRA from paying sales tax on the goods it purchases. It will amend the secrecy provisions of the APRA Act. It will reduce compliance costs on business, increase flexibility and remove unused provisions of the Financial Corporations Act 1974. It will also provide a mechanism, in response to concerns raised by industry, to ensure adequate disclosure to members prior to an ADI effecting a demutualisation.
Labor is supportive of those measures, as we have been in the case of many of the other sensible Wallis reforms. We will not, however, be party to legislation which weakens the provisions allowing the government to step in and help people who, through no fault of their own, could lose their retirement nest egg through theft and fraud without the protection of the government.
I note in conclusion that this issue of loss of legitimate employee entitlements has been a major issue over the past two or three years, with some substantial companies becoming bankrupt. We have seen the examples of Cobar, Woodlawn and others, with workers missing out on their legitimate accrued entitlements. One of those major issues of distress has been the loss of accrued superannuation entitlements. We want to see this problem 
 resolved and we are actively working on solutions to this problem. We would certainly not want to see the scope for loss of employee entitlements extended through weakening of the protections against loss through theft or fraud. That is why we have taken the position that we have on a couple of the provisions of the legislation before the House. That is why I have moved the second reading amendment that I have and why we will pursue some of these matters in the consideration in detail stage.
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—I have chosen to make some remarks on the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1999  because I think, in looking at the Wallis inquiry, that its purpose is to prepare Australia better to become one of the regional financial centres in the Asia-Pacific area. There are some interesting ramifications of that or perhaps necessary preconditions which, although not covered directly in this bill, are an essential part of achieving that policy outcome.
The bill deals with various transitional type measures such as sales tax exemption for purchases made by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the demutualisation of authorised deposit taking institutions, to bear in mind their members' interests. Another measure deals with foreign authorised deposit taking institutions and their need to obtain a banking authority. But, as I said, the legislation all goes to the government's aim of fostering Sydney in particular as a regional financial centre.
I would like to pose a couple of questions along the way. For a start, how realistic is that as a policy aim? I think it is a realistic one, provided that certain steps in addition to what is in the Wallis report are taken. You can then ask what more has to be done to achieve this outcome and you can indeed ask if Australia is ready for this. Do we really want to be competitive enough to attract such large flows of capital into investment and 
 broking institutions in Sydney that we would be genuinely regarded as a regional financial capital?
In asking those questions, I think of last weekend's result in the Victorian state election and I think back to what happened federally with the One Nation Party before that. It has to be said that there are some grave portents in rural and regional Australia which, in an indirect but nevertheless important way, bear on the whole question of whether or not we can get these further reforms up to make Australia competitive enough to attract that sort of capital.
This country was very broadly settled, perhaps more broadly so than any other part of the earth in human history. We came here as an immigrant people, spread out to an enormous degree and settled many small and medium sized country towns, villages and crossroads—and they are all still out there today. In doing so, many people staked their livelihood on agriculture and also on regional manufacturing enterprises. Sad to say, many of these are dying very quickly as sources of employment for people who remain in those parts of Australia. The electorate boundaries remain, and when it comes time for people to vote, quite naturally, their fears about what they see happening right in front of them translate into votes for Independent candidates in many cases and sometimes, it has to be said, for ludicrous candidates, some of whom were elected in the Queensland state election not so long ago.
So in many senses the further reforms that have to take place, especially in taxation, are often held back by the demands for funds, subsidies and so forth that people rightfully feel ought to be delivered to them to maintain their lifestyles in these parts of Australia. This is not a peculiarly Australian phenomenon at all; it happens in many parts of the world.
If you take a basic view of the economics of many our regional centres, you should look at the real prices of some of our commodities. Let us take beef. In the period from 1970 till now the real price of beef has followed a downward course. It has fallen nearly 60 per cent in that time. Likewise, sugar has fallen slightly more—61 or 62 per cent in real terms 
 in 1998 dollars. Interestingly enough, grain prices are relatively the same and also, strangely enough, wool prices are not so different in real terms from what they were back in 1970-71. It is really the competition from other fibres that has caused such difficulty there.
But to become a properly said `large regional financial centre' we have to go further than the measures that were announced this week as part of the business tax reform package. They were wonderful measures—very big steps made along the way towards this goal—but I believe that we have to find a way of reducing our top rate of income tax to around 30 per cent or perhaps even slightly less. We also need a capital gains tax perhaps set at around 10 per cent, not simply at half of the current marginal tax rate—although that, as I say, is a very big step. Furthermore, we need a special immigration category for information technology skilled people.
Radical tax reform, such as I suppose you would describe these measures, can also serve to rejuvenate some of Australia's regional centres by the devolving of certain types of IT work via networks or intranets, whether they be call centres, which are really at the very low end of the food chain in information technology, through to slightly higher more value added tasks such as the clerical processing of financial transactions or even more higher value added work such as the design and making of graphics, database administration or even programming skills. These things can be devolved to people living in regional Australia.
Two weekends ago, whilst visiting some properties for sale along the South Coast of New South Wales, I saw a blueberry farm in some disrepair. When I went to the house to greet the man who was selling the blueberry farm, and to inspect the property, I found that he was a computer programmer. There in this little shack were a number of stand-alone workstations, with not just HTML on the screen but other kinds of programming languages. It was quite clear that he was performing that sort of work. He was so busy with his computer programming that he had neglected his blueberry farm and it was in a 
 terrible mess. In fact, he was selling the property simply because he felt it was useless to try to maintain a blueberry farm while he could make a much higher income from his work as a computer programmer.
But, to use an agricultural metaphor, you have to till the earth before the plants will grow. There will have to be some, to use a hackneyed phrase, proactive measures taken to assist the devolving of these kinds of IT tasks to people who desire to live in wonderful parts of rural and regional Australia. For example, the government might think of intervening to locate extra computer processing capacity—what you would call the super computer, the sort of thing you can see at the Australian Technology Park in Redfern in Sydney—at a regional university and therefore give people who require that level of processing, to produce very high quality graphics, the opportunity to use that extra processing capacity to produce material very quickly. That is one such measure. To make life slightly easier for such people, to attract them to migrate not simply to Australia but out of our cities and to these places to establish their enterprises, you would have to do a little more about the transport links. There must of course be some reason to do that: you cannot go down the road of subsidising to too great a degree the cost of travel between regional parts of Australia and our cities.
In all of this, I talk a lot about both the investment sector and the information technology sector. As time passes, my guess is that that they will largely converge. Whilst the Wallis reforms are essential in building, if you like, a regulatory infrastructure to make it easier and more reliable to conduct such enterprises, you have to make available to these companies sufficient numbers of people who are skilled in things like database administration or construction and programming. The two keys to growth in a financial sector are information—the quality and access to it—and marginal rates of returns on capital invested. The less the regulatory burden, the better the marginal rate of return.
By making available large numbers of IT skilled people, you enable Australian financial enterprises—whether they are fund managers, 
 brokers, insurance companies or other types of enterprises—to do more. For example, how would you go about optimising returns in the global sector in banking, transport, computer hardware or some sort of manufacturing? How would you compare the rates of return on individual listed companies in the many different equity markets in the world today? You can do it, but you need an enormous amount of IT resources. But, if you can do it, you can provide an edge for your clients and hence you are slightly more attractive for people choosing where to place their money to be invested.
As time passes, we will see a convergence between the taxation burdens, liabilities, that enterprises in our financial sector must bear and the availability of information technology in the form of people. Hence, our immigration policy must look ahead to how we attract larger numbers of people from countries in this region—people with surnames that the average Australian cabinet minister, frankly, could not pronounce. That is the kind of gold we should be mining out there. In trying to bring all of these things together, one must of course deal finally with our parliament. Measures pass through this House with debate, amendments are moved and the government accepts suggestions that are constructive.
It is said that all roads lead to Rome but in this town it seems that often all roads lead to the Senate. We have to acknowledge that we do not have a majority there and that, from time to time, we have some difficulty dealing with the parties there—the Democrats, who hold the balance of power, of course, and the ALP. We need to focus them less on the notion of envy and more on the notion of what Australia has to do to compete with its peer nations not simply now but 10 and 20 years down the track. As I said, it is not simply a question of dealing with, one by one, discrete areas of policy, such as taxation or financial regulation, but it is more how we tie together the different elements that these enterprises in Australia will need in order to compete.
These different elements include immigration, taxation, financial regulation and even, 
 if you draw the bow a little further, transport and regional development. If reforms to the tax system—which we must persevere with to try to achieve later on—strike shoals or reefs of resentment in the electorate, people feeling neglected and voting against established parties or policies out of sheer frustration, we will not be able to achieve that convergence of policy. Hence, we will not be able to achieve our outcome of fostering Australia, particularly Sydney, as one of the Asia-Pacific's larger financial centres. One could talk in much more detail about these things, but perhaps it is better they are talked about less and actually done. I conclude my remarks there and pass the baton to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation to give the government's view.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—It gives me pleasure to sum up this Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 2) 1999 . I thank the member for Wentworth for his erudite comments. The member for Wentworth has a deep understanding of the financial services industry, having practised in that area previously. He made a very important contribution in the debate, as did a number of other members.
This bill puts in place a regime that will help support the recommendations of the Wallis report. It is a further step forward in the process of regulatory reform that was initiated as a response to the financial system inquiry, known as the Wallis inquiry. The Wallis report has had a material impact on the performance of the financial services industry in Australia. It has been used as a blueprint for the reform of the financial services industry in London, which is perhaps the most important financial services jurisdiction in the world.
The Wallis report basically states that we should have one or two regulators of financial products and services as opposed to financial entities. Australia decided to go with a twin peaks approach of having, on the one hand, a prudential regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and, on the other hand, a corporate regulator, the Australian 
 Securities and Investment Commission. The United Kingdom went with a single peak regulator, the Financial Services Authority, headed by Mr Howard Davis. This has made the FSA an extremely powerful body in London. As my colleague the member for Wentworth knows, London is where most of the international transactions in global financial services occur. London is the biggest foreign exchange market in the world. It is in many ways the access point of the capital markets of the United States to Europe.
London's new regulator, the FSA, is a private company. I find this intriguing. The Australian regulators, ASIC and APRA, are government owned regulators; they are statutory authorities. London has decided to go with a single regulator—a private sector company, limited by guarantee, that has its own private sector board. This private body, which regulates the entire financial services and corporate system in the United Kingdom, in many ways acts independently of the government.
The power of the new FSA was exemplified recently when it fined a financial institution in the city of London in excess of £100 million. The FSA still had not had its empowering legislation passed through the parliament, yet it fined a private sector company for improper activity and the private sector company paid the fine even though it had no legal obligation to do so. That says to me that this authority in London is very powerful, and not only is it a powerful authority in Europe but it is, in global financial terms, an extremely powerful entity.
In many ways I am very glad that, under the Wallis recommendations, the Treasurer and the government in their wisdom decided to have a twin peaks policy. We will have a prudential regulator, APRA, which has responsibility for supervising at the moment in excess of 200,000 superannuation funds, including of course the do-it-yourself funds, and for supervising the banks, insurance companies, building societies, credit unions and some friendly societies. These were the second half of the Wallis reforms, which we passed through the parliament quite recently.
So what the bill does, and what we are going to consider in the consideration in detail stage, is further tighten the Wallis reform initiatives which were announced and passed by the parliament quite recently. They include the further empowerment of APRA to exempt it from paying sales tax on the goods that it purchases—that is self-evident; you could not do that, of course, if it were a private sector company, following the line of the United Kingdom—and amendments to the Banking Act, the Financial Corporations Act, the transfer of assets and liabilities under the Financial Corporations Act, the financial laws amendment act, the Life Insurance Act, the Reserve Bank Act and, importantly, the superannuation legislation relating to financial assistance to funds, and further amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. I appreciate the comments made in this debate by the member for Wentworth and by the shadow Assistant Treasurer. The bill takes us a further step forward in reform of the financial services industry in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.
	 Question put:
	 That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Kelvin Thomson's  amendment) stand part of the question",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—Labor will not be opposing the package of bills under consideration. However, we will be moving a second reading amendment setting out Labor's concerns about the levy process—that is, if the second reading amendment arrives in time; things have been moving fairly quickly here.
The reason these bills are before the House today is principally due to government incompetence. On the one hand, we have the Treasurer saying that he is in the middle of one of the biggest tax reform processes Australia has ever seen and, on the other hand, we find the department cannot get right what we would regard as pretty simple matters. I have to say that this is somewhat typical of this government. You get plenty of froth and bubble on the surface but a lot of problems in terms of following through with the detail. What we have seen is a procedural error which casts into doubt the validity of the imposition of levies on industries in the financial sector.
I will detail the history of this matter. The measures for the collection of supervisory levies are contained in the Financial Institutions Supervisory Levies Collection Act 1998.	Under section 50(2) of the APRA Act, for each financial year, the Treasurer must determine from the levy money received during the year the amount that is necessary to cover the costs to the Commonwealth of providing market integrity and consumer protection functions for prudentially regulated institutions. This amount is retained in the 
 consolidated revenue fund until allocated to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Taxation Office, which perform these functions. The balance of the levy money, after taking out the amount for consumer protection functions for prudentially regulated institutions, is to be paid to APRA under section 50(1) of the APRA Act. The total levy receivable for the financial year 1998-99 was estimated at $40 million, and $70 million is estimated in 1999-2000.
On 11 August last year, the Treasurer made determinations that imposed a levy on certain industries in the financial sector with a general public announcement through the Commonwealth Gazette of 13 August. However, the government failed to meet the requirement of subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 because the determinations were to take effect from 1 July 1998, which was earlier than the public announcement of 13 August 1998. These determinations were therefore made invalid by the Acts Interpretation Act. To correct its own error, the government has been forced to introduce the bills being debated in the House now to override the retrospectivity provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act and validate the determinations on the imposition of levies.
There are a range of levies imposed. For general insurance companies, the levies raised range from $5,000 to $55,000. For authorised non-operating holding companies, the amount of levy payable is $10,000. For life insurance companies, the levy ranges from $5,000 to $148,000. In addition, retirement savings account providers face a levy of between $5,000 and $8,500. Superannuation entities pay between $200 and $39,000.
There is general industry acceptance of the need to contribute to the running costs of APRA, ASIC and the tax office. But, displaying its usual flair, the government has even managed to shake this support. We have had industry groups expressing serious concern at the levels at which the levies have been imposed. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA, for example, considered the levy amounts to be unfair and inequitable and more than is necessary to 
 cover the costs of efficient regulators. As a consequence of the strong representations from the financial sector, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation announced on 3 August this year a review of these supervisory levies. A report on the review is expected in early October 1999.
Labor will certainly not be opposing the bills before the House. We do, however, condemn the government for the incompetence displayed in its handling of this issue.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—It is not a difficult issue, Minister. Heaven help us when we need to implement the more difficult GST and the business tax reforms that emerge from the Ralph review. As foreshadowed, I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1)	 its sloppy administration in relation to the setting of the levy limits;
(2)	 the lack of transparency displayed in the determination of the levy; and
(3)	 its failure to adequately consult with industry participants"".
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—I was to close at this point, but the minister scoffed. I do need to bring him back to the point that the government's handling of the issue of regulatory levies has been less than satisfactory. Quite a number of industry funds and other bodies have expressed concerns about the way in which levies have been imposed with a lack of consultation. They have certainly not delivered on the government's suggestions throughout the Wallis reform process that this would lead to lower costs of regulation and, by implication, lower levies.
As I pointed out to the House, it is quite clear that, in announcing in August that the minister would have a review of the levies, he is responding to industry pressure and clearly there are signs that the government has not handled this issue as well as it might. We will be very interested in the review of the levies. We also wait to see the Wallis process flowing through in terms of lower regulatory 
 levies. That is something that the industry has been led to expect would come out of this process. It will be very interesting indeed to see whether this occurs in due course.
—Order! Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>AUTHORISED NON-OPERATING HOLDING COMPANIES SUPERVISORY LEVY DETERMINATION VALIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—I am delighted to participate in the debate on the supervisory levy determination validation bills which support the historic recommendations of the Wallis committee report. I am delighted that the opposition are supporting these bills, which are of a technical nature and which support the broad thrust of the outcomes of the Wallis committee's inquiries. I particularly note the remarks of the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, at the table, Mr Hockey, about the activities of the regulatory authority in the City of London and draw the comparison between the Wallis committee recommendations and the government's move to provide a similar regulatory authority here in Australia. In many ways, we lead the world for the way in which these recommendations have been implemented into legislation and provide prudential and regulatory structure for financial services here in Australia.
There is a well-known saying that, if you owe the bank $100,000 and you cannot pay it back, you have a problem but, if you owe the bank $100 million and cannot pay it back, the bank has a problem. Financial regulation and prudential requirements are vital in some situations. Sometimes we find that too much money is lent to people who are unable to pay it back. We saw these problems arise in the 1980s when banks and financial institutions were unable to handle their very excessive loans. It is a challenge that this government has responded to, obviously in the hope that in future, when excesses of lending might take place, there will be a structure in place that can handle that situation.
This legislation is necessary to implement the findings of the Wallis inquiry whose report was brought down in 1997. The chairman of that committee, Mr Stan Wallis, who 
 is a leading company director, in my view presented a very sensible report, along with his fellow committee members. They undertook a very exhaustive look at financial services in Australia and the way in which we should develop sets of regulations and structures. What came to light were the corporate collapses and the problems of the 1980s, and the ad hoc nature of the prudential regulations that existed at that time. I would like to quote the key findings in chapter 8 of the report, headed `Financial safety'. The first one states:
The intensity of prudential regulation should be proportional to the degree of market failure which it addresses, but it should not involve a government guarantee of any part of the financial system.
While that is a fairly wordy recommendation, it quite clearly says that the government has a role to provide prudential protection but it does not undertake to guarantee banks or other financial institutions in the event of their collapse. The second key finding states:
The framework for the provision of prudential regulation should be designed to ensure that its objectives are clear, that it deals efficiently with the development of financial conglomerates and the blurring of product and institutional boundaries and that it promotes competition by minimising unnecessary or artificial regulatory distinctions between different entities.
Again, that very strong recommendation is suggesting that in the changing times, where we have different financial products and different areas of responsibilities, that we should have one regulator to move across the boundaries and provide a prudential cover for all those financial services. The third key finding states:
Prudential regulation can have adverse effects on efficiency, competition and innovation and there is scope to adjust existing regulation to reduce these effects, particularly through more flexible rules for the ownership and corporate structure of licensed entities.
What that is saying is that we should try to remove the red tape as much as we can to ensure that markets in Australia work efficiently and compete with the markets of Tokyo, London and New York.
As the minister at the table would recall, the states had a high level of involvement, leading to duplication of functions and incon 
 sistency in approach and unnecessary expense. We have a federal government which is prepared to make the necessary changes on these regulations that were state by state based. That will ensure that Australia does become a competitive nation in this area of financial services. The report states on page 642:
Over 800 staff are now involved in financial regulation in Australia, resulting in direct and compliance costs which appear to be high by international standards.
Again, the minister at the table would be aware of this and that we are trying to make these areas of control efficient and effective. There were failures of institutions, most notably in my case the Pyramid Building Society in Geelong. The member for Corio would be fully aware of the impact of that failure on the Geelong community, under a Labor government in Victoria, where people lost their life savings. The Pyramid Building Society had lent in overheated market conditions and, under state regulations, there was a failure of the financial system and the political process to protect consumers.
The human cost of the Pyramid failure was enormous in western Victoria and in Victoria generally. I spoke to people who, in one week, lost their total life savings. I spoke to people who were in a state of shock for three or four days and unable to speak or comprehend the magnitude of loss. In one particular case I am aware of, over one weekend a retired farmer deposited the whole proceeds of his farm—that may have been a foolish thing to do—and found, when it was clearly understood that Pyramid had collapsed, that he had lost his life savings. That is the human outcome of a lack of prudential regulation. You could have an argument about the role of the building society and the role of the Victorian Labor government but, to be fair, there was a grey area of what was required and the Pyramid directors argued that they had acted within the regulations at the time.
So we see in that example how important it is to move forward with the recommendations of the Wallis report, to put them into federal legislation and make sure they work. The key recommendation was that we had a 
 single regulator for this area. One of the reasons was to increase consumer protection—the investors in the Pyramid Group would have been very pleased if this legislation had been in place—for the same financial products and services so consumers and users could feel more confident that their products were being protected, whether insurance, banking or housing societies. Whilst we have a more financially deregulated system, we need to make sure that these prudential and regulatory arrangements are in place. I quote from the Wallis report, page 644:
A by-product of deregulation was the increased availability of debt in the second half of the 1980s. In conditions of intense competition and growth in some asset prices, many banks dropped their lending standards which led subsequently to significant write-offs in the early 1990s.
Minister Hockey at the table and all of us would be aware of the amazing write-offs by big banks—Westpac and others. They wrote off massive debts because they had overdone it in a heated lending environment. They found that their loan book had been incautiously driven, and billions of dollars were written off. It is the hope of the government that this new set of prudential regulations will caution both the big lenders and the smaller lenders to look after their customers and their shareholders. The Wallis report went on to say, in the same vein:
This was an experience common to many countries, and prudential regulators around the word reacted by first standardising and thereafter steadily increasing, capital adequacy and other prudential requirements
So we have this interesting debate of whether you regulate in a tight manner or whether you open the arrangements up to a more sensible regulatory structure—as is the case here in Australia—run by the Commonwealth, not the states, ensuring that the prudential requirements meet market forces and yet protect the main players.
The key argument in these bills is that the regulators should only collect from institutions the amounts that are needed to regulate those institutions. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is to receive $6.6 million to run their activities, the Australian Taxation Office is to receive $2.35 
 million, and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is to receive $31.5 million. That covers credit unions, friendly societies and building societies. All those generally state controlled groups now come under the control of APRA.
So APRA will now collect these moneys from various industries, as was the case in the previous set of arrangements. The regulatory functions of the Reserve Bank will be abolished. The Reserve Bank's former functions were  financed by interest forgone on non-callable deposits held by the bank, so there was an unusual method of arranging for the payment of that regulatory function. Non-banks will be judged consistently on their own performance, APRA will have an independent board and charter, and the disclosure requirements of the institution are to be undertaken by the Securities and Investments Commission.
We have a set of very sensible arrangements emerging from the Wallis committee of inquiry. Australia, and individual investors, can move forward with confidence within the constraints of prudential requirements. Both sides of this parliament should make it clear that the government and regulatory authorities can never legislate against bad debts. I think the minister at the table would agree with that. All we can do is set in place arrangements that will encourage people to act in a sensible, careful way when handling other people's money and competing in the money market.
In the case of these bills, as the opposition have drawn our attention to, there must be a separate bill for each supervisory levy in each sector of the financial services industry. Just for the record, the levies are to be imposed through the following acts: the Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions Supervisory Imposition Act 1998, the Authorised Non-operating Holding Companies Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998, the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Imposition Act, the Retirement Savings Account Providers Supervisory Levy Act 1998 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998. 
Under section 52 of the APRA Act, the aspect of the levies that will be spent on protecting market integrity and consumer protection will go into consolidated revenue. This may well be given to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Taxation Office for their supervisory function. The balance of moneys collected by the Commonwealth will go to APRA. So we have a set of arrangements that ensures that these supervisory functions can be paid for. Similar to what the minister at the table was saying, there is an interesting example in the City of London, where a private company provides supervision for that very important financial centre. That is something the government might give some thought to at a later date. But certainly this set of arrangements is visionary and sets Australia up to be in the forefront of prudential and regulatory arrangements.
An authorised deposit taking institution is a body corporate authorised to carry on banking business, such as a bank, a building society or a credit union. Again, these definitions are fairly important. The levy will be a flat amount and cannot exceed $500,000 per contributor and, in the future, the inflation indexed figure on the $500,000.
If these bills are not enacted, then the 1998-99 levy cannot be collected. So it is fairly important. I appreciate that the opposition are supporting these bills to implement these collection levies. These supervisory levy determinations for 1998 were not gazetted until 13 August 1998 even though they were to take effect on 1 July 1998.
The opposition have raised the point that the government may not have got this correct. I just draw to their attention, and to the House's attention, that the Howard government has brought about more financial change—and with the Ralph report which was brought down yesterday there will be more financial change—in the area of taxation and regulation than has taken place in the last 50 years. I think it is rather churlish of the opposition to suggest that we have one minor amendment in a major piece of financial and budgetary legislation that this House has had to deal with. Absolutely mammoth changes 
 have taken place over the term of this government. The Ralph report that was brought down yesterday adds to this determination by the government to bring about reform and a more competitive Australia, especially in the taxation and financial area.
The passage of this legislation will ensure that the recommendations of that very big and well thought-through Wallis committee will make Australia a centre for finance and stockbroking in this region. It will ensure that it is supported by a prudential, honest and legislatively backed set of arrangements that will give confidence to international investors that they can deal with people and institutions in Australia and know that they are honest and well backed by this prudential requirement. They will know that they can invest in Australia with confidence.",REPS,<title>AUTHORISED NON-OPERATING HOLDING COMPANIES SUPERVISORY LEVY DETERMINATION VALIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—May I take this opportunity to thank the erudite member for Corangamite for his always well-researched and thoughtful speech. I also take this opportunity to note in the House that the member for Corangamite has certainly been one of the most impressive members I have gotten to know in the parliament. He is always very thoughtful about individual issues that are to be dealt with, particularly in relation to financial matters. I not only enjoy our friendship and our thought-provoking discussions but really do appreciate, and have learned from, his never quenchable thirst for more information and for the logic behind individual issues. Perhaps that is why he is one of the leading thinkers in the parliament. I think the people of Corangamite are very well served by his endeavours.
As the member for Corangamite pointed out, the Wallis reforms are indeed the blueprint reforms that are now being used in some of the biggest markets in the world as the path-breaking, path-finding process for global financial services and prudential regulation change.
It is a little disappointing—and I know that he is better than this—that the member for Wills moves this guffaw as an amendment, talking about administration, transparency and 
 consultations involving the levies. The fundamental point is that financial institutions in Australia have never had a better arrangement for prudential supervision. They no longer have half a billion dollars a year tied up in non-callable deposits. Even in the path-breaking reforms of the United Kingdom, which have adopted the Wallis report as the blueprint, there is still a requirement of financial institutions to keep a certain level of deposits with the FSA or an authorised body. It might be the Bank of England. There is still a requirement that they keep a certain level of capital—I think from memory it is about five per cent—with the government.
In our case, we have said to the financial services industry in Australia, `Take back your non-callable deposits and you will pay a maximum per individual operating entity of $1 million for the prudential supervision of APRA and the contribution to ASIC for consumer activities, and also the ATO.' That is a great deal for Australian deposit taking institutions. It is a great deal because on the one hand they have significant benefit from the revocation of non-callable deposits, at some cost to the government, but on the other hand, in the interests of appropriate supervision, it is fair. There is no other major jurisdiction in the world that does not have a similar regime to that of the UK where there is a form of non-callable deposit for a certain amount of assets that need to be lodged with the government.
In our case we have said no, prudential supervision is separate to the requirements of lodging capital with the government. Therefore we have a much fairer system and, indeed, one that is certainly working quite well. I do accept the concerns of international banks and some of the building societies and people involved in the transition of the most recent Wallis reforms from 1 July this year that they may be paying an unfair level of levy. In some cases there are entities that are not paying enough and, on the other hand, there are entities that are paying too much.
I accept that, and that is why I announced a review of APRA levies some weeks ago. That review is being undertaken with a couple of initiatives in mind. The first one is to put 
 in place a fairer system for the application of levies and the second one is to consider the concerns expressed, particularly by international banks about the level of levy that they are required to pay and, in particular, where, for example, one international financial institution might be operating three different arms. It might have a retail bank, it might have an insurance company and it might have an investment bank. Accordingly, depending on its size, it could be paying $3 million in APRA levies compared with far larger financial institutions such as the four major retail banks which operate as one entity with different operating arms and, therefore, pay only a maximum of $1 million. So that is part of the brief of the review, and we will be making some comments about that in the not too distant future.
On that basis, I commend the bill to the House. I reject outright the proposed amendment put forward by the member for Wills. I urge him not to move everything that is put in front of him by his staff or the staff of Senator Conroy. It would be much wiser for him to read amendments before he moves them in this House and consider their ramifications and therefore avoid embarrassing himself and the opposition with what can only be described as `fluff in print'.

That the amendments be agreed to.
The passage of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  by the Senate is an important step in providing human rights complainants with an effective and cost-efficient process for making complaints under antidiscrimination legislation. The amendments moved by the government in the Senate 
 were all designed to better protect the rights of persons protected by the Commonwealth human rights legislation package. The first amendment empowers the Attorney-General to formulate standards under the Disability Discrimination Act in relation to the access to and use of premises by persons with a disability. This amendment will add a new paragraph (f) to subsection 31(1) of the act to empower the Attorney-General to formulate standards with respect to the treatment of persons with a disability in relation to access to or the use of any premises that the public or a section of the public is entitled or allowed to enter or use, whether for payment or not.
The second amendment is to paragraph 31(b) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to make clear that, when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquires into any act or practice that may constitute discrimination, it may inquire into any systemic practice. This will ensure that the commission is sufficiently equipped to inquire into complaints of discrimination in all appropriate cases.
The third and fourth amendments both relate to the conduct of compulsory conferences before the commission and are designed to ensure fairness and equity for all parties. The person presiding over a compulsory conference being held as part of the conciliation process for a complaint of unlawful discrimination must ensure that the conduct of the conference does not disadvantage any party—the complainant or the respondent. This will be achieved by amending item 59 of the bill to provide a new subsection (2A) in section 46PK.
In addition, the bill now provides an entitlement for a person with a disability who is unable to participate fully in a compulsory conference because of that disability to nominate another person to assist him or her at the conference. This will be achieved by amending item 59 of the bill to provide a new subsection (5A) in section 46PK. As the government noted in the Senate, this bill remedies deficiencies in the current system for dealing with antidiscrimination complaints and ensures that human rights litigants are 
 given fair and equitable access to justice, should they choose to pursue a human rights complaint in the Federal Court. I commend these amendments to the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The opposition will not be opposing the adoption of the amendments to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 , but I would like to make a few comments. Initially, I should expressly note the Attorney-General's good faith in the government's negotiating with the Australian Labor Party some of the Labor Party's suggested amendments and accepting those in the Senate. In particular, I refer to the making of disability standards in relation to access to premises, issues of systemic discrimination, the amending of complaints during the litigation process, the referral of discriminatory awards and determinations to the Remuneration Tribunal and the Defence Force Tribunal, and the court fees that should apply to discrimination cases. We welcome the government's reconsideration of those issues.
We are concerned that our suggestions in respect of the applicability of the rules of evidence and representative complaints to the Federal Court were not accepted. The Labor Party also has great concern in respect of the issue of the awarding of costs. The act will provide that costs follow the event—that is, if you commence proceedings in the Federal Court and lose, you will be ordered to pay the successful party's costs. That is going to be a significant disadvantage to anyone commencing proceedings in the Federal Court; they simply will not have the resources to risk that loss. We have to bear in mind that in this area the awards of damages are not usually very large at all, particularly in the area of physical and intellectual disability. Usually, it is a symbolic issue or access issue that is, nonetheless, very important as to how society treats, cares for and assists disabled persons.
There will not be a big pool of money at the end of the tunnel to pay legal fees. In circumstances where there is not going to be much money, any litigant would have to balance that against the prospect of paying very substantial costs in the Federal Court proceedings should they lose their case. We 
 also have to bear in mind that it is still the case that there is very little precedent law as to how these cases should be determined. Many of these cases are ploughing new ground, so any litigant in this area does take on a considerable risk. We think there is going to be a significant disincentive for these disability issues to be aired in the courts and, ultimately, for the community, having regard to those court decisions, to take on board the principles. Those points have been made today, for instance, by the National Council on Intellectual Disability and the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition. They said this in a media release:
The Democrats and the Coalition have ensured that human rights justice only exists for the wealthy. People with disabilities will not be able to risk their meagre possessions in taking an action in the Federal Court. It is now unlikely that any Federal Court decision will be made under the DDA. While ensuring that discrimination and human rights decisions will now be enforceable, people with disabilities will not be able to afford the financial risks in taking their case to the Federal Court.
That simply puts the reality of the position. I should say that the government's position on this matter has substantially been one of good faith. They have negotiated their position, explained their logic and received the arguments to the contrary. They have not accepted our suggestions, but we respect their position. We do not respect the position of the Australian Democrats, however. Indeed, the disability groups to which I have referred described their action as `shameful'. It was indeed shameful. The Democrats did not disclose how they intended to vote on this matter and, rather than arguing their case, they simply put forward selective arguments that had been made by the disability community and let the government take a swing at them. They did not present any arguments to back up what they were putting forward or enhance, develop or explain those arguments that had been put by the disability community. Effectively, they selectively quoted from the submissions of disability groups, effectively placing the ball for the government to come in and have a kick. They really let down the disability community. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—I am aware that some members of the disability community would have preferred a different costs regime to apply in cases before the Federal Court and, of course, we were aware of the Australian Labor Party's position. However, the government remains firmly of the view that the maintenance of the existing Federal Court regime offers the best outcome for people with disabilities—indeed, for all those protected by the human rights and antidiscrimination legislation.
I would like to outline again the basis for this view. I noticed the member for Barton read from a news release from a couple of disability groups. The approach taken by those groups is simplistic, and I do not believe they fully understand the ramifications of what they are saying. And we have no criticism of the Democrats whatsoever for taking a different view. As far as we are concerned, they acted in complete good faith in our negotiations with them. I should mention at the outset that we have undertaken that the Attorney-General's Department will review the impact of the cost regime on human rights cases within the next three years, in the light of experience.
Under the current system, the court has the discretion to order costs in relation to actions to enforce determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Section 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act provides that the awarding of costs is at the discretion of the court or judge. This leaves it open for the court to award costs in favour of a party where the circumstances or merits of the case warrant such an approach.
Lawyers are, in fact, more likely to take cases on under a costs follow the event regime as such a regime will encourage contingency fee arrangements. As the commission has noted, parties have often been unable to secure legal representation for proceedings in the commission because it is a no costs jurisdiction. The same outcome would result in the Federal Court under the opposition's preferred amendment. The opposition's amendment appeared to be modelled on provisions in the Workplace 
 Relations Act for the award of costs in certain types of proceedings under that act, and provides for costs to be awarded against a party who makes a frivolous or vexatious application. The provisions in the Workplace Relations Act, however, follow from a different costs regime. They make no sense in this context, and the outcome for complainants would be exactly the same as under our proposals. With the usual Federal Court cost regime applying, an applicant who makes a frivolous or vexatious application would pay the costs under a costs follow the event regime because they would lose their case.
The wide discretion available for the Federal Court under section 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act allows the court to take any considerations into account that it considers appropriate in making a costs order. Although there are special rules for workplace relations cases, there is no justification for treating human rights litigants in any manner differently from others. The respondent may well be a small business or an employee who, for example, has been accused of sexual harassment and, therefore, may have no greater resources than an applicant. It is preferable in those circumstances to leave costs issues to the discretion of the court so that these issues may be addressed.
A concern has been raised that public interest test cases, particularly where there is a lack of precedent in relation to a particular question of law, might be discouraged by the normal rule that costs follow the event. In relation to this issue, the government would point to the ability of the commission to act as amicus curiae to assist in such cases. In addition to this, people suffering from financial hardship will be entitled to apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance to run court proceedings in human rights matters.
The proposed Federal Magistrates Service will have jurisdiction over human rights complaints which have not been satisfactorily conciliated in the commission. One of the attractions of the magistrates service is that it will keep costs down for litigants. It will utilise streamlined procedures and a less formal judicial culture, which should allow 
 for quicker resolution of cases and will act as a factor to reduce costs. Many litigants in the human rights jurisdiction are expected to be unrepresented, and they will also be helped by the simplified procedures.
These factors should help reduce legal costs and result in savings for litigants both in terms of time and money. It is envisaged that most human rights matters will be able to be dealt with in the more informal Federal Magistrates Service environment. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Law Council of Australia both support the government's position on costs. (Extension of time granted)
In addition, this bill envisages a scheme where court costs would be reduced because of the emphasis on informality initiatives to reduce costs, which include that the commission may assist an applicant to prepare his or her court application forms—and the court is developing simplified forms. In addition, HREOC commissioners may appear as amicus curiae with leave of the court.
The government has listened and responded to the concerns of the disability community in relation to the fees which apply to matters in the Federal Court. We welcome Labor Party support for that situation. In response to the concerns, the government has reached an agreement with the Australian Democrats to provide that the only fee to apply to human rights cases in the Federal Court will be a flat rate of $50. This will provide a significant up-front saving to human rights complainants.
In concluding and in commending the amendments to the bill to the House, I would call on those disability groups which make such vigorous representations to all parties to carefully consider what it is that they seek to achieve because in some cases—and this bill has been an example—what they seek to achieve is not necessarily going to be achieved by what they seek to have the government do.

That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House condemns:
(1)	 The Prime Minister for attempting to deceive the Australian public by announcing a policy concerning diesel fuel rebate for the timber industry in his media release of 31 May 1999 and then reneging on that policy commitment less than three months later;
(2)	 the Deputy Prime Minister for claiming the House on 28 June 1999 that the cut in the diesel fuel rebate was as a result of the deal with the Democrats when the Government now claims that that decision was a mistake;
(3)	 the Minister for Forestry and Conservation for not protecting the interests of the timber industry and allowing its access to the diesel fuel rebate scheme to be traded off with the Democrats in securing the deal to pass the GST"".
There is a mystery for the unravelling here. I do not know if we have a great deal in the way of investigative journalism these days, but it is certainly there for anyone who is interested in it, and the likes of Agatha Christie would take a great deal of interest in it indeed. I invite the House to consider the history of this matter and to have a look closely at what has happened. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999  proposes to undo one aspect of the deal done between the Prime Minister and the Democrats to secure passage of the GST, namely, the reduction of the amount of diesel fuel rebate eligible for forestry operations. This will increase the amount of the rebate by 100 per cent for forestry operations.
By way of background, the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme returns to certain businesses—such as mining or primary production—all or a proportion of the diesel excise that they pay on diesel fuel used in their business operations. The rebate applies only to these off- 
 road uses, presumably because of the historical link to excise and road funding.
The Prime Minister announced in a media release on 31 May this year the following change of policy regarding the GST package, which had proposed to extend the off-road uses of diesel which would qualify under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. I quote:
Off-road Diesel and Like Fuels
The extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels will be limited to providing full credits for marine use, bush nursing homes, hospitals, nursing homes, aged persons homes and private residences, but not for construction, power generation, manufacturing or forestry. The proposed full credit for mining currently accessing the DFRS will be maintained.
The government then followed up this announcement by introducing the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Bill 1999 which was passed by the Senate on 28 June. This bill specifically limited the amount of rebate to  35/43 of diesel used in forestry—not a full rebate at all. The amount was expressly limited in this legislation to 35/43 . Minister Anderson commenced the second reading speech by stating that the bill:
. . . implements changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme agreed with the Australian Democrats as part of the package of environmental measures that will now accompany the introduction of the new tax system on 1 July 2000.
Subsequently, the minister at the table, Minister Tuckey, claimed that the legislation was a mistake, and that the government did not intend to reduce the rate of rebate to forestry.
Mistake, my foot. It is quite clear from the legislation that was introduced into the Senate in June 1999 that it was the government's intention to limit the rebate to 35/43 diesel used in forestry. A mistake is the sort of thing we were considering earlier in the legislation to do with regulatory levies in superannuation—where the government introduced a regulation and then found that it offended against the Acts Interpretation Act and therefore had to come into the House with a bill. That is a mistake. This is not a mistake; this is something else altogether.
The issue to be determined here is: should we support forestry being treated in the same manner as other off-road industrial users of diesel or should the current limitation of 35/43 remain? The case in support of the legislation is that it has the support of the relevant industry organisations such as the National Association of Forestry Industries. This association argues that it merely restores the parity between forestry and other primary industries and that there is no case for their industry to be discriminated against. I think that is a fair argument. This legislation also has the support of relevant unions. Labor has always treated forestry operations like all other forms of primary production for the purposes of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. That is to say, it has always been eligible for a 100 per cent rebate, so supporting this bill is consistent with that situation. Opposition to this bill would involve a change to policy on our part.
The case against the legislation can be summarised briefly: the environment movement do not support logging in native forests, they certainly do not support any public subsidisation of that activity, and they see the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme for forestry as a subsidy in that context.
The other relevant aspect of the legislation that we should consider is the question of whether we facilitate the government's reneging on its public commitments. Opposing the bill would amount to holding the government to its public commitments. As I have indicated, on balance, the argument that there ought to be parity between forestry and other primary industries in relation to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is a compelling and reasonable argument, and we are not going to oppose the legislation.
I think it is extraordinary that the Democrats have so far sat absolutely mute while the government has reneged on a deal which was an aspect of the agreement with the Democrats to secure the passage of the GST. That strikes us as absolutely extraordinary and, on that basis, there is a case for this legislation to be referred to a Senate legislative committee which could look at the deal making process between the government and the 
 Democrats on the GST. I think there would be considerable public interest in some of the questions being asked.
We have to ask ourselves, `Just how weak are the Democrats in their present mode? Where are the Democrats?' They have disappeared completely on these sorts of questions. Their deal with the government on the environmental consequences of the GST generally was appalling. They cooperated with the government in the passage of legislation for the government to be able to devolve some of its national responsibilities to the environment back to the states. Their position on these matters has been entirely unsatisfactory.
The financial impact of this proposal has not been disclosed by the government; the explanatory memorandum states that the cost is nil. We think, in fact, that it would cost tens of millions of dollars, and we would be interested to hear any further information the government can provide in relation to this matter. We will not be opposing the second reading. We do, however, think that a substantial fraud has been perpetrated on somebody if the government and the Democrats can say, `We have a deal on the GST, and we have associated elements of the environmental package with it. One of them is the reduction of the diesel fuel rebate for forestry operations.' Now the government comes back into the parliament and says, `No, the diesel fuel rebate for forestry is going to be 100 per cent,' completely contradicting the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Bill 1999, which they introduced and passed in the Senate as recently as 28 June 1999.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to support Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999  and certainly to support the Minister for Forestry and Conservation in his view that there should be equity in primary industry with the diesel fuel rebate and that it should be passed on to those operating in the forestry industry. The bill aligns the Diesel Fuel 
 Rebate Scheme so that the rate that applies to the forestry industry is that which applies to the agricultural and fishing industries. I do not believe that anybody could rightly say that you should single out the forestry industry and say, `You should not get it; you are a different part of the primary industry sector that should be discriminated against.' The bill merely seeks to ensure that the forestry industry is no worse off after the introduction of the new tax system. The full rebate will be payable for fuel purchased after 1 July 2000.
I have listened to the comments of the shadow minister in the debate, and it is a fairly typical approach of the opposition to want to have two bob each way. They come in and say that on balance they will support it. I wonder whether the minister heard the key phrase that the unions said they are in support of this. As we know, the marching orders for the opposition come from the union movement. If they say it is okay, then ahead they go; if they say it is not okay, then of course they do not support it. So much for a new initiative in deciding their own direction for the country!
It is good to see that the opposition will support it overall, although they are going to play their own games by referring it to a Senate inquiry. Over what position—the fact that the government changed its view on this in terms of its arrangements with the Democrats? It is clear that it was an anomaly and that it should never have happened. Surely, we as a government have the right to say, `Well, yes, that may not have been appropriate. Let us consider taking this back to where we were before.' I think that shows commonsense on the part of the minister, who has shown strong support for the forestry industry and for those who work in it.
There is an attitude that has developed among some sections of the environmental movement, the Democrats and even some sections of the opposition that seems to suggest that forestry workers are some type of lesser individuals and are not working in the national interest. Of course the reality is quite the reverse. These are the people who provide the timber that is used right throughout Australia in construction, in providing homes 
 for families and in very worthwhile activity. Some 84,000 workers and their families are in the forestry industries. The coalition is committed to assisting those rural workers. It is very difficult to find replacement industries in the rural sector. There is lip-service given by the opposition to assisting people in regional areas in employment, but when the crunch comes there is always some reason why they find it all too hard. A lot of the new growth industries—e-commerce, finance, banking, development and tourism—has taken place in the cities. The growth that has occurred has, in many ways, bypassed sections of regional Australia. Here are real jobs in regional Australia. Here are 84,000 people working in regional Australia, and they should be supported.
The industry is important for its export potential. It is performing very significantly by providing export dollars. Members of the Labor Party often stand up and talk about the balance of payments situation. This is an area in which we can assist our balance of payments situation by assisting our forestry industry. It is in the building blocks of the economy, such as the forestry industry, that these decisions are made. If the forestry industry is not assisted, if it is not competitive with timber producers overseas, then contracts will go to those countries. While we need to be very mindful of environmental concerns, we also need to be aware of two key factors in regional areas—some 84,000 jobs and the great earnings that were produced last year, amounting to just on $1.3 billion, with paper board packaging and woodchip areas being the strongest components.
However, one of the most important aspects of this legislation is the concern for the environment. A responsible and sustainability focused Australian forestry industry should be supported as far as possible to relieve our demand for less responsibly harvested forest products. The reality is that, if we do not assist our own forest industry, we will be importing more and more from countries which do not have the same regimes and do not protect their forests to the extent that Australia does. In the global forests situation, it makes sense on an environmental basis to 
 assist our own industry, which meets the environmental credentials and guidelines that the minister has been championing. In fact, there is a temptation to act not on a global basis but locally and say to the greens, `We are on your side, we will stop all the axing of our forests.' But we should think on a global basis.
It is quite ironic that the bill would be opposed in the Senate by the minor parties as a result of their concern for environmental damage done through the use of fossil fuels. Maintaining forestry industry access to the full diesel fuel rebate is crucial to Australian industry to maintain its competitiveness. It is also important in the sustainability of the industry and the expansion of our forest estate.
The regional forest agreement signed between individual states and the Commonwealth of Australia maintains a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, an internationally competitive timber industry and an ecologically sustainable forest management across the whole of the forest estate, including production areas. The reserve system provides for ensuring the conservation of biological diversity within the system and these criteria include objectives to achieve reservation of 60 per cent of existing old growth forest and 15 per cent of the pre-1750 complete forest biodiversity. The 15 per cent of pre-1750 biodiversity target far exceeds the international level of remaining forest established by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN, and recognised by international conservation groups. That is, we have set ourselves and achieved a far harder target than that advocated by the green movement for all countries in the world, and of that we should be proud. Other nations are in fact less responsible in the way they go about harvesting the trees in their own area. By comparison, we can be rightly proud of the standards and the safeguards that we have established.
The ABARE figures show a $1.963 billion deficit in forest products. We are strengthening prospects for our wood product exports. It is clear that there is much to do before we can do without the $3.258 billion of wood 
 imports. Although our high wood product import level can be explained by a lack of an efficient domestic paper mill industry, Australia imported some $830 million worth of sawn wood last year. That is a situation which is very difficult to support in that we are losing our competitive position, we are importing product into Australia, we are blowing out the balance of payments situation because of this reliance on imported product. Were the forestry industry not to be assisted through the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, things would be made more difficult—so difficult that there would be more and more product imported into the country.
Given the fact that this country is ranked in the top three nations in terms of forest per capita, we should be able to supply our own needs, provide sustainable value added products for export and take some pressure off those forests in the world which are subject to threat. Yet disadvantaging the industry through the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme would certainly not help that situation and we would increase our reliance on foreign grown product. There are some well meaning environmentalists in the country, but I would urge them to think on a global basis. I believe that the Democrats cannot see the forest for the trees on this issue.
Through responsible harvesting practices, which has had the support of both sides of the House since 1992, we can manage our timber in a sustainable fashion. Production forestry does not result in the reduction of the forest estate. In fact, the national forest inventory shows that in Australia the area of forest is increasing. We have more forest now than we had a decade ago and we will have more forest in 10 years than we have now, even with a production forestry regime. Responsible forest management includes the retention of wildlife corridors which support tree-dwelling animals. Responsible management also has regard for retention of a diversity of plant life.
Australia is on track to achieve our 20/20 vision, a target of lifting annual plantation plantings threefold from 30,000 hectares per annum to 90,000 hectares per annum by the year 2020. Conservative estimates presently 
 put this figure at in excess of 50,000 hectares per annum.
So clearly we support these proposals. I support the minister and his efforts in managing this important industry. In conclusion, I just want to say that it is important that we take a global position on this, that we are wanting to assist our own industry to remain competitive. If we do not pass on these concessions, the cost of our product would increase, our ability to compete internationally would be eroded and the attractiveness of imported product would be further increased. This is not in the interests of our own balance of payments situation. It is not in the interests of global environmentalism, given the fact that Australia has a much higher standard of regulatory control and standards than exist in many countries overseas from where the product is drawn.
I am pleased to see that the opposition will be supporting this bill, even though they are referring it to inquiry because the government has changed its position. All power to the minister that he has come to this position—one, I am sure, that is welcomed around Australia by the 84,000 people who work in the forest industry, who provide real input in terms of jobs and in terms of economic growth in regional areas which is so needed right across this country.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—As has been indicated by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the opposition will not be opposing the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999 , but we have moved a second reading amendment which I think encapsulates some of the important considerations that this House ought to be turning its mind to in considering this bill.
The reason why we are considering the bill is the incompetence of the government. That is the simple explanation as to why we are debating this bill in the House today. Since this government came to office we have seen a succession of ministers in its first term having to leave the front bench for a variety of reasons. It has been a government that has not upheld parliamentary standards that are required of Australian governments. But, apart from that, there is another dimension to this 
 government's performance and that is its sheer incompetence in bringing forward its policy proposals and getting them through both Houses of this parliament.
I am rather intrigued that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, who sits at the desk today, in his second reading speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999 said this:
An inadvertent consequence of the passage of the overall package of amendments to the modified ANTS Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is that the forestry and timber processing industries would have been required to pay approximately 8c per litre more for off-road use of fuel than other agricultural industries.
`An inadvertent consequence'. Of course, if we go back to the particular agreement that was struck between the government and the Democrats, it states this:
The extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels will be limited to providing full credits for marine use, bush nursing homes, aged person's homes and private residents but not for construction, power generation, manufacturing or forestry.
There in the agreement that was struck between the government and the Democrats on the ANTS package is the specific exclusion of this industry from the particular concessions that were on offer to other industries.
Of course, when the legislation to give effect to what the government intended in this agreement came to this House, the changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme that were contained in the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Act 1999 specifically gave effect to the agreement between the government and the Democrats. Minister, I would hardly call it an `inadvertent consequence' of the passage of the overall package. It is hardly `an inadvertent consequence' when you bring legislation into this House that specifically gives effect to the nefarious agreement that you made with the Australian Democrats which excluded forestry. Now you have to come into this House with your tail between your legs—the great supporter of forestry industries in Australia, the great defender of working people who get a living out of this very important industry—and eat humble pie in the form of this bill to 
 straighten out the incompetence of the government in dealing with this matter.
The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is very important to the rural sector and to forest industries. It was a scheme that we supported when we were in government. It is a scheme that over time has had many problems. Part of the problem with the scheme has been over time its burgeoning cost and the complexity of its administration. These are two particular aspects that have bedevilled this scheme since it was introduced. In 13 years of government, Labor, mindful of the budgetary impact of the scheme, made significant amendments to it to make sure that in an administrative sense the capacity to rort it was reduced and that in a fiscal sense we were responsible in retaining it.
When this government came to power and it put before the Australian people the GST proposals that it said we would never have, a central part of the pitch to rural and regional Australia and, indeed, to the forest industries was the fact that the GST package as it related to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme would be particularly advantageous to rural and regional dwellers and to industries, such as the forestry industry, that use this particular fuel.
What we have here in the legislation before us is a deepening of the administrative problems and burdens associated with this scheme. We now find the government deeper in the mire with the very thing that we had hoped it would avoid in making adjustments to this scheme. We have always held the view on this side of the House that the claims that the government was making on the benefits to rural and regional Australia from the GST package and, in particular, the savings that would flow to rural producers, forestry operators and others in rural communities who use this fuel, were grossly exaggerated with regard to the benefits of the ANTS package put before this parliament and the Australian people.
We have always held the view that the benefits on diesel fuel that were touted by the government would not be realised to the extent that was claimed. In a political sense, we have seen in rural and regional Australia 
 how people in country areas view the Liberal and National parties. I say to the minister opposite and to the government, `If you really think you have taken a belting in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in rural and regional Australia, wait until people living in those areas really understand the implications of what you have put before them in the GST package.' If you go behind the rhetoric, you will find that the benefits claimed that should flow to the sector are not really there. They are not going to be there simply because the changes that have been made with the imposition of the GST, given the concessions that the government has made in the diesel fuel area, will not translate through to cheaper transport costs to the extent that the government has claimed.
There is a very interesting analysis that has been done on the impact of the government's measures on transport costs. I will not go into it again in this place; I already have in previous debates. But that particular analysis concluded that the bottom line is that the diesel fuel credit of 23c a litre will mean a reduction of 0.33 cents in the dollar in the cost of producing food and service sector outputs in rural and regional Australia. Here we have the government touting a particular fall in the price of diesel and parading this around rural and regional Australia saying that this is the greatest thing since sliced bread for farmers and others who live in these communities as well as other industries such as the forest industry. At the end of the day, all it will mean is a reduction of 0.33 cents in the dollar in the cost of producing food and service sector outputs in rural and regional Australia. When you take into account the enormous impact that the GST is going to have on living costs for people in rural and regional Australia, this gain, when translated into reduced prices for goods sold at the corner store in regional Australia is going to be very small. These businesses are going to be lumbered with a nightmare in terms of administrative costs associated with the GST and huge compliance burdens, so you can see that the gains that are being touted by the government to the sector with the amendments that have been made with respect to diesel fuel will simply not materialise.
When that happens and the penny drops, this government is going to find that what happened in the Victorian election is going to be repeated across the length and breadth of Australia. And so country people in rural Australia ought to take it out on coalition governments. We have the Liberal Premier beating his breast yesterday in the press saying, `Oh, I am sorry,' and then we have the Leader of the National Party saying, `Well, if we are in coalition with the Liberal Party again we are going to demand that things are done differently.' What a gutless lot they are in coalition.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I just raise the purpose of this particular bill. I can see that there is an association with the ANTS package, and I can allow that, but when one gets to some presumed or otherwise perceived dispute between two politicians that can hardly be considered relevant.
—I thank the minister and I do remind the honourable member for Corio that the bill is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, and I am sure he will continue in his attempts to be relevant.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I accept your ruling on the direction of the debate. I simply make this point in conclusion. The reason why we are debating this bill today is the incompetence of the government. The greatest deception perpetrated on the forest industries of this nation has been perpetrated by the minister who now sits at the desk.
—He is a fraud.
—He is more than a fraud. The government is a fraud.
—If the honourable member for Corio will resume his seat, I anticipate what the honourable minister will say. He is objecting to the member for McMillan calling him a fraud. I would be grateful if you would withdraw.
—With great deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw.
—No, not with deference to anybody. You just withdraw.
—What we have here in the legislation is really policy fraud because here we have a government that had put before the Australian people a deal that it had done with the Democrats which specifically excluded this industry. The minister knew it. The Prime Minister knew it. The coalition knew it. The National Party members knew it.
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—The member for Corangamite knew it. He knew it when he went into the Western District and spoke to the workers and the community in his electorate trying to whip up this frenzy about regional forest agreements. He was able to stand there in front of those people knowing that his own government was perpetrating this deception that they are trying to gloss over here today. I will leave my remarks there. Really this is the latest in a long line of incompetent policy backtracks that we have seen from the coalition, and the minister really ought to resign.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill must surely be one of the most incredible pieces of legislation to come before the parliament since the last election. At one level, the effect of the bill is relatively straightforward. It seeks to amend the Excise Act 1901 to align the rate of diesel fuel rebate for forestry use with that of agriculture, with effect from 1 July next year. In the words of the explanatory memorandum circulated by the government:
An inadvertent consequence of the passage of the overall package of amendments to the modified ANTS scheme is that the forestry and timber processing industries would have been required to pay approximately 8 cents per litre more for off-road use of fuel than other Agricultural industries. The intention of the Government was always that these industries would receive the same rebate amount.
We are thus invited to believe that we are merely correcting a simple mistake. But we are entitled to ask, as the Australian people are asking: how did this so-called mistake happen and who was responsible for the mistake?
To find out why the forestry industry was under the impression that it was not going to get the full rebate, you do not need to look 
 very far. In fact, you need only to read the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Act 1999 passed by this parliament at the behest of this government in June and given assent on 8 July. It said:
A declaration . . . may declare different rates for:
(a) the use of diesel fuel in primary production other than forestry; and
(b) use of diesel fuel in forestry.
However, the rate declared for use of diesel fuel in forestry must be 35/43 of the rate declared for use of diesel fuel in primary production other than forestry.
The inescapable fact that many members opposite know—and they have been onto the minister about this—is that this clause did not sneak into the legislation through an amendment moved by the Greens, Labor or Harradine; this wording, we are supposed to believe, was actually in the government's original bill by mistake. With the exception of Minister Tuckey's press secretary and the person who wrote the explanatory memorandum for this bill, everyone knows that that clause came to be passed into law in June. It happened because it was an integral part of the coalition's deplorable GST deal with the Democrats—those well-known friends of the forest industry. The text of the Howard-Lees GST deal is publicly available to everyone. The diesel fuel rebate section says, in black and white:
The extension to the off-road concession for diesel and light fuels will be limited to providing full credits for marine use, bush nursing homes, aged persons homes and private residences, but not for construction, power generation, manufacturing or forestry.
One would believe that someone in the government managed to send a copy of the agreement to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, and surely he read it and noticed that paragraph—one would hope he did. Despite their subsequent attempts to rewrite history, that is the package that the Prime Minister negotiated, that the Deputy Prime Minister defended, and that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation has been trumpeting around the place as a great outcome in regard to the GST. They were all obviously delighted to have brought the Democrats to get their long-sought GST.
As previous speakers have indicated, the opposition will not be opposing this bill. This is because we do not see why the timber industry should be the meat in the sandwich between the coalition's incompetence and the Democrats' duplicity. The fact that we are not opposing the bill does not mean that we accept the ludicrous claim that this bill is merely correcting a mistake that no-one knew about at the time.
In totally rejecting the government's claim, I remind the House of a raft of references to this matter on the public record. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, recently elevated to Deputy Prime Minister, commented on 29 May, `The size and scope of the rebates for diesel agreed with the Democrats will not change. That is the deal. The interests of rural and regional Australia have been protected.' They were not protected enough for them not to need this legislation.
Next we deal with two quotes from the Senate Hansard of late June. Senator Ian Campbell on 28 June commented:
. . . in the case of forestry, this industry will continue to have access to the rebate in the proportion that it currently receives.
If this were not enough to alert even the dimmest coalition member to what was going on, we then had Senator Lees, unable to resist the temptation to skite about what she had done. In the Senate next day, after Senator Campbell, she said:
In this bill we have increased the costs for forestry by 8c a litre. It is probably not something that we should point out to the National Party, but there it is, and that is what we have done in this legislation.
Senator Lees was not hiding under a bushel; she was making it quite clear that this government had come to a deal with her with regard to diesel and the forestry industry.
At this point, surely even the Minister for Forestry and Conservation should have woken up to what was happening, but apparently not. We are supposed to believe that he was really a latter-day reincarnation of the television character, Sergeant Schultz, famous for always responding, `I know nothing.'
Next we turn to a media release issued by Chris Althouse from the Forest Protection Society on 3 July 1999 which said in part:
The Forest Protection Society members are outraged that an apparent backroom deal with the Democrats had singled out forestry for an 8c per litre penalty on the diesel fuel rebate, whereas all other users of the diesel, such as primary producers, received a full rebate of 43c per litre.
We can be pretty confident that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Forestry and Conservation were briefed about the release because it coincided with a demonstration by FPS members outside the Liberal Party Federal Council meeting that day in Canberra. Still the government maintained its silence and made no attempt to say that a mistake had been made or that there was a problem that needed to be rectified. As evidence of this, let me refer again to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson. On 4 July, in a very long interview which meandered through the matter of the Democrats and rural communities, he commented that there had been an understanding `because of the Democrats' concern about pollution and their view that what might loosely be called some ""non-sympathetic views"" of the forest industry in particular, where they will keep what they have but not enjoy the extension of the grant system'.
Once again, as late as 4 July, we had no remorse from the government, no hint that a mistake had been made—this mistake that the minister now parades before us. In fact, we had the man whose mission in life is supposed to be to protect the interests of rural and regional areas including, presumably, the timber industry, saying on national television that `nobody really says there are any serious anomalies there where the use of diesel in rural and regional areas is concerned'. After all these announcements from government members that there were no mistakes, that there was a clear deal with the Democrats, that this was the right policy and there were no anomalies, a mere seven days later the Minister for Forestry and Conservation either came clean or woke up to what had been happening. He said, `An inadvertent consequence of the passage of the overall package of amendments to the modified ANTS was 
 that the forestry and timber processing industries are required to pay approximately 6c per litre more for off-road use of diesel.'
That was not the intention, he commented, and steps would now be taken by the government to address the problem. After being told by all and sundry in the government—by the Deputy Prime Minister and everyone else—that there were not any mistakes, that there were not any anomalies and that it was a deliberate policy, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation finally told the Australian electorate that there had been an anomaly. From that day forth the government has steadily stuck to this fictional line: that it was a big drafting mistake that could easily be fixed without any cost to the taxpayers or without ratting on the Democrats.
You do not need to accept the word of the opposition that these claims are a complete untruth. Already, confirmation of the true situation was provided by Senator Allison from the Democrats. She said in the West Australian on 13 July that everyone understood this meant a reduction in off-road diesel rebates for the forest and timber industries. There was absolutely no lack of clarity on this. It was very straightforward.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,1999-09-23,"—by leave—I thank the House for this opportunity to report on the outcomes of my visit earlier this month to four South American countries, and on the meetings of the Cairns Group and APEC that I also attended.
In Buenos Aires, I chaired the 19th Ministerial Meeting of the Cairns Group of fair trading agricultural nations from 27-29 August. Coming less than three months before the World Trade Organisation meeting at Seattle, which is expected to agree on an agenda and a framework for WTO trade negotiations, the Cairns Group meeting could not have been more timely. I am pleased to report that, in a strongly worded communique, the group reaffirmed its commitment to an ambitious liberalising outcome from the next round of agricultural negotiations and agreed to work closely during the lead-up to Seattle.
The meeting reconfirmed the group's ambitions for freer, fairer and more market oriented global trading conditions, with trade in agriculture placed on the same footing as trade in other products. The group agreed that, at Seattle, they would push for a clear and detailed mandate for agricultural negotiations to ensure they begin on time, conclude before 2003, and have clear objectives.
The group also welcomed the strong message of support from Mr Dan Glickman, US Secretary for Agriculture, who was a guest at the meeting and who assured us that the United States would not agree to any WTO outcome that did not include a good result on agriculture. Given the broad convergence of Cairns Group and US interests, Secretary Glickman agreed that the United States should cooperate closely with the Cairns Group in the lead-up to Seattle and beyond. Secretary Glickman's presence also gave me another opportunity to convey Australia's continuing concerns over the US decision to restrict Australian lamb exports, and also to seek details on the United States' 
 proposed $US7.5 billion emergency farm aid package. Secretary Glickman assured me that the proposed package would not breach US obligations under the WTO. Cairns Group ministers agreed to meet next in Seattle, on the eve of the WTO conference, and again in Canada next year.
During my trip to South America from 27 August to 5 September, I visited Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. Highlights of those visits included the signature of a double taxation agreement with Argentina, the opening of the new Australian Consulate-General and Austrade office in Lima and an IDP Education Australia office in Sao Paulo, as well as high-level official and business contacts in all countries that were visited. My meetings with Australian business representatives emphasised the trade and investment opportunities for Australian companies in the region, particularly in the mining, agribusiness, infrastructure and services sectors.
The rapid development of these markets demonstrates the effectiveness of the government's policy of encouraging greater market diversification by Australian exporters. Merchandise exports to South America were valued at just $200 million in the mid-1980s, but have grown to around $900 million in 1998-99. While Australia's exports are concentrated in the minerals and resources sector, exports of manufactures have grown strongly in the last decade and now account for over 40 per cent of all exports. With merchandise imports from South America valued at $550 million in 1998-99, Australia enjoys a substantial merchandise trade surplus with the region. South America is also a promising market for services. Australian exports of services now exceed $250 million. Apart from traditional areas like banking, finance and mining, there are also new opportunities in education, superannuation, health and telecommunications.
Investment, estimated at $3.6 billion in mid-1998, has been the cornerstone of Australia's involvement in the region. South America's strong resource and agricultural base has been attractive to Australian companies—particularly the mining sector, but the range of Australian investment is diversifying. The 
 longer term economic outlook for the countries I visited is positive. All have massive natural resources and increasingly affluent populations, and are moving towards more open markets. Opportunities in South America warrant a fresh look by Australian businesses. The government is doing its part to help, as the new trade  focused consulate-general in Lima demonstrates. The current inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into Australia's trade and investment relationship with South America will provide a valuable review of Australia's links with this region.
Together with my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I attended the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Auckland on 9 and 10 September. I went with three key objectives: to produce a strong unambiguous statement of support by APEC for the launch of a new WTO round; to maintain the emphasis in APEC on trade and investment liberalisation and to ensure that individual action plans reflect a determination to meet the Bogor goals; and to highlight the useful trade facilitation work that has been done by APEC and to accelerate progress where possible.
I am pleased to report that the ministerial and leaders meetings delivered strong outcomes that very much met these objectives. We now have an unambiguous commitment by the Asia-Pacific region to a pragmatic set of negotiations that deliver substantial improvements in market access. The agreement forged by APEC in Auckland, which has set the scene for a successful WTO meeting in Seattle, includes: a call for comprehensive market access negotiations, including on industrial tariffs in addition to agriculture and services; agreement that the round should be completed in three years as a single package without precluding the possibility of implementation of early results on a provisional basis, including the accelerated tariff liberalisation package; and, on agriculture, a commitment to participate actively and constructively in the negotiations and support for the elimination of agricultural export subsidies and unjustifiable export prohibitions and restrictions. 
Another significant outcome of the meeting was agreement to improve APEC members' individual action plans—the documents which record the steps economies have taken, or will take, to reach the APEC goals of free and open trade and investment. I will be working hard to ensure that the individual action plan process delivers better market access for Australian companies and that the plans themselves are improved. To this end, Australia will provide technical assistance to help developing economy APEC members produce better plans. I presented Australia's own individual action plan to APEC in Auckland. I have the pleasure of tabling it today for the information of honourable members. I commend it to the House.
I also used the margins of the APEC meeting to launch a study on the benefits to APEC members of opening up sugar markets in the region. Australian sugar producers are the most efficient in the world and I will be doing all I can to highlight the distortions in global sugar trade, including at the WTO meeting in Seattle.
The other outcome from Auckland with which I was closely involved was an agreement to boost business facilitation. APEC's work on streamlining standards, customs procedures and business travel, and in other areas, complements the more traditional trade liberalisation work and reduces costs of conducting business in the region in a very concrete and direct way. For example, the Auckland meeting signed off on a new mutual recognition agreement on conformity assessment for electrical and electronic goods, which could take five per cent off the production costs of this $US250 billion regional trade, saving exporters and consumers up to $US12.5 billion a year, once fully implemented. APEC ministers agreed in Auckland to give more attention to this practical kind of work and to involve business groups more in setting priorities and taking advice.
The Cairns Group and APEC meetings have laid the groundwork for the crucial WTO meeting in Seattle. I am encouraged by the great support Australia has generated for its WTO objectives. Our government is deter 
 mined to pull out all stops to ensure that those objectives are met.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,"<title>Report on Visit to South America, and the Meetings of the Cairns Group and APEC</title>",Ministerial Statements,16,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—by leave—I wish to make a brief statement on the same matter. The three priorities on which the minister has reported are indeed fine priorities. The Cairns Group is a fine initiative of former Labor trade minister John Dawkins. It needs the ongoing care and attention of Australian trade ministers and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The tradition that trade ministers, when they go to Cairns Group meetings in Latin America—which occurs every second year—should use that opportunity to make bilateral visits to our major trading partners in Latin America is a fine tradition started by me. The APEC initiative, particularly the Bogor agreement that is driving APEC, is another fine Labor initiative. So it is hard to say that the three issues about which the minister has reported are not very worth while. But, in responding to each, I want to comment on each of those matters and on where this leaves us with the new WTO round fast approaching.
With regard to the Cairns Group, the minister has given us a potted summary of the objectives of the Cairns Group but nothing of the challenges it will face and how it intends to meet them. Even worse, there seems to be no sense in the minister's statement that reflects how the Cairns Group fits into the overall trade picture. For example, eight of the 15 Cairns Group countries are also members of APEC, but there is no mention in this statement of how that substantial bloc in favour of agricultural trade liberalisation could have played a role at APEC. It reminds us on this side of the Cairns Group communique from Buenos Aires which read more like a tirade against agricultural protection than a strategy for removing the barriers that cost Australian farmers so dearly. It might also have been recycled from the year before with just the names and the date changed.
Finally, Mr Vaile said that the US Secretary for Agriculture, Dan Glickman, assured him that the $US7.5 billion aid package to US farmers did not breach WTO rules. What would you expect him to say—that it did? But there are some more fundamental ques 
 tions for him to deal with which you would expect would be in the forefront of the mind of a former agriculture minister. In particular, will the US package hurt Australian farmers? If so, what does the Minister for Trade intend to do about it? We look forward to hearing the answers from Mr Vaile on this matter on subsequent occasions.
With regard to the South American visit, I welcome the fact that the minister continued the tradition of visiting South American countries in the course of his Cairns Group visit and that he focused on trying to get some improvements on market access in those important emerging markets. But, while the minister is focusing on market access, there is a much bigger game being played out, and that is the free trade agreement game. Negotiations are currently occurring on free trade agreements between a range of Asian countries and their South American trading partners—for example, between Japan and Mexico, between Singapore and Mexico and between Korea and Chile. All of these agreements, if they were to succeed, would have profound implications for Australia.
But it is not only that we are not being asked to play in some of these games. Even where we are asked to play, we seem to have chosen to sit on the sidelines. The one potential free trade agreement that might include Australia is known as P5, made up of the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Chile and Singapore. However, despite frequent entreaties from the New Zealanders, we are refusing to put any real work into P5 whatsoever. Why? It is almost impossible to know, because the minister has made no public statement about it. Perhaps trade, for this government, is limited to issues of trade promotion.
With regard to APEC, everybody knows that Labor feels passionately about APEC, which is why in June the Leader of the Opposition gave a pathway speech focusing on it and why the shadow minister for trade, Peter Cook, produced a 27-page discussion paper on it. We cannot help despairing as we watch the organisation drift under the Howard government. The minister's goals for Auckland give some idea of where the organi 
 sation has got to. Labor had urged the government to grasp the nettle of achieving the Bogor goals: free trade by 2010 for developed countries and by 2020 for developing countries. We pointed out that the next WTO round will be the last round to be completed before 2010, so if Australia wants to see the Bogor goals achieved we need to get them up at the WTO. And that meant APEC members agreeing to take them to the WTO. Instead, anxious not to aim for something which it was not absolutely sure it could achieve before it started, the government just opted to have APEC members endorse a new round. They had already done that before they came, so that was a modest objective if ever there was one.
Mr Vaile's two other goals for APEC are vacuous in the extreme. Goal No. 2 is to maintain the emphasis in APEC on trade and investment liberalisation. This is, after all, the core of what APEC is all about. It would be very difficult for it not to focus on its raison d'etre. Goal No. 3 is to highlight the useful trade facilitation work that has been done by APEC. So it is not surprising that the minister was able to declare success. If you aim low enough, you will always succeed.
With regard to the broader issue and very important issue of the WTO, today's statement will do nothing to reassure those who were looking for a sense of drive and vision at November's Seattle WTO meeting. Already we are being told privately that the minister is not sure whether he wants to liaise with Australian business at Seattle. Conditions for liberalising world trade are better than at any time in the past 20 years, but there is no sense that this government and this minister are ready to play the leading role that Australia has played in the Uruguay Round. So we welcome the statement, but we are disappointed with the limit to its ambitions. However, we welcome the fact that the minister continues the tradition of reporting on these matters on return, particularly from the Cairns Group and from APEC.

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—There would probably be no need for an MPI of this nature to be introduced into this place today had the Minister for Defence, when questioned by me yesterday in a genuine attempt to elicit some information about the reserve forces and the deployment of troops in East Timor, come into this place and given the answer that he gave today in a prepared statement to a question from one of his own. The response from this minister in parliament this afternoon in suggesting that the reason for me raising a question yesterday was scaremongering is a long way from the truth.
What the parliament has to understand and what all Australians have to understand is this: Australia presently is in the process of building up to a commitment of the largest overseas force in 30 years. Australia is in the process of committing 4,500 troops to East Timor for good, sound humanitarian reasons. Australia is in the process of committing something like 10 per cent of the total ADF to an operation overseas which will, by necessity, see the need for those troops to be rotated. Why do I say that? I say that because any force structure planning that goes to the heart of an operation such as Operation Stabilise must make contingency plans for the deployment of troops and to rotate those troops over a period of time.
The United Nations resolution that sees Australia as the leader of the multinational force in East Timor is open ended: there is no time constraint for that particular operation to conclude. I—like the minister and everybody else in this place, I am sure—would want to see that operation conclude quickly. We would like to think that the United Nations Blue Helmets will take over from the multinational force as quickly as possible and we would like to think that Australia's fighting men and women that are in East Timor at the present time will return home as quickly as is possible and as safely as is possible.
But the minister's response yesterday and the general attitude that he displays in this place to questions about defence issues generally do not give us a lot of comfort because the simple fact is there is no place for complacency at the present moment. I remind members that today, in the news reports that have been coming in over the Internet, we find that Australian troops are actually involved in shootings and confrontations involving militia in East Timor.
We are seeing threats being made—and I will quote one from a report. Apparently witnesses have said that there are about 500 pro-Jakarta militiamen massing in the town of Liquica, west of Dili, saying they would mount an attack on foreign peacekeepers. `We want war,' one of the camouflage wearing militia said, and this report goes on to quote an East Javanese territorial battalion major—that is, from the Indonesian army—saying:
We will be departing from East Timor soon, maybe today. After today all hell will break loose.
The simple fact is all hell will break loose in East Timor. The fact is that we have a commitment there of Australian fighting men and women to do a job that everyone in this parliament supports. The sentiments that have been expressed in here have been unanimously carried, as they should be. But the fact of the matter is that the minister, by his attitude in answering a question put to him yesterday—as has been his attitude when questions have been put to him in this place on previous occasions—does not give us confidence, and the newspaper reporting of that is just extraordinary. 
The Minister for Defence stood up in this place and said the question of the rotation of troops and the use of reserve forces to supplement our troops in East Timor was a matter that would be considered when it was relevant. Forty-five minutes later, the ADF spokesman on East Timor matters was briefing the media, telling them all of the contingency plans for putting the reserves into action, and 24 hours later the minister comes in with a prepared answer that basically mirrors what that man said. Twenty-four hours later he comes in with the answer to the question that he could have put at the time!
Whilst his office was then denying that it actually had the reserve plans in operation, members of this place had people ringing their offices saying, `Guess what: the military has been on the phone asking us if we want to come back into active service.' But the minister's office is out there denying it in the media saying, `No, this isn't the case.' Peter Costello gets on the radio and says, `Well, actually, yes, it is.' He says:
We'll have to ensure those troops have full equipment, allowances, support, rotation, leave. It will require another brigade, which we are already raising.
So you have the military raising the brigade, the military talking about reserves and Treasurer Peter Costello talking about reserves, and the reserves in this case are the Army Reserves. You have people like Hugh Smith of the Australian Defence Force Academy saying that the ADF is very stretched and that, when it comes to training people to go on overseas deployment out of the reserves, those people need to be brought up to a standard that will take a considerable number of weeks.
You also have the people referred to in question time this afternoon—for example, the President of the Defence Reserves Association, Major General Warren Glenny—also talking about the need to boost recruitment. We have the very fact that under this government we have seen our reserve numbers fall 50 per cent short of the recruiting targets in the last 12 months. We have seen this government change the Workplace Relations Act so that anyone who wants to serve in the reserves is going to be penalised because it is 
 no longer an allowable matter. In other words, employers will not give them time off.
We have asked the minister if he will do something about that and, to his credit, in his answer today in question time he did say that was an issue that he was going to talk through with the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. I hope he will. I hope that not only will he talk it through but that he will get the change that is necessary. I will give a commitment—and I am looking on our side for the shadow minister for workplace relations; he is not here but I will give it anyway—that if the minister brings in the change that will eliminate that particular issue from the agenda altogether we will pass it quickly.
—Hear! Hear!
—We will pass it through both houses just like that, Minister. So go and have a talk to P1. Have a chat to him, see if he is prepared to do it and we will be there with you.
—P1 or P2?
—Well, it's P2 but they are interchangeable, aren't they? They are all indispensable or are they not dispensable?
—They're both indispensable.
—P1 or P2—we do not care. But there are other things that this minister must be doing at the moment, and we raised some of them in question time today. This minister must be talking to the ministers for defence in the coalition forces to ensure that those commitments are there. I raise with you, Minister, in this MPI our ability to sustain a deployment because of the concern that this operation is open ended. If we suddenly find that this operation is going to go on for a considerable time, what guarantees do we have that the other countries that are participating or are giving commitments to participate in this deployment will still be there?
What commitment is there that after, say, three months, as we get to Christmas, our partners in this multinational force will continue to be there? Will they stick? The minister must be on the phone to them. The fact that this place is so dangerous—we already have the leader of the contingent 
 saying on the public record that his forces are stretched—and the fact that all of the troops have yet to be deployed demands that the minister be on the phone, on a daily basis, talking to the ministers for defence in the countries that have agreed to deploy as part of the multinational force and, importantly, ensuring that they are going to stick.
The minister must also try to re-establish some contact with General Wiranto. It is all well and good for the Prime Minister to say, `I have not spoken to President Habibie for a couple of weeks,' and for the Minister for Defence to say that he has not spoken to General Wiranto, the defence minister for Indonesia, for a couple of weeks, but the fact is that there are still Indonesian soldiers in East Timor. The reports coming across the wires today indicate that Indonesian soldiers may in fact be firing on Australian soldiers. The minister has to talk to General Wiranto on a regular basis and establish some dialogue. There is no point whatsoever in saying, `I can't get him on the phone.' The minister must try. The minister also has to get a bit of intelligence—I do not mean that in the normal sense; well, maybe I do—so that he is continually on top of the brief. He has to ensure that the intelligence coming out of East Timor from the ADF—the fine men and women that are serving Australia so well—is being digested so that if questions are put to him in this place, to try to elicit information, he is able to stand up and respond appropriately.
The minister must also continue to liaise and consult on a regular basis with senior Defence officials. It is no good for this minister to come into this House, dismiss the concerns we have about raising the Ready Reserves—which we would like to see put back in place, I might say—and dismiss altogether the concept of reserves taking part and say, `We will worry about rotation and deployments and so on when the need arises.' The minister must come in here and be prepared on a daily basis to respond to these sorts of concerns. The minister, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition—in both Darwin and Townsville when we were all up there together to farewell the troops—spoke fine words about the job that the troops 
 would do for Australia. Their families back here in Australia demand that the minister knows what is happening at a time when Australia has deployed the biggest offshore contingent in 30 years. They must be convinced that the minister will not simply glibly throw away any concerns that are directed towards him.
We would also like to know whether the minister, as part of this rotation process, as part of the process of calling up the reserves, is looking at opportunities for our full-time defence personnel serving in other theatres to be redirected to East Timor. For example, is the minister considering recalling some of the troops that we presently have on peacekeeping duties in Bougainville, redirecting them to East Timor and replacing them with reservists because he believes that it is not as dangerous in Bougainville as it is in East Timor? We would like to know that. I am sure the people on Bougainville would like to know that. I am sure people elsewhere, and their families, would like to know something about that.
Has the minister finally found out, given that the contingency is now in East Timor, whether medical practitioners will be available to give service to our serving men and women should the need arise? When a question was put to the minister some weeks ago about the level of availability of those people, he glibly said, `They will be there when they are ready and when they are needed.' Well, they are needed now, and we would like to be assured that they are in fact going to be there.
The simple fact is that the circumstances of East Timor are dangerous. While the scenes of East Timor that we are seeing on our televisions at night may not be any longer filled with vision every couple of seconds of marauding militias with home-made guns or machetes hacking into people, or people throwing rocks, they are being replaced with discoveries of mutilated bodies in the bottom of well shafts. We are being told about journalists being murdered. We are talking about Australians going into buildings in Dili unable, necessarily, to convince everyone that they can secure the environment around Dili—let alone out around other locations. We want to know, and the people of Australia and 
 the families of those serving men and women in East Timor want to know, that the minister is across his brief, that the minister has a handle on the responsibility he has.
The Prime Minister, for a variety of reasons that have been canvassed, went out and committed Australia to this action and we have the leadership of it. The defence minister has the responsibility for the welfare of those people serving there. In question time today the Prime Minister said, in reference to his ministers, `indispensability comes to quality'. The funny thing is that, when the Prime Minister was talking about potential leaders to replace him in the interview that he gave to Howard Sattler today, he mentioned Alexander Downer and John Moore, but when the transcript was put out by the Prime Minister's office—guess what?—John Moore, you were missing. You have been missing for a number of weeks now. Show us that you are across your portfolio. Show us that, as the defence minister, you are concerned about those people in East Timor.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>East Timor: Australian Defence Force Deployment</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Moore, John, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—The member for Cunningham is a nice guy. He is popular around the House, but he makes a dreadful spokesman for defence. He comes up and away he goes with a series of allegations. He is not aware of the facts. It is nice to take him around to some of these shows, but he needs to get up with the facts. The ADF is adequately resourced. We can maintain a deployment of 4,500 troops in East Timor for 12 months. We can rotate those forces within that 12-month period.
The issue we are considering today is a critical one. It is therefore important that we be aware of the background of this historic deployment. As we all know, the government supported the decision of the Indonesian government—a tripartite agreement set out on 5 May—to hold an action of consultation in East Timor on 30 August. It is well known that Indonesia had responsibility for security in the period surrounding the ballot and that on the day of the vote there was very little disturbance. We acknowledge the role of the Indonesian government in achieving this.
The widespread violence after the ballot, however, was completely unacceptable. Since 
 then the Australian government has worked tirelessly to help stabilise the situation and to provide a path for the will of the East Timorese people to be given effect. We were well pleased when the Indonesian government announced its decision to accept a multinational peacekeeping force. The Australian government worked very closely with the international community to obtain the agreement of the United Nations to allow the deployment of troops into East Timor.
The United Nations Security Council reached its resolution in an incredibly short time. The UN mandate is a strong one, and we believe it fully meets INTERFET's requirements. The mandate authorises INTERFET to restore peace and security in East Timor, to protect and support UNAMET and to facilitate humanitarian assistance operations. Importantly, INTERFET is authorised to take all necessary measures to fulfil the mandate.
At the request of the United Nations Secretary-General, Australia accepted the leadership of this peacekeeping force. Major General Peter Cosgrove, one of Australia's most distinguished service-in-combat soldiers, has been appointed to the commander's position, and I am sure that all Australians are very proud of the role that he and his colleagues are playing. This was all achieved within the space of three weeks, and that is worth recording. I have certainly never seen that before. It is a great credit to the diplomatic efforts of the Prime Minister, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and senior officials of our departments.
This deployment is a very important one. As I said in the House earlier this week, it clearly meets the test of Australia's national interests. We have a vital strategic interest in promoting peace and stability in East Timor. Without that peace and stability we cannot be confident of our own security, so our leadership of INTERFET not only is about being a good international citizen but equally is about promoting regional peace, security and Australia's national interests.
It is our objective to ensure that the United Nations process moves back on course as soon as possible. Our aim is for phase 3 of 
 the United Nations process—the period after the Indonesian parliament ratifies the 30 August vote and a United Nations transition authority takes over—to commence as soon as possible. The intention of the Australian government is for the multinational force to carry out its mandate and to hand over to the United Nations transition authority as soon as possible. Currently, phase 2 of the operation, INTERFET is expected to last for up to four months.
I would now like to turn to the current status of the INTERFET operation. As of this morning, there were 2,750 personnel deployed in East Timor, comprising some 2,416 Australians and 282 foreign forces. Another 987 Australian personnel are serving on ships involved in Operation Stabilise. The build-up of troops, stores and equipment will continue today through both the port and Dili airport.
INTERFET is continuing to develop its operations. Yesterday the Bacau airport was secured by Company Group in preparation for the deployment of further INTERFET forces. A suspected militia location in the Tropicana Hotel in Dili was investigated by INTERFET forces yesterday. A cache of approximately 40 weapons, mostly handmade, were discovered and five personnel were detained for questioning. Twelve Black Hawk helicopters are now located in Dili. Security elements will be deployed to Dare and Uamori today. Twenty C-130 sortis, of which nine are Australian, have been planned between Darwin and Dili today, including three air drops of humanitarian aid—two by Australian aircraft and one by French aircraft. A total of 85 C-130 sortis, 52 of them Australian, have been completed between Darwin and Dili up to and including yesterday. This includes six humanitarian drops delivering over 100,000 pounds of food and supplies.
As far as the current state of the INTERFET coalition is concerned, firm commitments have now been received from 12 countries. These are the Philippines, the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand, Italy, France, Canada, Ireland, Brazil and Malaysia. Eight other countries have indicated a willingness to contribute but actual commitments have not 
 yet been agreed. These countries are Fiji, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Egypt, Mozambique, Norway, Spain and Denmark. International contingents continue to arrive in Australia and will be deployed in Dili in due course as part of the force build-up. Forces or elements from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and the US are located in Darwin and will continue to deploy to East Timor. Brazil and Italian force elements are undergoing force preparation in Townsville prior to deployment. This has been an excellent deployment and an excellent example of international cooperation between nations. I commend the ADF on this well-planned and well-executed operation. I thank the nations involved for their contributions and, in particular, for their speedy response to the request from the United Nations.
I now turn to the issue of sustainability of our contribution to INTERFET and East Timor. Clearly the scale of our deployment in East Timor is posing major challenges for the ADF. However, because of the decision we took in February this year to raise the readiness of a second brigade, we have now available to us sufficient forces to deploy and maintain on East Timor a contingent of up to 4,500 personnel for a year. This includes sufficient forces to allow for a rotation of the units. The government has been advised by the ADF that they are planning for units to spend no more than nine months on deployment, and if possible less. These are operational matters.
The government has very close contact with the leadership of the ADF and will naturally act on its advice on this important matter. As I said at question time, we are also conscious that our troops in East Timor have families back here. Within the bounds of the operational requirements, we will try to provide as much certainty for families as possible regarding the expected duration of the deployment. We hope that, within a year, the situation in East Timor will have improved to the point that our forces can be withdrawn, or at least significantly reduced. We are currently working with the United Nations to ensure this occurs, but the government recognises that 
 there is a possibility that we may need to sustain the deployment longer than that.
Our present force will allow us at the same time to maintain significant forces to deal with other contingencies, may they arise, and to ensure that we have the forces for critical national tasks, such as a counter-terrorism response for the Olympics.
I would now like to turn specifically to the important issue of the possible need for rotation of the Australian contingent. This is an issue that has been under close consideration by the government. Firstly, we need to be clear that the current mandate should not be seen as a substitute for the tripartite agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations. The purpose of the current deployment is to create the conditions on the ground that will permit the process put in place under the agreement to get back on track as quickly as possible. If this can be done quickly and effectively, there should be no need for the rotation of the forces currently in East Timor. We intend to work vigorously towards that outcome. All parties to the mandate are keen to see the situation on the ground stabilised to the point where we can transfer the mandate for a peace enforcement operation to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in support of a United Nations transitional authority in East Timor.
Australia will, of course, contribute to the peacekeeping force as well as to the transitional authority. The nature and scale of our contribution to phase 3 of the peacekeeping force will be tailored to the situation at that time. I can say, however, that I expect we will not need to deploy on the same scale as under the current peace enforcement mandate. It is likely, however, that phase 3 of the peacekeeping force will be required to support the transitional authority in East Timor for some considerable time. Accordingly, my department is now planning the likely manpower and resource requirements to allow an effective ADF contribution to such a force. Our initial studies indicate that the support for phase 3 of the peacekeeping force could largely be sustained from within the current force structure. There is a need, however, for prudent planning in case the peace enforce 
 ment operation under the current mandate needs to be extended beyond the current projections for phase 2.
As I said in question time, I am advised that the current manning levels are robust enough to support a projected ADF contingent of some 4,500 personnel, including any requirement for rotation, for a period of at least one year, although additional resources will be required to cover equipment and operating costs. Any extension of the current mandate beyond the 12 months would require some form of expansion to maintain a force at the higher end of the scale. This will require an early decision on the requirement to raise additional regular elements based on 7 Brigade in Brisbane. My department is now doing the detailed planning work on this issue and I will take the matter to the National Security Committee very shortly. While I do not wish to pre-empt their consideration, I can say with great confidence that the government will take whatever decision is necessary to ensure that our defence forces are properly manned, trained, equipped and sustained to support our forces in East Timor, whether under the present peace enforcement mandate or under the phase 3 peacekeeping mandate.
The coalition has spent the last three years focussing Defence on its reasons for being: providing combat capability to protect Australia and its interests. That focus on combat capability through the Defence Reform Program has shifted resources from administrative areas to the sharp end. Because of this, there are more Regular Army personnel combat and combat related roles than when the coalition came to power. We have brought a second brigade sized group, 1 Brigade in Darwin, to a higher state of readiness, at 28 days notice to move. In December 1997 we introduced the Army individual readiness notice. Personnel must now meet set fitness requirements and be ready to deploy, focusing our individual soldiers on their need to be combat ready. So we are in a strong position to support any deployment.
Listening to the contribution made by the member for Cunningham today, I have to say I totally reject the scaremongering of the opposition on this matter. We do have suffi 
 cient forces to deploy and maintain a contingent of 4,500 personnel on East Timor for a year. That includes sufficient forces for a rotation of those units. The government is working closely with the leadership of the ADF to ensure that our deployment to East Timor is adequately resourced. That is the case at the moment and it will continue to be the case for the total period of the deployment. The government is committed to ensuring the ADF is properly resourced.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>East Timor: Australian Defence Force Deployment</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—It is a sad testimony to the gross inattention and incompetence of the Minister of Defence that we must have this debate today. On Tuesday this House, on a bipartisan basis, totally supported our contribution to INTERFET and we offered our best wishes and support for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are already in Timor or those who will be there in the near future. On that occasion, we highlighted the failure of the government to address a raft of issues regarding the Defence Force, and particularly the urgent need to rebuild the Australian Army Reserve. Our concerns have been met with denial and buck-passing by the government. The government continues to congratulate itself for acting in April to place a second brigade on 28 days readiness.
As I said on Tuesday, we have consistently supported the decision. But I remind the House of the time the minister told the Ten Network that placing two brigades on 28 days readiness would require a bigger base of reserves and improved cooperation from employers. What we need to know is what action he took on this very same requirement that he himself identified. The government continually had advice from military intelligence about what was really happening on the ground in Timor, particularly in relation to the integral links between the TNI and their surrogate militias.
Equally, it has been receiving advice for the best part of the past year about the poor state of the reserves. Indeed, a quick check through my own records reveals the following media releases and speeches of mine in 1999 on issues facing the reserves: 8 January, `Coalition policies harm reserve recruitment'; 15 
 February, `Army Reserve', in grievance debate; 20 April, `Liberals disown Reith on defence reserves'; 3 May, `Action needed on leave for defence reservists'; on 11 May, there was an MPI in this House with regard to the reserves; 11 August, `Scott unrealistic on reserve leave'; 20 September, `Government fails to recruit 2,300 defence reservists'. So there has been a long, hard effort by the opposition to alert this government to the problems of the reserves in this country.
Indeed, on the resumption of parliament for the budget sittings the opposition initiated a matter of public importance, highlighting:
The disastrous impact on the Defence Reserves of the Coalition's industrial relations and defence policies.
Then, as now, the government's response was denial on the one hand and, on the other, the false promise that it was, once again, looking into remedial measures for the reserves. This approach has continued this week, but in the changed context where we now have troops on the ground in Timor—troops potentially in harm's way who have a right to expect that this government and this parliament have in place proper contingency plans to support them and to replace them when the need arises. Yesterday my colleague the member for Cunningham asked the minister to:
. . . explain how Australia is going to rotate Australian troops deployed in East Timor, especially considering that the government abolished the Ready Reserve scheme, removed leave for Defence Force reservists as an allowable matter under the Workplace Relations Act, and allowed recruiting to the reserves to fall short by nearly half the target?
Most Australians would have thought that was an apt question, reflecting strong views widely held in this country, which needed a detailed response from the government. What was the substance of the minister's reply? The crux of it was:
. . . some 3,000 troops will be deployed in that province in the very near future, with full equipment, food, fuel and resources. As I said, the
question dealing with the reserves should be addressed to the minister assisting. The question of rotation will be dealt with when that becomes relevant.
It is not relevant now, apparently. What an appalling performance: fobbing off responsi 
 bility for the reserves to his junior minister and implying that the question of rotation was irrelevant at present.
Unfortunately for the minister's shrinking credibility—but fortunately for the Australian people—the Australian Defence Force had other ideas. Within hours of the minister dismissing the matter, the ADF's official spokesman on our Timor deployment, Colonel Duncan Lewis, told the media that a new recruitment drive was under way `because of the urgency of getting a rotation in place'—quite a contrast to the minister's assurances—that the 7th Brigade was being mobilised, that the reserves would be looked at and that former defence personnel would be encouraged back into uniform. Apparently, all this was news to the responsible minister—the Minister for Defence. His spokesman was quoted on the front page of the Canberra Times as follows:
The Government had not made a decision on boosting the 7th task force. the army could sustain the East Timor force for some time and there was no rush to enlist recruits.
Today the minister played games of semantics to avoid confessing the true situation; namely, that Colonel Lewis was right and the minister was totally wrong again. So despite the denials last night we now hear that, while the reserves `generally' are not needed, `specialist' reserves, such as dental and engineering personnel, are needed and that the government was again looking into the need to increase the readiness of additional battalions.
Later in question time the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Mr Scott, answered that the government was again looking into the reserves. This is an appalling state of affairs. The Minister for Defence does not know what is going on in the Defence Force. Every genuine problem raised is met with the response that the opposition is being alarmist—just like we were being alarmist for the last year with regard to what was going on in Timor on the ground. When they are finally forced to admit that there are unresolved problems, the two ministers say they are looking into a response. When they are finally forced to admit that there are unre 
 solved problems, the two ministers say that they are again looking into a response.
Of course, it is not just in the past 24 hours that our military leadership has been trying to give the government soundly based—but unwelcome—advice. Indeed, I have here today a copy of an official Headquarters ADF minute that was sent to the former Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Bronwyn Bishop, on 24 May 1996—more than three years ago. It has a very unambiguous heading: `Inclusion of leave provisions for Defence purposes in the Workplace Relations Bill. The minute begins by noting that on 9 April 1996—not 1999; 1996—the author had discussed with the minister the concerns of the official Defence Reserves Support Committee. They are people who put a lot of their time into promoting reserves in this country. He had spoken to the minister about:
. . . the impact the [Workplace Relations] Bill may have on the availability of Reservists and the consequences that would have on the ADF, particularly if existing provisions for leave for Reserve training were removed from Federal awards.
The minute was very perceptive. It went on to say:
As Reserve members constitute approximately 40 per cent of the ADF workforce, their continued availability for training, as currently provided for in awards, agreements and company personnel policies, is essential—
underline `essential'—
to Australian Defence Force capability. Existing awards have been important in providing institutional support for Reserves through the inclusion of provisions which allow leave for military training purposes for members of the Reserves. Over one hundred awards include leave provisions for Reserve training provisions.
I am pleased that the member for Herbert is here today, because, unlike the Australian Defence Force, he does not understand that over 100 Australian awards and agreements had these provisions. He told his electorate that there was no such thing in the Australian industrial relations system. The minute—that brief that the minister had 3½ years ago—further told Bronwyn Bishop:
If not identified as a matter for inclusion in awards, Reserve training leave may not be picked 
 up within either the Certified Agreement, Australian Workplace Agreements or other State Agreements which will increasingly supplant existing awards.
Although not one of the safety net employment conditions identified in the Bill, Reserve availability for training is critical to maintaining defence capability and award coverage of this issue is an important component of ensuring availability. The Bill should therefore include provisions which would permit awards to continue to cover Defence Force leave provisions.
So the people who actually know something about this in the Australian Defence Force—the people who actually have carriage of this, regardless of governments and regardless of the ineptitude of individual ministers—told this minister that he should stand up to the minister for industrial relations and basically stop that change.
 Whether it was Bronwyn Bishop or the current minister, there has been a serious dereliction of duty with regard to maintaining Australia's reserves. No doubt when the then minister got that advice she said she would be looking into the matter—just like her successor said today, more than three years later. In the meantime, things have gone backwards. Defence leave has been taken out of awards, recruitment of reserves is at its lowest level in living memory—all at a time when the ADF is involved in its biggest overseas deployment since the Vietnam War. So, indeed, there is a need to condemn this minister for the gross inattention he has shown his portfolio. Quite frankly, the bonhomie that he daily produces and the friendly quips across the House are not good enough in such a serious matter.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>East Timor: Australian Defence Force Deployment</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,1999-09-23,"—Today the matter of public importance put forward by the other side of the House states:
The need for the Minister for Defence to ensure that the Australian Defence Force can sustain its deployment in East Timor as part of the Multinational Force.
—It can.
—I agree with the interjection from the back: that is exactly what we can do. Because the Liberal-National 
 coalition is in government, we as a country are able to do just what the motion states. That is the important point.
Let us just look at the facts. We have been here for about 3½ years. What was the sustainability of our Defence Force when we first came to government? This is the critical point in relation to the matter of public importance put forward by the other side of the House. Let me remind the House that, under Labor, combat capability was run down, and it is about time that those on the other side of the House admitted it. The only evaluation undertaken after 13 years of Labor was one of self-assessment—it was carried out by the Army itself, not by us when we first came to government—being taken from the Army 21 document. I will quote from that document. It says `units not adequately prepared for combat' and `army lacks efficient combat power'. It says, `It would require substantial warning time and financial expenditure to mobilise for a major conflict.' Also, `With some exceptions, units are understaffed, poorly equipped and have low readiness levels.' That is from the Army 21 document, a self-assessment carried out by the Army and given to us when we first came to government.
After having had the coalition in government for only 3½ years, this country is now more combat ready than it has ever been in the last 25 years. We have put the resources into the sharp end; we have put them into the areas where they are needed. For the very same reasons for having a defence force, not only do you have to have combat capability but also you have to give the troops the resources to do the job that the government and the nation asks of them.
Let us look at some of the dividends that 3½ years of coalition government have brought about. I remind the House that, when we came to government to find that we had to deal with an appalling budget deficit, we quarantined the Defence budget from any savings measures. Let us look at some of the measures that we have been able to deliver in terms of combat capability.
We have been able to free up some 1,000 military positions from administrative func 
 tions and transfer them to combat and combat related duties. We have been able to refit the HMAS Tobruk and retain it in service. Under the opposition's policy, Tobruk would have been on the bottom of the ocean by now; it was to be scuttled. We know that ship is playing a vital role in the deployment in East Timor right now. We also have been able to lease the Incat catamaran, which is a vital part of the capability that we now have for this East Timor deployment. These are just some of the dividends that this government has been able to deliver.
On top of that, we have 1 Brigade in Darwin on 28-days notice to move. Effectively, this means that we have doubled our capability for an early deployment. That is as a result of the minister's taking forward to cabinet the decision that we needed to increase our capacity for combat capability. That is another one of the dividends brought about by this government. Mr Deputy Speaker, when you relate that and the other action we have put in place to the motion before the House, I think quite clearly you can see that we are able to sustain that deployment.
Let me give the House an idea of the numbers that we have in the ADF. With some of the scaremongering that is going on out there, I find quite irresponsible some of the armchair experts and their comments. What we have now are troops up in East Timor, and I think they are doing this country proud in the time-honoured tradition of the ADF. We as a government—and I note that the other side of the House supported the resolution the other day—have to be right behind those people. The last thing that this nation can afford is a situation such as the one we saw at the end of the Vietnam War. Because that war was politicised, those veterans, when they came back from Vietnam, never received their due respect from the community. We have to make sure that that does not happen in this country for any cheap political reason or for any people trying to take cheap shots.
Let me give you some idea of the numbers that we have. We currently have 23,000 Regular Army personnel. They have the basic soldiering skills that are needed in East Timor. Also, of active reservists, we have 
 something like 20,000 in the Army, 1,300 in the Navy and 1,600 in the Air Force. Those numbers include the additional personnel that we have been able to add by the common induction training that we introduced in January last year. Through the common induction training, we have been able to turn out 2,500 Army reservists who have received the same basic training as regular recruits who go into the Army. In other words, those reservists have had the same basic training that regulars have received. There are 2,500 of them, and they obviously could be trained to the same level as the regular force in a very short period of time; they could, and may, make an invaluable contribution, should we need to call on reserve numbers for rotation.
Let us contrast that with the Labor Party's policy on the Ready Reserves which they have been talking about in the last few days. The Ready Reserves scheme introduced by the Labor Party in 1990 peaked at around 2,500 personnel. What they did to put those Ready Reserves in place was cut two regular battalions. Their solution was a part-time Army, not a full-time Army. They produced 2,500 personnel, but to fund them they cut two battalions.
—But you haven't replaced them.
—The honourable member for Chifley.
—He makes a fair point, Mr Deputy Speaker. They haven't replaced them.
—We have. Quite clearly, we are making sure that we have not only combat capability but also Army reservists who are receiving the same basic training as those going into the regular force.
The Labor Party are saying that we should have made reserve leave part of the Australian workplace agreements. The fact of the matter is that there are now more reserve leave provisions in those agreements than there were in the awards. When I talk to the people out there in business, many of whom employ reservists, they say, `We would rather cooperate with the government and cooperate with the Defence Force than be coerced into employing someone and give them that leave 
 through the award system. We would rather work cooperatively with the reservists rather than be coerced.' That system is working.
We know that the Commonwealth Bank have it in their Australian workplace agreements. Telstra have it in their agreements. The Northern Territory administration have it in their agreements. Our system is working. I wish the opposition would get into the real world and see how it is working and get behind good public policy that not only supports small business but also supports the reservists who want to have leave as part of an agreement under the Australian workplace agreements.
I will quickly touch on the other problem we have in relation to recruiting. This is an important point. We have in this country a shrinking number of 17- to 24-year-olds. We have an ageing population in Australia today. As a result, we do not have the number of people we previously had in the younger generation. It is a problem. Career perceptions and lifestyle expectations have changed. The other thing is that the economy is strong and there are many more job prospects out there for young people. We do not think that is a bad problem. We can support the troops in East Timor and we can support the rotation. It is only the coalition that is going to be able to deliver. (Time expired)

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Housing Development at Parap Grove, Darwin.
The aim of the Defence Housing Authority is to provide housing for members of the Australian Defence Force and their families. The volume and location of housing provided must meet the operational requirements of the Australian Defence Force and other needs of the Department of Defence.
The Defence Housing Authority proposes to spot purchase 50 project homes within the Parap Grove development located within the Darwin suburb of Ludmilla, an established residential suburb located reasonably close to the city centre. This development will offer the Australian Defence Force personnel and their families a secure suburban environment with good access to community facilities, such as shops, schools, public transport and recreational facilities.
The Defence Housing Authority considers the spot purchase of these houses to be a sound commercial option. Market investigations have found that serviced land availability for detached dwellings in Darwin and its surrounding area is limited and there is a lack of suitable established Darwin residences for spot purchase.
These houses are required to be online and available for the December 1999 to end January 2000 posting cycle for the Australian Defence Force. The estimated cost of the proposal is $17.15 million at July 1999 prices. Subject to parliamentary approval, the Defence Housing Authority intends to enter into an agreement with the developer to spot purchase these project homes in November 1999. Settlement is to be completed by the end of January 2000 to coincide with the 
 posting cycle of the Australian Defence Force. I commend the motion to the House.

The Defence Housing Authority proposes to spot purchase 50 project homes within the Parap Grove development located within the Darwin suburb of Ludmilla, an established residential suburb located reasonably close to the city centre. This development will offer the Australian Defence Force personnel and their families a secure suburban environment with good access to community facilities, such as shops, schools, public transport and recreational facilities.
The Defence Housing Authority considers the spot purchase of these houses to be a sound commercial option. Market investigations have found that serviced land availability for detached dwellings in Darwin and its surrounding area is limited and there is a lack of suitable established Darwin residences for spot purchase.
These houses are required to be online and available for the December 1999 to end January 2000 posting cycle for the Australian Defence Force. The estimated cost of the proposal is $17.15 million at July 1999 prices. Subject to parliamentary approval, the Defence Housing Authority intends to enter into an agreement with the developer to spot purchase these project homes in November 1999. Settlement is to be completed by the end of January 2000 to coincide with the 
 posting cycle of the Australian Defence Force. I commend the motion to the House.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—As I indicated before question time, the opposition has cited a large number of government spokesmen—Senator Ian Campbell, the Deputy Prime Minister and others—with respect to their recognition that what happened in regard to diesel and the forestry industry was well known and was part of an understanding with the Democrats in return for the passage of the GST. Similarly, we have cited a variety of Democrats spokespeople, including Senator Allison and Senator Lees, who have been gleefully boasting how they pushed the government up against the fence and, because of their attempt to undermine the hardwoods forestry in this country, had persuaded the Prime Minister, in return for their support of the GST, essentially to ensure that forestry was not given the same level of support in regard to the rebate on diesel oil.
Throughout this time we never heard from the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. He was never sighted. I do not know whether he had not read the bill, whether he was away on holidays in Finland looking at a few forests over there, whether he just had too much on his plate, whether he had to contend with attacks on him by Minister Tehan in Victoria, and later by Minister Edwards in Western Australia or whether he had had blues with the minister in New South Wales, Mr Yeadon. I do not know whether his obsession with attacking every relevant state minister in the country was the reason why he missed this crucial bill for the industry, whether he really did not know what was going on or did not concentrate; I do not know what the reason was.
He came before the Australian people in the last month or so and said that this was all a big mistake. The Democrats leader did not 
 know that no understanding had ever been reached. Apparently Senator Lees was not at meetings where she, the Prime Minister and I guess the Treasurer came to this understanding. The Deputy Prime Minister apparently did not know what he was talking about. This had been a mistake. The Deputy Prime Minister was wrong to say that there was an agreement and that there were `no anomalies' in the legislation.
Today we have a situation where, on the one hand, with the government's ineptitude in allowing this measure to operate and also the Democrats' weakness, having passed the GST and condemned the Australian people to the effects of that, particularly lower middle income earners in this country, having reached that agreement, they now have to eat their words and essentially back off while the minister pushes forward to bring in this equal rebate.
The opposition supports the government's move because it is needed by the industry. Anything other than this would discriminate very strongly against it. The opposition reiterates that this has been a very sorry example of monumental duplicity on the government's part, monumental naivety on the Democrats' part and, if he is to be believed, monumental incompetence on the part of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"O'Byrne, Michelle",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The diesel fuel rebate returns to certain business all or part of the diesel excise they pay on diesel fuel used in their business operations. As from 1 February 1999, the excise on diesel fuel was 43.355 cents per litre. Forestry, along with agriculture and fishing, was included in the category of primary production. The rebate applicable to primary production was 35.027 cents per litre. The effective rebate rate was 35/43.
The  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999  seeks to redress the failure of this government to ensure the diesel fuel rebate is extended to forestry operations. The government's previous position outlined by the Prime Minister in late May indicated that `the extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels will be limited to providing full credits for marine use, bush nursing homes, 
 hospitals, nursing homes, aged persons homes and private residences, but not for construction, power generation manufacturing or forestry'. This ensures a full credit or a 100 per cent rebate for those nominated areas.
Changes to the diesel fuel rebate were contained in the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate) Act 1999. Subsection 5AAA allows for the declaration of different rates for the use of diesel fuel in forestry. The declared rate was set at 35/43 of the rate declared for use of diesel fuel in primary production other than forestry, or as Senator Lees puts it:
We have increased the costs by 8 cents per litre for forestry. It is probably not something that we should point out to the National Party but there it is.
This position would have meant that forestry and timber processing industries would have been required to pay substantially more for off-road users of fuel than other agricultural industries, despite the historical equity in the area of primary production. This position was greeted with harsh criticism from the industry and workers.
It is at this point that we start to see the unravelling of the Democrat-government deal on diesel fuel rebates because the minister claims that there was never an intention to give a lesser diesel fuel rebate to the forestry industry, that it was indeed an `inadvertent consequence'—an inadvertent consequence that Senator Lees was happy to claim as an achievement. The minister claims that `the intention of the government was always that these industries would receive the same rebate amount'. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry supports the claim that the impact was unintentional and in fact that the government always wanted to extend this concession to forestry.
The Democrats claim that the decision to exclude forestry was deliberately negotiated with the coalition, a position the government no longer subscribes to. In fact, according to a report in the West Australian regarding any modification to the government's position, Senator Allison of the Democrats said `that the move meant that Mr Howard was reneging on an integral part of the deal made to 
 secure Democrat support'. So we have the option of four possible truths before us. Did the minister pay so little regard to his portfolio area; was he so unconcerned about the future of the forestry industry that he did not even notice his government's failure to treat them as any other agricultural industry; was he always planning to renege once the government had its way and pay no regard to the negotiations with the Democrats; or was he prepared to gamble timber workers' jobs to get the GST through? After all, the minister admitted in an interview on 14 July that he had `anticipated that they'—the Democrats—`would not agree to this particular change being made'.
I am afraid that none of these options inspire confidence in either the operations or the integrity of this government. All we can see is incompetence, dirty deals and blatant disregard. This government, however, have achieved one thing with this debacle, but I am afraid the minister may also have to refer to this as an `inadvertent consequence'. They have said to timber workers, `There are other areas of so much importance that we will let you hang while we ensure passage of other legislation.' They have signified their willingness to take a risk on this issue but hasten to assure workers: `Don't worry because we never meant it, anyway.' The big question is how much of this process the Democrats were aware of. Did they agree to exempt forestry, with the full expectation that the matter would be redressed? Were they misled into believing the government supported their position?
The Democrats have not proven to be skilled negotiators with this government. They walked into the negotiation room with firm commitments to the electorate regarding the GST in hand and they threw them away. One wonders if they even put up a fight. They fell over then, but did they fall over this time? If they did not, they must find this bill very disturbing because it shows exactly what their deals are worth. What this deal has shown is that even when they take a stand they have no capacity to enforce it. The government is not bound by their agreements. In fact, their deals have been labelled `inadvertent consequences' and as such can be amended at will. The 
 government's escape clause? `We didn't mean it.'
This bill will ensure that the full rebate will now be payable for fuel purchased for eligible forestry activities from 1 July 2000 in line with the rebate for agriculture. Its practical application will be welcomed by timber industries and workers. However, it illustrates to the Australian community so much more. What this whole episode indicates is that there are many questions to be asked about the credibility of this government's deal with the Democrats. It depicts a sad story of incompetence, dirty deals and blatant disregard. I fear the Australian people are, and will continue to be, the victims.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—In speaking on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999 , I welcome the decision to amend what was a very discriminatory situation with the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The forest industry and timber processing industries would have been required to pay approximately 8c per litre more for off-road use of fuel than other agricultural industries and mining. This was a nonsense. It came about when all the wheeling and dealing went on with the Democrats when the GST was being negotiated. It was an absurd situation. There was such an outcry by the industry that the government has had to renege on its sleazy deal with the Democrats. Yet the Minister for Forestry and Conservation had the hide to say that the deal was not there. `No, no,' he said, `this was an inadvertent move that occurred during the passage of the documents.' Strange, isn't it, that every other report of its omission was put down to the deal with the Democrats and the passage of the GST?
When this government released details in May this year the wording seemed quite clear. With the motion that went through the Senate in June, the bill specifically limited the amount of rebate to 35/43 for diesel fuel used in forestry. Now the government says it was a mistake. The minister said that the full rebate will be payable for fuel purchased for eligible forestry activities from 1 July 2000, which will align the diesel fuel rebate for forestry use with the rebate for agriculture. Once again, the poor timber industry has been 
 taking the rap for the failure of this government to understand or to be involved in deals—somebody just being off to lunch. The timber industry was being used and held to ransom through a shabby deal.
There still seems to be a case as to whether this bill has gone far enough. It apparently restores only partially the parity between forestry and other primary industries. There is no case for the timber industry to face discrimination, particularly as it is the only sustainable resource industry that is able to put environmental benefits back into the community in the form of new forests that can deliver carbon credits. `How?' you might ask. Well, trucks and other machinery are not just used to take out timber; they are also used to prepare the ground and the roads and to develop seed beds for plantations or regrowth areas for new timber—you cannot say that about mining and other off-road users in other areas.
There are a number of flaws in the whole diesel fuel rebate legislation because the definitions are so fuzzy. I have had some difficult situations in my own electorate in trying to get people their rebates. I have spent quite a bit of time trying to interpret for my constituents what the definitions are. It really comes down to: when is a road a public road and when is it a private road? This can be a dilemma, I can assure you, in Tasmania.
Many of the roads that are used frequently by the public to pursue forestry, tourism, picnics, forest walks and the like—uses which are encouraged by both industry and local councils in these areas—are private roads that have been planned, built and maintained by private companies or by Forestry Tasmania. They have been opened to the public on the basis that it is good public relations to be transparent and open, to put on show forestry activities and to invite the public to see what is being done. Because of this, small contractors that get contracts from major companies or from Forestry Tasmania to build roads have real difficulties in claiming the fuel rebate. That needs to be dealt with in a fair and positive way.
This government keep tripping over their shoddy workmanship. They have tried to be 
 too clever by making deals here, there and everywhere without really understanding what the legislation meant. I thought I heard it said that the minister went to Europe—he probably chose the wrong time to go. He got lost because these negotiations were going on and people got stuck into the timber industry. Now he has had to come into the House and eat humble pie and present this bill. I support the opposition's amendment.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—When you distil this whole debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999  and everything to do with what we have seen here today, it comes down to being a dirty, filthy, shabby little deal which the Liberal Party has done with the Democrats to sell out the interests of blue-collar workers in the forest and forest products industry. That is what it is, Wilson, and you have been caught napping. You should be embarrassed, you are embarrassed, and you know it. We hear a lot of talk about how this government is all for blue-collar workers. I heard the Prime Minister today refer to how Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, is a champion of blue-collar workers—one minister, he said, who was the champion of blue-collar workers in the government. Let me make this clear: over on this side we have 30 frontbenchers who are the friends of blue-collar workers—not one frontbencher who is claimed to be a supporter of blue-collar workers.
Let us have a talk about the reality of the forest and forest products sector under Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. What have we seen of late when it comes to the forest and forest products sector? The sacking of the CSIRO Forest Products Laboratory in Clayton. What an absolutely disgusting performance! The work that was going on there was the future of downstream processing in this country. It would make sure that in electorates like mine there would be a viable future for the timber industry. And what do we see from the government? We see it prepared to sit back and see 37 skilled professionals sacked from a laboratory of 83 staff. 
When I talk about the sacking of the Forest Products Laboratory, I am talking in the context of the sacking of Rome. I am talking about its destruction and the destruction of all that knowledge—all laid to waste—because that is what we have seen under Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. He likes to talk the talk about how he is a great mate of blue-collar workers whilst, at the same time, he is selling out their interests. Selling out their interests is exactly what he did when it came to the diesel fuel rebate. He sold out blue-collar workers right across Australia. He did not care. He did not go into bat for them—or, at best, he did not know. At best, he was asleep at the wheel. His being asleep at the wheel is the best you could hope for when you analyse his performance. It was a disgusting and weak performance from this bloke—absolutely disgusting and absolutely pathetic.
When we consider the government's performance on regional Australia, I suppose we have plenty of reason not to be surprised at that sort of performance. Let us talk about unemployment in my electorate and in Gippsland. It has the second highest unemployment rate in Australia and nothing is being done about it. There is no adjustment package, no consideration and no compassion from this government. All it does is talk about the regional forest agreement process—`We support the regional forest agreement process.' And well you should, because it is a Labor initiative. That is why we on this side support it as well, but we recognise that it is not a panacea for everything confronting the forest and forest products sector.
You can always tell when Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, is getting desperate because he usually wheels out something about the RFA process and starts bagging out some state minister for the environment or forestry. That is simply because he has come up with nothing when it comes to the industry policy confronting the forest and forest products sector. He has done nothing creative to ensure a viable future for this most important sector. Increasingly, the forest and forest products sector is taking on a greater importance in regional Australia 
 because the federal government is pulling out services from those areas. As it pulls services out, there are fewer and fewer jobs there. The only jobs remaining are those jobs in the forest and forest products sector, and these are exactly the jobs which the Minister for Forestry and Conservation is ensuring will not have a future because of his sacking of the Forest Products Laboratory in Clayton.
It is a weak performance. Any sort of competent minister who had an interest in the future of the forest and forest products sector would intervene and say to CSIRO management, `You've got it wrong, and this is what you're going to do: you're going to fix it. You're going to get it right and you're going to reinstate the Forest Products Laboratory.' If we had a minister with any sort of commitment at all to the forest and forest products sector, that is what he would do. Minister, you should get off your backside, take your hands out of your pockets and get on with the job of ensuring that there is a sustainable future for the forest and forest products sector.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—Let us note the litany of alleged mistakes related to this issue. Let us give the Minister for Forestry and Conservation the benefit of the doubt that this was indeed just a mistake, a blunder—inadvertent and dumb but not deliberate or deceitful. Firstly, what do we make of the Prime Minister's media release of the 31 May 1999 noting the change of policy regarding the GST package which proposed to extend the off-road uses of diesel which would qualify under the DFR? Not only does the PM's release identify concession industries which specifically do not include the forest industries but, as if to reinforce the point, to specifically exclude the timber industry, it is actually named or identified as not to receive full credits—`but not for construction, power generation, manufacturing or forestry'. No benefit of the doubt here, Minister.
What of the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Bill 1999, which was passed by the Senate on 28 June 1999? This bill specifically limited the amount of rebate to 35/43 of the diesel used in 
 forestry. No benefit of the doubt here, Minister. What of Minister Anderson when he commenced the second reading speech by stating that the Customs and Excise Amendment (Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme) Bill 1999:
. . . implements changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme agreed with the Australian Democrats as part of the package of environmental measures that will now accompany the introduction of the new tax system on 1 July 2000.
No interjection from our Minister for Forestry and Conservation. No shouts from the floor of, `Hey! Hang on a minute, there's a mistake here. Hey John! You've missed out the forestry industry. Stop your speech and save me having to be humiliated by introducing an amendment. Hey, stop!' No benefit of the doubt here, Minister.
What about the media release issued by Chris Althaus of the Forestry Protection Society on 3 July 1999? I quote:
FPS members are outraged at an apparent backroom deal with the Democrats that has singled out forestry for an 8 cents per litre penalty on the diesel fuel rebate whereas all other users of diesel such as primary producers receive the full rebate of 43 cents per litre.
This is Chris Althaus, who, like his colleagues in Tasmania, Barry Chipman and Christine O'Connor, is alert to impediments to the operations of the forestry industry and is `committed to encouraging regional, economic and jobs growth in an innovative timber industry, whilst also balancing responsible environmental concerns'—the very objectives the minister lists in the amendments. The FPS saw the dud, but the minister didn't. Surely this defies belief. Didn't the minister see the FPS media release condemning the Democrat-Coalition deal? Didn't he receive a copy?
I know how effectively the FPS lobby their cause. You, Minister, would have been a prime target and let me assure you they rarely miss their target. No benefit of the doubt here, Minister. This clearly demonstrates the truth of the situation: (1) the Democrats demanded the exclusion of the forest industry from the full DFR; (2) the PM and Minister Anderson dudded the timber industry, either with your complicit knowledge, Minister, or despite you; (3) the Democrats were appeased by this exclusion and the deal was done; (4) the FPS, 
 CFMEU, AMU, NAFI and supporters of the forest industries strenuously objected to this discrimination against the timber industry and forced the government to correct its discriminatory exclusion of the timber industry from a full credit of the DFR; and (5) the government has now reneged on its deal with the Democrats. Its `mistake' has been publicly acknowledged. Minister, you cannot expect the benefit of the doubt on this issue. It is either incompetence or complicity.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I intend to be charitable this afternoon. After all, is this not the minister that was described by the Prime Minister only today as the friend of the blue-collar worker, as the man who has brought certainty to the timber industry? Do not ask me how he has done it because, with decisions being made on the run, such as this one, how any industry could plan or decide it was going to invest in the timber industry is beyond reason. After all, is this not the minister that has had the RFA agreement for northern New South Wales sitting on his desk since November last year? He still has not signed off on it. This just happens to be an area that affects the blue-collar workers in my electorate. I can assure you, Minister, that they want to know when you are going to sign off on that one, too.
I certainly support the legislation, as does all the Labor Party. We believe that forest jobs are honest jobs. We know there are responsible people out there that need the assurance of this government, so that they know they can invest and they know that they have the support. That is why we are making sure they get the message that the people in the timber industry do have the support of the Labor Party. I only wish that the minister could have given that assurance some months ago.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 9) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—I will comment first on the claims of the member for Braddon that nobody shouted out that there was something wrong with the legislation. I happen to have a list of the speakers to the legislation at the time. The names given to me—and you will excuse me, 
 they are not in their electorates—are Crean, Kernot, Fitzgibbon, O'Connor, Thomson and Horne. I have checked their speeches. None of them said there was a mistake here, either. None of them stood up and said, `Hey, we are for the timber workers. Why are you having a shot at them with this particular matter?' When it came to shouting out and protecting the timber industry in this issue, there was a great deal of silence on both sides of the House. So we do not want to get too moralistic or hypocritical when it comes to—
—What, not a word from them?
—Not a word from all those speakers. On 23 June, they all were listed as speaking. They never raised the issue. The government of course rejects the opposition's pious amendment but welcomes its support for the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999 . Nevertheless, in terms of the opposition's attack on me in that amendment, let me apologise to the timber industry for my lack of diligence in not noticing this mistake before the bill was introduced. But let me reiterate: this situation was not a breach of the ANTS tax arrangement. The agreement with the Democrats was that all primary entities that benefited from the current diesel rebate system would retain that right to the same extent. The forestry industry currently has the benefit of the full diesel rebate for off-highway activity. The mistake was based on an assumption that somebody had that that privilege was not extended to the forestry industry. I do not know who that person was. And maybe it was a belief held by the Democrats. But all that was agreed at the time was that when these matters were corrected under the new arrangements those in receipt of the full rebate retained the full rebate. That of course included the off-highway activities of the forest industry.
As a consequence, the government is rectifying its mistake. I find this quite remarkable. It seems that a lot of the people thought it was our responsibility to keep a promise that was applying a higher tax to the industry when in fact it would seem that we would be much better off reducing the tax. That stands in stark contrast with circumstances I well 
 remember in 1993, when the present opposition, then in government, went to the people with a promise of tax reduction called the l-a-w tax cuts and as soon as they were re-elected threw them out. At the same time, having said that there would be no increase in indirect taxes, they added two per cent to every rate of sales tax and 6c a litre to the diesel tax on every truckload of logs and every railway trainload of logs—for instance, in Tasmania—that went along, outside of the forest industry. When one gets down to the issue of what promises one keeps, one should be reminded of those circumstances.
This was a mistake made by someone who had a misconception of the arrangements available presently to the forest industry. As such, they are now being rectified. That is an example of good government. We are fortunate inasmuch as these provisions do not go into effect until next year and therefore there has been no loss to the industry. They are very supportive of the fact that, once the issue became apparent, the government responded positively.
I also want to respond to a couple of other remarks that were made. The member for McMillan clearly does not understand what went on at CSIRO. He should also know, if he had been here a bit longer and bothered to study the forms of this place, that I am not the minister responsible for that.
—He did not say you were.
—Yes, he did. He said I should ring up the CSIRO. I checked. The member for Reid ought to know you cannot rewrite history in this place. It is all on the record.
What I am saying is this: the people whom he has mentioned were all employed, to the best of my knowledge, under a CRC, a cooperative research corporation, which this government introduced as a measure to encourage industry to participate with the research organisations, to get together to put together partially industry funded arrangements for research. It is not totally prescriptive, but one of the conditions is that it is a one-off grant, and in that period of time industry support is supposed to increase for 
 that purpose. In the circumstance it did not. The government has outlaid, again to the best of my knowledge, the same sum of money this year and in so doing has funded a lot of new projects.
Why was there a lack of industry funding? The reality was that the industry was in dispute as to the application of the levy and some were not wanting to pay it. My response to that quite some time ago was to get all the industry people together in a room, remind them of the fact that in these matters the government is only a facilitator, not the originator of all these ideas, and encourage them to come up with a proposal that would be satisfactory to them so that they could be out there spending money on research and, of course, creating employment for researchers such as those who have lost their positions at CSIRO. That meeting was extremely successful, and in fact the industry agreed with us on that day to a new set of levy arrangements—being progressed at the moment—that hopefully will deliver a very substantial amount of money into research, which I would agree is most important to the future of the industry.
The point on which all opposition speakers were silent was what they are going to do about security. I have discovered today that our deficit in forest products, which we constantly quote at $1.5 billion, has risen to nearly $2 billion. Of course, that is a deficit in value added products. To value add our timbers above the level to which they tend to be exported or sold locally today, you can start bidding at $100 million and you can go up into the billions of dollars. Nobody is going to spend that money until this parliament and certain state parliaments act. The member for Braddon knows very well that his state is already there, having bipartisan support and having passed RFA legislation, waiting to benefit and be the frontrunner in this sort of investment flow, the minute this parliament passes regional forest legislation that the industry trusts and that the unions trust—and that is not legislation with the amendments that the opposition has proposed. That is another point that I would make.
It is a pity to give me a lecture when I am here supporting legislation and proposing 
 legislation to reduce the tax on the timber industry. We are doing the right thing. We made a mistake. We are not hiding from it—
—You are trying to.
—No, I have never hidden from it. I said to the people straightaway that, through a misunderstanding of how the tax applied to a certain part of the industry, we allowed legislation to pass this House that was incorrect. Our response is not to tough it out; our response is to come in here and say, `We will fix it.'
I must also respond to the member for Paterson. There is no completed RFA in existence in the New South Wales parliament or here in Canberra, as he suggested, on my desk. What has happened is that we have returned to the appropriate National Forest Policy Statement procedures set out by the Labor Party in 1992, and we are going through that process in the north-east and the lower north-east of New South Wales. The interesting thing is that we are just doing things like consulting the people with a proper, advertised process. We are doing those things so that there can be a properly negotiated arrangement, and the progress is being made. What is more, when it is signed, if the member for Paterson can convince his caucus to pass the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  without amendments of the nature that they have proposed, then the security he demands for the local workers will be on the way. Those are the sorts of points we need to make.
I do not want to take any more of the House's time. I point out, firstly, that this was the appropriate measure for the government. Secondly, when it comes to breaking promises on taxes, you do not look to this side of the House with the Liberals and the National Party in office, you look to the other side. The only promise we are breaking is in order to make something better, but we have not changed the promise at all. The promise and the understanding were very clear, except that somebody at some point in drafting, I assume, believed that there were different arrangements in place for the forestry industry.
—There weren't.
—We know that there weren't. We agree with you wholeheartedly. The fact of life is that someone thought there were, and for that reason we got some legislation wrong. I apologise to the timber industry for my lack of diligence in not picking it up, but we have fixed it before it did any harm. I thank the House and those who participated in the debate.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999  amends the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 to provide $126.1 million to extend the higher level of funding which has been provided for the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, or IESIP, from 1997-99 to 30 June 
 2001. It also amends the act to incorporate the mixed mode course delivery away from the base element of the Abstudy scheme into the above act by providing funds in block grants to participating institutions. The opposition welcomes the government's commitment to maintain expenditure under IESIP for the most educationally disadvantaged group in Australia.
We do, however, have a couple of concerns. For a start, the government has never made public the findings of its review of Abstudy, on which it apparently based the changes announced in December last year. Those changes involved not only retaining Abstudy as a student support scheme separate to the Youth Allowance but also aligning many of the payments with those made to non-indigenous students under the Youth Allowance. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs claimed that the alignment was justified except in cases where `special provision needs to be made to cater effectively for the particular disadvantages faced by many indigenous students'.
The most obvious losers under the Abstudy changes will be students aged 21 and over, with some payments dropping by around $65 per fortnight. The minister has not explained why these students do not qualify for his special provision, given that the figures he himself released on 10 September showed that in 1996 only 13.6 per cent of indigenous people had a post-school qualification compared with 34.4 per cent of the general population.
Furthermore, in his media release of 15 December last year the minister assured us that the Abstudy changes would be budget neutral, yet no information has been provided to show how that is the case. In fact, all of the Abstudy changes have been shrouded in secrecy. The opposition has sought, on three separate occasions, information about the number of students and the cost of the part of Abstudy affected by this bill. We asked for the information in respect of 1998—information which the minister's department must surely now have access to—but no response has been received.
Secrecy and silence are not the way to encourage support from the opposition. We come to the issue of indigenous education in a spirit of bipartisanship, as we believe it is far too important to be used to score political points. It is extremely disappointing then that the minister, in question time on 24 August, attacked the record of the federal Labor government on indigenous education. It is indeed true, as the minister said, that with the problems a satisfactory solution has not been achieved. But the minister's own glossy presentation on 10 September to the Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was littered with headlines about the improvements made in indigenous education participation and outcomes over the years of the Labor government.
For example, between 1986 and 1991 enrolments of indigenous students in higher education grew by 148.7 per cent compared with 28.3 per cent for the general population. As a proportion of total higher education enrolments, the number of indigenous students rose from 0.3 per cent in 1981 to 1.2 per cent in 1996. Year 12 retention rates for indigenous students rose four percentage points between 1992 and 1996 while they were falling for non-indigenous students. The indigenous retention rate is now 32.1 per cent compared with 72.7 per cent for the general population.
What these figures tell us is that improvements have been made and that the minister would be far better advised to work with his colleagues on both sides of the House instead of trying to score these political points. The figures also tell us, of course, that a great deal more needs to be done, which brings me back to asking the minister why he feels justified in significantly cutting assistance to indigenous students aged over 21 years.
A report prepared for ATSIC by Ms Wendy Brabham and Associate Professor John Henry, from the Institute of Koorie  Education, Deakin University, details the effect of the changes to Abstudy to come into effect on 1 January next year. The report showed that the changes will advantage indigenous TAFE and university students who are under 21 years of 
 age, independent and single, of whom there were 730 in 1998, and those who are aged over 20 living at home. There were 165 such students in 1988. The report showed that the changes will significantly disadvantage indigenous TAFE and university students who are aged 21 and older, independent, single or with a partner, with or without children. There were 9,950 students in this category last year. The other group who will be significantly disadvantaged are those people who are getting either a sole parent or disability support pension, and there were 4,810 such students in this group in 1998.
So, excluding school age students, the balance—according to the ATSIC report—is around 900 students better off and almost 15,000 worse off. I would like to know how the minister expects changes like that to address the problems in indigenous education which he outlined at the ministerial council meeting recently. The most important point about the ATSIC report findings is that it is mature age students who make up almost 80 per cent of the indigenous TAFE and university student population.
The report quotes research over the last 30 years indicating that it is indigenous people of mature age, with community and family responsibilities, who are most likely to return to study, showing a pattern significantly different from the rest of the population. Why is the government making changes which will work directly against the positive trends in indigenous education, which will discourage more mature students who have family and community support from returning to study when they are keen to do so? Why is this not a case of the indigenous population having a special need and deserving special support?
In terms of the Abstudy changes dealt with in this bill, the away-from-base assistance for residential schools for distance tertiary students, or mixed mode, is being transferred to IESIP. It will be administered by DETYA and paid to institutions as block grants under indigenous education agreements. I understand that away-from-base assistance for testing and assessment, some field trips and placements will be retained as an existing benefit, administered by Centrelink.
This change is apparently to focus more on outcomes rather than the simple enrolment of indigenous students. Institutions will report on module and course completions, and I understand that some VET institutions are already operating this way. This seems a sensible and constructive approach, but the question which arises is how much more program money will be eaten up by necessary administration costs. I call on the minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in summing up the second reading debate, to come clean on how much money we are talking about. I would have thought that there were some lessons for governments about secretive behaviour and lack of accountability in the recent Victorian election.
In terms of maintaining the current level of funding for IESIP, the ALP is strongly supportive. IESIP was established by the Labor government in 1988 and is the main source of supplementary assistance for education providers catering for indigenous students. We support the concept of education agreements with providers, as well as the focus on outcomes, and urge the government to continue the Commonwealth's close interest in indigenous education. Given the concerns I expressed earlier, I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House:
(1)	 notes that indigenous Australians are the most educationally disadvantaged group in the country;
(2)	 condemns the Government for:
	 (a)	 failing to release the findings of the 1997-98 review of ABSTUDY; and
	 (b)	 cutting ABSTUDY payments to some categories of indigenous students; and
(3)	 calls on the Government to legislate to re-direct savings from its ABSTUDY changes into indigenous education"".

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—The purpose of the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1999  is to transfer some Commonwealth support for indigenous education from the Abstudy program to the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program, IESIP. The bill also provides for the administration of funding from within IESIP and the appropriation of required funds from consolidated revenue.
Indigenous education is a difficult issue and it requires that governments face up to the facts of it. One thing I can say is that the federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, is going about it in the right way. He has broad support for the kinds of initiatives he has undertaken in relation to indigenous education—and I note most recently from the Hon. Bob Collins, who is engaged at present in a review of indigenous education in the Northern Territory. In announcing the proposed changes to Abstudy, the minister stated:
The new ABSTUDY arrangements will be implemented from 1 January 2000 and will be budget neutral. There will be no change to ABSTUDY benefits to those students claiming assistance in 1999.
The shadow minister spoke about the away-from-base proposals, and in addressing that the minister stated:
The `Away-From-Base' benefit for `mixed mode' course delivery provided by educational institutions will be transferred from ABSTUDY to the Government's Indigenous Education Strategic Initiative Program (IESIP) to ensure flexibility. Under the new arrangements the Government will settle individual agreements with institutions for the purpose of achieving improved educational outcomes for Indigenous students from remote communities.
This is an appropriate move. Directing the funding through the  institutions will, I think, stabilise their stream of funding in this regard and improve the delivery of courses in those circumstances.
I note that time is limited, so I will jump straight to the circumstances concerning one of the institutions that will be directly involved in dealing with the these new mixed modes of delivery. I am talking about Batche 
 lor College in the Northern Territory. It is a very good institution which addresses a specific need in the Northern Territory. It provides courses for Aboriginal people from remote Aboriginal communities and delivers them in a way that is relevant to those communities and assists in their development. So we are taking people from a remote community, giving them skills appropriate to that community and then returning them so that they can advance their local community.
I will go over some of the details in relation to Batchelor College. Approximately 85 per cent of students come from those remote indigenous communities where the majority of people speak English as a second language—it could be said that it is a foreign language. That is obviously one of the major challenges. Currently there are 1,700 students, or 1,100 equivalent full-time student units, enrolled in Batchelor College in the longer accredited courses in more than 20 discipline areas. There are other courses, but the emphasis on the longer courses is on education, health and other areas applicable to the community development aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
Batchelor College aims to progressively develop into a multipurpose centre of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander scholarship, recognised nationally and internationally as an independent indigenous university. That is a very worthwhile aim. It is very important that the college proceeds and is further developed. What must be kept on track, though, is the absolute rigorous standard that applies to those university courses. People who look in from the outside often have a false perception that, because this institution operates as an enclave, it is in some way offering some mickey-mouse style courses. That is exactly what it is not doing. It is providing courses that are appropriate to those communities, and it is delivering them in a very special way.
To outline the way they do it, for the most part students are based in their home communities and attend intensive workshops several times a year at the Batchelor campus. They also attend the Alice Springs campus and annexes at Katherine, Tennant Creek, Nhulunbuy or Alyangula, or in other communities. In 
 addition to these intensive workshops, students undertake continuing studies in their own communities, where they are visited regularly by college staff and receive instruction face-to-face through distance education and through electronic technology. No doubt the importance of that part of the course is increasing all the time.
To aid its operation, the college has established a network of community study centres in more than 35 remote Northern Territory communities. This shows the depth to which the college has gone to make its learning processes appropriate and applicable to the system. Currently across Australia there are 8,557 preschool Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, 61,332 students at primary level, 27,147 at the secondary level, 8,859 TAFE students and 5,563 tertiary students; and 34.4 per cent of the indigenous population attending an educational institution compared with 35.5 per cent of the total population. In stating that, I should say that those are 1996 figures.
In 1998 there were 7,789 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students enrolled in higher education courses. In 1997, 0.7 per cent of course completions—we are talking now at tertiary level—were by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. That sounds very small but is a 12.3 per cent increase on 1996. That is a trend we must continue to foster. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has his eye on the ball in relation to indigenous education. He said:
Indigenous Australians must have the same opportunities educationally as non-indigenous Australians.
That sounds like he is stating the obvious, but as we shall hear in this debate—and, unfortunately, I am going to be restricted in my contribution to this debate—the capacity of people to realise that basic goal in many cases is being fundamentally eroded by their circumstances and by a conspiracy of various factors.
There have been various agreements that have set aside those sorts of targets. We need to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have access to the world via the education network. That is an important 
 goal to bear in mind. It is no good merely focusing people on activities in their community. We have to open them up to the whole world because, like every one of us, they are citizens of the world and they have the right to expect that.
Literacy and numeracy are very important factors in the performance of Aboriginal people in the education system. There were 8,200 people studied Australia-wide in a 1996 study of national school literacy. To give you an idea of the depth of the problem we are facing in indigenous education, the percentage of indigenous people who met the standard for year 3 reading was only 19 per cent; 81 per cent did not. At year 5, 23 per cent of the indigenous sample met the standard for reading; 77 per cent did not. When it came to writing in year 3, there was a 29 per cent achievement rate, and at year 5 there was a 24 per cent achievement rate. Clearly those numbers are not acceptable.
It is significant that the survey found that the lowest achieving year 3 indigenous students make little or no progress after the following two years of education. That is a very difficult hurdle to overcome. Relatively high rates of absence from school are evident amongst the indigenous sample, and this higher rate of absence appears to be a factor in the lower literacy achievement of these students. That is probably the number one problem.
English literacy achievements of indigenous students increased with the frequency of speaking English at home. About 30 per cent of indigenous students sampled did not speak English at home. I repeat: the English literacy achievements of indigenous students increase with the frequency of speaking English at home. That sounds like an obvious thing, but when you are in a remote part of Australia in a community where everybody speaks a language other than English and that is all you hear it must be very hard to come to grips with a common understanding of English. If people who try to learn Mandarin or Indonesian or anything like that do not get regular exposure to the language, it is very hard to make a fist of it. Likewise, if you have not got access to English, there is no 
 way that you can access the world of learning and achieve the goals a normal everyday citizen of Australia has a right to achieve.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—In one of the most famous literary exchanges Australia has experienced, the Bulletin , amidst the turmoil of the 1890s depression, featured a series of contributions from Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson. The theme was a simple one, as you would know, Mr Speaker: the city versus the bush. Lawson, in his hard-hitting style, would emphasise the uncertainty, trials and tribulations of country life while Paterson, in his own style of romantic prose, would remind us of the intangible benefits of the lifestyle, space and freedom that country life can offer. Between these two great poets lay a gulf in experience and of perspective. It is a gulf that remains relevant a century later.
Conservative governments, both at the federal and state levels, are finally being held accountable by those in rural and regional Australia who feel left out. While the politicians, Kennett, Howard, Costello and others, tell Australians how good things are, those in the bush are asking the question: where is our share? In Victoria they have just asked Jeff Kennett why, despite representing a quarter of the work force, they have received just 7.5 per cent of the new jobs in the past three years. They are asking the Prime Minister and Treasurer why it is that economically depressed communities bear so much of the burden of economic change. They will soon be asking why the top end of town is getting such massive tax relief when those who are struggling get their services and assistance cut.
The Victorian election result reminds us that not everyone is sharing the benefits of economic growth. The Howard government has left individuals, families and communities 
 without the essential support services they need to feel included in modern Australia. Like the Kennett government the Howard government will be punished for that because, while the city versus the bush debate is one that still figures in the Australian psyche, no-one believes that is justification to exclude such a significant number of Australians from full participation in society. The Howard government, like the Kennett government, claims to be about economic modernisation. But the economic issue that presents the greatest challenge is the shift towards a knowledge based economy, and that has been left unattended. It involves issues of research and development, innovation, investment in human capital and investment in the infrastructure that supports a forward looking economy and society. These issues affect all parts of Australia.
Economic modernisation for the Howard government, like the Kennett government, has been about cutting costs. It has been about closing schools, cutting education funding, extending hospital waiting lists, removing services from depressed areas and removing the support systems that underpin our social sanity. All of these have hit economically depressed areas the hardest. While all of this is hitting those in depressed areas, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will go down in history for squandering billions of taxpayers' dollars on tax relief for those who are doing well. The new economy increasingly rewards those with high skills. The focus of government should be on helping those without those skills. I am clearly a supporter of globalisation and economic reform, but I also believe that governments have a responsibility to protect society's vulnerable. The Howard government is unique in not having that capability. When governments become obsessed with cutting essential services, when they seek to undermine what it means to live in a community and when they start to believe that the only way forward is to divide and rule, they lose not only the faith of the people but also their moral legitimacy. The message is clear: we must complement economic reform with policies that can take with it those who would otherwise be left behind. Those of us charged with that responsibility 
 should not pretend that the task is easy, but we should not be so irresponsible as to throw away the potential for investment in those individuals, families and communities that need it most and call it economic modernisation.
We cannot take the path of rejecting change, but we must see change for what it is—a challenge, not a choice. But I believe it is a challenge this government has failed to understand. Where you live, where you go to school and your family and social support networks all still impact significantly on your life chances. Just ask the thousands of Victorians who have chosen to vote Labor for the first time ever. The issue of location is as important to Australians today as it was a century ago.
Our economically depressed communities have been missing from the unemployment debate for far too long. Improving living standards and opportunities in our most economically depressed areas is essential if we are to give meaning to the notion of equality of opportunity. Regional Australia is crying out for support, and it delivered this government a message last Saturday. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Economy: Reform</title>,Adjournment,27,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The graphic pictures that have come from East Timor in recent weeks have shocked us all. The death and misery that have been brought to the island by the militias are well known. But we are only just starting to come to terms with the sickness and disease that is spreading due to hunger and exposure of the refugees who fled into the hills to escape the militia's genocidal attacks.
One news report this week stated that 20 people had died in one village as a result of malnutrition and disease. Thousands of people are currently suffering from wounds they have received in fighting and many will die without early medical help. Our first priority should be to provide security throughout East Timor to enable medical teams to enter the areas of refuge and start the provision of emergency aid. There will be a huge job to rebuild the health system to cope with this crisis and to provide for East Timor after it achieves independence.
I am told that there are two health systems in East Timor: one previously provided by the Indonesian government and the other based around 27 hospitals and clinics run by the Catholic aid agency, Caritas. Caritas have only recently been able to re-enter East Timor and, along with other aid agencies, they will face a huge task. I was very pleased to hear there are moves afoot within the pharmaceutical industry to provide large quantities of urgently needed pharmaceuticals to assist the work of the major aid agencies. This is being coordinated by the aid group OPAL—Overseas Pharmaceutical Aid for Life. This group is run out of South Australia. Manufacturers around Australia are donating their products to meet the needs identified by major aid groups. A large container load is being loaded in Adelaide and will soon be dispatched.
Caritas has also collected a significant stock of materials through Catholic Health Australia by donations of medicines from Catholic hospitals. These will be distributed quickly in packs accompanied by advice in the local language so that local doctors and paramedical staff can get the medicines they desperately need. I understand another collection is being coordinated by the Australian Nurses Federation. These are all excellent initiatives which demonstrate the generosity of spirit that Australians have to help those in need. I am sure there are many other ways in which the health community in Australia can play a vital role in helping East Timor start on the road to recovery.
I also understand that many people have expressed an interest in assisting East Timor. Many are health professionals with important skills to contribute. The avenue for interested people to get involved is to register with Australian Volunteers International, the largest body in Australia supporting overseas aid projects through recruitment of volunteers. AVI has opened a special register of interest for people who have skills to offer in East Timor, with the intention of providing recruitment and training services to support delivery of emergency aid and longer term projects to support the development of the country.

"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—It is a pleasure to speak today in support of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, John Herron, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . The bill does not do anything of great note, but it is very symbolic. It is symbolic of John Herron's careful and attentive management of his portfolio and the recognition by the government of the importance of supporting the Aboriginal people's right to achieve as much say as possible over their affairs. This bill is a progression of that—let me explain why.
The bill deals with the present structure of ATSIC, which is a representative body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples. It has been operating in Australia since 1990, and has a tremendously difficult and complex task, I might add. There are many critics of ATSIC; 
 I can only advise those people that are critics to step back and look at all of the issues and then make your judgment. Do not make your judgment on one or two issues alone.
That is not to say that ATSIC is perfect—it does not claim to be. It is not perfect, and from time to time it has had problems. No doubt in the future, with the complexity of its role, it will continue to have some of those problems. But we hope that, with good government and a good minister like John Herron, these will be overcome.
—And a good shadow minister.
—And a reasonably good shadow minister, Daryl Melham—who is a better committee member, might I say. He is a member, as Mr Haase is, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which I have the honour of serving as chair and which works pretty well for Aboriginal people, for Australians and for the parliament.
ATSIC regions are incorporated into zones in Australia. There are 35 regional councils, which are then divided into 16 zones. The position to date is that the minister, John Herron, and his predecessors have appointed the chairperson and one other commissioner. The rest have been elected. This provision of the act was amended in 1996 and provides that the commission consist only of elected representatives, not those appointed by a minister. I welcome that because that is the sort of thing that we need to do. White man's parliament, meaning well, should try to limit as much as possible its involvement in the decision making process that indigenous people want to make themselves. We should be encouraging indigenous people to have a go and make decisions, to be accountable to their own people and to Australians. It is better for them to do that than for governments to appoint people to these sorts of bodies. That amendment was a good one and it is about to take place. There was a deferral of the implementation of that, by agreement of both sides of politics, when we entered government in 1996.
I would also like to pay tribute to the chairs of ATSIC, who include Dr O'Donoghue. Sometimes she has been a pretty severe critic of the government that I am a member of—unjustly, I think. But on other occasions she has been a good advocate for indigenous people and is generally well respected. We wish her well. The current chair, Gatjil Djerrkura, is a remarkable man. I have got to know him quite well and I wish him every success. I am not sure what is going to happen with the current elections, but I certainly do admire Gatjil and thank him very much for his good advice to me from time to time and, especially, for his very generous comments in relation to the report on the Northern Territory land rights act that the committee which I chair recently released, which is entitled Unlocking the future. We understand that the chair of ATSIC has endorsed the general thrust of that report, and we appreciate that generous endorsement.
The bill before us today does not include any major changes to the ATSIC Act, but it does clarify the process pertaining to the new arrangements for the chairperson. The bill provides that the person who will be elected—in contrast to being appointed as in the past—by his or her fellow commissioners to be the ATSIC chair ceases to hold his or her original office—that is, of being a regional councillor and a zone commissioner. Obviously, it would be wrong to hold both positions. The present act does in fact provide that they would hold both positions, and that is not practical. The chair, having been elected, should not have those other positions. The bill deals with that situation.
The bill goes on to say that the positions left vacant by the election of the chair will be filled through a process set down in the election rules made under the ATSIC Act. What will happen is that the indigenous people in the affected region will not have to vote again, having lost their zone commissioner, that person having being made chair of ATSIC. A recount will be done to elect the new councillor—they will go through the votes that were recorded in the previous election. In the case of the vacant position of a zone commissioner, the regional councils will elect a new commissioner in a by-election. That process is facilitated in this bill. It will complement the policy of the government, allowing commissioners to be elected by the people and elected commissioners to elect the chair.
The bill is a simple one. There are no substantial financial costs on the Australian taxpayer, except that the person who fills the vacant office of the commissioner and the regional councillor would, of course, be entitled to the appropriate salary and allowances.
In conclusion, there is a lot of work to be done by all of us to address the unfortunate disadvantage that indigenous people suffer. Unfortunately, they die a third sooner than all other groups of Australians, their unemployment rates are 60 per cent higher than the rates in any other area of Australia and their health is in many cases very bad. So the government's focus, under John Herron, has been to give greater attention and targeting to that.
Hence, we have brought in a policy where all the skills of all of the health deliverers in Australia, at both Commonwealth level and state level, are brought into play. Rather than have ATSIC being the one that has to struggle to provide the health services and planning for indigenous people, it is far better to use the whole of the talents of all Australian health workers, the family of health people and the ministers to work collectively together. Michael Wooldridge has brokered agreements between all the state health ministers to that effect. That is a much better, targeted way of doing it.
My colleague Barry Wakelin, with Harry Quick, who is deputy chair of my committee—Barry is chair of the other committee—is inquiring at the moment into indigenous health and has issued a discussion paper—
—You mean the members for Grey and Franklin.
—That is right. I am sorry, I am being too informal. They are doing a wonderful job. I would encourage all members to read their discussion paper because it does highlight a number of important issues. In training, the ministers David Kemp and Peter Reith, together with ATSIC and others, have put in a targeted program to create partnerships where targeted results and outcomes will be achieved. We have already got a great development there.
My colleague the member for Kalgoorlie has been briefing me about an exciting development in Murrin Murrin in Western Australia where Anaconda has formed a partnership with the local Aboriginal people and they are talking now about establishing a training college, which is a fantastic idea. So there are great, exciting things happening—good, positive things, and the best thing for us to do is to focus on the positives. Don't ignore the negatives, but don't allow the negatives to knock off the positives. It has been a shame in indigenous politics in Australia that there have been too many negatives knocking off the positives.
I support the bill and wish it a speedy passage. Again, I record my appreciation of John Herron's work for the Aboriginal people of Australia.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . Let me 
 preface my remarks by congratulating the member for Indi for his remarks and for his chairmanship of that committee. I have often been criticised as a savage political opponent of the Liberal Party, but I find it appropriate at this juncture to congratulate the member for Indi for his generosity of spirit towards the Aboriginal people of Australia and for the integrity with which he has conducted himself in his dealings with Aboriginal people.
Speaking on this bill provides me with an opportunity to provide a few ideas about how we can bring ATSIC closer to the people whom the commission seeks to represent. I think that we can go some way towards doing this by devolving authority from ATSIC to the local communities which it seeks to represent.
I, like many other people in this parliament, read with great interest the paper delivered by Mr Noel Pearson to the Brisbane Institute some months ago. Noel Pearson, as many people in this place would know, is the director of the Cape York Land Council and a prominent Aboriginal leader in Australia. His paper offered a great insight into the ways in which governments might be able to relate to Aboriginal communities in the future.
Mr Pearson spoke about an interface between Aboriginal communities and the state government and the federal government. So he was talking about moving away from some of these joint committees which exist and these departmental responses to the problems which Aboriginal communities face. He is talking about making a radical departure from that and starting again with something new, something over which the people in that community can have greater control and which would give greater responsibility to the people in those communities. I congratulate Mr Pearson on making those remarks. He has been very courageous, certainly politically courageous in the context of the constituency which he speaks for. I congratulate him on that initiative.
One of the things which ATSIC needs to consider in the future is regional offices. I come from Victoria and had the good fortune to work as the chief executive of the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Health and Housing Cooperative, in Morwell, where our primary responsibility was the delivery of an Aboriginal health service to the people there. We were not a large organisation; we had, I think, only 16 or 17 staff at any one point. But our dealings with ATSIC, whilst very good in the context of trying to negotiate the best outcome for the people we sought to deliver services to, would have been made better if we had had an ATSIC office based in Gippsland, as opposed to an ATSIC office based in Melbourne. We need to encourage the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to consider more closely whether or not this would be practicable.
I know that many of the Aboriginal people in Gippsland with whom I have the good fortune to be friends consider ATSIC still an organisation far away from their needs and aspirations. I think that placing an office there, of whatever staffing would be considered appropriate, considering the size of that Aboriginal community and also the community's needs, would be a step in the right direction. It would give the likes of the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Cooperative, the Ramahyuck Aboriginal cooperative in Sale, the Gippsland and East Gippsland Aboriginal Cooperative in Bairnsdale, and the Aboriginal cooperative in Orbost much closer links into that very important organisation, which still is responsible for delivering a large number of programs to Aboriginal people. I mention that today, not in the context of trying to impose the view which I have about the way that Aboriginal services should be delivered in regional parts of Australia, but rather offering it as an idea based on the experiences which I have had in the delivery of Aboriginal services in Gippsland.
In considering the bill and its provisions which relate to the democratic provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, there are a few important points which need to be made. The first is the very low rate of participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in elections. We have such a small number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the Australian Electoral Commission rolls. When members here go through their polling booths on election days—as I think most people do; they visit the various polling booths in their constituencies—I would just ask them to consider how many Aboriginal people they ever bump into as they are doing the rounds of their constituencies. The truth is probably not many, even though many of us have significant Aboriginal communities in our electorates. This is something which we need to address very seriously.
I noted with some alarm that there were substantial cuts to the Australian Electoral Commission Indigenous Enrolment Program in 1996. I would urge the government, in the best bipartisan traditions of this place, to urgently reconsider whether or not it would be appropriate to reinstate that program as a way of encouraging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in general elections in this country. I think that we are all the better for having those people participate in the democratic process.
I cannot tell you how much it pains me when I go and see Aboriginal people in my constituency and talk to them about an election coming up—as we have just had in Victoria—only to find that there is indifference in some people's minds about the fact that there is an election on and many people still are not registered to vote. We have a great democratic tradition in Australia. We need to seek to extend that democratic tradition to include all people in our community, and especially Aboriginal people who, for so long, have been marginalised from the political process.
A second point I want to make is that little is being done to empower Aboriginal people to participate in the entirety of the democratic process. It concerns me that so many Aboriginal people still feel very locked out from that process. I am talking about not just encouraging people to vote but also encouraging people to participate fully and wholly in the democratic process.
It was with some enthusiasm that my office advised me that a number of people involved in the land claim which is being pursued by the Gunai/Kurnai people in Gippsland have made an appointment to see me at my office in Moe this Friday. I am fortunate in that many Aboriginal people in our community feel confident coming to see me in my electorate office and, I hope, feel that they get some service from me.
I am very pleased indeed to see that that group of people—a group of people who are usually marginalised from the political process—had the initiative and, in many ways, the courage to go and see a local member of parliament to discuss this claim. Often local members of parliament are seen as people who will not be supportive of the cause of Aboriginal people in their community. It is a shame that that has been the case for a long time. I am very pleased that that group of people has had the confidence—and the confidence in me—to come and see me to discuss the issue of their land claim.
There tends to be a lot of talk about empowerment, but I think we need to be careful not to allow that talk to just be the shrill banter which politicians can go on with from time to time. I notice, with some concern again, that the Community Training Program, which is worth about $67.2 million, has been cut. I think this has undermined the efforts of people on both 
 sides of parliament who are committed to genuine participation by Aboriginal people to try to encourage more Aboriginal people to be involved in the process.
I think it is worth reflecting on what the Community Training Program aimed to achieve. In the ATSIC Annual Report1996-97, the objective is listed as follows:
To improve decision making and service provision by Aboriginal organisations, through training which aims to increase skill levels and enhance employment prospects.
I think most people in this place would agree that this is a very important objective. In describing community training, the document lists a few dot points, one of which is as follows:
.	 provides assistance to selected individuals to enable them to undertake specific accredited training or education courses.
It continues:
The component had three elements:
.	 community training funded through ATSIC Regional Councils;
.	 Inwork, funded through ATSIC State and Regional Offices; and
.	 Full-time Professional Study Grants, funded through ATSIC Central Office as a national program.
So it is a shame that this Community Training Program has lost $67.2 million worth of Commonwealth funding and will now be unable to be delivered to Aboriginal people. I think it is worth noting as well that cuts to ATSIC, totalling nearly half a billion dollars, have occurred and have undermined Aboriginal self-determination.
Whilst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission regional council elections will take place in October this year, we need to consider what the government has done to empower Aboriginal people to participate more fully in this process. It is worth considering the program that existed previously to encourage more Aboriginal people to get onto the electoral roll. I can remember that the Aboriginal organisation which I used to work for had some great posters up around the place encouraging Aboriginal people to participate in elections. We had these posters up all around the organisation, and as people came into the organisation they would say, `Here we have an Aboriginal organisation'—these were all funded by ATSIC—`giving us encouragement to get involved in the political process.' As a result of that and of having some Australian Electoral Commission enrolment forms around the place, people were certainly encouraged to get involved and to have their say in ATSIC elections and also in the general election process at both state and federal levels.
Most people would understand that the advantages of having more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participating in the democratic process are huge. By having more involvement by Aboriginal people in democracy, we end up with much more representation at federal, state and local levels. This can only be a good thing in making sure that the interests of Aboriginal people who have traditionally been very marginalised from the political process are not forgotten.
I think it also encourages more understanding by Aboriginal people of the democratic process of local land councils, for example, and also of health services and cooperatives which are often charged with the responsibility of delivering various services to Aboriginal people. It is worth noting that in the past a number of problems have been encountered by organisations delivering services to Aboriginal people which have been run along democratic lines.
Questions have to be asked about how realistic it is to expect Aboriginal people to deliver services to their own communities using the democratic processes of cooperatives, elections for land councils and all the rest when not enough effort has been made by Commonwealth or state governments to try to engender greater understanding amongst Aboriginal people of the democratic process. We cannot just set up an organisation to fail and then wash our hands of it saying simply, `We gave the funding to a democratic Aboriginal organisation. Unfortunately they did not run it correctly and therefore we are not to blame; they are to blame.' That sort of approach is clearly unacceptable.
We should use the opportunities we have through funding to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to try to encourage people to participate in programs which engender within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community a greater awareness of the role of individuals in the Aboriginal community in electing directors onto Aboriginal health services and local Aboriginal land councils and in electing people to serve on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander regional councils.
I think we have a great responsibility. If we are going to take it seriously, we have to look at empowering some of those organisations which deliver Aboriginal education programs and encourage and support them in delivering programs to the Aboriginal community of which they are a part. For example, in my own electorate there is an enormous amount of good work done by the Koori unit at the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE. This group of very hard-working people deliver programs in adult literacy as well as in a whole range of other programs such as computer literacy and Aboriginal child care and assist Aboriginal people to access mainstream programs.
We need to talk, through ATSIC, about how we might ask the Koori unit at the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE, or other organisations, to deliver some type of management training or community leadership training to Aboriginal people. We talk a lot about the need for leadership in communities. Members of parliament who represent regional areas hear regularly that there is a need for community leadership to come from the regions so that the regions may seek the opportunities which are available to them. We talk a lot about the realities of globalisation and how regions are competing against not just other regions in Australia but regions in other parts of the world. However, we have not put in place processes which will allow Aboriginal people in regional areas to step forward as leaders in their own communities to take advantage of the opportunities that exist to put in place empowering practices for communities—not the type of paternalism we have seen in the past but empowering practices. We need to look seriously at the way in which we can deliver those services to Aboriginal people and encourage the likes of the Koori unit at the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE to be a participant.
An important point is that the government is letting Aboriginal people down through its inaction in this area. We need to be serious about preparing Aboriginal people for leadership roles in management, assisting them to understand their roles and responsibilities in the positions of director in the various organisation which I have mentioned.
There are some opportunities for director training for Aboriginal people. I note that ATSIC, some years ago, produced a very informative video titled So You Want to be a Director. It was in plain language and very easy to understand format—I myself found it very useful—and provided clear indications of what the responsibilities of being a director would be. I think 
 that sort of service delivery—that type of appropriate education—is something that we should try to encourage more.
In conclusion, I will speak briefly about a great dream that I have and which I hope some day will be realised—that is, that we will have a system of Aboriginal scholarships in this country which will be genuinely available to ordinary men and women and their children in Aboriginal communities right across Australia and that this would be something which Aboriginal communities could control themselves and therefore have responsibility for. Aboriginal communities would choose the leaders of the future and would have a stake in it. People in those communities would be able to undertake the type of management and leadership training which would empower them to be able to go out and seek new opportunities for their community, which they need to take advantage of if they are to succeed as a people in the future.
We have some great Aboriginal people and some great Aboriginal leaders in this country. Noel Pearson, whom I mentioned earlier on, is a great example of that. If we had a process in place which was able to produce Aboriginal leaders with experience and training in management, in accounting, as well as in director training, we would be going some way towards meeting our responsibilities—giving Aboriginal people the tools of empowerment. This is an area in which we are not going anywhere near far enough. I think everyone would agree on both sides of the parliament that there has been far too much paternalism in terms of Aboriginal service delivery in the past. We need to relate to Aboriginal people as partners in the process. Only by including them as partners in the process can we possibly hope to assist them to choose a better future for themselves and for their children. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to speak in support of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . This marks a stage in the evolution of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. ATSIC, as it is known, was established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. One of its objects, as set out in its legislation, is `to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of government policies that affect them'.
ATSIC has an elected arm to represent the interests of indigenous people. There are 35 ATSIC regional councils throughout Australia, plus the Torres Strait Regional Authority, whose members are elected by indigenous people. These regions are then grouped into 17 zones. A short time after an ATSIC election, regional councillors from each zone meet to elect one of their number to represent the zone on the ATSIC Board. The next ATSIC election is scheduled to be held on 9 October this year. It is expected that the elections of zone commissioners will take place in early December 1999. Those regional councillors elected as zone commissioners following this election will, for the first time, elect one of their own number to be the new ATSIC chairperson.
The bill provides that the person elected by his or her fellow commissioners to be the ATSIC chair ceases to hold his or her original offices of regional councillor and zone commissioner. The positions left vacant by the election of the chairperson will be filled through the process set down in the election rules made under the ATSIC Act. The indigenous people in the affected region do not have to vote again. A recount is done to elect the new councillor. In the case of the vacant position of zone commissioner, the regional councillors will elect a new 
 commissioner in a by-election. This process results in a commission of 18 members rather than the 19 currently.
To ensure that the number of commissioners should equal the number of zones, plus one—the chairperson—the bill provides that a chairperson who resigns is also taken to have resigned as a commissioner. The bill removes the current reference to 17 members in section 27 of the act and clarifies that the minister must appoint as members of the commission those persons elected to represent the several zones.
There is quite a history to the choosing of the chairperson. Originally, the minister chose the chairperson. Later, the act was amended so that the minister appointed the chairperson from amongst the commissioners. Still later, an amendment was passed which provided for the commissioners to choose their own chairperson. This amendment will come into effect after the next election on 9 October. This bill concerns the arrangements that follow from the appointment of one of the commissioners as chairperson. Section 26 of the ATSIC Act allows the commission to review, from time to time, such aspects of the operation of the act as it determines. The bill also provides that a commission chairperson who resigns is taken to have resigned as a member of the commission.
In April 1997, the board of commissioners determined that a review of the act under section 26 should be undertaken. This review involved comprehensive and wide ranging consultations with indigenous people. The ATSIC board requested that appropriate arrangements be put in place prior to the next ATSIC election.
In 1998 the board reported to the minister, putting forward a number of recommendations arising from the review. Recommendation 7 says:
Where the person elected to represent a zone is subsequently elected as Commission Chairperson, the person should cease to hold office as a member representing the zone and as a Regional Councillor, with these offices to be re-filled through the normal electoral process.
It is this recommendation that is reflected in the bill before the House today. In its report on this recommendation, the commission said:
There was strong support from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community for such a provision to be included in the Act.
It went on to say:
Bearing in mind the strong support expressed for the proposal during the consultations and the undoubted heavy workload falling on the Chairperson, the Commission favours, on balance, that he or she be replaced as the Commissioner representing the zone and as the Regional Councillor.
This bill reflects the commission's view and its provisions will be in place before the next ATSIC elections. I am sure that ATSIC and the indigenous community will welcome the clarity and certainty that this bill brings.
In particular, it is pleasing that representation at the regional level will not be diminished. There is much to be positive about in indigenous affairs, not only for indigenous people but for all Australians. Indigenous people are undeniably severely disadvantaged against all socioeconomic indicators, but we are beginning to see some real and lasting improvements. As a government we are committed to addressing that disadvantage in a practical way so that indigenous Australians can enjoy equality of opportunity with other Australians. While money alone is not the answer, we are committing record levels of funding to specific programs that will address that disadvantage.
Self-reliance through greater economic independence is the ultimate goal in enabling indigenous Australians to create their own businesses, generate employment and generally create a more positive future for themselves and their children. A new indigenous employment program, IEP, has been announced in the budget. This program has an emphasis on private sector opportunities and support for indigenous small business. Major features of the IEP include a strategy to encourage chief executive officers to recruit and train indigenous staff, private sector structured training and a national cadetship program for cadetships in the private sector.
In my own electorate, in the towns of Leonora and Laverton in the north-eastern goldfields, exists an organisation called the Leonora-Laverton Cross-Cultural Association. This is a group formed with the cooperation of mining operations in the area and is a classic example of the opportunities created under our new employment programs. The opportunities for Aboriginal people in the goldmining and exploration sectors are quite extensive. One of the sad realities, however, is the level of base education currently possessed by Aboriginal people in the goldfields area, and it is creating a great problem for the LLCCA to effectively employ and continue to provide employment for Aboriginal people.
The problem highlights itself in a specific area. In Western Australia, state legislation enacted allows for the forfeiture of driving licences in the case of unpaid traffic infringements and other fines whereby individuals owe money to the government. A consequence of this may arise if Aboriginal people who have sat for, passed, been issued with a motor vehicle driver's licence and had it forfeited apply for employment in this particular local employment scheme and state that they are licensed to take a position that involves driving on a mine site. It is a clear requirement of the mining companies that all drivers so employed be licensed under state legislation as drivers. It is subsequently realised, often through a routine licence check on community roads, that the individual has had outstanding fines, has not paid them and that their licence has been forfeited. The fact that they have been stopped whilst driving a motor vehicle results in a further fine for driving whilst unlicensed, and the revolving door continues to revolve.
Of course, the immediate consequence is that the individual is no longer licensed and able to hold down employment on a mine site as a driver. Once again, the opportunity to gainfully employ one more Aboriginal person and get them out of the welfare paddock is lost. I believe that my approaches to the state government are being considered, but more needs to be done in this field to effectively remove this insidious and revolving door situation. Some of its solutions are to be found in more effective communication when licensing drivers—I am not just referring to Aboriginal drivers but to all new drivers gaining their licence—that informs them of the consequence of not passing on their current address to authorities and of not paying fines.
However, that said, we have made great progress with programs for employment and education, health and housing of Aboriginal people generally. In fact, 70 per cent of the $2.2 billion budget this year is going on health, housing, education and employment programs for indigenous Australians. To give you just a few examples of these practical improvements, four years ago there were just 800 indigenous Australians doing apprenticeships or traineeships. Today there are 4,800. The number of indigenous apprentices and trainees is an example of the success of the coalition's approach. When we came to office in 1996 there were just 800 indigenous apprentices and trainees Australia-wide. Three years later, this number has grown to 6,000.
Twenty years ago, only 8.6 per cent of indigenous students stayed at school until their final year. Today, over 33 per cent finish school, and that figure continues to rise. Expenditure on indigenous education programs will be increased by $16.3 million in 1999-2000. The Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program will target indigenous students' literacy and numeracy competencies and school attendance levels. A decade ago there were 1,600 indigenous university students. Today, there are almost 9,000.
The indigenous infant mortality rate is of great concern, but even in this area things are improving. Twenty years ago, the indigenous infant mortality rate was more than 20 times that of the wider community. Today, with still some improvement to be made, it is only three to four times higher, a considerable improvement. This is an area that will continue to be addressed, particularly in remote communities where there has always been a lack of prenatal and postnatal care. Over the past three years, 35 additional Aboriginal medical services have been provided, mostly in remote areas. Indigenous health funding has quadrupled over the past decade.
The Indigenous Business Incentive Program has provided about $18 million in seed funding to 84 businesses. Successful indigenous business means more indigenous employment opportunities and therefore less dependency upon welfare. The CDEP Work for the Dole Program is a great success in indigenous communities with 33,000 indigenous Australians voluntarily working for the dole.
In conclusion, these may be only small steps towards addressing disadvantage and there is still much work to be done. Nevertheless, they are steps in the right direction because they are steps away from welfare dependency and towards economic self-sufficiency, and they are important steps on the road to reconciliation. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,1999-09-23,"—in reply—I thank the honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 , and also thank particularly the opposition for their cooperation in expediting the bill.
I want to say how pleased I was to hear the contribution from the honourable member for Indi, Mr Lieberman. The honourable member for Indi is following in the steps that I followed at one stage in this parliament by chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I know my colleague the member for Aston, Mr Nugent, has also had a long period of involvement with that committee and in these matters.
The honourable member for Indi has been very much involved in pursuing, as this government has, the best ways and means of ensuring that Aboriginals are able to play a meaningful role in the decision making that affects their own lives. And particularly through the consideration recently of some of the issues relating to the reform of Aboriginal land rights law in the Northern Territory, he has had a focus on consultation and involvement.
This has been the hallmark of this government and former governments. There is nothing new about the emphasis on Aboriginal self-management or upon individual self-determination. This is a view supported by the government. It is part and parcel of the way in which previous ministers such as Ian Viner, Peter Baume and Fred Chaney implemented programs when the Fraser government was in office.
I find it very beneficial when we have contributions from members of parliament with considerable experience, like the member for Indi. I welcome the contributions from newer members, such as the informed contribution from the member for Kalgoorlie, who was able to outline, in a very comprehensive way, some of the programs of the government, particularly in the area of training, and the impact that they are having, and the cooperation that is now being seen in the areas of cross-cultural training through the Leonora-Laverton program, which he enumerated. I thank him for that contribution.
I welcome also the contribution from the honourable member for McMillan, because he showed perspicacity in his comments—something that is not often understood by other members of the opposition. He recognised that, ultimately, education, health, housing, employment, and particularly training, are keys to Aboriginals being able to have the capacity to make those decisions in relation to their own lives. That is a very good starting point. He may not know everything that has been done; he may not have the detail of that in his mind, but it is a good starting point for him to focus on those programs and to assist the government with the initiatives that they are taking in this regard.
It is important to focus on training, but you cannot focus on training until you have really started with basic education—literacy and numeracy. They are the sorts of issues that have been very comprehensively dealt with in the programs that my ministerial colleague the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, David Kemp, has been pursuing. It is important to recognise that there has been some movement. As one who has examined these matters over a long period of time, when I look back at what I saw when I was fairly new in the parliament more than 20 years ago, as I visited many centres around Australia, and when I visit those same places today, it is important to recognise that there remains very considerable disadvantage, but there has been change, and it has been positive.
Without that change, the Noel Pearsons of this world, having regard to the education that he has received, would not be there—and he is not alone. When I started in public life 26 years ago, I recall there being two Aboriginal graduates—Charles Perkins and Margaret Valadian. Today, we are talking about thousands of young Aboriginal graduates. That is a very significant shift in a very short period of time. Of course, today, we see year 12 retention rates that have quadrupled over a period of time. We see post-school qualifications doubled to 13.6 per cent. We have seen higher education enrolments trebling. We have seen the proportion of indigenous people in professional occupations rising from 14 to 22 per cent.
These shifts do not occur without a good deal of effort and commitment. But it also ought to be recognised that when you are coming off such a very low base—and it is acknowledged that that is where we were—these sorts of changes are going to be generational in terms of ultimately bringing all Aboriginals to the same sort of standard of living that Australians generally are able to enjoy. That is where we want it to be. That is what we are seeking, and we are seeking it through very practical programs, but also by trying to address the issue of self-esteem, particularly through the approach that we have taken in supporting reconciliation.
Some of the steps that have been taken recently by the parliament, and the support that has been given to the work of the Reconciliation Council, are all incremental, but are going to be very positive in terms of creating an environment in which the programs that are in place—and bear in mind that they cost in the order of $2 billion—are able to have a positive impact.
It is in that context that I want to thank honourable members for their contribution to this debate. The debate is really about implementing ATSIC's section 26 review. I found a high 
 degree of awareness amongst members of what we are doing here: simply ensuring that, when you have an ATSIC chair elected from amongst the members, the place that he or she would have otherwise occupied as one of the regional councillors and zone commissioners be able to be filled in the normal way, so that those people who have given up their representative to assume this leadership role will not be left unrepresented.
We have an election under way. That election is going to be an important one. This will be the first time in which ATSIC is able to elect its own chair. These changes are necessary to ensure that it is able to be conducted and that these aspirations in terms of the new structure are met. I am delighted at the support that is being given to the bill and the expeditious way in which it is being handled. I commend the bill.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to make some comments with regard to the local government elections held in New South Wales on Saturday, 11 September, and the history of senior members of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party in trying to avoid the democratic will of the people.
Leichhardt Council is a somewhat famous council, made more so by the movie Rats in the Ranks. But stories of Leichhardt Council did not end in 1994. On 9 September 1995 there was a general election for Leichhardt Council. In the Glebe-Annandale Ward, Christine Bourne, the Liberal Party's No. 1 candidate, was successful over the ALP's No. 2 candidate, Ms Alice Murphy, by 17 votes. That was to be short-lived because, in the recount held on 15 September, 
 that margin was reduced to three votes. Due to electoral irregularities, legal action was taken by Ms Murphy and on 27 September, in order to stop the mayoral election going ahead, an interlocutory injunction was granted to defer that mayoral election so that the challenge to the New South Wales Supreme Court, acting as a Court of Disputed Returns, could take place.
The mayoral election was indeed deferred for a short time. Unfortunately, some two months later the mayoral election did take place. Christine Bourne's vote at that mayoral election saw the NAN—No Aircraft Noise—Party candidate, Ms Maire Sheehan, elected mayor by that margin of one vote. We then had long legal proceedings. Ms Bourne engaged Peter King, a former head of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party, as her barrister. Richard Smallwood was engaged as her solicitor. On 2 February, in order to show how keen they were to get costs, a bill of over $7,000 was sent to Ms Murphy on behalf of Mr Smallwood for the costs of that interlocutory proceedings.
What occurred after that was that the Court of Disputed Returns overturned the result and ordered that the ballot be recounted with the votes that should have been included to elect Ms Murphy to be included. In order to stop the democratic process and will of the people being carried out by the correctly cast votes being counted, Ms Bourne took further action. She appealed to the Court of Appeal and that court handed down its decision, which was to cast aside the election of Ms Bourne and order a by-election. That was not enough. The Liberal Party heavies, including Peter King, still acting as her barrister, appealed to the High Court of Australia to stop the democratic will of the people being exercised in Leichhardt council. They were again unsuccessful and costs were ordered against Ms Bourne for those proceedings, which by then had gone all the way to the High Court.
The by-election was then held on 14 June 1997. Ms Bourne, running under a `build Badgerys now' platform, failed to succeed in that by-election and Alice Murphy was elected by a significant majority. At that time it did not help that Christine Bourne was the executive director of a four-wheel drive group that had gone into the Wollemi pine, known as `the living fossil', and was advocating a free-for-all in national parks. This Christine Bourne has since shown her senior connections with the Liberal Party by being the state Liberal candidate for the marginal seat of Mulgoa at the last state election, and last Saturday she was a candidate for East Ward of Penrith council.
What is significant about Penrith and Leichhardt and the link with Ms Bourne is that front parties, the Seniors Party and the Marijuana Smokers Party, appeared in both Penrith and Leichhardt giving preferences to the Liberal Party. Christine Bourne, in spite of all this, has refused to pay any of her legal fees and was served a bankruptcy notice last Thursday in the electorate office of the member for Lindsay where she works. Why is it that the Liberal Party of New South Wales, and in particular the campaign being run out of Jackie Kelly's office, is prepared to go to any lengths to stop the democratic processes from taking place? There were other parties there, of course—most amusingly, the No Badgerys Creek Party, which, given that Christine Bourne campaigned for Badgerys Creek when she was in Leichhardt is quite an extraordinary situation.
