Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  I rise to speak on Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2012. The Extended Medicare Safety Net, established by the previous coalition government, assists thousands of Australians with high out-of-hospital medical expenses. For those who have eligible expenses above the relevant thresholds—and I can remind the Senate that that is $598 for concession card holders or $1,198 for all non-concession card holders—the safety net provides 80 per cent of any additional out-of-pocket costs for the remainder of the calendar year.


In the lead-up to the 2007 election those opposite, the Australian Labor Party, claimed that it would honour the safety net and the support it provided to families. The then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd, and the shadow health spokesperson, Nicola Roxon, stated on 22 September 2007:


With about one million people each year receiving some cost relief from the safety net federal Labor will not put more pressure on family budgets by taking that assistance away.


I think we all know what is coming. In the 2009 budget Labor proposed cuts of $610 million from the Extended Medicare Safety Net by capping item numbers for a range of services, including obstetrics, assisted reproductive technology, treatment of varicose veins, the injection of a therapeutic substance into the eye and cataract surgery. The changes, of course, as is typical with the Labor government both under Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard, were proposed without consultation. When have we seen that happen: the social workers, the occupational therapists, the mental health nurses recently—the incentive program? We have seen it with a whole range of things. It is so typical of those opposite. We have seen it in quite a number of programs in mental health. We have recently seen it with aged care. They go out, they do not consult, they make the decisions.


Then there is a kerfuffle and we work out that patients are at risk and then all of a sudden we see quarter backflips, some other backflips and no backflips and an absolute debacle with patients most especially left in the lurch.


Taking you back to 2009 and the proposed cuts of $610 million, the changes were proposed, as I said, without consultation and were a clear breach of the promise given at the previous election—surprise, surprise! Why should this not surprise Australians? Because this is a government whose hallmark of its time in government has been broken promise after broken promise, whether it is the carbon tax and 'there shall be no carbon tax under a government I lead' or something like this in the health or mental health or ageing or any other portfolio.


At that time the coalition secured some important concessions. The government was forced into negotiations with key patient groups and the profession. The coalition's actions resulted in increases in Medicare rebates, increases in the proposed caps and the addition of new items, particularly in relation to IVF. The coalition was also successful in preventing the capping of the item numbers for injections into an eye, which would have been detrimental for patients requiring treatments for macular degeneration.


Given Labor had already broken its promise on the Extended Medicare Safety Net, the coalition also successfully moved an amendment to provide greater scrutiny of any future changes to the caps. It requires that any ministerial determination to change the caps must be approved by a resolution of both houses of parliament. Ultimately, the review of the capping arrangements did show that out-of-pocket expenses had increased for patients for those items that had been capped.


This bill makes further amendments as a result of the caps that the government has put in place. It seems clear that this is an issue which should have been addressed when the caps were enacted. This bill will allow caps on benefits under the Extended Medicare Safety Net to apply where more than one Medicare service is performed on the same patient on the same occasion and it is deemed to constitute one professional service. The bill limits the Medicare benefit payable under the Extended Medicare Safety Net for a deemed professional service to what would apply to the constituent items of service; that is, the Extended Medicare Safety Net cap that will apply in such circumstances will not exceed some of the Extended Medicare Safety Net caps that would apply to the individual Medicare items. The bill appears to address an anomaly rather than making policy changes. It also removes the requirements that families confirm in writing the composition of their family for the purposes of the Extended Medicare Safety Net.


I will now take the Senate to some comments that were made by the health minister on 16 August during the debate of this bill the other place. They are so typical of those opposite, most especially Minister Roxon, the previous health minister. And now Tanya Plibersek, the current health minister, has taken up the usual rhetoric that they normally throw into every health debate, which is this absolute fabrication—the assertion that when the Leader of the Opposition was health minister apparently a sum of money was taken out.




Senator Ludwig:
  He cut $1 billion.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  That is wrong. That is an absolute lie and you know it, Minister Ludwig.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Through the chair, Senator Fierravanti-Wells!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Minister, you know that it is wrong. Let me tell you this.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I withdraw 'lie' and replace it with fabrication. Let me tell you why it is a fabrication. It is misleading, it is wrong and it is something that those opposite continue to parrot. The assertion that funding for public hospitals decreased by $1 billion under the coalition government is false.


Australian government funding for health, including public hospitals, increased significantly under the coalition government. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian government expenditure on public hospitals increased every year from approximately $5.2 billion in 1995-96 to over $12 billion in 2007-08. Annual spending on health and aged care by the Australian government more than doubled from $19.5 billion in 1995-96 to $51.8 billion in 2007-08. Australian government funding to the states under the Australian healthcare agreements was $42 billion between 2003 to 2008, compared to $31.7 billion between 1998 to 2003 and $23.4 billion between 1993 to 1998. The 2003 to 2008 Australian healthcare agreements provided a 17 per cent increase in funding compared to the previous agreement.


The government's claims are untrue. They are wrong, they are misleading. Minister Ludwig, they are a fabrication because in 2003 the coalition government provided an extra $10 billion for public hospitals in the Australian healthcare agreements. Funding for public hospitals from 2003 was 83 per cent higher than under the previous Keating Labor government. A change in the growth rate of the Australian healthcare agreements due to higher private health insurance coverage and other demographic changes was reflected in the forward estimates of 2003. Some public hospital expenditure continued to increase by 17 per cent in real terms in the 2003 to 2008 Australian healthcare agreements, contrary to the false accusations that those opposite continue to peddle. Let me repeat that: from 1993 to 1998, it was $23.4 billion; from 1998 to 2003, it was $31.7 billion, and from 2003 to 2008 it was $42 billion. It is important that those opposite stop peddling this fabrication for some political gain. It is absolutely, totally untrue.


There are some important examples of where the government has broken its promises in health. We have just seen one example through the Extended Medicare Safety Net. But I would like to focus on a couple of areas in my own portfolio which have recently demonstrated yet again this government's incompetence and its mismanagement. It was with great fanfare that we saw mental health in last year's budget. Mental health has been done. We had Get Up! out there with the candles; we had the Prime Minister out there with various people, including Professor McGorry, making comments about mental health and spending. I say to the Australian people that it was an absolute illusion. Where has the money been spent? Do not just take my word for it. Why are we starting to see eminent people like Professor McGorry and Professor Hickie in the press making these comments? I want to raise in particular in article that appeared in March 2012 in Hospital and Aged Care. Here we have Professor Hickie being very critical of the government.


I want to quote from this article. In one part of it Professor Hickie is very critical of the progress that this government has not made in terms of meeting its mental health promises, and he makes this comment:


As a result of the mess left at the end of the Rudd era, key structural issues in mental health services remain unresolved. There is no commonly agreed service model, particularly for out of hospital and ongoing community care. Due to the unholy horse-trading between the Commonwealth and the states, the first good idea that was discarded was a Commonwealth takeover of the funding of state-based community health.


In this article, in which he makes a series of very critical comments against the government, he also makes this comment:


A whole range of other essential services also awaits clarification as to who has the responsibility to fund or deliver. Much has simply been left for later dialogue or worse, potentially, to be delivered via Medicare Locals at some future (unspecified) date.


I could go on, Mr Deputy President, but what is this telling you? This is telling you that this government, in whatever area it is in, is all about spin and no substance. We are dealing with one in five Australians with mental health issues, and here we have leading people like Professor Hickie, Professor McGorry and Professor Mendoza, who resigned so spectacularly from the government's own national health advisory council, criticising the government for its lack of action in even the most basic of ways in relation to mental health. It is a very, very sad indictment of those opposite.


Indeed, we even have the chair of the National Mental Health Commission, Professor Allan Fels, for whom I have great respect, writing an article in the Australian on 1 October under the headline: 'This commission will help mentally ill or I'll quit'. It is very clear that the framework that Professor Fels has had imposed on him in relation to the Mental Health Commission will, in my view, in no way allow him to do what really needs to be done in mental health in this country. Here we have Professor Fels hoping, I think, that the Mental Health Commission will make a difference; but, as he said in his article:


… if it doesn't, I'll be the first to call for it to be closed.


I want turn to some recent events in my Ageing portfolio which demonstrate this government's total lack of transparency and bad faith in its dealings with providers in this country.


Again, we had the fanfare—and Minister Butler is very good at lots of fanfare—with the release on 20 April of the so-called aged care 'reform' package. Certainly, when that package came out, the coalition was, I think, justified in being cautious in its response. We said the devil would be in the detail; and, indeed, the devil has been in the detail. Of course, we did have the peak bodies immediately endorsing the package, but I think they are somewhat regretting that now because they have seen that the devil has been in the detail and they have been short-changed to the tune of $1.6 billion. It is very clear that these changes were done administratively and, therefore, not done with the opportunity of their having public scrutiny. At this stage, we do not know how much of that so-called reform package will require legislation—and, when it does, we will certainly give it proper scrutiny.


I want to take the Senate to the issue of the changes that were announced on 1 July. Again with little or no consultation with the sector, suddenly the sector finds $1.6 billion has been taken out of the aged care funding instrument that was released. I take the Senate to some comments that were made and a report that was commissioned by Leading Age Services Australia. It is revealed that there will be a $750 million shortfall over the next 2½ years in this analysis, which the Centre for International Economics undertook for Leading Age Services Australia. It predicts that 89 per cent of aged care facilities will face unrecoverable losses of revenue under the revised funding model, which came into effect on 1 July. The head of Leading Age Services Australia, in a media release on 10 August 2012, states:


This ultimately means an average reduction of between $20,000 and $23,000 in care funding for each affected resident every year … 


…   …   …


The average loss per aged care facility is more than $125,000 each year, with some facing revenue shortfalls of up to $560,000.


I agree with Mr Mansour, who says:


Smaller and rural facilities are potentially the most affected.


He states:


As running costs continue to rise, aged care providers—unlike most businesses—cannot increase care fees—


because they are pre-set.


Recently we have seen comments made by Grant Thornton that $3.5 billion worth of development has been taken and will be affected in the aged care sector. I conclude by saying that the coalition does not oppose the changes in this bill. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:52):  I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill. I also thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her contribution. Although I am not sure it stayed relevantly close to the bill, we do have wide-ranging second reading debate speeches on this topic.


More than ever before, we are making the most of every precious health dollar. We are guided by the evidence and have invested wisely. We are finding efficiencies and returning the benefits to patients. Where the evidence said things were not working, the Gillard government have done things differently. The bill before this Senate is part of this. We have looked at the evidence on how the extended Medicare safety net works, and it says we need to close the loophole to protect the integrity of the system.


The EMSN provides individuals and families with an additional rebate for their out-of-hospital Medicare services once an annual threshold of out-of-pocket costs is reached. Once the relevant annual threshold has been met, Medicare will pay for 80 per cent of any future out-of-pocket costs for out-of-hospital services for the remainder of the calendar year, except for a number of services where an upper limit of the EMSN benefit cap applies. The government introduced benefit caps for certain services following an independent review that found some providers have used the EMSN to increase their fees to excessive levels. The EMSN was designed to help patients with out-of-pocket costs, not to subsidise excessive charging by some doctors.


Under the current legislation, in certain circumstances where more than one Medicare item is claimed by the same patient on the same occasion and the items are deemed to constitute one professional service, EMSN benefit caps are unable to apply as originally intended. An example of this is where patients have more than one operation performed at the same time. Some doctors are performing multiple operations to avoid the EMSN benefit caps. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and allows the EMSN benefit cap to apply even when multiple services are performed. This means that the Medicare benefit goes towards helping patients with out-of-pocket costs, not on subsidising excessive charging by doctors. Importantly, it helps to protect the integrity and sustainability of the EMSN, and for those reasons this bill is supported.


I note the opposition are also supporting the bill. In reply to some of the issues raised in the second reading debate speeches raised by the coalition, one of the areas where there is really a stark contrast between the views taken by those opposite and this government is if you look at one area in GP bulk-billing rates.


We think bulk-billing rates do provide an indication of the difference between this government and those opposite. In 2003, under the coalition, bulk-billing plunged to a low of around 67 per cent. This government has spent a record $17.64 billion in Medicare benefits, excluding dental benefits. That is an average of about $784 in Medicare benefits for every Australian. So GP bulk-billing rates are now at a record 81.2 per cent. The coalition could never claim to have improved bulk-billing rates. This government has set out to improve the bulk-billing rate and has improved it significantly. Why? Because we have an unprecedented investment in health and hospitals across Australia, unlike those opposite, who took a billion dollars out of the health system.


If you look at bulk-billing rates since 2008, you will see that we have invested a record $2 billion to drive them up, with incentives for general practice, pathology, diagnostic imaging and telehealth services. If you look at the record of the coalition, you can see that it has only ever stood for cuts to health, which means cuts to bulk-billing and higher fees for Australians when they go to the doctor. The opposition have characterised this debate as a health debate. Our record stands for itself, while the coalition failed to deliver during their 10 years in government. But we are not talking about that; we are talking about a health legislation insurance amendment to ensure that it continues to deliver for Australians. So, with those short words, I commend the bill to the Senate.

In reply to some of the issues raised in the second reading debate speeches raised by the coalition, one of the areas where there is really a stark contrast between the views taken by those opposite and this government is if you look at one area in GP bulk-billing rates.


We think bulk-billing rates do provide an indication of the difference between this government and those opposite. In 2003, under the coalition, bulk-billing plunged to a low of around 67 per cent. This government has spent a record $17.64 billion in Medicare benefits, excluding dental benefits. That is an average of about $784 in Medicare benefits for every Australian. So GP bulk-billing rates are now at a record 81.2 per cent. The coalition could never claim to have improved bulk-billing rates. This government has set out to improve the bulk-billing rate and has improved it significantly. Why? Because we have an unprecedented investment in health and hospitals across Australia, unlike those opposite, who took a billion dollars out of the health system.


If you look at bulk-billing rates since 2008, you will see that we have invested a record $2 billion to drive them up, with incentives for general practice, pathology, diagnostic imaging and telehealth services. If you look at the record of the coalition, you can see that it has only ever stood for cuts to health, which means cuts to bulk-billing and higher fees for Australians when they go to the doctor. The opposition have characterised this debate as a health debate. Our record stands for itself, while the coalition failed to deliver during their 10 years in government. But we are not talking about that; we are talking about a health legislation insurance amendment to ensure that it continues to deliver for Australians. So, with those short words, I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  There has been a constant in the political debates over the past few years, a constant first pushed by the Liberal Premier from Western Australia and then followed by Liberal Premiers in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland—a constant push not to search for ways and means to grow the wealth of our great land but to ruin 80 years of fiscal union and throw out the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation; a push to throw out this equitable method of distributing finances across the Commonwealth and replace it with a simple per capita split. Unfortunately for our great country, this push has now consumed the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz.


Vital Tasmanian services that our community needs are at risk from Senator Abetz's meddling on this issue. On ABC radio in Tasmania on 26 July this year, Senator Abetz said that he wants Tasmania to get its fair share of the GST revenue. Senator Abetz could not give a guarantee that the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation would remain. Instead, Tasmanian Senator Abetz stated that he understands Western Australia's concerns. This is a classic case of trying to hedge your bet both ways. The concerns of Western Australia's Liberal Premier are unfounded. The state is rolling in cash from the mining boom and the Liberals have no regard for the extreme negative effects of trashing our fiscal union.


I urge all in this place to support the principle that has been the bedrock of our fiscal union for the past 80 years, the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation—a bedrock principle that has contributed to Australia weathering all storms, particularly, this current two-speed economy that is sapping manufacturing and low margin exports from the eastern states. Our system of horizontal fiscal equalisation seeks to ensure that all states and territories have the financial capacity to provide to their residents services of the same standard in areas such as education, health, transport and public safety. It does not mean that there will be equal services in each state; it is up to each state government to decide how best to spend its budget. But for each state government to even get to the starting line in providing decent services to its people, we need a fair system.


We have a fair system. We use HFE to distribute the goods and services tax—the state's tax, as it is known. The GST distribution relativities are calculated by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, an independent body. The method used by the Commonwealth Grants Commission is to take a per capita split of GST then adjust for two broad measures. It is these measures that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, would cast aside. The first is the expenditure need of the state. This takes into account a variety of factors that determine the costs of providing services in the state—for example, wages, population density and levels of disability. The second is the revenue need of the state. This takes into account a state's own sources of revenue—for example, land tax and mining royalties. In effect, the formula seeks to provide a relatively higher share of grants to states that have below average capacity to raise their own revenues and/or have to spend more to provide the same standard of public services as other states due to disadvantage or isolation.


Ironically, the parlous state of the Western Australian economy in the late 1920s stimulated the federal discussions for interstate financial transfers. The fact is that the Commonwealth Grants Commission was created for Western Australia's benefit. Mr Abbott and Senator Abetz need to understand that the principle of HFE has benefitted the state of Western Australia for most of the past 80 years. I quote the Western Australian Department of Treasury and Finance:


… in the early days of Federation, the Western Australian economy bore little resemblance to its present prosperous form. Isolated by geography and unable to exploit the free trade between States that resulted from the newly formed Constitution, it became necessary in 1925 for the Commonwealth to establish a Royal Commission into Western Australia's financial disabilities.


As a result, in 1933 the Commonwealth Grants Commission was formed to oversee a more equitable distribution of Commonwealth finances, which resulted in Western Australia being given the status of 'claimant State', and being in receipt of special grants from the Commonwealth for the next 30 years or so.


The fact is that Western Australia has spent most of Federation living off transfers from the more populous states.


A further history lesson: iron ore was not discovered in Western Australia until the fifties. The mining industry was then not established for another 20 years. Then a long-term decline in commodities prices meant that Western Australia still received a slight subsidy. In fact, in 2006, with gold pouring out of Kalgoorlie and iron ore being extracted from the Pilbara and the Kimberly, Western Australia was still a claimant state. What Mr Abbott and Senator Abetz need to understand is that Western Australia has in effect used all of the other states for these years, biding its time and receiving its handouts, only for it to turn around now and foolishly seek to cut off its mates over in the east.


It has been estimated that a move to distribute GST on a per capita basis could lead to a loss of $630 million from Tasmania's annual budget—$630 million—each and every year. I could do a man, woman and child analysis but I will leave that to those opposite. Instead, I will focus on the impact on Tasmanian services. Cutting $630 million is equivalent to sacking 800 doctors, 3,000 nurses, 500 allied health professionals and 100 child protection staff combined.


These are job cuts and resultant losses to vital services that Tasmanians cannot afford. These are facts that Senator Abetz and Mr Abbott cannot ignore.


A review of the distribution of GST revenue was announced by the Australian government on 30 March 2011. This review was tasked with considering whether the current methodology of sharing GST revenue among the states will ensure that Australia is best placed to respond to structural and other challenges. Importantly, the review endorsed the principle of HFE. The focus of the review is on how the future challenges facing Australia will impact on equalisation. The challenges identified include continued globalisation, climate change, population growth and demographic change, the impact of technology, and the need to address Indigenous disadvantage.


The review definitely did not set out to undermine the principle of our fiscal union, HFE. Nor did it set out to take from those doing it tough and to give to the states that have solid revenues purely because of the location of mineral deposits. The idea set forth by the Western Australian Liberals and taken up by their eastern states' adopted son, Mr Abbott, that there should be a special deal for Western Australia surely is implying that Western Australians, though, are entitled to higher levels of finance for their schools and hospitals than someone in Rosebery, Zeehan or Queenstown—Tasmania's mining region. It implies that children who face extreme disadvantage due to isolation in this region of Tasmania should receive less support for their education than a child who is born in Western Australia. All this will achieve is to further entrench regional inequalities for future generations.


I applaud the tenacity of Tasmanian Premier and Treasurer, Lara Giddings, in her swift and comprehensive action to present Tasmania's case to the review. Tasmania's share of GST revenue equates to approximately 40 per cent of the state's total revenue. Tasmania receives slightly more than 1½ times its population share of GST revenue due to its inherent disadvantages. Examples of this disadvantage include: Tasmania's lower capacity to raise many types of revenue; the lower per capita gross state product and smaller tax base; Tasmania has an older population than the rest of the country, lower socioeconomic status and an above average proportion of Indigenous people; and Tasmania's isolation and population dispersion. It is logical that where population is as decentralised as it is in Tasmania, the costs of delivering services per person increases.


Senators may not be aware, but only about 45 per cent of Tasmania's population lives in the capital city, Hobart. Around 80 per cent of Western Australia's population lives in their capital city, Perth. Tasmanians are spread across our island: from the dairy farming in Circular Head to the mining and fish farming on the West Coast, the grazing lands of the Midlands and the industrial hub of Bell Bay. Tasmania's geographic disadvantages cannot be understated. With the support of other states, Tasmania can continue to produce the high quality food and beverage products that we are famed across the world for.


But workers cannot produce these wares without adequate government services behind them: without a local school for their children to learn the basics of maths, science and language; without a doctor in case they are taken ill; without decent police and emergency services for times of crisis; and without decent roads and rail to connect each person to these services and to get their wares to market. The Tasmanian federal Labor team, led by Minister Julie Collins, has been very strong on this matter. At our recent Tasmanian state conference, Minister Collins moved a motion pushing for the maintenance of the HFE system. Importantly, this motion was supported by Australia's Treasurer, Wayne Swan, in his presentation to the conference.


The Labor Party, through the core of their leadership team, support the principle of HFE. It is in our DNA; we support a fair go for all Australians. That is why Labor are rolling out the pilots of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is why Labor instigated the Gonski review of school funding and why I and many other Labor members and senators are campaigning for its implementation. It is why we stimulated the economy during the greatest financial crisis since the establishment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to save over 500,000 jobs and keep Australians working.


It is vital that the Tasmanian Liberal senators stand up to Mr Abbott on behalf of all Tasmanians. We have four Liberal senators from Tasmania, and each and every one of them needs to be knocking on Mr Abbott's door and telling him that it is not okay to sell out Tasmania. The Tasmanian Liberal senators need to unequivocally state whether or not they support the HFE method and whether they are willing to sell out Tasmanians and let Tony Abbott move the Liberals to a per capita method. Minister Collins has written to Senator Eric Abetz on behalf of the Tasmanian Labor team, asking him to make a commitment that he and his Tasmanian Liberal Senate team will support Tasmania and fight for the retention of the HFE method. We are yet to hear a response. The 800 doctors, 3,000 nurses, 500 allied health professionals and over 100 child protection staff whose jobs are on the line from the Abbott-led Liberals are yet to hear a response.


It is not enough to simply say that Tasmania will get a 'fair deal'. Mr Abbott's idea of a 'fair deal' would rip the heart out of the Tasmanian budget. It would rip the heart out of vital public services that Tasmanians depend on. Just this week, Mr Abbott continued his trash talking of Tasmania. Mr Abbott said in South Australia to his party's faithful that the state can become more like Western Australia or it can become more like Tasmania. This is petty politicking at its worst. My state of Tasmania produces many fine products and in many areas punches well above its weight. We have been hit hard by the global slowdown, the high Australian dollar caused by Western Australia's full speed ahead approach to mining and by the downturn in the forestry industry.


People often say that there is no hope left in Tasmania, that all the jobs are drying up and that they have to try and move interstate and find work. To that I point to the record $4½ billion worth of private sector investment, growing at a faster rate than any other non-mining state, and I highlight that local businesses have invested more than $1½ billion in machinery and equipment over the past year, at a growth rate more than double the rest of the nation. Tasmanians have the desire, the skill and the courage to move our state forward. Senators, we must look beyond this current paradigm. HFE has served all states in Australia well. Just look to Europe to see the devastation of a monetary union without an efficient and equitable fiscal union. We must all commit to maintaining the principles of HFE.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-08-22,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


It is interesting that this is the minister who is supposed to represent the Labor Left; who is supposed to be a person who can stand her ground; who is supposed to be part of the reason, you would imagine, that the Labor Party did not take on what was obviously the eminently wise immigration policy of John Howard. But since Minister Wong decided that John Howard's policy was the one that she wanted to support, and obviously all the Labor Left colleagues agreed, obviously led by Senator Evans, we now have to rely on that same strength of character, that same commitment, that same stoic nature to be able to guide us through part and parcel of the introduction of the carbon tax.


It is going to be quite perplexing as we see the bills that are coming through at the moment. I was talking today to a substantial farmer from South Australia, the minister's state, who is going to have to pay approximately $35,800 this year for the carbon tax. I was trying to work out what I would tell this farmer that they are going to get for that. What exactly do farmers get for that expenditure? If they turn on the television set they might presume that they get Craig Thomson back. Maybe you get him for that, I do not know. You would be surprised what you can buy with that sort of money. He knows the value of what you can buy on a credit card. Maybe you could get that. Maybe you could get whatever we are seeing on the front page of the Australian at the moment with the AWU and the issues pertaining to that. Maybe that is what you get for the sort of money that is on offer from the carbon tax.


We have to realise that what this is actually going to do is go to a very vulnerable section of the economy, a section, especially in agriculture, that cannot pass on their costs. They will either have to absorb the costs by a lower standard of living or by putting people off. If they are putting people off, I do not quite know how this is assisting regional Australia. They tell us today that they have been the champions of regional Australia. One suspects that they are the champions for regional Australia in the same manner that Minister Wong is the champion of the Labor Left. How she has failed so miserably in trying to look after the issues of the left wing of the Labor Party is how miserably they are looking after regional Australia. They are great at the rhetoric, but they are not so good at the delivery. 


Since the Labor Left is really a defunct organisation now, has no real meaning, no purpose, no strength of conviction, no ability to stand on its own two pegs; seeing they are now pointless—



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator JOYCE:
  I congratulate Senator Sterle because he is part of the Right and the Right run the show. You are to be congratulated, Senator Sterle, for the way that you have rolled the Labor Left, backwards and forth, backwards and forth, backwards and forth, and shown what an absolutely pathetic organisation they have become. 



Senator Thorp interjecting—




Senator JOYCE:
  It is good to see a new senator in here who gave her maiden speech merely a couple of weeks ago—and it was great to listen to it—as part of the Labor Left. But within merely days they have been rolled on one of their key policies. This is the sort of conviction, the stoic nature—



Senator McLucas interjecting—




Senator JOYCE:
  Senator McLucas: there is another person from the Labor Left who was absolutely rolled, backwards and forth, complete and utter doormat to the Right. But we must congratulate Senator Sterle and congratulate Minister Conroy for rolling over Minister Wong, for rolling over Senator Douglas Cameron, for rolling over all the Labor Left and making them look like complete and utter imbeciles without even a philosophical soul. But they will, apparently, be able to look after regional Australia; they will, apparently, be able to look after people with the carbon tax. They cannot even look after themselves. They cannot even stand up for themselves. How on earth can they stand up for anybody else? How on earth could they look after anybody else? In complete hypocritical format we have seen people such as Senator Evans tell us that the greatest thing he ever did—not one of the greatest things he ever did, not amongst the greatest things he ever did, but the greatest thing he ever did—was to wind back the Pacific solution. He is of the Labor Left, you see, but he got rolled. So what we have now is a complete capitulation. 


There is another person who is in the Labor Left who is a reflection of the stoic nature, the absolute will of iron, the undoubted character. That person's name is Prime Minister Julia Gillard, another person who has that will of iron, that insurmountable character that can be totally relied on. But we do not quite know anymore whether she has been rolled or not because we do not know what she believes in— (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:06):  I rise to participate in this debate on the motion to take note of answers. The first point I would like to make is that the well-known and dominant principle called the 'vomit principle' is apparent in this debate. During every single question time and at every single opportunity the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, and his disciples repeat, ad infinitum, erroneous and non-factual positions on the carbon price. They believe if these positions are repeated often enough they will become part of the Australian public's understanding.


It is a fairly sobering position that Australia is the 15th largest polluter in the world and the largest polluter per person. There is a general community understanding that something needs to be done about this position. I have participated in a number of climate change forums where people have been invited to come along and make a contribution to this debate. I can specifically recall one at the Norwood town hall which, I must admit, I went to with a degree of trepidation having listened to the position from the other side and being a recently elected senator. It was a reasonably well-attended forum and the people there were concerned that Australia was 15th in the world in pollution and the largest polluter per person. There was no regurgitating of the position put by the opposition. One of the important contributions in that debate was a simple and clear presentation from a university lecturer from the University of Adelaide. He had a very dry economic position. Simply put, his position was: 'If it is free to pollute there is no incentive not to pollute; if there is a price on pollution then you will change behaviour.' That is an economic principle which I think stands across a number of areas, not only the carbon emission debate.


I was a bit of a spender, if you like, with my electricity. I would not turn off lights when I moved from different parts of the house. I quickly got re-educated by the person in charge of the household. I can go back to a debate we had during an enterprise bargaining negotiation in Alice Springs, where the airport manager actually insisted that everybody start being frugal with electricity in order to reduce their bills. We laughed at him but I might add that after a month of him taking solitary action he came back to show us the difference in the electricity bill.


I do not think there is anything wrong with a price on carbon which has the effect of changing our behaviour in using a scarce and expensive resource. What is really apparent in this debate is the absurdity of the coalition. They fail to disclose that cost impacts are only a percentage of business turnover—that electricity is a percentage of business turnover. It is estimated that total electricity costs represent only two per cent of turnover. To come in here with all these examples of educational institutions and hotels that are going to close their doors, lay people off, stop selling or stop educating because a fraction of their business cost has gone up is quite erroneous.


The other side of the equation is simply that there is a compensation package which allows people, particularly small business, to justify the impact of any electricity increase and pass it on. There are proper tests and checks and balances in respect of that but that is a clear and unequivocal position. The compensation package is widely understood to be in place in that event.


In summary, a price on emissions will change behaviour. It will change the behaviour of the big polluters. It has changed my behaviour. I may not be under the same pressure as an ordinary householder in paying my electricity bill but I have changed my behaviour in this matter.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-08-22,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:11):  I also wish to take note of answers given by Senator Wong to questions asked by coalition senators. We have heard more denial from the government this afternoon about the impact of their carbon tax. It stands to reason that schools use a fair amount of electricity: classrooms have to be lit, heated or cooled, and there are computers and AV equipment in many of them. Those school halls the Prime Minister has built, whether or not the schools actually wanted them, all have electric equipment in them too. School canteens prepare hot food for students. All of this requires electricity.


The July power bill of one large high school showed a carbon charge of almost $500 separately listed on an account totalling just $6,000. Schools just cannot cop that. The cost of a canteen lunch is going to have to go up. Shame on Labor. Shame on the government. Once again this government and this Prime Minister are asking us to trust them. They claim any increases will be offset by the indexation of federal funding. They want parents to trust them on that and now they want parents to trust them on the Gonski review of school funding.


This government is playing Australians for fools. It thinks it can get away with anything. The problem that is now coming home to roost, though, is that no-one trusts this Prime Minister or this shambolic, deceptive, incompetent government that she leads. Over the weekend we saw a leaked list of 3,200 schools—Julia Gillard's hit list of schools that will have their funding cut. Hit lists are not new to the Labor Party. Back in 2004, when Mark Latham was the new sensation and Julia Gillard his chief cheerleader, Labor had a hit list of schools targeted for funding cuts. They were proud of it. You will not often hear me praise Mark Latham but at least he was honest about the fact that he was committed to cutting school funding. Julia Gillard says she has no plans to cut funding—just like she had no plans to challenge Kevin Rudd; just like she had no plans to alter the private health insurance rebate; just like she had no plans to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax. Yet on Monday during an interview on Sky News, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Minister Garrett, was asked to guarantee that no school would be worse off. He could not.


We have the Prime Minister running around telling us that everything is wonderful—that there will be chicken in every pot, or perhaps I should say a sausage roll in every lunchbox; everyone will be better off. On the same day we have her own minister refusing to support her claims. If we take everything that has been said in the last day, Labor's position is that every school will be better off—but they cannot guarantee that no school will be worse off. No wonder parents are confused.


I would like to turn for a moment to focus on schools across the Great Southern region of Western Australia—an area in which I take a great interest. I had a look at the hit list and was horrified to discover that some of the schools targeted for significant cuts are some of those most in need. There are many communities across the Great Southern that have been identified as being areas of high socioeconomic need. They are proud and hardworking communities, but they are not necessarily wealthy communities. For instance, one of the schools on the hit list for a funding reduction is the Western Australian College of Agriculture at Narrogin. This is a school that is training the next generation of farmers. We all know that it is becoming harder to keep young people working on the land. Families that have farmed for generations are selling up because their kids do not want to carry on farming.


For those who do choose to remain, we need to ensure that their kids have the best education possible and the very best practical farming education there is so that they can run successful farms in the years to come. We are talking about people who will grow our food in the years ahead. This government seems incapable of understanding that simple fact. The Western Australian College of Agriculture at Narrogin is slated to have its funding slashed by over $2.7 million. To take another example, the Gonski hit list proposes a funding cut of over $1.7 million for the Mount Barker Community College, a school that services a catchment area with a significant Indigenous population and high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. There are many other schools on Labor's hit list, including Kojonup District High School, Katanning Senior High School, Southern Cross District High, Brookton District High and Newdigate Primary School. By my count, 41 schools across the Great Southern region are on the hit list. None of them are wealthy schools. Many of them are government schools. This is more bad news for the Great Southern community from a government that either does not understand rural and regional communities or simply does not care.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (15:16):  I sometimes think that on the issue of carbon pricing and how to deal with global warming we have the most clear and striking contrast between the attitudes of the people opposite and the people on my side in this place. There is a very stark contrast.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator THORP:
  I am glad to see that even some of the flat-earthers have been dragged, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century to recognise that global warming is a significant issue in our country—in fact, in the whole world. Where I live is a coastal region surrounded by areas like Clifton Beach, Sandford and Lauderdale. Work done by our local council, the Clarence City Council, has shown that the dangers of inundation on our coast are very real and significant, particularly dangers coming from storm surges. We are dealing with a very serious problem. It is quite disconcerting to have it trivialised so much by those people opposite. At least the government is taking very sensible action in trying to do something about this serious threat. We are not doing it by imposing a debt of $1,300 on every household in Australia and then handing that money over to the big polluters to spend as they will in some bizarre hope that, if given extra money, they will cut their pollution. No, that is not how Labor is addressing it. Labor is addressing it by making sure that the big polluters have an incentive to change their behaviour and reduce their carbon emissions by having a carbon price put on those emissions. It is a sensible and practical way to do it.


It is often said by members opposite that this is the world's biggest tax. In fact, Australia is in the middle of the pack in terms of global action on carbon pricing. The report The critical decade: international action on climate change found that 90 countries, representing 90 per cent of the global economy, have committed to reduce their carbon pollution and have policies in place to achieve those reductions. The Climate Commission concluded that by next year 850 million people will be living in countries or states with emissions trading schemes, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland. Those people opposite should be praising this government for taking sensible action on this issue rather than being so negative.




Senator Fifield:
  For lying?




Senator THORP:
  If you wish to use the word 'lie', this gives lie to the claim by the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, that we are only going to achieve a significant reduction in emissions if there is global action, and at the moment there is no sign whatsoever that the rest of the world is going to do things like introduce carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes. If there is a lie, there is the lie. What will the coalition's Direct Action policy take us to? It will destroy our international competitiveness, it will leave Australian businesses behind the rest of the world, it will make the essential task of reducing emissions even more difficult and costly for us and it will rip $1,000 out of the pockets of hardworking Australians, pensioners, students and families as you reduce—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are as untruthful as your leader.




Senator THORP:
  Ha ha!




Senator Wong:
  Ignore him. He's completely irrelevant.




Senator THORP:
  I know. If the coalition get their way, it will be particularly painful for my state of Tasmania: 171,000 Tasmanian taxpayers may well lose their tax cut; 102,000 Tasmanians and 5,000 self-funded retirees will have money ripped out of their pockets if Tony Abbott rolls back carbon pricing; and a couple on the full age pension will have over $500 slashed from their pension under Mr Abbott's plan. What is most concerning to me is that this is a double whammy for Tasmania, because this is the same opposition that would, if in government, also rip $600 million per year from my state alone. I really wish the Leader of the Opposition in this place were present here because I am still waiting for a commitment from Mr Abetz that he will stand with his fellow Tasmanians, like yourself Mr Deputy President, to make sure that that cruel fate does not come to our state.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-08-22,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (15:22):  I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Wong to questions asked by coalition senators about carbon pricing. It is not actually the question I was hoping to be speaking on, but, nonetheless, I am pleased to participate in this part of the debate. I note the comments of Senator Gallacher, who spoke earlier. I am sorry he is not here. If my memory serves me correctly, Senator Gallacher and, indeed, Senator Sterle made a big song and dance about the carbon tax and transport, but what needs to be remembered is that, if the Australian Labor Party is re-elected, in 2015 there will indeed be a carbon tax on transport. I did not hear Senator Gallacher talk about that today. I wonder why. He knows what effect the carbon tax will have on transport from 2015. I would have hoped that he would stand up today to defend and look after his constituency by viciously attacking the imposition of a carbon tax on transport. He knows what financial impact it will have on the sector; he knows the potential employment impact.


I want to talk about the greatest lie ever told in a deliberate attempt to mislead the Australian people, and that, of course, was the statement by the Prime Minister prior to the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led. That indeed has proved to be a lie. The opposition have said quite clearly that we will untie this lie. If we are elected we will abolish the carbon tax. I suspect I know what will happen in relation to the carbon tax after the next election if we win it. Those opposite will be sitting on the side of the parliament which is voting for the abolition of that carbon tax. They will be voting with us in relation to the carbon tax, so every single word uttered by Minister Wong and the conga line of people on the other side about the bonuses and positive impact of the carbon tax will be thrown out in about the time it takes to count the vote after the division, which will no doubt be called by the Greens, who no doubt will be Labor's bed partners at that stage.


In the time left to me, I want to go back to a question asked by Senator Nash of Minister Wong. I do not think anyone should underestimate the impact of the Prime Minister's comment in the past week on small business in this country. When the Prime Minister said that business should simply pass on additional costs to customers in full, she belled the cat on the impact of this tax on small business and on all Australians. It was an extraordinary statement from the Prime Minister of this country. It was a statement undoubtedly driven by the fact that she knows in her heart of hearts what impact this tax will have. She knows full well that she told the world's greatest lie in relation to the world's greatest carbon tax before the last election, to buy off the vote of the Australian Greens. We are now confronted with a tax that will do untold economic damage to this country, and the Australian Labor Party is going to vote to abolish it anyway after the next election if the coalition is elected.


I want to talk about the company that Senator Nash referred to, Geoffrey Thompson Holdings. They have been hit with a one-month carbon tax bill of over $10,000, or 15 per cent, and cannot pass that on. As Geoffrey Thompson Holdings said, they 'may have to reduce their workforce to save costs'. Another company, a food manufacturer from central Victoria, approached me in the last 24 hours. They said they had been told by the supermarket they supply that under no circumstances should they even contemplate passing on their increased costs, because they simply would not be paid and that order would go to another supplier who was prepared to try to absorb the costs themselves. This will have an extraordinarily damaging impact on our economy. (Time expired)

  I want to reiterate what I spoke about at length in the chamber last night, and that is: these footprints are probably going to prove to be some of the most important trackways and dinosaur footprints on this earth. We are talking about footprints that were left 130 million years ago. Some of these footprints have been left by what are now thought to be some of the biggest dinosaurs that ever walked this earth. The connection between these footprints and Aboriginal culture is also unique in the world. The government is continually saying, 'It's not our problem.' It is, because these are so important. This project should be rejected on the basis of these footprints alone, besides anything else—the marine environment, of course, and the rest of the terrestrial environment. It is not good enough for this government to wash its hands of this issue and to say that it is a state responsibility. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-08-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:01):  On the last sitting day in June, as this chamber knows, the Senate passed the stronger futures legislation, a policy for which there is no substantive evidence that it will be effective, just like its predecessor, the Northern Territory intervention, had no substantive evidence of its effectiveness. At around the same time that the Senate was considering the stronger futures legislation, results of the 2011 census were released. This stronger futures legislation and the government's policy approach is supposed to be closing the gap of Aboriginal disadvantage—the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in life expectancy and socioeconomic indicators. I would have expected to see that the gap in those socioeconomic differences was closing. In fact, the census showed us that in those key socioeconomic indicators between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia it is not closing. That gap is not vanishing. In fact, there was very little difference between the 2006 and 2011 censuses. The latest data on Closing the Gap, the figures from the end of last year, showed escalating reports of self-harm and suicide. I will come to employment in a minute.


What is particularly concerning about those reports is that the feedback I am getting from those on the ground in the Northern Territory is of shell-shocked communities, a feeling of disempowerment, continuing reports of people talking about a loss of dignity and with extreme despondency about the way that communities have been promised a lot that has not been delivered.


We have seen some changes, of course. We no longer have government business managers; we have government engagement coordinators. But, again, as with the government business managers, people do not know what they are supposed to be doing or what has changed. What has changed is that around the rest of Australia we have seen a defunding of some programs in order to fund the stronger futures legislation. One of the things the government made communities understand is that in their 10-year commitment to ongoing funding—and 10-year and long-term funding is a good idea—there was little new money being delivered. There are some programs being continued. Money has been cut from other programs, such as the Indigenous law and justice programs, where we have seen $23.9 million over four years being redirected. We have seen money being redirected from the National Native Title Tribunal. We have seen money being redirected from the intensive literacy and numeracy programs for underachieving Indigenous students. We have seen community festivals and education engagement funding being cut. We have seen cuts to funding to the youth mobility and youth leadership programs, and to programs designed to address petrol sniffing—that critical element of youth diversionary programs. 


Just last week at our inquiry into the Low Aromatic Fuel Bill, commonly known as the Opal fuel bill, the department confirmed that approximately $1 million a year has been cut from those very necessary youth diversionary programs. One of those programs does some work in the Northern Territory but the others are from around the rest of Australia. So what we have seen here is a cut in funding from other programs to prop up the government's commitment in the Northern Territory—a commitment to programs that are not working. They are not closing the gap. They are not significantly changing those socioeconomic programs. They are not delivering better outcomes for employment.


Some of the latest survey work from the Bureau of Statistics—Labour force characteristics of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians—shows that the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia in terms of the ratio of employment to population remains the same at 25 per cent. In fact, figures for the Northern Territory are worse.


In some states there has been stagnation but in the Northern Territory the figure is the lowest at 37.9. As Jon Altman points out in the article that he wrote recently about this issue, it is the lowest despite the intervention and the reputed creation of 2,000 public sector jobs in prescribed communities. The intervention—and I keep calling it 'the intervention' because, as everyone in the communities knows, 'stronger futures' is simply a rebadging of 'the intervention'—has disempowered people in communities and we all know that the first step to closing the gap is about empowering people, about making programs culturally appropriate.


Another recent report, from a team led by Professor Pat Dudgeon from the University of Western Australia, was released just the other day, Hear our voices. It also points out the extreme importance of making sure that you have strong community, that you are building a leadership capacity, that the programs are developed by the community and delivered in partnership with the community, that there is community ownership and that, importantly, we build cultural strength. One of the most overwhelming comments that people make about the intervention is the disempowerment of community, the top-down approach and the lack of consultation when the intervention was first imposed. Those are the key elements that we hear all the time from communities.


Just this week we had a delegation visiting this place from Utopia which reinforced the fact that people feel disempowered, that people were not consulted, that they feel an overwhelming sense of despondency because of strong futures and the approach the government is taking because the government, with stronger futures, has repeated the same mistakes from the intervention. There was a farce of a consultation process and I can name a number of reports and go through ad infinitum the number of complaints that my office has received and that have also been written up about the poor consultation process. I think there are enough to knock that fallacy on the head. There is also the evidence that the Senate Community Affairs Committee received when inquiring into stronger futures, which overwhelmingly criticised the consultation approach. So, again, communities were not adequately consulted about the future.


But the key thing here is that we are not getting those community driven programs that are culturally based. Importantly, there are homelands, and one of the constant complaints that we have been receiving is the failure of the government to support homelands. Yes, they have continued the funding for homelands—but at a minimum amount. What I was told yesterday as to what you see at Utopia is that you get $2,000 for a home refurbishment in a non-hub town or a non-growth town and you get $70,000 in a growth town. People feel overwhelmingly disenfranchised and that the government does not value homelands and is not investing in homelands. But it is the homelands that deliver connection to country where people feel at home and where people feel their cultural strength, yet the government's policy drives people out of homelands into growth towns, where you get a lot more social dysfunction, where people feel isolated and do not have their cultural strengths. So what the government needs to be doing is rethinking its approach to policies to deliver, and also to address Aboriginal disadvantage. (Time expired)

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (16:11):  Mr Deputy President, I made it my business to come in this afternoon and listen to all of the contributions from the Greens in their opening speeches on this section of our business today. I think that if you had listened very carefully to the last 10 minutes you would not have heard one policy idea, you would not have heard of one initiative, you would not have heard of one solution, you would not have heard of one way of moving this debate forward. I understand, Senator Siewert, that you have an interest in this area but I think that your knowledge of what is going on through the length and breadth of the Northern Territory clouds your view about what a lot of people think about this.


So let us go to stronger futures. It is not a rebadging of the intervention. It suits you and it suits your political rhetoric to try to encourage Indigenous people in the Northern Territory to believe that but though there are many aspects of the Northern Territory Emergency Response, which was introduced under the Howard government, in it they have now gone and no longer exist in this legislation because we have spent four years talking to Indigenous people about a way forward. This is unlike when the intervention was first introduced by a former minister, Mal Brough, and occurred overnight. What we did, as I said in my speech in a contribution to the stronger futures legislation debate, was get Peter Yu and his group of three to conduct consultations. We changed the legislation so it complied with the Racial Discrimination Act.


We have been out there a number of times talking to people about what they want. People focus on the 12 weeks in which the consultations on that particular piece of legislation this year were focused, but the reality is that people like Minister Warren Snowdon and his staff, me and my staff and Minister Macklin, to her credit—and Senator Scullion, I have to say—actually get out on the ground week after week and hear a much more balanced view about what is going on out there than you do.


Three weeks ago I had the privilege of going to Dhanaya, which is a homeland in north-east Arnhem Land, and I sat there with nearly 300 people for 11 hours that day. I was extremely privileged to be part of a young boy's initiation ceremony followed by, several hours later, a funeral, and in the course of that day I got to speak to many people at Dhanaya. What I know is this: people out there are very confused about the shire council reforms that have been undertaken by the Northern Territory government and they say that these have taken their voices away.


The Northern Territory government is working through that because it was an inefficient and inept system of managing local government. We and the Northern Territory government are working to ensure that those small communities have consultative groups that work within those shires. They talk about their voices being removed. Let us make sure that that is not wrapped up in the stronger futures package. Let us be really clear about this. It is about the local government reform, which is major and massive—73 communities are now down to nine super shires. Is it going to work overnight? Of course it is not, but it is going to take years to make sure that people know what has happened.


We talk about consulting with Indigenous people. I think we have done it better than many governments have done it in the past. Wherever we have built houses, we have a local housing reference group. I was at Wadeye three weeks ago where there are 75 new houses. You would seriously think that it was a suburb anywhere in this country. It is in a square grid. It has sealed roads. It has guttering. For the first time ever I have seen new houses put in Indigenous communities with guttering, lines marked on the road, power lights overhead, footpaths and fences. I was astonished when I saw it and the people there were eminently proud of this new lot of housing. It was done in consultation with Indigenous people, so 75 houses were not just built anywhere. I could say the same about Maningrida and the new houses on Groote Eylandt.


All of the growth towns have a local implementation plan—an LIP. Those communities have been asked to identify 10 priorities in their community. Those priorities change and are different. Each of those communities has a local implementation plan committee working with local government, the NT government and the Commonwealth government and the community. There are four parties that sign up to that local implementation plan.


So things are very different out there. Sure, it is a struggle. I have been in the territory for 31 years and I still grapple with why children are not going to school everyday. I still grapple with why we have the health outcomes that we have, and there are plenty more challenges. But looking back 31 years, I do see a difference. What we are determined to do is to stop this small cycle of funding where plans for community groups and organisations get put in place and then, after one or three years, they have to reapply for their funding.


I think the greatest thing that has come into place with stronger futures is a 10-year bipartisan funding commitment between the government and the coalition. So no matter what happens at next year's federal election or the federal election after that—or the federal election after that, for that matter—$3.4 billion will be there so that we can have a generation of implementation of programs.


Senator Siewert, you have not heard Aboriginal people ask you month after month to, 'Please give us a decent block of funding, give us funding that goes beyond three years so that we can actually plan.' I have constantly heard that everywhere I have gone throughout the Northern Territory in my working life there. I really do have to pay tribute to Jenny Macklin and people like Senator Wong and Wayne Swan who decided that that they would get this money together and fund these programs for 10 years.


Everywhere I go Indigenous people say two things to me: they want to stop the alcohol abuse; and they want to stop people ruining their lives by getting easy access to alcohol and to have an alternative. Stronger futures tackles that challenge. They want assistance to get their kids to school and stronger futures tackles that challenge as well, working in partnership with Indigenous people. Women want to continue with the BasicsCard because they feel some security about that and they want us to continue to improve the safety in their community. Stronger futures does that.


We have worked very hard with the homelands policy. Even the coalition said to the Northern Territory government, 'We will find homelands for a certain number of years but after that you have to find the money yourselves.' Well, it was not going to be possible and it is not possible in the economic base of the Northern Territory. Under the stronger futures package we have given $200 million over 10 years to support municipal and essential services in the homelands. The coalition have partnered with us as part of the 10-year funding commitment. I hope that $200 million is now safe and secure. During this election campaign Paul Henderson, under his dynamic leadership and extensive consultation with people in the Northern Territory, travelled out to Gan Gan, a homeland in north-east Arnhem Land, two weeks ago and announced that they would match our $200 million with $300 million. So under the Labor Party, both federally and in the Northern Territory, you have a $500 million commitment for homelands for the next 10 years because we acknowledge the profound connection between Indigenous people and their homelands. We acknowledge their culture, we acknowledge that they want and deserve a right to live on their homelands. Through stronger futures and our homelands policy we support that right. (Time expired)

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2012-08-22,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (16:21):  I take this opportunity to again place on the record the coalition's views on stronger futures. I also look to take to task Senator Siewert's remarks with regard to some of those matters. Senator Siewert says that the intervention completely failed and she brings forward what I would say is at best anecdotal evidence. 


I am quite often lectured by Senator Siewert and others in the Greens about evidence based policy, and I would ask them to listen to their own admonishments and start to provide that themselves. Certainly we see evidence in some of those areas of the provision of police as well as the complete collapse of defence injuries, as provided in the statistics by the medical centres. There is also all the support evidence by independent surveys conducted in these communities. I know that you would love to have everybody say that we were just into rebadging the intervention with Stronger Futures. Stronger Futures only deals with, as you would be well aware, Senator Siewert, provisions around community stores; the rescheduling of the alcohol provisions where the community asked for that prior to Strong Stronger; and the announcement that the leasing arrangements will now be voluntary. I have to say that the circumstances and the funds behind the intervention cannot be compared with a rebadging under the Strong Futures legislation. 


Senator Crossin touched on the consultation involved in the Stronger Futures. One of the things which I will support the Greens on is that anybody who has had anything to do with the Stronger Futures would know that if we needed a lesson on how not to consult—and I acknowledge that it is a difficult challenge—it would be that. As a committee, we arrived at a community to find that they had already had the government's department in there for 10 days. They really did not know what we were doing there. They had never heard of it at all. It means that quite clearly we do need to go back to the drawing board in that regard. As Senator Crossin indicates, the shire council reforms were not only confusing but very destructive in terms of how people felt about their communities and their capacity to be able to say, 'These are the priorities that our community needs in the shire context.' The Country Liberal coalition in the Northern Territory has a policy to return the full say that existed prior to those reforms to those individual shires. 


Again, Senator Crossin, you talked very fondly about the consultation on SIHIP and how you had your house built. I agree; I think a lot of people were quite happy with that. There were two problems with it, though. The first is that it cost $53 million before a single brick was laid. The second is that the feedback the Aboriginal people gave the government about what sorts of houses were to be built was completely ignored. So I am not really sure that that would be something I would be boasting about. 


Before I briefly go to the homelands, I have just heard, sadly, that Olympic Dam mark II will not be going ahead. I had heard from a lot of people, from a lot of different organisations and from government that an awful lot of Indigenous employment was to be levered against it. I have to say that it not going ahead certainly does not come into my context of a stronger future. I think we would all be extremely disappointed about that. 


The homelands movement is one with a great deal of history. Senator Crossin reminded us that late in March the federal government announced $221 million to provide some basic amenities. This is a bit confusing. The $221 million is there simply because we have decided to multiply our normal budgetary remarks by 10—it looks bigger. Wouldn't we all love to just multiply everything by 10? So I think we should contextualise that. This is $22 million a year, as it always has been. It is the $22 million a year that was originally provided in 2007 by the coalition. As Senator Crossin said, the clear agreement was that the Commonwealth government would provide this money to the Northern Territory government, because at that stage they really needed some infrastructure improvement, and the Northern Territory government would take responsibility for it in four years. It is a bit rich to come in here and say, 'We were never going to do it,' because that is, as I understand it, not the agreement at the time. In any event, that $22 million is now going to be continued by this government, and the coalition would, of course, support that. 


There is one real challenge with some of this money that I can recall from earlier this year. In fact, it was probably on the first day that you can cross the Mann River, whenever that was, and we still had water in the windows; so it was pretty early in the year. I visited 21 homelands that were the responsibility of one of the homeland resource centres. I spoke to the people in all of those communities. I said, 'What've you had done in the last few years that you can remember where somebody came here and did anything with the power, the water, the septic system or anything else?' There was in fact only one thing, which was at Marwin. They very proudly walked me up to a very large, $3,006, I think, poly water tank. They were very proud of the tank. But the fact is that it had sat on its side, 20 metres from the stand, unplumbed, for 18 months. They were proud of it, and I was obviously proud with them. But it was a pretty poor indictment that over that much time the reality on the ground is that the money is going somewhere but it is not going there. 


I think all future governments—I am trying to take the politics out of this—should remember that, instead of giving money to organisations so that we can stand in this place and say to the people of Australia, 'We gave this much money; we gave $22 million to the Northern Territory,' and then walk away—because how is money supposed to put water in a tank?—we need to, with the leverage of the Commonwealth, change the way we do business. What we need to do as a Commonwealth, with the great leverage that we have, is start buying outcomes. It does not matter if it is the Territory government or the Western Australian government or the Country Liberals or Labor, we simply need to guarantee to ourselves that we are buying an outcome rather than pushing up a government. But that is not happening at the moment, and it is something that I believe just simply cannot continue. 


There is also a very small matter of the administration of these fees. We expect $10 to buy $10, but it does not. It invariably buys $9 or $8. When you start getting out in the bush a bit, it sometimes creeps up. We need to ensure that, when the Commonwealth is using its massive leverage, we take that into consideration and actually provide outcomes. One of the things in relation to the homelands more generally is the provision of $619 million for an additional 60 police officers. They are not actually additional. They are the same police officers that were provided by the coalition on the basis that the Northern Territory government provided the number of police officers they were supposed to. Of course they have not done that. 


I think all these arrangements need to be treated with the respect they deserve, whether they have arisen through COAG or through an independent agreement between the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth. Stronger Futures is a piece of legislation which tidies up and continues some of those elements of the intervention, some of which have, very sadly, been allowed to drift aimlessly. 


We have heard from Trish Crossin. I think she spoke quite passionately about the fact that the government are not actually pursuing most of those things that that nasty bloke John Howard—without verballing you, Trish—had instigated. She said they had got rid of those things. I think it is that sort of attitude which has allowed some of these very good programs to drift aimlessly. Sadly, the truth is that today we should have been in the position of being able to look back on good work having been done and, as a result of that work, being able to exit those communities. 


I am loath to criticise and belt those on any side of politics, because this is a very difficult task. But we must learn from our mistakes—mistakes all of us have made. It is starkly clear that there are plenty of things which have been done wrongly and we cannot continue to repeat those wrongs of the past. But, after five years of this sort of federal investment, it is quite clear that we should by now have been in a position to be able to get out of these Aboriginal communities. We should by now have been able to see them having and achieving the same aspirations that other Australians have—a roof over their heads, the potential to own that roof, kids going to school and a job. Sadly, that is still not the case.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (16:31):  I suspect that if Senator Siewert had had a few more minutes to speak on this matter of public importance on the Stronger Futures legislation, she would probably have directly addressed some of the matters raised by Senator Crossin. I found some of the accusations that came flying back across the chamber quite bizarre—because a fair bit of the enormous amount of work that Senator Siewert has done on behalf of disadvantaged Aboriginal people and Aboriginal people across the spectrum has been done in conjunction with Senator Crossin. When our interests align and when the government does good things, we will of course support them. 


Senator Crossin asked, rhetorically I suppose, what positive initiatives we had supported. She said that she had not heard any. I find it perplexing that we would need to underline them—but I will. On hearing, and oral health in particular, Senator Siewert has been directly involved in a comprehensive plan for otitis media—and Senator Crossin knows this. We were able to bring about comprehensive funding for a suicide prevention package. Again, this is cross-party work which everyone supports. We were able to bring about soundfields in classrooms. We have detailed proposals for community controlled education in Aboriginal communities. We have been a big part of the debate on a floor or minimum price for alcohol, as we have been on takeaway-free days in areas where the communities are calling for them. 


On criminal justice, we have played a major part in popularising justice reinvestment. This is something both of us—and now Senator Wright as well—have had a lot to do with, inspired largely by the work of former Human Rights Commissioner Tom Calma. He brought the concept to Australia after he had seen how well it was working in the United States. Senator Siewert has a native title amendment on the books, which Senator Crossin is absolutely welcome to support. It actually gives people the right of veto—the absence of which has been a tragic flaw in the native title legislation right from the beginning. We were a big part of mandating Opal fuel—and of course there is Senator Siewert's proposal for unsniffable Opal petrol to be mandated across the region. These are not trivial matters. These are things with which we have been directly involved in support of the aspirations of our Aboriginal communities—not just in the Territory but across the country.


The issue I want to address directly is the idea that the best way to support economic development and Aboriginal advancement in the Northern Territory—and there seems to be a bizarre and nasty cross-party consensus about this between Labor and the CLP—is to dump radioactive waste on them. Senators will be well aware that this is a campaign I have had quite a long involvement with. I became involved in 2005, when I had the good fortune to be on Senator Rachel Siewert's staff and sat in the public gallery during the fateful week when the coalition, which had the numbers in the chamber at the time—they were fresh from bashing through the Work Choices legislation which would eventually bring the government down and they subsequently rammed through the welfare-to-work and terror laws and abolished student unions—decided, for a wrap-up, to have a go at radioactive waste and passed this shameful legislation through. During that debate—and I remember this vividly—ALP senators spoke out strongly. They were great. They were actually inspiring. They were not as inspiring as Senator Siewert but they were clearly on board. 


Since then, what has happened? Directly after the 2007 election, responsibility passed to Martin Ferguson and the Howard agenda continued. It was shameful. The Howard government radioactive waste legislation was described by ALP MPs, in the run-up to the 2007 election, as 'sordid'—and sordid it is. The idea that the best way to promote economic advancement in the Northern Territory is to post six of the loneliest security guards in the country to guard against people tampering with radioactive waste for the next three centuries absolutely beggars belief. They waved around a $12 million cheque in the community, north of Tennant Creek, which wanted a decent road and some community education support for their kids. That $12 million cheque was dangled in their faces in exchange for hosting what they thought was going to be a rubbish dump. Those were the words that were used—'rubbish dump'. 


As I said, I have been involved with this campaign for quite some time. We have seen some very strong support from right across the board. I would like to acknowledge NT Chief Minister Henderson, who has defied his federal colleagues over this issue—and of course the NT Greens have been steadfast in the Barkly region, in Alice, in Darwin and right across the Northern Territory. But the Chief Minister is fighting an uphill battle, because he is fighting his own federal colleagues. This is a Labor Party radioactive waste dump, but it follows exactly the same template as the one which was announced by the coalition in 2005. 


It was extraordinary, when listening in to the House debates and when the debate on the Radioactive Waste Management Act came through the Senate, to hear one coalition speaker after another taking credit for the idea and bagging the government for simply cutting and pasting. On that I agree with them. I agree with my colleague Senator Scullion, who claims some credit for the Mukaty waste dump, when he says that the ALP had just copied the coalition's policy—because they did. The only people who have been standing up and supporting the community on this one from day one have been the Australian Greens.


It is made all the more disappointing by the actions of the ALP when they were in opposition. 


This is obviously a campaign that has a long way to run. Matters do not get to the Federal Court on a whim. While Minister Ferguson at the behest of the Northern Land Council continues to insist that one person effectively is able to speak for that country, we are in regular contact with a large number of traditional owners from the complex and quite tightknit family networks up there saying that of course traditional responsibility and custodianship over the area is shared and it is not a simple matter to simply draw a rectangle out of the area that five family groups signed on to as the Muckaty Land Trust and say it is just one person. 


So the federal government is in enormous trouble and I suspect what is in the offing is probably a humiliating backdown. No matter what the outcome of the Federal Court, this is no way to treat the people of the Northern Territory. I am surprised at how quiet the NT CLP have been over this extraordinary attack on Territorians' rights. One thing I will note which has been a positive consequence, not just of the way the intervention was handled but also of the way this waste dump proposal has been handled, is that it has re-sparked the debate over statehood for the Northern Territory. The debate is probably in better shape than it was when it was last had in the Northern Territory. I support the discussion being had so that this kind of exploitation—which is what it is; it is base exploitation of the constitutional weakness of the Northern Territory—can be taken advantage of by both major parties voting together as they did when that Muckaty waste legislation was finally put to the vote during the last session.


What is happening in the Federal Court is that the traditional owners are wishing to explain that the Muckaty Land Trust was granted to five groups in common due to interconnected responsibilities and songlines. The government of course has isolated a small number of people and declared them the exclusive owners of the designated land. We fought the bill for two years and it did pass this March, but we were pleased to be able to secure an amendment after negotiations with the government, which was also supported by the coalition, to ensure that no international waste is stored in Australia. But the impact on the traditional owners of Muckaty continues, as it has now for seven years since John Howard's law was first passed—exploiting that same constitutional weakness that Territorians are now more than sick of hearing about—to dump radioactive waste on their land. The impact on them has been stress—they do not need this; they have enough on their hands without having to fight an industrial hazardous waste facility on their country as well. The issues that Senator Scullion listed, the issues that Senator Crossin listed and the issues that Senator Siewert relayed are all real issues that will only be solved if in a cross-party way we listen to the aspirations of the people who are directly affected in the Northern Territory. 


The very last thing that people need is to hear about the nation's most toxic radioactive waste not being safe enough to be parked where it is at the moment, under the active care and maintenance of the staff at the Lucas Heights facility in Sydney, but somehow magically being transformed into something completely safe if it is trucked 120 kilometres north of Tennant Creek and dumped in a shed surrounded by barbed wire. The people of the NT do not buy it. They have supporters all around the country, and I know this full well, who do not buy it either. The government has come down completely the wrong track, backed by the opposition, and the Greens will continue, if we have to, to be the only voices standing up in opposition to this flawed and completely misconceived facility.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:41):  It is always good to listen to the contributions of other senators. Half the time I do not think we pay enough attention to each other—we are too busy running political arguments—but I have listened very carefully to the contributions by previous speakers. I acknowledge the fine contributions from Senator Crossin and Senator Scullion, from both sides of the political fence. I could not argue with anything they said, and it was comforting to hear truths come out. I spend an inordinate amount of time in Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley—no-one would spend as much time in Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley as me. I have seen the despair and the disadvantage firsthand, and it sickens me. But I do take heart when I hear Senator Scullion say that we need to take the politics out of it. 


I do not think any senator since 1901—111 years—could put their hand on their heart and say that we have had a fantastic record, that we have done a fantastic job, in eliminating Aboriginal disadvantage. I will acknowledge that each term of government brings new challenges and I acknowledge the fine work that is being been done by the Gillard Labor government. I know, because I drive Minister Macklin mad, every time I come back from the Kimberley, with more and more problems, more and more requests, because I go out there and I consult. More importantly, I do not tell my blackfella mates what I think is good for them—I want them to tell me what they want me to hear and what they want me to bring back to Canberra.


Senator Siewert's matter of public importance refers to the inadequacy of government policies such as Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory and support for homelands. I am very familiar with the homelands. I think I have visited at least 40 of them; there are probably about 60. I do not doubt Senator Siewert's commitment to Aboriginal Australia; I do not doubt for one minute that she has a good heart when it comes to trying to deliver the best outcomes for Aboriginal people most times. But it is very important to get some facts out on the table. I find it very disingenuous when senators say one thing in their home state and then say another thing when they are here in Canberra. That goes for the mob in the other house, too.


I want to talk about Aboriginal disadvantage particularly in the Kimberley, and I want to talk about a couple of recent visits to the Kimberley not only by myself but also by Senator Siewert and Senator Milne—and the bastion of the green movement, Dr Brown, on the Sea Shepherd. There has been a very topical gas project proposed for the Kimberley region north of Broome.


I, for one, do not care if there is a gas hub there or not. If there is going to be a gas hub, as long as all environmental approvals are ticked, as long as Aboriginal people are employed and as long as the traditional owners gain benefits, I am very happy. That is not inconsistent with what I have always said, whether it be on the public record or spoken to oil and gas companies or to my blackfella mates up in the peninsula and around Broome and the wider Kimberley.


But I get a little bit annoyed when Colin Barnett, the Premier of Western Australia, decided he was going to compulsorily acquire the land of the traditional owners, the Jabirr Jabirr and the Goolarabooloo—which I do not agree with. When they initiated the native title talks through the KLC—at the time, Mr Wayne Bergmann was the chair of the KLC—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  I hear Senator Siewert is going to chuck some barbs, and I do hope I hear them. But I get really annoyed when the Greens, including Senator Siewert and Senator Milne—if I am wrong, they will have the opportunity to correct me—go visit Broome, go up and meet with Waardi and then sit there with one of the most senior TOs, Rita Augustine, to tell her, in her words to me, that they were there to save the blackfellas from the mistake they may have made because it is wrong having a gas plant. That really annoys me. You see, as part of the negotiations with the Kimberley Land Council and the traditional owners—the Jabirr Jabirr and Goolarabooloo—the Goolarabooloo do not agree but the Jabirr Jabirr do, whether we like it or not. The problem with democracy is that it is great if you can control it; as we know, that does not always happen. The vote has been taken, and they have decided that they were happy to go along with the agreement to have an Indigenous land use agreement.



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  Senator Siewert, for your information, you should spend more time talking to the traditional owners. They decided that over the life of the gas plant—some 30 years—there would be a return in benefits of some $1½ billion to the Aboriginal traditional owners across the Kimberley, not just on the peninsula. That will deliver benefits in housing, in education and training, in roads, in all sorts of stuff. Under Wayne Bergmann's great leadership he has also started up KRED—Kimberley Regional Economic Development—where all Aboriginals will gain.


But I think it is really disingenuous when you go there, Senator Siewert, and lecture our traditional owners on how wrong they are and distance yourself from the environmental movements. They asked you to come out and visit the area or come out and talk to the Jabirr Jabirr, and you did not want to do it. The Leader of the Greens, Senator Milne, did not want to do it. You wanted to have a lovely photo taken of a flag welcoming the Sea Shepherd to Broome to make sure that whales were not being harpooned by gas plants—




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. He is making comments about things he knows nothing about. He is, in fact, misleading the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  That is not a point of order. Resume your seat.




Senator STERLE:
  I am echoing the words of the senior traditional owners that I met with. If that is not the case, you will have the opportunity to defend that, but that is clearly what they told me. You cannot come in here and bag the government. You say one thing in Canberra when it suits you. Why don't you stick up for the blackfellas in Western Australia? Why don't you stick up for the people I talk to? Why don't you go up there and do something different that may hurt the Greens? Why don't you do what I do: why don't you sit with them and ask what they may want, not what you think is best for them?




Senator Siewert:
  How do you know I haven't?




Senator STERLE:
  Then that is what you do as the Greens.


But I will share some other words. I will quote from a speech by Mr Bergmann to the National Press Club on 27 June 2012. I know I do not have much time, but I need to get these words out. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Wayne's speech. He talked about having a gas hub in the Kimberley and the tough times that the traditional owners went through. He also said:


These were some of the darkest and toughest days, trying to place traditional owners in the strongest position.


At the time I was proud to have stood with the environmental alliance.


The Kimberley Land Council and TOs negotiated an Act of Parliament to stop any further LNG development on the Kimberley Coast and to limit industrial activity associated with gas processing.


He then went on to say:


We—


the traditional owners and the Kimberley Land Council as well—


negotiated a regional benefits package for the benefit of all Kimberley Aboriginal people, and compensation for traditional owners.


We supported National Heritage Listing over a large part of the Kimberley.


Yet most of the environmental groups turned against us.


These groups could have assisted us in enforcing the highest environmental standards in order to minimize the impact of the development.


But they turned their backs on us.


They have deliberately ignored the way in which Kimberley Traditional owners have worked to protect the Kimberley Coast.


He also said:


We have stood side-by-side with environmental groups to minimize the impact of gas development in the Kimberley. But what have they delivered in return? Nothing.


They have no interest in the need of Kimberley Aboriginal people to build a strong culture and a strong economic future.


In fact in some cases they have involved themselves in the politics between indigenous groups and families, and encouraged and promoted division, disempowering traditional owners.


I would love to read more of Mr Bergmann's speech.


I hear from Senator Siewert words about empowering people. I agree wholeheartedly. I also heard Senator Siewert use terms such as 'strong community'—agree. 'Leadership'—absolutely side-by-side with you on that one. 'Cultural strength'—who am I to argue? And guess what else I heard. 'Consultation'. So I say on that: unfortunately, the politics come into play here. But I would strongly suggest that, when we get lectured to by the Greens about the benefits of Closing the Gap, we could do a lot more but we do not need to be misled. We do not need this misinformation. This is politics in its purest form. Talking about purity: the Greens' purity sometimes just leaves me absolutely gobsmacked. (Time expired)

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2012-08-22,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (16:51):  In participating in this debate on the matter of public importance moved by Senator Siewert this afternoon, I want to acknowledge, as Senator Scullion did, what the government has done thus far in this process in bringing forward the legislation that was recently debated in this chamber. I also want, as I did on that occasion, to continue to raise concerns—to use Senator Scullion's words again—in part about the government's drifting approach in this area of circumstances in the Northern Territory under stronger futures for Indigenous Australians, despite the passage of the legislation. I listened carefully, as Senator Sterle did, to all of those who have contributed to the debate this afternoon. I heard Senator Crossin speak on aspects of the SIHIP housing construction program, and I also noted Senator Scullion's response to that. But I see again in today's Australian another series of concerns being raised in relation to the state of some of that housing, and individuals who are not actually living in public housing having rent deducted from their welfare income, which would not seem to me to indicate the strongest possible approach to dealing with that at the moment. I also note the call of the Northern Territory Ombudsman for a review of every single rent collected by Centrelink since the start of the intervention in 2007 in that regard.


The coalition has indicated, both during a previous debate on the legislation and again today, that while this legislation is a step in the right direction we do not believe it solves the broader problem of what is a less than fully adequate approach to Indigenous affairs from this government. There was much that could have been taken from the work of the intervention—which was introduced under the previous coalition government—but has not been taken and consolidated by this government, and that remains of concern to us. For example, in terms of that drift—I think Senator Scullion used a very effective word in that regard—why would it take four years to realise that those emergency response measures, which were designed to basically enforce the rule of law, if you like, to get children to school and to create economies in remote communities, were indeed urgent and worthwhile measures? There is no excuse for any drifting on those sorts of things as far as we are concerned, and it has the effect of hampering the progress of those individuals that it was meant to support.


After almost five years and a massive investment of funds, we should be at a point, as Senator Scullion said, where the community leaders are now those who are leading reforms and where passive welfare—for want of another turn of phrase—is not seen as life as it happens, as is still too often the case in remote communities. But, unfortunately, we still have school attendance rates which are far too low. We still have alcohol related crime and assaults which are far too high, and Senator Crossin also referred to those. We have persistent preventable health problems and a lack of economic opportunity which only ends up continuing to lead to frustration and despair in the communities.


I recall that on the evening of the passage of the legislation Senator Boswell came into the chamber and made a contribution in this debate as well. I am paraphrasing, not reading from the Hansard, but he said that after seeing report after report—and he is an individual of long standing in this chamber, so he would have seen many—showing that there has been limited and insufficient improvement in the welfare and care of children in remote communities, this remains, notwithstanding the legislation we dealt with then and the work that has been done previously, one of the most extraordinary challenges that we face as a nation. We have the challenge of dealing with languages—the challenge of many Indigenous children still speaking a language understood by a few in their own community—and the balance of engaging them in English instruction as well. So it is obvious that, notwithstanding that investment, we have seen insufficient improvement. This is only an early step, it would seem, in the progress to combating disadvantage. We supported the stronger futures legislation on that occasion because real reforms are and will continue to be needed, but we will continue also to vigorously and energetically hold this government to account if they do not provide the leadership, backed up by real commitment, to end this disadvantage and disconnection.


In speaking about some of those issues, we come again to the issue of alcohol abuse and its devastating impact on both families and local communities. We do not see the government outlining any real vision to work cooperatively with the Northern Territory government to tackle that alcohol abuse. In fact, over the period that preceded the introduction of this legislation, much of the heavy lifting in that area has been left to the Northern Territory government. So, if you are looking for fresh ideas on how that problem can be solved, one imagines that we might be better advised to watch the progress of the Northern Territory election campaign that is currently underway rather than looking to the government for inspiration.


The problem with the measures that were contained in the stronger futures package is that they were essentially only duplicating existing measures so that this government appeared to be taking stronger action against alcohol abuse rather than new and innovative approaches. As I mentioned in this chamber during that debate, the government at the time agreed to an opposition amendment which clarified the power of the federal minister in relation to those specific measures. It made it clear that, prior to modifying, suspending or cancelling a liquor licence or permit, the federal minister must first write to the Northern Territory government requesting that the Northern Territory liquor commission take action. If, after those steps are taken, the Northern Territory authorities will not act then that Northern Territory minister must provide a written response detailing why they will not take the requested action. After the consideration of that response, the federal minister can then exercise the powers provided in that legislation to suspend or cancel liquor licences. We have over time also supported township and community living leasing arrangements in the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act, but again the fact that those measures were only being implemented at the time of that legislation is another example of the slow pace of these reforms in this area.


The Northern Territory emergency response monitoring report from October 2011 indicated the following:


Following feedback from the land councils on these proposals, township leasing is now being pursued as a longer term priority, unless traditional owners initiate discussions.


I really do not believe that the government has shown the urgency that this issue demands. If those actions in relation to land and leasing are delayed, that delays the aspirations of prospective Indigenous homeowners and business operators, because without township leases you cannot achieve the level of private homeownership or commercial development that has been identified as necessary.


We have also spoken previously on the food security measures contained in the package, which continued aspects of the coalition government's previous program. The 10-year timetable for improvement that has been set down, though, is something which we identified on that occasion as very frustrating. It needed shorter interim targets, and can only slow down the reform process yet again. How can you know if they are actually working in any substantive way if you have to wait that long for results?


So we are concerned about interim targets on a number of those levels, not just in relation to the food issues but also programs in relation to school attendance and enrolment data—so, the SEAM measure in particular. I think that having those reviewed earlier is a particularly important aspect which was raised in the previous debate.


In conclusion, I refer briefly to the homelands issue. I stand to be corrected, but I understood Senator Crossin to say in her remarks that the Northern Territory government had contributed $300 million, bringing the total contribution for the homelands to $500 million. But my understanding from Chief Minister Paul Henderson's statement of last week is that the new homelands policy of the government and this government includes a commitment of $200 million from the Australian government and $100 million from the Territory government over the next 10 years, which in fact will total not $500 million but $300 million. Again, we are concerned—as I said at the beginning of my remarks—about the aspects of drift in the government's policy. We would like to see a stronger approach.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-08-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:01):  I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on health services and medical professionals in rural areas, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


It is with great pleasure that I present this report. Upfront, I thank my colleagues on the committee. It was a very enjoyable experience—I think that I am allowed on this occasion to speak for all of us and say that—we enjoyed working together. I also thank the secretariat once again for the long hours and hard work that they have put into this report.


This report highlights, yet again, what I think many of us felt very strongly, and that is that there is inconsistent access to the medical workforce in rural and regional areas. In particular, access to medical specialists plummets outside major cities and falls to much lower levels outside large capitals. Also, we are aware of data that is showing higher disease burdens and poorer health outcomes for those living in rural and remote areas. While we acknowledge in our report that there has been work done, we believe, given that we have made 18 recommendations, that there is room for improvement and that more work needs to be done.


As I said, we made 18 recommendations; but in the rest of the short time I have available, other than recommending that people with an interest in this area get hold of the report and read it because there is some very useful information in there—read the recommendations—I point to a couple of key areas. One is that there has been a lot of talk about the classification system for incentives for medical professionals to work in regional areas. Again, the committee received a lot of criticism and input into that discussion and we made strong recommendations about the system needing to be improved—in fact, replaced and improved with some significant improvements.


One of the key areas that was also identified was the fact that the more specialised the medical profession has become—the more specialists we have—the more that has led to the detriment of rural health, because we do not have so many people going into rural generalist programs as in the past, or becoming rural generalists. We were presented with some excellent evidence around the success of programs—which I am sure my colleagues will talk about—and so we made some recommendations around those. We have also identified the need to look at the training places that are available regionally and we made some recommendations on those particular issues, to expand those, and we looked at how we can make improvements there.


We were also very clear that we talk not only about doctors. We are not just talking about doctors; we are talking about nurses and allied health professionals as well. One of the key recommendations that I think is very important—and I am aware that Senator Moore, in particular, will talk about it because it was her who was really focused on allied health and needing to get more focus there—is that a rural and regional allied health adviser be added to the adviser positions in the department.


We also talked about incentives for rural students to study medicine. The overwhelming evidence that we were presented with was very strong: if you want people to go and practice medicine and allied health in the bush then you should be supporting regional students and people from a rural background into studying medicine and as health professionals in particular. The evidence shows that if you come from the bush you have an affinity for the bush and a 'rural-mindedness'—I think that is the right word. We made some recommendations about how we can incentivise that. But there were also some other things we found that were barriers to ensuring more health professionals in rural and regional areas, and so our committee made a number of recommendations.


As I said, there are 18 recommendations. Of course, the Community Affairs Committee could not table a report without talking about the need to improve access to data. We found it quite difficult to pull together the different data sources so we have made some recommendations about data.


I think that this report will contribute significantly to the ongoing work to ensure that we get better health provision in rural and regional Australia.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:07):  I want to use this short time to acknowledge the amazing support and commitment of so many people who chose to come before our committee. We had over 130 contributions and a number of supplementary contributions where people put in an original application and talked about their concerns and issues, then, as they individually followed what was going on in the Hansard and through phone calls coming to the committee, they then felt that there were more things they wished to share with us. Whilst it was a trial at times for the committee secretariat to ensure that we had all this information, it is a wonderful acknowledgement of the skills and commitment and dedication of so many people in rural communities to ensuring that their rural communities get the best possible access to medical services. 


As Senator Siewert said, a core aspect of our committee was to make sure that we were looking at the range of medical support. Too often we get into a debate about the number of doctors in rural areas. That is a worthy debate and no-one is moving away from that and it will continue to be problematical, as our committee found in terms of making sure that we have appropriate training. My personal favourite, as Senator Siewert has mentioned—and I think that most of our committee members will mention—is the issue around ensuring that we have people who want to work in the bush, people who want to have the chance to have training to receive professional skills so that we can make an effective link for those who want to work in the bush to get their skills and then return to the bush, and that was the aspect of 'rural-mindedness'. I believe that everyone who was on this committee is rural-minded, and I think all the people who came to give us a evidence are rural-minded. We think that should be valued in the way students are selected and the way assessments are done and, most particularly, the way training is actually executed. People need to have the opportunity to work in a rural setting to see the wonderful range of opportunities there in order to find out whether that is the place where they are best able to use their skills.


We saw through the evidence the range of issues that have come in by a series of governments. This is not a problem peculiar to one government or another. This is not a new issue. In fact I did say during the committee hearings that I think sometimes we get a degree of 'rosy-glassedness' when we look back on the past—and I apologise to Hansard for how you are going to spell that one! Nonetheless, I think that sometimes we look back and think that things were much better than they really were. If you look at the number of professionals working in the medical sphere that were available in some of these rural centres in the past, they were not well serviced all the time. I think that what we are doing now is balancing a situation where people have a greater expectation of their rights to have effective medical services, and that is appropriate. In the past they may have been prepared to put up with one doctor with extensive working responsibilities and no time off and with no Allied Health—and I do acknowledge the point made by Senator Siewert—I am unabashedly a proponent for Allied Health Services. When you are talking about medical services, you are talking about the range of wonderful professional help that we should be able to access no matter where we live.


We heard about the number of recommendations. I particularly want to acknowledge the work of the Rural Health Alliance. Their professional commitment to this area over many years was really the basis for much of the evidence that we received. Not only did we receive it from the alliance, we received it from a number of their component parts. So thank you very much to Gordon Gregory for his resilience, his commitment and his professional knowledge. He was so valuable in working with our committee, ensuring that we knew what the background knowledge was.


Before I sit down, I particularly want to acknowledge Senator Judith Adams. One of the things that was with us all the time was the fact that this was a committee that Judith was dedicated to, and I felt at times that she was there giving evidence. I think we need to see that the work of women like Judith, countrywomen, strong professional nurses who have knowledge of their community and a desire to ensure that their communities are well serviced, is valued. We need those people. We need to acknowledge them. We need to respect them and we need to fund them well, because no community can exist without people who have that knowledge and dedication.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:12):  Some time ago Dr Paul Mara from Rural Doctors Association had a conversation with me about the inequities that he saw with the incentives to try to get doctors out to regional areas. That was, I guess, the seed for this inquiry; it grew from there. It certainly created the drive for it.


I thank my Senate colleagues for agreeing to hold this inquiry. I think that it has been one of the most important pieces of work we have seen for regional health for quite some time and I really do thank them for their agreement to initiate this inquiry in the first place. I thank also my colleagues the shadow minister, Peter Dutton, and the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional health, Andrew Laming.


There is no doubt, as everybody knows, that there is an enormous inequity when it comes to health between regional communities and the cities. We have just reflected in this committee the solutions that people have brought to us. We have just reflected in this committee the thoughts that are out there, the extremely good commonsense thinking that is going to create a better future for health in regional communities. 


But it is going to take commitment to change. There are so many good solutions out there that hit a wall and go nowhere because we have not seen enough commitment to change, and that, I think, is one of the key things that we need to take out of this entire inquiry. We have made, I think, 18 excellent recommendations, but we need from both sides of parliament a real commitment to change.


Initially, the driver was the issue around the workforce incentive programs.


It was and is—this issue still exists—completely stupid to have the same incentive for a doctor to move from the city to a small town like Gundagai, which is under huge pressure when it comes to GPs, as the incentive for a doctor to move to a place like Wagga, which has around 60,000 people and has a specialist support network. To have the same incentive applying to doctors moving from Sydney to Gundagai or to Wagga is just completely stupid. It is bleedingly obvious—pardon the pun—that that needs to be changed, and that very much came through during the inquiry.


Also, for rural generalists, we need to have GPs who can do the general procedural things as well. All the evidence showed that that has really slipped away. We have got to get a focus back on those medicos who obviously provide a great GP service but who also have the training so that they have the procedural skills to be generalists. It is vitally important that we do that.


We also noted very clearly that there is an inadequate supply of rural placements for medical interns. This needs to be addressed. There is no point getting all these students through the system if, once they get to that point, they cannot get an intern place. The quota that is currently required is 25 per cent of students from a rural background. The definition needs to be changed. Currently you have to have spent five years of your life in a rural area somewhere. We figure that is not good enough. We want it to be students who spend either four of the last six years of secondary school in a rural area or four of the last six years with their home address in a rural area, or city students who show rural-mindedness, that being an orientation to work in a rural area, which they would support by a willingness to be bonded.


We also need to look at the 25 per cent rural medical student intake and make sure that we have clarification of where that is not being met. It is vitally important that universities are not allowed to slip that under the radar. It is a requirement, it should be shown to be requirement, and we need to have clarity around those figures. We also need to support rural GPs who provide training. That is vitally important. It should be support both financially and by providing locums to help them. We need incentives to ensure that medical students are encouraged to study at regional universities.


We have done a lot of work around allied health, and it is big-picture stuff. We need to look at the interprofessionalism, if you like, of how health in the regions works. We were looking for things outside the square and we were particularly impressed with the Charles Sturt University proposal for a full-scale medical school. Obviously, students from a rural background studying in a rural area are far more likely to stay in a rural area to practise their profession.


I thank my colleagues. I commend the report. I certainly hope that the government pays attention to it. This is not a report to be thrown under the carpet. There are some very good recommendations in this and we absolutely hope that they are acted upon.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (17:17):  I would like firstly to congratulate Senator Nash for being the person who initially suggested this inquiry and, in particular, looking at the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Areas, which clearly has not been working properly. But it was the entire Community Affairs References Committee which broadened this out into what has become a very meaningful assessment of the health services available in rural and remote Australia.


I was somewhat surprised to discover that the number of health professionals across Australia is spread evenly across the country on a per capita basis. Clearly, 'on a per capita basis' when you live in a town of 100 people is not quite as helpful as it might be when you live in a city of a million people. So we need to think about accessibility and many other issues at the same time as we are thinking about whether we have enough health professionals on a per capita basis. We have suggested not only that the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Areas should be reassessed and changed to be far more flexible and to reflect much more the needs of people in remote areas and the incentives for doctors to actually go to those areas; we have suggested also that there should be a proper evaluation or assessment conducted at the same time as any new system is put in place. The problem for people who use the scheme is that whether you are in Gundagai or Newcastle, as Senator Nash said, or whether, in my state of Queensland, you are in Longreach or Townsville—both of which have the same classification—is clearly a significant factor in the ease with which you are going to get doctors to work in those areas.


One of the other things that came up, and I must congratulate Senator Moore on this, was the fact that there is a huge amount of data being collected, there is a huge amount of research going on and there are many good programs going on, but the communication of these, the sharing of information and the correct use of material are lacking in almost every area. You only have to look at the evidence from the Australia Bureau of Statistics about the geographical classification for remoteness areas, which said:


… it is well known that some policy makers use ABS definitions, both geographical and others, to directly target policy. For example, some organizations paid an additional allowance to staff stationed in 'rural' areas… The validity of using ASGC in this way depends entirely on the relevance of the geographical concept to the desired policy outcomes. It is vitally important that anyone developing policies, funding formulae or intervention strategies understands the alignment, or lack of alignment, between … classification and their business objective.


I think that unfortunately what we have discovered is that there really has been very poor alignment in the past on this topic.


As I said, the government, every government, is spending significant amounts of money to try and ensure adequate health services in regional Australia, but the evidence that we received as a committee during the inquiry has highlighted the deficiencies in both the development and evaluation of the programs. We have an urgent and fundamental need to better understand what works, where it works and where we have significant gaps in the system. 


I would very much like to commend this report and, like Senator Moore, I would also like to acknowledge our former colleague the late Senator Judith Adams, who would have revelled in the opportunity to be involved in this inquiry and whose work in the Senate paved the way in many ways for the work that we have done in this inquiry.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-08-22,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:22):  For almost 12 months now the Community Affairs References Committee has been looking into the factors affecting the supply of health services and medical professionals in rural areas. This inquiry started with the knowledge that people from regional Australia experience poorer health outcomes than their urban counterparts. It was the Nationals' very own Senator Fiona Nash who brought these terms of reference to the committee.


Research tells us that people who live outside major cities are 20 per cent more likely to have had asthma and 16 per cent more likely to report mental or behavioural problems. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports that people living outside major cities are 1.2 times more likely to engage in behaviours associated with poorer health, such as smoking and binge drinking, than people living within major cities. Life expectancy in regional areas is one to two years lower and in remote areas it is much more—seven years lower. Part of that could be because of the difficulty country people have had in accessing health services. We know that to be the case—because there is not a doctor's surgery 10 minutes down the road; there are no specialist staff in the local small hospital there ready to assist.


We wanted to find out exactly what the issues are so that we can look at how the government and community can work together to solve the problem. As others have mentioned, there was no shortage of people assisting us with the task—from academics and the medical fraternity, both retired and current, to local community members. As part of that process we have heard from stakeholders right across Australia and built up a picture that shows that the problems being faced by those in country areas are quite consistent throughout the country.


For a start, the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Areas model used by the government to determine what is classified as regional, rural or remote is flawed. It is the same model that is being used to determine a whole host of incentives and policy settings which I will not detail now for the sake of time. But it is the classic one-size-fits-all policy: it does not work, especially for the regions. It is particularly relevant in my patron seat of Bendigo, a large regional centre that serves the surrounding area with a soon-to-be-built, world-class $630 million hospital. We heard examples from Central Victoria General Practice Network and the Murray Plains Division of General Practice regarding the crude application of the RA classification, which gives communities with population bases ranging from 2,000 to 100,000 the same relocation and retention grants. There is a big scope of difference there in reality. Tiny towns in the region surrounding Bendigo, such as Elmore, do not receive any additional recognition for their particular situation.


The Centre of Research Excellence in Rural and Remote Primary Health Care, based in my patron seat, has done some excellent work in this area. It is referenced throughout the report and commended by the committee. I suggest that anyone with an interest in this area read the work of Professor Humphreys. Additionally, we found that a problem in country areas is that GPs are becoming increasingly rare as more medical students opt to specialise; yet rural GPs need a well rounded, complete set of skills. One day you have to set a leg, the next day deliver a baby, do the stitches and dispense some antibiotics for a cold—and that is just for the animals. Jokes aside—that is for the community members. We need really well rounded medical graduates in regional areas. These skills are just as important as a specialisation in other areas. Indeed, these days general practice can be a specialisation in its own right. We have mentioned Queensland Health's efforts in this area and I would particularly like to highlight those. It is quite an exciting approach to the problem.


Medical specialist numbers plummet outside the major cities to levels as low as one-sixth of those in large capitals, hence the need for better access to specialist services whether through transport assistance or even through specialists travelling to regional areas for one or two days a month to enable locals to access their services. The committee is encouraged by the steps already taken and wants to see the progress of the Rural Clinical School programs continue to ensure that students have access to support at all stages in the training and placement program. There is a great quote that I would like to be able to deliver here but for the sake of time I will not be able to. It was a key factor in supporting the training out there. The evidence suggests that we have seen the need; we are training more medical graduates but they do not have the funded places to go to, to complete their training. We would like that to happen in the regions so they can get on board with what a fantastic experience it is outside capital cities—and hopefully join us there for their long careers.


I would like to thank Senator Siewert, Senator Nash, Senator Moore, Senator Boyce and Senator Fawcett for great work done on a great report.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-08-22,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (17:27):  I rise to support the comments of my colleagues on this report, which is a very important report for people living in rural, regional and remote Australia. I am not going to repeat all of their comments in detail except to say I strongly support the comments around classification systems. Statistics do indeed lie. They do not necessarily reflect the reality on the ground and we need those improved systems such as the ones identified and recommended in the report. I support the comments on specialisation and the lack of incentives that are available for allied health professionals compared to GPs.


I would like to touch on a couple of things that have come up during the inquiry from a South Australian perspective specifically. Firstly, states are different, particularly if you look at demographics and the distribution of population. Policy that is developed at a national level that may well suit the larger east coast states, with larger populations and larger regional centres, may not suit South Australia. A number of pieces of evidence came to light during the inquiry that highlighted that sometimes things occur quite differently because of the different arrangements within states.


For example, in South Australia the largest regional town, Whyalla, is around 21,000, Port Augusta is around 13,000, and Port Lincoln is around 14,000; then we have a number of other smaller places. So in South Australia there is no regional university. Flinders University, for example, has taken a great initiative with the Parallel Rural Community Curriculum in Renmark and Mount Gambier. They are having terrific success and there is good longitudinal evidence showing that students who spend a long period of training as an undergraduate in country areas do in fact have a higher probability of returning and remaining in the country as a GP.


What is important, though, is that we look at it as a whole system. It is not just the universities; it is also the training placements for interns and people in their second year after graduation. What we see in South Australia is that there are only some six places available in the country and yet we need some 56. Allowing for international medical graduates, perhaps we only need 24; but that is still a fourfold increase in what is available at the moment.


So there needs to be alignment between the state government as well as the federal government and the providers, such as universities and colleges, to find a way to make this transition smooth and effective so that the communities who need the support get it, as opposed to the buck being passed or just reaching dead ends in trying to get people to flow between the various stovepipes.


The federal government also has a role to play in looking at how they work with the state government around things like incentive payments for GPs or the provision of locum services to support GPs in country areas who wish to provide training for medical students or, indeed, for interns. I note the trial that is occurring in South Australia—for example, in Kapunda—where people can come as an intern and GPs can provide a level of training for them post their graduation from medical school. In a state like South Australia, where we do not necessarily have large enough communities to have training hospitals in the community, that is a model that is viable. It is starting to work, but we need the federal government to look at ways to adequately compensate GPs for the time taken away from their business—because at the end of the day it is a business; it pays their bills—to provide that support.


I thank a range of people for their support in South Australia and for making me aware of the issues in South Australia. Steve Holmes, you can take your stockwhip and put it back on the wall. I think this inquiry has done a fair bit to round up of some of the issues. Dr James McLennan at the Clare Medical Centre showed the way in terms of sustainable rural practice. Dr Anthony Page in Gawler highlighted a number of the areas of difference between state and federal policy that can have an impact. I also thank Scott Lewis from the RDAA, as well as my federal colleagues Rowan Ramsey, Patrick Secker and Senator-elect Anne Ruston who helped out with the inquiry.


One of the recommendations that has come out of a lot of the work in South Australia is to look at having a function within DoHA that aggregates the information collected by Medicare locals so that on a regular basis we assess the gaps that are emerging between federal and state policies and very deliberately put those onto the COAG agenda so that they can be dealt with in the interests of sustainable health care for people living in rural and remote Australia.


I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-08-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:01):  I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on health services and medical professionals in rural areas, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


It is with great pleasure that I present this report. Upfront, I thank my colleagues on the committee. It was a very enjoyable experience—I think that I am allowed on this occasion to speak for all of us and say that—we enjoyed working together. I also thank the secretariat once again for the long hours and hard work that they have put into this report.


This report highlights, yet again, what I think many of us felt very strongly, and that is that there is inconsistent access to the medical workforce in rural and regional areas. In particular, access to medical specialists plummets outside major cities and falls to much lower levels outside large capitals. Also, we are aware of data that is showing higher disease burdens and poorer health outcomes for those living in rural and remote areas. While we acknowledge in our report that there has been work done, we believe, given that we have made 18 recommendations, that there is room for improvement and that more work needs to be done.


As I said, we made 18 recommendations; but in the rest of the short time I have available, other than recommending that people with an interest in this area get hold of the report and read it because there is some very useful information in there—read the recommendations—I point to a couple of key areas. One is that there has been a lot of talk about the classification system for incentives for medical professionals to work in regional areas. Again, the committee received a lot of criticism and input into that discussion and we made strong recommendations about the system needing to be improved—in fact, replaced and improved with some significant improvements.


One of the key areas that was also identified was the fact that the more specialised the medical profession has become—the more specialists we have—the more that has led to the detriment of rural health, because we do not have so many people going into rural generalist programs as in the past, or becoming rural generalists. We were presented with some excellent evidence around the success of programs—which I am sure my colleagues will talk about—and so we made some recommendations around those. We have also identified the need to look at the training places that are available regionally and we made some recommendations on those particular issues, to expand those, and we looked at how we can make improvements there.


We were also very clear that we talk not only about doctors. We are not just talking about doctors; we are talking about nurses and allied health professionals as well. One of the key recommendations that I think is very important—and I am aware that Senator Moore, in particular, will talk about it because it was her who was really focused on allied health and needing to get more focus there—is that a rural and regional allied health adviser be added to the adviser positions in the department.


We also talked about incentives for rural students to study medicine. The overwhelming evidence that we were presented with was very strong: if you want people to go and practice medicine and allied health in the bush then you should be supporting regional students and people from a rural background into studying medicine and as health professionals in particular. The evidence shows that if you come from the bush you have an affinity for the bush and a 'rural-mindedness'—I think that is the right word. We made some recommendations about how we can incentivise that. But there were also some other things we found that were barriers to ensuring more health professionals in rural and regional areas, and so our committee made a number of recommendations.


As I said, there are 18 recommendations. Of course, the Community Affairs Committee could not table a report without talking about the need to improve access to data. We found it quite difficult to pull together the different data sources so we have made some recommendations about data.


I think that this report will contribute significantly to the ongoing work to ensure that we get better health provision in rural and regional Australia.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:07):  I want to use this short time to acknowledge the amazing support and commitment of so many people who chose to come before our committee. We had over 130 contributions and a number of supplementary contributions where people put in an original application and talked about their concerns and issues, then, as they individually followed what was going on in the Hansard and through phone calls coming to the committee, they then felt that there were more things they wished to share with us. Whilst it was a trial at times for the committee secretariat to ensure that we had all this information, it is a wonderful acknowledgement of the skills and commitment and dedication of so many people in rural communities to ensuring that their rural communities get the best possible access to medical services. 


As Senator Siewert said, a core aspect of our committee was to make sure that we were looking at the range of medical support. Too often we get into a debate about the number of doctors in rural areas. That is a worthy debate and no-one is moving away from that and it will continue to be problematical, as our committee found in terms of making sure that we have appropriate training. My personal favourite, as Senator Siewert has mentioned—and I think that most of our committee members will mention—is the issue around ensuring that we have people who want to work in the bush, people who want to have the chance to have training to receive professional skills so that we can make an effective link for those who want to work in the bush to get their skills and then return to the bush, and that was the aspect of 'rural-mindedness'. I believe that everyone who was on this committee is rural-minded, and I think all the people who came to give us a evidence are rural-minded. We think that should be valued in the way students are selected and the way assessments are done and, most particularly, the way training is actually executed. People need to have the opportunity to work in a rural setting to see the wonderful range of opportunities there in order to find out whether that is the place where they are best able to use their skills.


We saw through the evidence the range of issues that have come in by a series of governments. This is not a problem peculiar to one government or another. This is not a new issue. In fact I did say during the committee hearings that I think sometimes we get a degree of 'rosy-glassedness' when we look back on the past—and I apologise to Hansard for how you are going to spell that one! Nonetheless, I think that sometimes we look back and think that things were much better than they really were. If you look at the number of professionals working in the medical sphere that were available in some of these rural centres in the past, they were not well serviced all the time. I think that what we are doing now is balancing a situation where people have a greater expectation of their rights to have effective medical services, and that is appropriate. In the past they may have been prepared to put up with one doctor with extensive working responsibilities and no time off and with no Allied Health—and I do acknowledge the point made by Senator Siewert—I am unabashedly a proponent for Allied Health Services. When you are talking about medical services, you are talking about the range of wonderful professional help that we should be able to access no matter where we live.


We heard about the number of recommendations. I particularly want to acknowledge the work of the Rural Health Alliance. Their professional commitment to this area over many years was really the basis for much of the evidence that we received. Not only did we receive it from the alliance, we received it from a number of their component parts. So thank you very much to Gordon Gregory for his resilience, his commitment and his professional knowledge. He was so valuable in working with our committee, ensuring that we knew what the background knowledge was.


Before I sit down, I particularly want to acknowledge Senator Judith Adams. One of the things that was with us all the time was the fact that this was a committee that Judith was dedicated to, and I felt at times that she was there giving evidence. I think we need to see that the work of women like Judith, countrywomen, strong professional nurses who have knowledge of their community and a desire to ensure that their communities are well serviced, is valued. We need those people. We need to acknowledge them. We need to respect them and we need to fund them well, because no community can exist without people who have that knowledge and dedication. 


I commend all our recommendations and I think that in the future we will have more things to say. This was a committee on which it was a joy to serve. We met people that had the same sense of commitment we had, and the recommendations of this committee can make a difference. Thank you for being part of it.

 (Victoria) (17:22):  For almost 12 months now the Community Affairs References Committee has been looking into the factors affecting the supply of health services and medical professionals in rural areas. This inquiry started with the knowledge that people from regional Australia experience poorer health outcomes than their urban counterparts. It was the Nationals' very own Senator Fiona Nash who brought these terms of reference to the committee.


Research tells us that people who live outside major cities are 20 per cent more likely to have had asthma and 16 per cent more likely to report mental or behavioural problems. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports that people living outside major cities are 1.2 times more likely to engage in behaviours associated with poorer health, such as smoking and binge drinking, than people living within major cities. Life expectancy in regional areas is one to two years lower and in remote areas it is much more—seven years lower. Part of that could be because of the difficulty country people have had in accessing health services. We know that to be the case—because there is not a doctor's surgery 10 minutes down the road; there are no specialist staff in the local small hospital there ready to assist.


We wanted to find out exactly what the issues are so that we can look at how the government and community can work together to solve the problem. As others have mentioned, there was no shortage of people assisting us with the task—from academics and the medical fraternity, both retired and current, to local community members. As part of that process we have heard from stakeholders right across Australia and built up a picture that shows that the problems being faced by those in country areas are quite consistent throughout the country.


For a start, the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Areas model used by the government to determine what is classified as regional, rural or remote is flawed. It is the same model that is being used to determine a whole host of incentives and policy settings which I will not detail now for the sake of time. But it is the classic one-size-fits-all policy: it does not work, especially for the regions. It is particularly relevant in my patron seat of Bendigo, a large regional centre that serves the surrounding area with a soon-to-be-built, world-class $630 million hospital. We heard examples from Central Victoria General Practice Network and the Murray Plains Division of General Practice regarding the crude application of the RA classification, which gives communities with population bases ranging from 2,000 to 100,000 the same relocation and retention grants. There is a big scope of difference there in reality. Tiny towns in the region surrounding Bendigo, such as Elmore, do not receive any additional recognition for their particular situation.


The Centre of Research Excellence in Rural and Remote Primary Health Care, based in my patron seat, has done some excellent work in this area. It is referenced throughout the report and commended by the committee. I suggest that anyone with an interest in this area read the work of Professor Humphreys. Additionally, we found that a problem in country areas is that GPs are becoming increasingly rare as more medical students opt to specialise; yet rural GPs need a well rounded, complete set of skills. One day you have to set a leg, the next day deliver a baby, do the stitches and dispense some antibiotics for a cold—and that is just for the animals. Jokes aside—that is for the community members. We need really well rounded medical graduates in regional areas. These skills are just as important as a specialisation in other areas. Indeed, these days general practice can be a specialisation in its own right. We have mentioned Queensland Health's efforts in this area and I would particularly like to highlight those. It is quite an exciting approach to the problem.


Medical specialist numbers plummet outside the major cities to levels as low as one-sixth of those in large capitals, hence the need for better access to specialist services whether through transport assistance or even through specialists travelling to regional areas for one or two days a month to enable locals to access their services. The committee is encouraged by the steps already taken and wants to see the progress of the Rural Clinical School programs continue to ensure that students have access to support at all stages in the training and placement program. There is a great quote that I would like to be able to deliver here but for the sake of time I will not be able to. It was a key factor in supporting the training out there. The evidence suggests that we have seen the need; we are training more medical graduates but they do not have the funded places to go to, to complete their training. We would like that to happen in the regions so they can get on board with what a fantastic experience it is outside capital cities—and hopefully join us there for their long careers.


I would like to thank Senator Siewert, Senator Nash, Senator Moore, Senator Boyce and Senator Fawcett for great work done on a great report.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-08-22,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (17:27):  I rise to support the comments of my colleagues on this report, which is a very important report for people living in rural, regional and remote Australia. I am not going to repeat all of their comments in detail except to say I strongly support the comments around classification systems. Statistics do indeed lie. They do not necessarily reflect the reality on the ground and we need those improved systems such as the ones identified and recommended in the report. I support the comments on specialisation and the lack of incentives that are available for allied health professionals compared to GPs.


I would like to touch on a couple of things that have come up during the inquiry from a South Australian perspective specifically. Firstly, states are different, particularly if you look at demographics and the distribution of population. Policy that is developed at a national level that may well suit the larger east coast states, with larger populations and larger regional centres, may not suit South Australia. A number of pieces of evidence came to light during the inquiry that highlighted that sometimes things occur quite differently because of the different arrangements within states.


For example, in South Australia the largest regional town, Whyalla, is around 21,000, Port Augusta is around 13,000, and Port Lincoln is around 14,000; then we have a number of other smaller places. So in South Australia there is no regional university. Flinders University, for example, has taken a great initiative with the Parallel Rural Community Curriculum in Renmark and Mount Gambier. They are having terrific success and there is good longitudinal evidence showing that students who spend a long period of training as an undergraduate in country areas do in fact have a higher probability of returning and remaining in the country as a GP.


What is important, though, is that we look at it as a whole system. It is not just the universities; it is also the training placements for interns and people in their second year after graduation. What we see in South Australia is that there are only some six places available in the country and yet we need some 56. Allowing for international medical graduates, perhaps we only need 24; but that is still a fourfold increase in what is available at the moment.


So there needs to be alignment between the state government as well as the federal government and the providers, such as universities and colleges, to find a way to make this transition smooth and effective so that the communities who need the support get it, as opposed to the buck being passed or just reaching dead ends in trying to get people to flow between the various stovepipes.


The federal government also has a role to play in looking at how they work with the state government around things like incentive payments for GPs or the provision of locum services to support GPs in country areas who wish to provide training for medical students or, indeed, for interns. I note the trial that is occurring in South Australia—for example, in Kapunda—where people can come as an intern and GPs can provide a level of training for them post their graduation from medical school. In a state like South Australia, where we do not necessarily have large enough communities to have training hospitals in the community, that is a model that is viable. It is starting to work, but we need the federal government to look at ways to adequately compensate GPs for the time taken away from their business—because at the end of the day it is a business; it pays their bills—to provide that support.


I thank a range of people for their support in South Australia and for making me aware of the issues in South Australia. Steve Holmes, you can take your stockwhip and put it back on the wall. I think this inquiry has done a fair bit to round up of some of the issues. Dr James McLennan at the Clare Medical Centre showed the way in terms of sustainable rural practice. Dr Anthony Page in Gawler highlighted a number of the areas of difference between state and federal policy that can have an impact. I also thank Scott Lewis from the RDAA, as well as my federal colleagues Rowan Ramsey, Patrick Secker and Senator-elect Anne Ruston who helped out with the inquiry.


One of the recommendations that has come out of a lot of the work in South Australia is to look at having a function within DoHA that aggregates the information collected by Medicare locals so that on a regular basis we assess the gaps that are emerging between federal and state policies and very deliberately put those onto the COAG agenda so that they can be dealt with in the interests of sustainable health care for people living in rural and remote Australia.


I seek leave to continue my remarks.

CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SLAVERY, SLAVERY-LIKE CONDITIONS AND PEOPLE TRAFFICKING) BILL 2012


The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-Like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 will protect some of the most vulnerable people in Australian society. 


With this bill, the Gillard Labor Government is protecting vulnerable, women and children, and in some cases, men from trafficking and slavery. 


For many in our community, the notion of ""slavery"" evokes nineteenth century images of people sold as chattels, shackled and transported between countries. Tragically, nineteenth century slavery has not been abolished. It has simply taken other forms. 


People traffickers recruit, transport, transfer, harbour or receive their victims through force, coercion or other means in order to exploit them. This is the modern day face of slavery. 


A common factor of contemporary slavery and trafficking – from forced labour and forced marriage to organ trafficking – is the misuse and abuse of power. And such an abuse has no place here.


I want to send that message loud and clear – to all Australians, to all young people. Duress, violence and intimidation are not acceptable in contemporary Australian society – in any context. Slavery, trafficking and forced marriage are unacceptable. They are very serious crimes. 


That's why Labor is bringing forward this bill to improve protections for victims of all forms of slavery and trafficking, and to help law enforcement agencies detect, investigate and prosecute the perpetrators. 


Fortunately, slavery and people trafficking are not common in Australia, but the effect on victims is traumatic and can have lifelong consequences. 


The bill will strengthen and expand the capability of investigators and prosecutors to combat these crimes by introducing new offences of forced labour, forced marriage, harbouring a person for the purposes of furthering the offence of trafficking and organ trafficking into the Commonwealth Criminal Code. 


More specifically this bill will:


create a standalone offence of forced labour where a reasonable person in the position of the victim would not consider him or herself to be free to cease providing, or leave the place where they provide, labour or services because of the use of coercion, threat or deception


criminalise the conduct of a person who uses coercion, threats or deception to bring about a marriage or marriage-like relationship. The offence would also apply to a person who is a party to, but not a victim of, a forced marriage


criminalise the conduct of a person who harbours, receives or conceals a victim and in doing so, assists or furthers the purpose of a third person who has committed, or is committing, a trafficking, slavery or slavery-like offence


create standalone offences criminalising trafficking a victim, either to or from Australia or within Australia, for the removal of his or her organ.


The bill will also insert general relevant evidence provisions into both Divisions 270 and 271 of the Criminal Code. These provisions set out a list of matters a court or jury may have regard to in determining whether a victim has been coerced, threatened or deceived (for both Divisions 270 and 271), whether the victim or their guardian consented to the removal of the victim's organs, or whether another person has caused the victim to enter into debt bondage (Division 271). 


It will also insert general consent provisions into Divisions 270 and 271 to make it clear that a victim's consent or acquiescence cannot be used as a defence in a proceeding for an offence against those Divisions.


Reducing a person to a state of slavery or servitude often involves suppressing the person's free will and their self-respect, as well as the ability to make decisions for themselves. To allow a defendant to escape liability because his or her offending achieved the desired effect in bringing about these changes in a victim so that they appear to consent would be inexcusable. This provision makes that clear.


These measures will establish a continuum of offences criminalising exploitative conduct ranging from slavery to debt bondage. The definition of 'exploitation' in the Criminal Code will be expanded to cover broader forms of exploitation including debt bondage, forced labour, forced marriage, and all forms of servitude including non-sexual servitude.


Forced labour goes against everything Labor stands for. And that is why we must act to make sure that no one in this country is subject to such a misuse of power. And that no one is able to get away with forcing someone to work in that way.


Labor has a long history of protecting Australia's most vulnerable. We introduced Medicare, we introduced the Sex Discrimination Act and we are introducing a National Disability Insurance Scheme. And this bill continues this tradition. 


It was Labor who repealed Tony Abbott's unfair workplace laws. 


And it is Labor who is now introducing a new offence of forced labour. 


While the majority of identified victims in Australia have been women trafficked for the purposes of exploitation in the sex industry, law enforcement agencies are increasingly identifying both men and women who have been subjected to exploitation in a range of other industry sectors and workplace environments. This bill will introduce a standalone offence of forced labour and expand the existing offences of sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting to ensure they apply regardless of industry. 


Where a person who does not consider himself or herself to be free to cease providing or leave the place where they provide labour or services, because of the use of coercion, threat or deception – they will be protected.


Penalties for the existing debt bondage offences will also be increased, reflecting the seriousness of these crimes.


I would like to take this opportunity to say something about one particular aspect of this bill: forced marriage. I am proud to introduce legislation which makes forcing someone into a marriage illegal. It is a serious matter – and should be treated as such. Marriage should be a happy event, entered into freely between consenting adults,


Forced marriage places young people at risk, and can result in harmful consequences including the loss of education, restriction of movement and autonomy, and emotional and physical abuse.


Some critics have asked: ""won't this force it underground? ""I say to them – it is already underground now – and it can't stay that way. It is the role of the Attorney-General to make it completely clear that in Australia, marriage must be entered into freely, without duress or constraint.


In order to strengthen the law's ability to deal with the perpetrators of slavery and trafficking offences, this bill makes it a crime for another person to assist or further the commission of these offences. The new offence of harbouring will extend criminal responsibility to those who facilitate a slavery or trafficking offence by harbouring, concealing or receiving a victim of a slavery or people trafficking offence. This is to ensure that there is no way for people to avoid prosecution because they did not transport, recruit or transfer the victim into the country themselves. 


The bill also creates standalone offences of organ trafficking. Trafficking a person to remove his or her organ is currently criminalised through offences relating to exploitation. This amendment will clarify the circumstances in which an offence of organ trafficking will apply, including situations in which the victim's organ is not ultimately removed. 


These organ-trafficking offences will ensure that Australia meets its international obligations and comprehensively criminalises this exploitative conduct.


The bill will increase the capacity of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute perpetrators, and to better support and protect victims. It will assist in addressing the impact of crime by improving the availability of reparation orders to individual victims of Commonwealth offences, including slavery and people trafficking. 


In conclusion, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill 2012 was prepared following extensive public consultation. 


The Government released two discussion papers on slavery, people trafficking and forced marriage, and also sought submissions on an exposure draft of the bill. 


With this bill, the Government will clarify and strengthen the operation of existing slavery and people trafficking related offences to make sure that the perpetrators of these offences and those who facilitate them cannot escape prosecution.


The bill reflects the Government's commitment to doing all it can to prevent slavery and people trafficking. It is easy to say no. It is harder to stand up and do the right thing. And that is what this bill is about. For Labor, it is about protecting the most vulnerable in Australia. It is about getting things done to make this country a fairer, safer place for all of us. 


This is the Gillard Labor Government carrying on the great Labor tradition of standing up for the less powerful against the strong and giving a voice to those who cannot always speak up for themselves.


ILLEGAL LOGGING PROHIBITION BILL 2011




Introduction



The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill (the Bill) responds to a significant issue affecting forest communities around the world. 


The environmental and social costs of illegal logging worldwide have been estimated at approximately US$60 billion per annum. 


Illegal harvest of timber contributes to environmental degradation through bad practices by illegal loggers. It hampers social development by depriving local governments and communities from the benefits derived from the use of their resource. 


Illegally harvested timber also undermines well regulated and sustainable industries, including the Australian industry, by undercutting legally harvested timber products. 


This bill will make it a criminal offence to import regulated timber products or process raw logs without undertaking due diligence. 




How this b
ill was developed



The bill is the product of extensive consultation. 


A commitment to prohibit the importation of illegally harvested timber was first presented to the community during the 2007 and 2010 election campaigns. Following the 2007 election, the Labor Government commissioned substantial research to inform policy development including a regulation impact statement; a risk assessment framework; a framework for differentiating legality verification and chain of custody; a generic code of conduct for importers; an economic analysis of the impact of illegal logging; and reports on the small business impacts and social costs of illegal logging. 


In December 2010, the Government announced the framework to implement the policy. 


On 23 March 2011 the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry tabled an exposure draft, referring it to the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for public inquiry. 


The Committee released a report on its findings on 23 June 2011, which included seven recommendations. In particular, the committee recommended the government reconsider the role of the timber industry certifiers and the inclusion of a requirement for a mandatory and explicit declaration at the border. 


The Government has considered the report, and the dissenting report, and the views of stakeholders about the Committee recommendations in preparing the bill now before the Parliament. 


The Government has received representations from the domestic timber industry; state governments, timber and timber product importers, the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, the Uniting Church of Australia, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, domestic retailers and exporters of timber products to Australia. 


The Government welcomes the strong community interest in this issue. 




How the b
ill works



The bill focuses exclusively on measures that will restrict the importation and sale of illegally logged timber in Australia. The Government recognises these measures are an essential first step towards a longer term goal of Australian's sourcing timber products from sustainably managed forests, wherever they are in the world. 


The bill will regulate timber products at two key points of entry onto the Australian timber market – at the border, for imported timber products, and at timber processing plants where domestically sourced raw logs are processed for the first time. It will restrict the importation and sale of illegally logged timber in Australia in three main ways. 


First, the bill prohibits the importation of all timber products that contain illegally logged timber and the processing of domestically grown raw logs that have been illegally harvested. The prohibition enters into force on the day after Royal Assent of this Bill. A maximum penalty of five years imprisonment or 500 penalty units, equivalent to $55,000 for an individual and $275,000 for a corporation or body corporate, or both, applies under this offence. Importers and processors suspected of importing or processing illegal logged timber products would be investigated under the powers of monitoring, investigation and enforcement under Part 4 of the bill and will be prosecuted if they intentionally, knowingly or recklessly import or process illegally logged timber products.


Our own research and the work of the European Union indicate that the best way to minimise trade in illegally harvested product is to implement a due diligence framework. Importers and processors will be required to undertake a process of due diligence on those products to mitigate the risk that the timber has been illegally logged. The level of culpability for these products is negligence which differs from the standard subjective fault elements of intention, knowledge or recklessness. Negligence is an objective fault element which looks to the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances. Importers of regulated timber products can only be negligent if the prosecution can satisfy the requirements for negligence set out in the Criminal Code 1995.


Second, the bill will require importers of regulated timber products and processors of raw logs to undertake due diligence to mitigate the risk of products containing illegally logged timber.


Timber products, for which due diligence will be required, will be prescribed by regulations that will be developed in consultation with key stakeholders. The government will use a number of inputs when finalising timber products to be prescribed by regulations including an economic assessment of the range of product types, value and volume of timber annually imported into Australia. 


Importers of regulated timber products and processors of domestically grown raw logs will be required undertake due diligence to mitigate the risk of importing or processing illegally logged timber. The details of the due diligence process will be prescribed by regulations and will be based on a risk management approach. Criminal offences will apply to importers and processors who do not comply with the due diligence requirements of the bill. There is a maximum penalty of 300 penalty units, equivalent to a fine of $33,000 for an individual and $165,000 for a corporation or body corporate. Administrative sanctions and civil penalties for minor breaches of the legislation will be included in subordinate legislative instruments, such as administrative sanctions for non-compliance with certain due diligence requirements. 


Requirements for due diligence will be enacted after two years have elapsed following the commencement of the bill to give industry sufficient time to establish and implement their due diligence systems and processes. 


Due diligence will involve a three step process - (i) identifying and gathering information to enable the risk of procuring illegally logged timber to be assessed; (ii) assessing and identifying the risk of timber being illegally logged based on this information, and (iii) mitigating this risk depending on the level identified, where it has not been identified as negligible. The specific measures and procedures underpinning the three steps will be prescribed by regulations to be developed in consultation with stakeholders. 


To help meet their due diligence obligations and minimise compliance costs, importers and processors may utilise laws, rules or processes, including those in force in a state, a territory or another country. Individual country initiatives and national schemes, including national timber legality verification and forest certification schemes that can demonstrate that timber products have been harvested in compliance with the applicable laws of the country of harvest may be used, where applicable, as part of an importer's due diligence process.


To enable the Government to enforce compliance with the due diligence requirements, importers are required to complete a statement of compliance with the due diligence requirements of the bill before they complete a customs import declaration at the border. The information to be provided on the statement of compliance and customs import declaration will be prescribed by regulations. 


The customs import declaration will include a community protection question asking importers of regulated timber products whether they have undertaken due diligence in compliance with the bill. This will be linked to importers' statements of compliance to provide a legally binding basis for enforcement of compliance with the legislation. The government will monitor the importation of regulated timber products at the border for compliance with the customs declaration, whilst government compliance and investigation officers will carry out border and post-border checks, as required, using the monitoring, investigation and enforcement powers of the bill. 


Processors are required to complete a statement of compliance with the due diligence requirements of the bill. As Commonwealth, state and territory laws relating to the legality of timber harvesting in Australia are comprehensive and robust, the Commonwealth Government will seek to align the due diligence requirements of the bill with the pre-harvesting approvals processes of relevant state and territory governments to reduce compliance and administrative costs. The content and form of the statement will be prescribed by regulations. 


Third, the bill establishes a comprehensive monitoring, investigation and enforcement regime to ensure compliance with all elements of the Bill including the prohibition and due diligence requirements. Imported timber products may be seized by the Commonwealth without a warrant, under provisions in the Customs Act 1901, whilst goods deemed to be involved in an offence under the Act, consistent with provisions provided in the Customs Act 1901 and the Crimes Act 1913, may be forfeited to the Commonwealth.


The bill also provides requirements for importers and processors to provide statements and declarations of compliance, undertake audits and remedial action, provide reports and other information to the Minister and publish information for compliance and enforcement purposes. 


The results of audits will provide a basis for continuous improvement of importers and processors due diligence systems and processes, where deficiencies are identified, and for enforcement purposes by the Commonwealth where breaches are detected. To ensure there are satisfactory levels of transparency of compliance with the due diligence requirements of the bill, importers and processors are required to make an annual statement of compliance. The nature and detail of these statements will be prescribed by regulations to be developed in consultation with key stakeholders. This information may be used by the Commonwealth to publicly report on the performance and level of compliance of importers and processors, consistent with privacy and commercial-in-confidence considerations. The coverage and detail of public reporting requirements will be developed in consultation with key stakeholders.


The bill provides for the government to undertake a review of the first five years of the operation of the Act. This review is to be commenced no later than 12 months after the 5 year period is complete. This provision should ensure ongoing improvement in relation to the operational aspects and effectiveness of the legislative framework.




International alignment



The bill aligns Australia's efforts to combat illegal logging with international initiatives, including legislation already implemented in the United States and developments in the European Union. 


It is therefore sensible that this bill should work towards alignment with international regimes. 


In establishing the regulations, the government will continue to develop requirements that, to the greatest extent possible, align with the measures being introduced as part of the US Lacey Act Amendments (2008) and the EU Regulation (2010) in order to minimise compliance costs for exporters. This will have the effect of engendering greater cooperation amongst timber importing markets like Australia, Europe and the US and help to facilitate higher compliance amongst exporting countries.


For example, the Government anticipates that certification systems (either third party or government) recognised by EU or the US frameworks will be capable of meeting Australia's requirements. 


The bill will also strengthen Australia's leadership position in the Asia–Pacific region on forestry issues and facilitate continued bilateral and multilateral cooperation with developing countries to promote legal and sustainable forest management.




Conclusion



The bill allows the Government to work with key stakeholders to stamp out illegal logging and trade in illegally logged timber products. 


An illegal logging working group, comprising industry sectors and non-government organisations is already established to assist the government in this process and help minimise the compliance and administrative costs for both industry and government, whilst driving behavioural change in the global timber trade. The government will continue to work closely with its illegal logging working group and state and territory governments to develop the subordinate legislative instruments required. 


The Government appreciates the work of the Senate Committee for Rural Affairs and Transport for its contribution to the development of the Bill. The Government also acknowledges the input of industry, both importers and domestic producers, and other members of the community for their input into the process thus far.


The Illegal Logging Prohibition Bill (2011) delivers on the Government's policy to restrict the importation and sale of illegally logged timber in Australia. It will remove unfair competition posed by illegally logged timber for Australia's domestic timber producers and suppliers establish an even economic playing field for the purchase and sale of legally logged timber products and provide assurance to consumers that products they purchase have been sourced in compliance with Government legislation.


PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2012


Mr President, this bill makes some important amendments to the Public Service Act 1999.


On 8 May 2010, the then Prime Minister announced that the Government had accepted all of the recommendations made in the earlier report, Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for the Reform of Australian Government Administration.


This report, 'the Blueprint', outlined a comprehensive reform agenda to position the Australian Public Service to better serve the Australian Government and the Australian community. It is an agenda that requires modernisation of the Public Service Act, bringing it into line with contemporary needs.


The amendments in the bill will strengthen the management and leadership of the public service and help to embed new practices and behaviours into its culture. The bill recognises that the delivery of high quality services and policy advice requires effective and committed leadership, supported by a public service that is efficient, driven by its desire to serve the community, and contemporary in its outlook.




Strengthen the leadership of the APS



Part 1 of Schedule 1 to this bill provides for a clearer articulation of the roles and responsibilities of Secretaries, particularly in relation to their stewardship of the Australian Public Service. The revised descriptions clarify the service and performance expected of Secretaries and strengthen Secretaries' accountability to Ministers in performing their roles and discharging their responsibilities. 


The amendments restore the arrangements which operated prior to 1999. The amendments provide for appointment and termination decisions of Secretaries to be made by the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, following receipt of a report from the Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department in consultation with the Public Service Commissioner. 


The minimum length of a Secretary's appointment will be five years—unless the Secretary requests otherwise. This provides for continuity of leadership and strengthens the integrity of the appointment process.


Part 2 of Schedule 1 to this bill creates the Secretaries Board, comprised of the Secretary of each Department and the Commissioner. The Secretaries Board, which replaces the Management Advisory Committee, will identify strategic priorities for the APS and take responsibility for its stewardship. 


Part 3 of Schedule 1 to this bill amends the role of the Senior Executive Service to strengthen APS leadership by expanding the descriptors of Senior Executive Service leadership responsibilities, supporting collaboration and the development of whole-of-government responses to issues.




Modernise and clarify the functions of the Public Service Commissioner



Part 4 to Schedule 1 of this bill modernises the functions of the Public Service Commissioner.


The bill specifically recognises the Commissioner's role as the central authority for APS workforce development and reform, an authority that will take a leading role in ensuring that the Service has the organisational and workforce capability to meet future needs.


The Commissioner will have three broad functions:


to strengthen the professionalism of the APS and facilitate continuous improvement in workforce management in the APS;


to uphold high standards of integrity and conduct in the APS; and


to monitor, review and report on APS capabilities within and between Agencies to promote high standards of accountability, effectiveness and performance.


A new function will allow the Commissioner to undertake those tasks and responsibilities which are issue-specific or which may change over time. 




Review and inquiry functions



The Commissioner has extensive powers to undertake reviews or inquiries which were introduced with the 1999 Act, including in certain circumstances the ability to exercise the same information-gathering powers as are available to the Auditor-General. The bill provides more detail on how reviews may be initiated and reported.


In particular, the Commissioner will be able to undertake a 'systems review' or a 'special review' in specific circumstances.


'Systems reviews' will allow the Commissioner to review and report on the management and organisational systems, structures and processes of an APS body, or the functional relationship between two or more bodies. These powers do not derogate from the inquiry functions of other statutory officers and it will be a matter for Government as to who is the most appropriate entity to conduct a review.


By contrast, 'special reviews' will be able to be initiated only at the direction of the Prime Minister. While it is expected that special reviews will be uncommon, the bill makes clear such a review is available to Government in those rare circumstances where the public interest demands it. The Commissioner's information-gathering powers under section 43 of the Act will be available for special reviews. 


To augment the capacity of the Commissioner to conduct reviews and call on specialised knowledge, the bill provides for the appointment of Special Commissioners by the Governor-General to assist in undertaking all or part of a systems or special review and report through the Commissioner. 




Agency Head Code of Conduct



Under the Public Service Act, the Commissioner has a specific power to inquire into alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct by Agency Heads and report to the appropriate authority on the results of such inquiries.


Unlike the discretion available to Agency Heads in respect of APS employees, there is little scope for the Commissioner to conduct a preliminary assessment before launching a formal inquiry. To remedy this, the bill provides a regulation-making power to prescribe the circumstances in which the Commissioner may exercise discretion to decline to conduct an inquiry into alleged breaches of the Code by Agency Heads, or to discontinue an inquiry without invoking the reporting requirements. This element of discretion is desirable to deal with trivial or futile matters or matters that have previously been dealt with. 




APS employee Code of Conduct



Currently, the responsibility for investigating and determining breaches of the Code of Conduct by APS employees rests with Agency Heads. On occasion Agency Heads have wanted the Commissioner to conduct an independent investigation into suspected misconduct by one or more of their own employees. This is typically when public interest concerns raised by a particular allegation make it desirable that matters are investigated and determined by an authority that is both expert and independent. 


The bill proposes that the Commissioner will have a new function to determine alleged breaches of the Code by APS employees. This function will be triggered when requested by the Agency Head or by the Prime Minister. The Commissioner may decline to conduct such an investigation.




Revise the APS Values and introduce APS Employment Principles



Part 6 of Schedule 1 to this bill revises the APS Values and introduces a set of APS Employment Principles. 


The Values and the Employment Principles are statements about the essential character and philosophy of the APS. They define what the APS is, and how it should operate. 


The proposed Values—that the APS is Committed to Service, is Ethical, Respectful, Accountable and Impartial—are more succinct and memorable, easy to understand, and will help the Service to create an ethical, high performance culture.


The Values and Employment Principles together capture the essence of the existing 15 Values, blending contemporary ethics with enduring principles of public administration that go to the heart of the Westminster model. No important concepts have been lost.


Agency Heads and APS employees will, by law, be required to uphold the Values and the Employment Principles. Agency Heads and Senior Executive Service employees will also be required to promote them, reflecting the key responsibility that they have as leaders within their agencies to set the tone for the right culture.




Technical and operational amendments



The bill also contains a number of other, largely technical, amendments aimed at more effective management of the Service. These amendments reflect the experience of working with the Act over the last 12 years.




Code of Conduct



Part 7 of Schedule 1 of this bill relates to the handling of misconduct in the Australian Public Service.


The bill provides for amendments to the Code of Conduct so that its first four elements will apply when there is a direct connection with the employee's employment. 


Other amendments to the Code or provisions for handling misconduct will allow agencies to deal more effectively and efficiently with other unacceptable behaviour.


The bill also provides for a misconduct investigation to be finalised after an employee has separated from the APS, providing more certainty for agencies and making it less attractive for employees who are under investigation to resign before a finding is made, as many employees in this situation currently do.




Whistleblower reports



The Act currently provides protection for whistleblowers in the APS. The Regulations provide the framework under which whistleblower reports are handled.


The bill makes two small amendments to the scheme. It provides a specific regulation making power and allows for matters to be excluded from inquiry, including those that relate to an employee's own employment. Such complaints are better directed to the existing Review of Action scheme.




Temporary APS employees



Part 10 of Schedule 1 of this bill simplifies the operation of the non-ongoing employment provisions. The Act will provide that regulations may prescribe, rather than limit, the circumstances under which a non-ongoing employee may be engaged, and may prescribe the grounds for the termination of employment of non-ongoing employees. 


The principle that ongoing employment is the usual basis for engagement will be retained.




Machinery of Government changes



Part 11 of Schedule 1 of the bill improves the operation of the Machinery of Government provisions by providing the Commissioner with discretion to determine whether employment-related matters can continue following a Machinery of Government change. 


The bill also makes clear that the power to move staff out of the APS in order to give effect to a Machinery of Government change covers those non-APS Commonwealth bodies that do not have separate legal identity, such as the Australian Federal Police.




Confidentiality of information, privacy and immunity from suit



Part 12 of Schedule 1 to this bill provides protections for an Agency Head or APS employee who provides information voluntarily to the Commissioner or Merit Protection Commissioner in the course of the exercise of their review and inquiry functions. 


Part 13 of Schedule 1 to this Bill moves the immunity from suit provisions from the Regulations to the Act and provides consistency in the functions which attract immunity.


The act will provide that regulations may be made to authorise by law the use, as well as disclosure, of personal information in certain circumstances. This reduces the uncertainly expressed by many APS agencies as to their capacity to use personal information relating to employees for a range of purposes in managing their staff.




Legislative instruments



Part 14 of Schedule 1 to this bill rationalises the subordinate instruments under the Act. The Commissioner's direction-making power has been expanded to allow directions on employment matters relating to all APS employees, such as engagement, promotion, redeployment, mobility, training schemes and termination. 


The matters set out in the Prime Minister's Public Service Directions will be moved to the Commissioner's Directions under the consolidated power. The Commissioner's Directions will be legislative instruments, registered in accordance with the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, correcting an oversight when that Act was introduced.


The Classification Rules, which prescribe a Service-wide framework for the classification of APS employees, will be made by the Public Service Commissioner, reflecting the movement of this function from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to the Commission in July 2010.




Miscellaneous amendments



Parts 9 and 15 of Schedule 1 to this bill improve the operation of the act by making a range of other minor technical amendments.


Schedule 2 to this bill repeals the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Act 1999. This act was the accompanying legislation to the current act when it was introduced in 1999 and is now largely redundant although some provisions will be retained through regulations.


Schedule 3 to this bill makes a number of consequential amendments to other acts.


Schedule 4 to this bill puts in place a number of application, saving and transitional provisions to ensure the continuity of certain matters, such as investigations, reviews or inquiries in progress.




Summary



In summary, this bill responds to the reform agenda of the Blueprint by implementing significant reforms relating to the leadership of the Australian Public Service.


It is important that the public service legislation supports a Service which is fit for purpose, meeting the legitimate needs of the Government of the day both now and into the future. 


This bill provides for a modern, contemporary employment framework that will allow greater agility and responsiveness by the APS to the community and government. It will result in greater efficiency and more effective use of Commonwealth resources. It will also facilitate and accelerate the cultural shift towards operating more effectively as 'One Australian Public Service'.


VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2012


I am pleased to present legislation that will give effect to a number of measures that will improve or clarify services and benefits to the veteran and Defence Force community and make various amendments to update Veterans' Affairs and related legislation.


Benefiting the veteran and Defence Force community are amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act that will exempt from income tax, payments made under the new Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. 


The Scheme commenced on 1 January 2012 and the first payments will be made in the first quarter of 2013. 


The Scheme provides for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by eligible veterans and members in the purchase of pharmaceuticals.


The implementation of this Scheme has been achieved through amendments to the legislative instruments that govern the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the MRCA Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. 


Amendments are required to the Income Tax Assessment Act to grant payments under the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme, the necessary income tax exempt status. 


These amendments have the added benefit of also clarifying the income tax exempt status of other reimbursements that may be made under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the MRCA Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 


It is expected that approximately 50,000 veterans and members will benefit from the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme.


Further amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act will make it clear that treatment costs reimbursed under the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act are income tax exempt. 


The Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act provides treatment and testing for cancer for eligible nuclear test participants. 


In some circumstances, treatment costs incurred by an eligible participant may be reimbursed. 


Changes in the bill to Veterans' Affairs legislation will clarify the approval and authorisation arrangements for travel for treatment for eligible persons and attendants under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act. 


In 2010-11 the Department processed over 155,000 claims for reimbursement for travel expenses for treatment purposes. 


Travel expenses can include costs for transport, meals and accommodation for eligible persons and where necessary an attendant to accompany the eligible person. 


Amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act will make it clear that Repatriation Commission approval or authorisation for such travel may be given before or after the travel has been undertaken. 


Further beneficial amendments in the bill will enable special assistance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to be delivered in a more timely manner.


This will be achieved by enabling special assistance to be provided by legislative instrument instead of by regulation.


The result will be a more streamlined and therefore speedier process for providing special assistance to veterans, members, former members and their dependants. 


The remaining amendments in the bill will make minor changes to clarify and update Veterans' Affairs legislation and further align the Veterans' Entitlements Act with the social security law. 


These changes are part of the Government's ongoing commitment to continually review, update and improve the services and administration of benefits to our current and former military personnel and their families.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:43):  I move:


That the Small Pelagic Fishery Total Allowable Catch (Quota Species) Determination 2012, made under subsection 17(6)(aa) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and under section 17 of the Small Pelagic Fishery Management Plan 2009, be disallowed.


Something quite extraordinary happened in my home state this afternoon that relates directly to the debate on the Greens's disallowance motion in the Senate tonight. I would like to table a document in the Senate that relates to a motion that was passed in the Tasmanian lower house, the House of Assembly, today.


It was quite extraordinary in the sense that from what we can gather from the Greens here federally it is the first time that we have seen tripartisan support for a conservation outcome. It is the first time that Liberal and Labor MPs have broken ranks with their federal MPs on a conservation issue. I seek leave to table a document.


Leave granted. 




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I start by reading it. I had a speech prepared but I think this summarises a lot of the issues upfront and then I will address a couple of key points. The final amended motion passed reads as follows:


That this House


1. Notes that:


(a) The growing community concern and disquiet over the potential arrival of the super trawler, FV Margiris, to operate in Australian waters to fish the small pelagic fishery;


(b) The questions raised regarding the potential impact of the increased quota of 18, 000 tonnes per annum on local fisheries;


(c) This is a matter for Federal authorities who are responsible for access to ports, fishing in Commonwealth waters and the setting of quota in those waters;


(d) That the Tasmanian local recreational and commercial fishing communities remain strongly opposed to the FV Margiris operation and have held large protest rallies around the state to stress their concerns;


(e) Both the Tasmanian Greens and the Tasmanian Liberal parties have publicly voiced their respective opposition to this proposed super trawler, with the shared concern that the Federal Labor Minister, Senator Joe Ludwig, has failed to demonstrate that this commercial fishery activity will be sustainable and will not cause localised depletion off Tasmania;


2. Requests the Speaker to write to Senator Ludwig, to advice him that the House will not support the FV Margiris operation in Australian waters and waters around Tasmania until the Parliament can be satisfied that the vessel and proposed harvest strategy will not adversely impact on the recreational fishery.


3. The House recognises the need for a balanced approach between the needs of a sustainable commercial fishing industry, access for recreational fishers and appropriate marine conservation outcomes.


What is very important about this motion passed by the lower house is that, in a state that is divided by conflict, we have seen a rare glimpse of all political parties putting aside politics and coming together on an issue that is very important to the community.


The issues relating to the super trawler have been around for three or four months—in fact, the issues internationally relating to concerns and the risks posed by super trawlers to commercial fisheries, recreational fisheries and ecosystems have been around for years. The super trawler as a large fishing vessel that targets the small pelagic fishery has come to symbolise to lots of people everything that is wrong with the overfishing that occurs in the world's oceans. 


While I commend the lower house in Tasmania's parliament for their brave stance on supporting both recreational fishers and conservationists, I make it very clear that standing behind the motion from Tasmania today are both recreational fishermen and conservationists working side-by-side to get a conservation outcome. This is not something that we see very often and, while it is powerfully symbolic and very important in so many ways that we see the old divisions being put aside, it does not have any teeth in preventing this super trawler from operating in Australian waters. Today we are proposing to debate and seek the support of fellow senators in the chamber to disallow the quota that has been set for the small pelagic fishery. 


This is not something that the Greens have done lightly. We have been speaking to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. We have put two series of complex, well researched questions on notice. We have met with AFMA. We have met with one of the chief AFMA commissioners and scientists who supports the super trawler. We have met with all recreational fishing groups and conservationists and only in recent days I have met the proponent, Seafish Tasmania.


Moving this motion has not been done lightly and we have done it as a last-ditch attempt to get parliament to debate this issue tonight and get support for what the public are clearly saying, which is: 'This super trawler shouldn't be allowed to operate in Australian fisheries until key risks have been addressed.'


I understand it is quite likely that the Greens are going to be criticised for shutting down a fishery. I also understand there are a number of fishermen out there who have investments in fisheries equipment and it creates some uncertainty. This is also something we have taken into account. The small pelagic fishery for which we are asking for the quotas to be disallowed for all intents and purpose was not fished last year—99.6 per cent of the quota was not fished. In large zones of the fishery, the small pelagic has not been fished for eight to 10 years. 


We understand potential issues with investor uncertainty and operators in this industry but we feel that the risks posed to recreational fishermen, other commercial fishermen and ecosystems by the lack of a management plan that addresses the risk of allowing a super trawler to operate in Australian waters far outweigh the potential negatives that we may see by shutting down the quota. We also understand—and I am happy to stand corrected on this—that the government can introduce a new set of quotas fairly quickly once the issue has been properly looked at.


I mentioned earlier that there were concerns from the recreational fishing groups. The key concern relates to local fish depletion. A trawler this size has the capability to stay out at sea for months on end, and has very large refrigeration units, very large nets and all the best technology in the world for catching fish. 


The concern is that this trawler could deplete fish in any given area, and that would have an impact on local ecosystems and local fishing activity.


I heard the proponent, Seafish, this morning on the radio saying that concerns about local fish depletion is misinformation being peddled by the Greens. I have been involved for three months with various stakeholders, and I know that the local fish depletion issue was brought to the Greens by recreational fishermen. It is not the Greens who are peddling this information, nor is it recreational fishermen. This is a valid community concern and there is disregard for a large number of Tasmanians and a large number of Australians who enjoy fishing. Localised depletion is where fishing reduces the abundance of fish in an area for a period of time. That is the technical definition. I heard a fisherman at a rally in Hobart recently say: 'It's when one of the world's largest supertrawlers comes to your local fishing spot, takes lots of fish and buggers up your fishing.' That is to put it in another way. 


What is very encouraging to me, to the Greens and also to those outside this chamber who have concerns about this issue is the scientific report that was released yesterday by a number of key eminent scientists in this country. I would like to read a couple of conclusions from that report. This relates directly to the issue local fish depletion. It says:


Fishing should be spread out so as to avoid localised depletions, especially in relation to any local ecological 'hotspots' where there is particularly strong local dependency between predators and prey (e.g. in the vicinity of some seabird rookeries).


In the final paragraph in the conclusion of the report, the scientists say:


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


In terms of the science on this issue, it seems like everyone is in agreement. The scientists are in agreement, and these scientists have been involved with this fishery for a long period of time. Some of them are very well respected in terms of their publications and their standing in the community in Hobart. I would like to acknowledge that on the record tonight. We have never intentionally set out or implied that we do not respect the work of our scientists in our Commonwealth or state fisheries—quite the opposite. Scientists are saying it, local rec fishers are saying it, and conservationists are saying it. 


To highlight the issue of local depletion with rec fishers, the government set up a working group several weeks ago. The working group brought in a number of stakeholders who had concerns about the impact that a supertrawler may have on their local fisheries. It is now common knowledge that that working group has fallen apart. The local fishing groups have walked. Their key concerns were very simple. They did not believe that this local fishing issue about depletion had been addressed in any detail. The report released yesterday, which I just mentioned, has been talked about today on every radio station around the country by the scientists involved. While it says that more work needs to be done to address this issue in a management plan, why hasn't it been done already, and why wasn't it in the report today?


Rec fisher groups started asking questions on rumours that they had heard that one of the largest trawlers in the world was coming to Tasmanian waters to fish the small pelagics, which are forage fish that big fish such as tuna feed on. They heard this rumour back in March and started speaking to their elected representatives and other people. It is now nearly the end of August. We asked the fisheries minister detailed questions about local depletion back in June. Only yesterday did a research report arrive that acknowledged that this is an issue for the management of this fishery, but it does not say how that local depletion is going to be managed or what science we have to address that at this point in time. If our disallowance motion is supported, it will give the government a chance to step back from this process and put in place regulations—whether it is adjustment to the Fisheries Management Act or whatever the appropriate format is that satisfies the stakeholders in this debate. 


The other issue on which the rec fishers walked from negotiations was that they did not feel that a voluntary agreement would satisfy them. The Greens have said publicly that they did not feel that a voluntary agreement would work. A legislated agreement was what the fishermen were asking for—a legislated agreement that provides safeguards for the risks of local fish depletion. Conservation groups have a larger list of requirements as well: guarantees of 24-hour monitoring on a vessel this size and lots of issues surrounding the potential for by-catch, which is when local sealife is killed by a large trawler—which happens all the time. These issues can be worked through. I would urge the other senators, especially those from Tasmania who have seen such a strong message from our state, to take note of the concerns. In the Sydney Morning Herald today there was an article with the headline 'Angling for power'. It talks about the power of rec fishers in this country when they come together to get outcomes.


I want to stress that it is not just the Greens and conservationists who have valid concerns about ecosystem impacts. Rec fishers are one of the largest lobby groups in the country. I have not heard one of Senator Boswell's infamous rumblings about rec fishers and how the armies of Armageddon, armies of rec fishers, are going to march over the horizon and tread on the Greens, but I understand that there are nearly five million across the country—which is a large number. A lot of them have concerns that need to be addressed.


We all agree that more scientific research needs to be done, we all agree that we could tighten up regulations and we all agree that risks need to be addressed before we let this supertrawler operate in Australian waters. One question that I have been asked in recent days when speaking to media and to a number of constituents is: why is this supertrawler coming to Australia? The technical answer is that we have an underutilised fishery. It is not economic to fish these fish because they are low value and it is high cost. That is why the fishery is not being utilised at the moment. Only a supertrawler has the capacity to fish these waters economically.


There is also a bigger issue here—a desire or a dream to use Australian protein from these small pelagic fisheries to feed the world. It is a sad irony that we may use our small pelagic fish to send to and feed countries like Africa who have had their local waters depleted by exactly the same supertrawlers. This is just one of many issues of concern that the community have with this boat. That may be scientifically valid and it may be that daily egg production method studies show that this fishery is sustainable into the future. But that work has not been done yet either. None of that work has been done for eight to 10 years in this fishery. I understand it will happen if the boat arrives and the company pays for it. This is another issue that conservationists would like addressed.


There is also a lot of very strong public concern about the process that has led to the quota allocation—the AFMA process. We have seen significant media on that in recent weeks. The only way we can allay those concerns is to revisit the quota allocation process—stand back, take our time and do this properly. It is my job as a parliamentarian, as it is the job of everyone in this chamber—and I am learning these things very quickly—to represent my constituents, voters for my party, and all concerned Tasmanians, on this issue. Once again, I applaud all the MPs in the lower house of Tasmania today—Labor, Liberal and Greens—for presenting such a strong message to their federal counterparts here tonight that they do not want this supertrawler to operate in Australian waters without the appropriate checks and balances put in place. Only we can put checks and balances in place, and we need to do it now. This boat is due to arrive in Australian waters any day. Any day now we have the potential for more public concern and an escalation of this conflict. It is our duty as parliamentarians to take action.


I know that a lot of my federal counterparts in the Labor Party have concerns about this—it is all documented in the media. I have had discussions with my Liberal senator counterparts, and I know they take this issue seriously as well. I am not pointing fingers at anyone; I am just saying, 'Listen to the spirit of Tasmania tonight.' It is not very often we see such a divided state come together and vote on a conservation outcome. We need to listen to and take note of what they have done and we need to take action on this tonight.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (18:04):  I rise somewhat flustered, as I was not actually sure that this was coming on for debate and I just happened to be here at the time. I would like to make a bit of a contribution. Firstly, I would like to congratulate Senator Whish-Wilson for his contribution. It was from the heart, and I believe as a Tasmanian he is reflecting the will of the parliament in Tasmania and, to some degree, the people of Tasmania.


As some of you would know, I have been around in fishery politics for some time—it is a pretty tough game—and I have also been around for long enough to know and to perhaps provide some insight about what we should not be doing. We see the headlines in the papers: 'Supertrawler!' and we read that it is not extraordinarily good, that it is large and a fishing boat—and children have to go to bed earlier—and that this is a very serious threat to our way of life. In fact, from my perspective, it is quite the opposite, and I did not think for a moment that the Tasmanian parliament would come to that conclusion. I thought it would simply pass on.


I had a passing look at the work that AFMA, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, had done—and, again, I acknowledge the credit that Senator Whish-Wilson piled on the scientists from that august body. I will deal with some of the issues about the size. Particularly to Senator Whish-Wilson and the Greens, I would say that the supertrawler is catching a particular amount of fish; it is not just catching any amount of fish. This is actually an output control fishery. So, for example, we say, 'We don't care how you catch it, but you are only allowed to catch 10 fish.' That is how it is. For those who are not familiar with input and output controls, with an input control fishery you are allowed to catch as many fish as you like with one hand behind your back or with a captain with an IQ of four—and I have been in fisheries that have that impediment, I have to say. An output control fishery is considered one of the best ways to manage fisheries.


I will give you a bit of a quantum on that. There is a benefit to this, because you could have maybe 10 or 20 trawlers go out there now and 'pelagically' trawl. So there is a great deal of efficiency with this. You could certainly call it a super-efficient trawler. There is no doubt about that. The efficiency is all about using less fuel to gather the protein. This trawler would undoubtedly provide for a much smaller carbon footprint—and we have certainly been lectured on those sorts of issues by the Greens a number of times in here, and perhaps rightly so.


The last issue I will touch on is that we provide protein. It is a very important foodstuff and we should think very carefully. Last night I was listening to Tim Costello on the television expounding the virtues of looking after people in Africa, particularly in the Horn of Africa, who are going through the most extraordinary drought. We keep talking about extraordinary droughts in Africa, but certainly this drought is having just a horrific impact on the population there, who have, right at the moment, almost no access to protein in particular. This is a market. This particular boat and this particular fishery is targeted specifically at filling that market. I just want to make that clear.


I will just quickly go through the process. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority have made an investment in science. They have not just run out and said, 'Big trawler—no worries, fill your boots; it will all be okay.' They have put so much work into ensuring that they have the total allowable catch. This particular boat will take 18,000 tonnes. That is a lot of jack mackerel—and four other smaller species—but it is out of a conservative estimate that built in precautionary principles of 360,000 tonnes annually, just to put it in context. The total allowable catch for the fishery is about 36,000 tonnes, of which this vessel will be taking 18,000 tonnes. We are talking 3.6 per cent of the total fishery, just to put it in context. It is a big trawler. It can hold it flat, it can do what it likes, but that is the maximum that it is going to be able to take.


I have only just stood up—I am not really across some of the things—but the senator did provide some interesting statistics showing that 99.6 per cent of the quota was not actually fished. I know we may have fundamentally different views on this, but my view is that we have a responsibility to be able to fish and allow fishing sustainably, within sustainable levels. I think if everything stays to the model that AFMA has got, then that is certainly what will happen. I think you could reasonably say that it is an unfished fishery. The senator made a comment along the lines of 'We are only using a super trawler because it is an unfished fishery'. I will use an analogy. I live in Darwin and I can tell you there is a very good reason we do not hook up the house trailer, put some vegies in it and tow it behind the Holden to Darwin, because we have got to use big trucks. It is a critical mass and efficiency issue. I would never be able to afford vegies if we used the house trailer and I can tell you that catching fish in pelagic fisheries any other way would simply would be too much for the market and I think we should also take that into consideration.


This has been heavily politicised in a short time and I have had the experience in my home territory of similar things. I will just deal with a couple of the key issues. I notice that in terms of local fish depletion there were a couple of other issues that the senator brought up. I will quote from a scientific paper by Colin Buxton, Gavin Begg, Jeremy Lyle, Tim Ward, Keith Sainsbury, Tony Smith and David Smith. If you do not know them, take it from me and google them: they are the key scientists in small pelagic fisheries internationally. In regard to local depletion in this exact fishery, they say:


Localised depletion is evaluated as unlikely with the proposed harvesting fractions applied in the SPF because most small pelagic species, and their predators, are highly mobile and local areas replenish quickly provided the overall stocks are not depleted. This has been the experience with small pelagic fisheries that have been similarly managed in Australia.


People say this is the first time this has ever really been done. We have a total allowable catch in the sardine fishery of South Australia, and that total allowable catch is 34,000 tonnes. It is double the quota we are talking about here. They are a very similar fish to manage, and this sardine quota is taken in an area half the size. I am not saying this as a contradiction. I just hope those listening will take that into consideration and that it will provide them with some comfort. I also note their recommendation in regard to by-catch: 


AFMA has committed to 100% observer coverage to monitor by-catch and other aspects of fishery operations for the factory trawler.


I think that will give everybody an awful lot of confidence in what is happening.


I want to briefly touch on fishing politics. We can manage fisheries from this place. We can manage them from here. I was part of a political party that managed fisheries in the Northern Territory. Way back in the day, if we put an Aboriginal and a commercial fisherman in a paddock and threw rocks at them, everybody in the Northern Territory would vote for us. But I tell you, it did not do much for the management of fisheries. It was not useful at all. I would urge all those involved in this debate to simply allow this to be left to the scientists. If you have a question with the science, if it is a question about the validity of it, if it is about 'have not had enough time', I would be the first person to say we need seriously to consider the precautionary principle and go back and look at that particular element. I know Senator Whish-Wilson has called for further consideration and that in the future we might go and do these things. Perhaps I do not know enough about the issue, but I am certainly concerned that this is simply a delaying tactic and that this will never happen. It is a real boat, there is a real quota, it is a real fishery and there is a real protein need in Africa. I have not heard in the debate that there is a particular piece of an element of the science that is flawed or that the scientists do not know enough about it or that somehow the application of the precautionary principle is not there. I suspect this is a reaction after recreational fishermen have come to you and said, 'Look, this is going to cause fish depletion.' And I am sure they have but, frankly, local recreational fishermen—I love them; I am one of them; I have bred them—probably are not quite as switched on to the science as the scientists are. I think we should leave this to science and we need to really think about the fact that a super trawler is actually a super-efficient trawler.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:14):  A few months ago Seafish Tasmania announced that they would be bringing the super trawler FV Margiris into Australian waters and the super trawler would seek to fish there. The super trawler is proposed to be based out of Devonport in Tasmania and has caused deep community concern throughout our state.


We have never had a factory ship super trawler fish in Australian waters before. Tasmanians are concerned about the environmental impact that the Margiris will have on our fish stocks now and for generations to come. The super trawler, as I understand it, is unlike anything that has ever operated in Australian waters. The Margiris is a 142-metre midwater trawler and weighs nearly 10,000 tonnes. It can process over 250 tonnes of fish a day. It has a cargo capacity of 6,200 tonnes. It is being brought here by Seafish Tasmania, which has secured an 18,000-tonne quota for jack mackerel, blue mackerel and redbait—key prey fish which help to sustain populations of the larger animals like southern bluefin tuna, fur seals, dolphins and other marine animals and birds. The Margiris will tow a 300-metre-long net through the waters above the bottom of the ocean. The catch will be frozen whole and most, as I understand it, will then be exported to West Africa.


So what has happened? In response to community concern the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, established a working group, inviting ENGOs, recreational fishing groups and Seafish Tasmania to be part of a group to try to reach an agreement on the super trawler. Of course, the ENGOs did not participate in the working group. The minister established the working group as a means of bringing the company and the community together on a set of additional voluntary measures regarding the operation of the FV Margiris. No outcome was reached and, on exiting the working group process, TARFish CEO Mark Nikolai issued a media statement. I will read some of that:


Reviewing the Small Pelagic Fishery science has heightened our concerns and raised more questions without answers.


Mr Nikolai went on to say:


Recreational fishers call on Minister Ludwig to not allow industrial scale fishing operations to occur in the Small Pelagic Fishery and address the significant public concerns surrounding the risks of local area depletion on fish stocks.


I attended a number of rallies in Hobart in July and August with Senator Lin Thorp which were organised by Tyson Clements, Martin Haley and Neil Clark. Rallies were held around the state. At the rallies we attended we heard the concerns of the recreational fishers and the local community. Many of the main issues were centred around spatial management, the science and, indeed, the science as it relates to the vessel—the size of the trawler and the impact this will have on the local ecosystem. Recreational fishers, game fishers, tuna fishers, tourism operators and conservation groups have been very active and vocal in calling for sound spatial management to ensure that our fishing stocks are a resource that is not just for ourselves but also for our children and our children's children.


We also need to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on our local ecosystems. Indeed, there are concerns regarding the science and how it relates if the volumes are being taken by one large vessel. This super trawler is a size we have never seen before and it throws up a number of questions that I believe were not thought of when the science was last done. It is also worth noting that, due to the important place small fish such as redbait and jack mackerel have in the food chain, there are concerns about the impact on local ecosystems that could occur through overfishing of these species.


At the rally in Hobart Senator Lin Thorp and I accepted a petition on behalf of Julie Collins, the member for Franklin. We also raised the concerns. After that meeting and at the rally we indicated quite clearly to the people who attended the rally that we would go back to Minister Ludwig—indeed, to the Prime Minister's office—and raise the concerns that were given to us at those rallies and at meetings that we held privately with TARFish and other fishing groups.


Last week I was among a group of parliamentarians—Senator Whish-Wilson was there as well—on the Parliament House lawns to view a petition of 35,000 signatures. It was a massive petition. This petition was later presented to Minister Ludwig and has been tabled in the Senate. The size of this petition again highlights the enormous community concern about the FV Margiris across Australia. Minister Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, Lin Thorp and I have also asked the federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Tony Burke, to intervene on the super trawler on environmental grounds. Minister Burke has himself stated his concerns regarding the FV Margiris and highlighted that super trawlers pose new issues for fishery management.


I believe we must see this issue resolved quickly. I am unconvinced of the safeguards that are in place to ensure our local ecosystems are not impacted by the super trawler. Consequently, I am of the view that the FV Margiris should not be here. Senator Whish-Wilson, I know, has genuine concerns about the long-term future of the Tasmanian fisheries. What we—Minister Collins, Senator Thorp and other members of the caucus—have been doing is using avenues available to us to address the valid concerns of our community that we share to deal with the super trawler now and, I hope, into the future.


So, while a disallowance motion is one tactic that can be used, I believe this motion is really nothing more than a gesture, but an empty gesture because it will not succeed and does nothing to address the issues we are facing. It does not address the issues in the long term that we are currently facing. Senator Whish-Wilson even talked in his own motion about the quota being reissued and the like. Anyway, I believe that the action that Senator Thorp, Minister Collins and others have taken in briefing the Prime Minister's office about the real concerns of the recreational fishers and the Tasmanian community, and working with the appropriate ministers to raise these concerns and awareness of the issues, is the best way to resolve this issue. Do I want the super trawler here? No, I do not. Do I think this motion is the best way to proceed? No, I do not.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-08-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:23):  I rise to support this disallowance motion, and I put on the record that, yes, this will succeed if people vote for it. What we are seeing here is a doubling of the quota without scientific support to show the super trawler will deplete our local fish and also take bycatch, which I will address in a minute. But I also go back to the science that Senator Scullion was talking about. He was waving around the Commonwealth Small Pelagic Fishery: general background to the scientific issues report, and he quoted from it. I am aware that Senator Whish-Wilson also quoted from it, but I put in context Senator Scullion's quote. He quoted the first bit of an important point when he said:


Localised depletion is evaluated as unlikely with the proposed harvesting fractions applied in the SPF because most small pelagic species—


and Senator Scullion articulated that. But he left off the important bit:


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


Of course, there is not the appropriate data to do a proper risk assessment on the likelihood of localised depletions occurring, and there is not any adequate information on the movement of target species in the region. That is also from scientific papers. So, on this issue that we will just have to rely on the science, that paper is saying we need more information.


We are particularly concerned about the impact that this super trawler will have on our fisheries in Australia. I will point out here that there has been some mention of whether this super trawler is subsidised and whether it is getting subsidised for this action. The fact is that, to operate, this super trawler has to be, has been and is subsidised by the European Union. Whether it is being subsidised to actually operate in our waters is important to know but is not the full story. The fact is that to exist it needs a subsidy. If it is being subsidised to exist, it is therefore being subsidised to operate in our waters.


It is very important that we deal with this quota issue, and it has highlighted the science arguments around our fisheries and the fact that we do not have as much information about our fisheries as AFMA would have us think. If this gets passed, it will send a clear message that we need better management of our fisheries and we are not prepared to support massive super trawlers—in this case the second biggest in the world—to come and fish in a rapacious manner in our waters. As I think other people have said, this super trawler is a game changer in the way we manage our fisheries in Australia, and that is why you are finding fishers, conservationists and industry standing up around Australia—particularly focused in Tasmania—to say no to this sort of fishing in our waters. Australia has in the past claimed that we have some of the best-managed fisheries in the world, and I have in this chamber acknowledged that also, for some fisheries. But this clearly demonstrates that we cannot just rely on our so-called reputation as being among the best fisheries managers in the world. We need to demonstrate that on the water as well.


I know that Senator Whish-Wilson has articulated some of the key issues, but I particularly want to focus on the issues around bycatch and point to what happened in New Zealand, where they have had some issues with the super trawlers there. The New Zealand government experienced difficulty in effectively enforcing fisheries regulations in their well-managed fisheries, and it should provide us with a very sobering lesson about the realities of super trawlers and the way they operate. Recently a local New Zealand company chartered Korean super trawlers to fish New Zealand waters, with observers from the New Zealand government on board. However, the observers were unable to monitor the whole ship the whole time. Catches were done when the observers were either asleep, on the other side of the boat or looking at something else, and the quota apparently was surpassed. As with many super trawlers around the world, the New Zealand experience has ended in legal action and is a very sorry example of the impact that super trawlers can have.


Have we learnt from this experience? It looks as if we may not have when we go back to the issue of bycatch. Apparently we are supposed to believe that this massive, great, big ship will move on when it sights a dolphin, but we have no assurances that this boat will have enough observer coverage to even flag that there is a dolphin there, without contemplating the issue of whether the ship will, in fact, move on or not. I draw attention to our most recent experience in Australia around bycatch, and that is the South Australian experience with sea lions. As we know, AFMA has had to close trawl fisheries in South Australia because of the question of bycatch. I also need to acknowledge that my colleague Senator Wright put a lot of effort into following up this issue. In fact, in this very chamber she raised questions about it. When they started looking at observer studies in that fishery, they identified that 374 sea lions were dying in 18 months.


They also uncovered a further 56 dolphin deaths. Because they started looking, they actually worked out what was happening in that fishery. There were attempts to deal with that, and what has had to happen is that they have had to close some of those fisheries. AFMA had to take decisive action in that case because it was clearly demonstrated that there was adverse impact on bycatch. We are now talking about a boat that is much bigger and which has had a lot of other trouble dealing with bycatch in other areas.


I think that super trawlers have earned a bad name because of their impacts on local depletions and because of their impacts in other countries. In the past 15 years 20 super trawlers off the west coast of Africa are estimated to have killed in bycatch 1,500 critically endangered turtles, 18,000 giant rays and 60,000 sharks. And you can bet your bottom dollar that that number of deaths is adding to what we already know about the low stocks of sharks globally. As a result of this sort of behaviour by super trawlers in West Africa, Senegal has recently banned all super trawlers. Just like New Zealand, they have learnt their lesson the hard way.


Why does Australia have to learn its lesson the hard way? Surely we should be learning from the experiences of our neighbours and from experiences elsewhere? We know that our fish stocks are plummeting globally. Why does Australia have to contribute to that? Why are we so determined to allow that to happen in our waters? We have held ourselves high, saying that we are some of the best fisheries managers in the world, and now it seems like we are coming down to the lowest common denominator with a super trawler that is subsidised to exist.


We have always said, 'No, we shouldn't be doing that,' and yet now we are facilitating the entry into our waters of a super trawler that is subsidised—




Senator Feeney:
  Who subsidises it?




Senator SIEWERT:
  The European Union does. I do not know if you were here a bit earlier, Senator Feeney, when I was saying that whether it is being directly subsidised to operate in our waters or not—to exist—that boat has the potential to come into our waters. It is subsidised to do that. If it were not for European subsidies this super trawler would not be able to operate anywhere. It has to have that to exist.


We are talking about a game changer here. On Radio National this morning we heard that if this season is successful we can expect it to stay. This is not a once off; this is a game changer for the way we manage our fisheries in this country. We are saying that it is okay for massive, great big super trawlers to come into our waters and fish hundreds of tonnes of fish at a time. It is a super trawler that can go into a local area and scoop up all those fish. Not only are those fish important as far as recreational fishers are concerned but other industry players are also concerned that this will have an effect on our ecosystems and other fish species in those ecosystems. We need to think about what we are doing here.


We need to think about why there was a doubling of the quota to enable this super trawler to come into our waters. The background paper that was released yesterday by seven fisheries scientists concludes with this statement, 'It would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion'. We do not know what impact this is going to have on our fish species and we do not know what impact it is going to have on local depletions. We do know that fish stocks around the world are at risk and that we have tried hard to get an adequate and good management system in this country—and I am not about to stand here and say that I think it is perfect, because I have said on other occasions that it is not. But it is certainly better than in a lot of other countries. So instead of maintaining that standing and building on it, what we want to do is join the common denominator and let this sort of operation happen in our waters.


I have to say that it is a strange experience to be in the position where rec fishers are lobbying us to oppose something. I have not had that experience too often, I have to say, other than that there are a group of rec fishers who see the benefits of marine protected areas and the way that they operate to help fish stocks—and I am not going to go over that argument here. So I am not saying that we have not worked with rec fishers in the past, but it is fairly unusual for rec fishers to be lobbying us to oppose something like this. It is the same with the broader commercial industry; that is also unusual.


So there has to be something—and I will use it, pardon the pun—'fishy' about this particular proposal if there are so many stakeholders that are opposed to this particular proposal. We need to be operating under the precautionary principle in our management of our fisheries. Any definition of the precautionary principle would say that you do not allow this sort of massive fish-gathering implement to operate in our waters when it will lead to local depletions and when we do not have the science. We do not know what impact it will have.


The science report that people are now holding up as saying that it supports it does not. It does not say it is okay to go ahead. We should be operating under the precautionary principle. We should not allow this material—




Senator Colbeck:
  It actually does. You are misrepresenting the science, as usual—no respect for science.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I hear the coalition across the chamber saying that we are no respecters of science. It is we who have been looking at the science around marine protected areas. It is we who have been looking at that.




Senator Feeney:
  What about climate change science?




Senator SIEWERT:
  Exactly! Do not lecture me about not looking at the science.




Senator Colbeck:
  Read the paper and give it its due!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Senator Siewert, ignore the interjections.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I will take your direction, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I will ignore them.


This approach is not good enough. We should not be doubling the quota and we should not be allowing that super trawler to operate in Australian waters. We have too much to lose: our fisheries are too much to lose by allowing this operation to happen in our waters.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (18:37):  I have had some quite instructive conversations with Senator Whish-Wilson in respect of this issue. We have sat down on a couple of occasions and had a discussion about it. But I have to say that Senator Siewert's contribution was, quite frankly, reminiscent of some of what her state colleagues have done in whipping up fear and frenzy around this issue and causing a large amount of the concern that exists in my home state of Tasmania and in other places, I might add, with absolutely irresponsible rhetoric around this particular issue. I recognise the concern that exists in my home state of Tasmania and I have had conversations with the recreational fishermen myself. I have sat down with them and we have been through the issues and I think that we understand our issues and I understand their concerns around localised depletions. 


As for the paper that came out yesterday, about eight weeks ago when this process started I went to some scientists and said, 'We would like you to publish something. We would like you to put something together that gives some information to the community around this,' because I have to say, the government's approach to this has been dead-set hopeless—absolutely dead-set hopeless. Going and talking to the Prime Minister achieves nothing. This does achieve something, because it provides some information to the community. 


I am really disappointed, Senator Siewert, in your misrepresentation of what is said. I have read the report. Senator Whish-Wilson read the same half of the paragraph out that you read and Senator Scullion read the other half of the paragraph, so when you put them together, you get the actual picture. As Senator Scullion said, here we have seven of the most respected marine scientists in small pelagics in the world. Professor Sainsbury has just spent two weeks at the United Nations FAO on small pelagics, lecturing on this—and I will come to that later in my contribution. These people are highly respected, and to misrepresent their writings as you have done is quite disgraceful. 


I am going to quote a part of the introduction. It says:


Several groups of scientists worldwide, including from CSIRO and IMAS, have recently examined the effects of fisheries on small pelagic species (also sometimes called forage fish) and how they should be managed so as to avoid undesirable flow-on effects of these fisheries on the food web and ecosystem.


Very important, because it comes to the issues that Senator Brown talked about. It continues:


There is now clear and widely agreed understanding about how these fisheries should be managed, and this understanding has a strong scientific basis—


That is the introduction to this paper. So suggestions that the science is not known, that there are doubts about the science, is complete rubbish. This is a very well-studied fishery and it is very well studied globally, and there are a number of papers that I will cite as part of the discussion here today that actually talk about it. So the rhetoric that the Greens have been going on with and the misrepresentation particularly by Paul O'Halloran, the member for Braddon in Tasmania, and Mr Kim Booth, the member for Bass in Tasmania, have been quite outrageous. It has whipped people into a frenzy. I have had people in my office who say that they cannot sleep at night because of the concerns that have been raised. They come in and quote the lines that the Greens are running out in Tasmania.


As Senator Brown said, and I agree with her on this point, this motion will not necessarily achieve anything. This is a typical Greens process—delay, delay, add cost, try and make an industry or a business unviable by applying additional cost to the business. They have done it in the forest industry and they do it in a whole range of other industries. They have said they are going to target the mining industry—same toolkit, same process. They demonise the industry, they destroy the reputation of the business, and then they cause delay after delay after delay, which increases costs and therefore makes the project financially unviable. That is their strategy. That is the strategy that is being used here. As Professor Sainsbury says:


The demand that there is scientific knowledge about the detailed local movement dynamics of fish stocks is an example of the approach that we must know everything about everything before we can do anything.


That is the way that the Greens operate—'unless you know everything'. But we know that science continues to evolve, and we should continue to invest in science so that we get a good outcome, and we must continue to improve our fisheries management. Not only do we say that we are a good fisheries manager, we are globally benchmarked as being a good fisheries manager. According to the fisheries research reports, the 2008 volume, as far as sustainability is concerned, Australia ranks second in the world.


Mr Burke this morning on Radio National made some quite extraordinary statements. He has actually redefined the issue of localised depletion. He is now talking about seals and dolphins and, quite extraordinarily, albatross. I have not seen an albatross 100 metres deep in the water. I have talked to the industry and to the owner of the vessel, who have fished with this method in this fishery previously—so we are not talking about a new process; it has occurred before—using very similar equipment. Mr Burke is now talking about localised depletions in a way that is different from what everybody else who has been talking about it understands. 


The paper that was released by those seven scientists yesterday actually deals with the issue of localised depletion. On top of that, the company is offering a move on provision to deal with the concerns of the local fishermen—quite responsibly. They are not necessarily required to do it; the fishery is already spatially managed. You just cannot go to the east coast of Tasmania, for example, and take fish. It already has some spatial management around it, and he is offering more. There is a huge opportunity. 


I was really disappointed when I heard that the recreational fishing sector had removed themselves from the discussions last week, as I said to you this morning, Senator Whish-Wilson, because we lost an opportunity to work with the recreational sector, those who are concerned, to do some more science around the issue of how we move around the fishery and how the fish move within the fishery. The offer is on the table. In fact, if you go back to the proposal that SeaFish put over nine months ago to gather new science, that was part of it. If you go back and do that research, that was part of their proposal months ago: to do some more research on the movement of the fish around the fishery so that it was better understood.


There was an opportunity that the recreational fishing guys could have taken to do that. I can understand their lack of confidence in the way the government has managed this—I sincerely can. The government should have said there is a shortage of information or there needs to be a compilation of information. That could have been put on the table. We all know that they were asking for it as part of the talks, but they were told it was not there. It has come out afterwards because somebody else asked for it.


Minister Burke said this morning he now accepts the science. He said on Radio National, in respect of localised depletions: 'I accept the science of that absolutely. The question then becomes whether those volumes, if taken by one vessel using these particular fishing methods, throw up anything that was not contemplated when the science was last done. That is the issue where I think it is quite responsible that questions be checked and checked through very thoroughly, and I am still waiting for some work to come back on that.'


Minister Burke, when he was minister for fisheries between 2007 and 2010, actually presided over the drafting of the small pelagics plan. On the very first page of the small pelagics plan, which was initially put out in 2008 and updated in 2009, it says:


there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


That is in the Small Pelagic Fishery Management Plan that was issued twice under Minister Burke when he was minister for fisheries. I am not sure what he was doing back then and whether he was moving a motion of no confidence in his role as a fisheries minister when he was there or whether he was just trying to find ways to intercede in this particular issue now, which I have to say I think is the case because, in my view, Minister Burke is completely out of control on a number of issues. But that is his record in this particular matter: he presided over the management plan that suggested a large trawler might be part of the deal back in 2008 and 2009. So for anybody in government to be suggesting that this is a huge surprise is quite outrageous.


I want to go now to the question of global fisheries and how they are managed. I mentioned that Professor Sainsbury was involved in some work in Europe and for the United Nations recently. I go to a piece of science that was issued back in April this year by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force. I want to talk about how that works and how our Small Pelagic Fishery Management Plan is established. In the small pelagic fisheries globally, the practice has been to fish down to 20 per cent of the biomass—that is, to take out 80 per cent. That has been the global practice until recently. What this report recommends is that the minimum remaining amount of biomass is doubled to 40 per cent. That is what they observe. The task force also talk about making allowance within that 40 per cent that is to remain for all the other species that forage on the small pelagics—it recognises that they are an important part of the food web.


When we come to the Australian Small Pelagic Fishery Management Plan, where is it set? We say you can take a maximum of 20 per cent. So Lenfest says double it from leaving 20 to leaving 40. We say leave 80, and that is with the most up-to-date science. We then overlay another precaution where we say: as the science decays so does the quota, by 2½ per cent per annum, and when you get to a certain stage you go to a tier-2 level, which has to be below 10 per cent. Where is it set right now? It is set for jack mackerel and blue mackerel at less than 7½ per cent and for redbait at 10 per cent.


So the frenzy that has been whipped up around this, around the science and the level of the quota and the sustainability of the quota, I think is quite outrageous. As Senator Scullion mentioned, there is a small pelagic fishery in South Australian state waters, in a very confined area, that takes 34,000 tonnes per annum. It is well studied. Its impacts are well understood. It does not have impacts on localised depletion and all of the other important marine mammals that are around it because we have a very precautionary approach to the way that we set our quotas and we take into account the importance of these species in the food chain. But nobody has been prepared to say that. Nobody has been prepared to put that important information on the table as part of this debate. All we have had is hysteria and innuendo and claims that will denigrate the name of the business that is operating in this fishery. I think that is an absolute disgrace. We saw that again in the Tasmanian parliament where the press release put out by the Greens does not even reflect the motion that was passed in the house today in Tasmania. Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Something quite extraordinary happened in my home state this afternoon that relates directly to the debate on the Greens's disallowance motion in the Senate tonight. I would like to table a document in the Senate that relates to a motion that was passed in the Tasmanian lower house, the House of Assembly, today.


It was quite extraordinary in the sense that from what we can gather from the Greens here federally it is the first time that we have seen tripartisan support for a conservation outcome. It is the first time that Liberal and Labor MPs have broken ranks with their federal MPs on a conservation issue. I seek leave to table a document.


Leave granted. 




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I start by reading it. I had a speech prepared but I think this summarises a lot of the issues upfront and then I will address a couple of key points. The final amended motion passed reads as follows:


That this House


1. Notes that:


(a) The growing community concern and disquiet over the potential arrival of the super trawler, FV Margiris, to operate in Australian waters to fish the small pelagic fishery;


(b) The questions raised regarding the potential impact of the increased quota of 18, 000 tonnes per annum on local fisheries;


(c) This is a matter for Federal authorities who are responsible for access to ports, fishing in Commonwealth waters and the setting of quota in those waters;


(d) That the Tasmanian local recreational and commercial fishing communities remain strongly opposed to the FV Margiris operation and have held large protest rallies around the state to stress their concerns;


(e) Both the Tasmanian Greens and the Tasmanian Liberal parties have publicly voiced their respective opposition to this proposed super trawler, with the shared concern that the Federal Labor Minister, Senator Joe Ludwig, has failed to demonstrate that this commercial fishery activity will be sustainable and will not cause localised depletion off Tasmania;


2. Requests the Speaker to write to Senator Ludwig, to advice him that the House will not support the FV Margiris operation in Australian waters and waters around Tasmania until the Parliament can be satisfied that the vessel and proposed harvest strategy will not adversely impact on the recreational fishery.


3. The House recognises the need for a balanced approach between the needs of a sustainable commercial fishing industry, access for recreational fishers and appropriate marine conservation outcomes.


What is very important about this motion passed by the lower house is that, in a state that is divided by conflict, we have seen a rare glimpse of all political parties putting aside politics and coming together on an issue that is very important to the community.


The issues relating to the super trawler have been around for three or four months—in fact, the issues internationally relating to concerns and the risks posed by super trawlers to commercial fisheries, recreational fisheries and ecosystems have been around for years. The super trawler as a large fishing vessel that targets the small pelagic fishery has come to symbolise to lots of people everything that is wrong with the overfishing that occurs in the world's oceans. 


While I commend the lower house in Tasmania's parliament for their brave stance on supporting both recreational fishers and conservationists, I make it very clear that standing behind the motion from Tasmania today are both recreational fishermen and conservationists working side-by-side to get a conservation outcome. This is not something that we see very often and, while it is powerfully symbolic and very important in so many ways that we see the old divisions being put aside, it does not have any teeth in preventing this super trawler from operating in Australian waters. Today we are proposing to debate and seek the support of fellow senators in the chamber to disallow the quota that has been set for the small pelagic fishery. 


This is not something that the Greens have done lightly. We have been speaking to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. We have put two series of complex, well researched questions on notice. We have met with AFMA. We have met with one of the chief AFMA commissioners and scientists who supports the super trawler. We have met with all recreational fishing groups and conservationists and only in recent days I have met the proponent, Seafish Tasmania.


Moving this motion has not been done lightly and we have done it as a last-ditch attempt to get parliament to debate this issue tonight and get support for what the public are clearly saying, which is: 'This super trawler shouldn't be allowed to operate in Australian fisheries until key risks have been addressed.'


I understand it is quite likely that the Greens are going to be criticised for shutting down a fishery. I also understand there are a number of fishermen out there who have investments in fisheries equipment and it creates some uncertainty. This is also something we have taken into account. The small pelagic fishery for which we are asking for the quotas to be disallowed for all intents and purpose was not fished last year—99.6 per cent of the quota was not fished. In large zones of the fishery, the small pelagic has not been fished for eight to 10 years. 


We understand potential issues with investor uncertainty and operators in this industry but we feel that the risks posed to recreational fishermen, other commercial fishermen and ecosystems by the lack of a management plan that addresses the risk of allowing a super trawler to operate in Australian waters far outweigh the potential negatives that we may see by shutting down the quota. We also understand—and I am happy to stand corrected on this—that the government can introduce a new set of quotas fairly quickly once the issue has been properly looked at.


I mentioned earlier that there were concerns from the recreational fishing groups. The key concern relates to local fish depletion. A trawler this size has the capability to stay out at sea for months on end, and has very large refrigeration units, very large nets and all the best technology in the world for catching fish. 


The concern is that this trawler could deplete fish in any given area, and that would have an impact on local ecosystems and local fishing activity.


I heard the proponent, Seafish, this morning on the radio saying that concerns about local fish depletion is misinformation being peddled by the Greens. I have been involved for three months with various stakeholders, and I know that the local fish depletion issue was brought to the Greens by recreational fishermen. It is not the Greens who are peddling this information, nor is it recreational fishermen. This is a valid community concern and there is disregard for a large number of Tasmanians and a large number of Australians who enjoy fishing. Localised depletion is where fishing reduces the abundance of fish in an area for a period of time. That is the technical definition. I heard a fisherman at a rally in Hobart recently say: 'It's when one of the world's largest supertrawlers comes to your local fishing spot, takes lots of fish and buggers up your fishing.' That is to put it in another way. 


What is very encouraging to me, to the Greens and also to those outside this chamber who have concerns about this issue is the scientific report that was released yesterday by a number of key eminent scientists in this country. I would like to read a couple of conclusions from that report. This relates directly to the issue local fish depletion. It says:


Fishing should be spread out so as to avoid localised depletions, especially in relation to any local ecological 'hotspots' where there is particularly strong local dependency between predators and prey (e.g. in the vicinity of some seabird rookeries).


In the final paragraph in the conclusion of the report, the scientists say:


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


In terms of the science on this issue, it seems like everyone is in agreement. The scientists are in agreement, and these scientists have been involved with this fishery for a long period of time. Some of them are very well respected in terms of their publications and their standing in the community in Hobart. I would like to acknowledge that on the record tonight. We have never intentionally set out or implied that we do not respect the work of our scientists in our Commonwealth or state fisheries—quite the opposite. Scientists are saying it, local rec fishers are saying it, and conservationists are saying it. 


To highlight the issue of local depletion with rec fishers, the government set up a working group several weeks ago. The working group brought in a number of stakeholders who had concerns about the impact that a supertrawler may have on their local fisheries. It is now common knowledge that that working group has fallen apart. The local fishing groups have walked. Their key concerns were very simple. They did not believe that this local fishing issue about depletion had been addressed in any detail. The report released yesterday, which I just mentioned, has been talked about today on every radio station around the country by the scientists involved. While it says that more work needs to be done to address this issue in a management plan, why hasn't it been done already, and why wasn't it in the report today?


Rec fisher groups started asking questions on rumours that they had heard that one of the largest trawlers in the world was coming to Tasmanian waters to fish the small pelagics, which are forage fish that big fish such as tuna feed on. They heard this rumour back in March and started speaking to their elected representatives and other people. It is now nearly the end of August. We asked the fisheries minister detailed questions about local depletion back in June. Only yesterday did a research report arrive that acknowledged that this is an issue for the management of this fishery, but it does not say how that local depletion is going to be managed or what science we have to address that at this point in time. If our disallowance motion is supported, it will give the government a chance to step back from this process and put in place regulations—whether it is adjustment to the Fisheries Management Act or whatever the appropriate format is that satisfies the stakeholders in this debate. 


The other issue on which the rec fishers walked from negotiations was that they did not feel that a voluntary agreement would satisfy them. The Greens have said publicly that they did not feel that a voluntary agreement would work. A legislated agreement was what the fishermen were asking for—a legislated agreement that provides safeguards for the risks of local fish depletion. Conservation groups have a larger list of requirements as well: guarantees of 24-hour monitoring on a vessel this size and lots of issues surrounding the potential for by-catch, which is when local sealife is killed by a large trawler—which happens all the time. These issues can be worked through. I would urge the other senators, especially those from Tasmania who have seen such a strong message from our state, to take note of the concerns. In the Sydney Morning Herald today there was an article with the headline 'Angling for power'. It talks about the power of rec fishers in this country when they come together to get outcomes.


I want to stress that it is not just the Greens and conservationists who have valid concerns about ecosystem impacts. Rec fishers are one of the largest lobby groups in the country. I have not heard one of Senator Boswell's infamous rumblings about rec fishers and how the armies of Armageddon, armies of rec fishers, are going to march over the horizon and tread on the Greens, but I understand that there are nearly five million across the country—which is a large number. A lot of them have concerns that need to be addressed.


We all agree that more scientific research needs to be done, we all agree that we could tighten up regulations and we all agree that risks need to be addressed before we let this supertrawler operate in Australian waters. One question that I have been asked in recent days when speaking to media and to a number of constituents is: why is this supertrawler coming to Australia? The technical answer is that we have an underutilised fishery. It is not economic to fish these fish because they are low value and it is high cost. That is why the fishery is not being utilised at the moment. Only a supertrawler has the capacity to fish these waters economically.


There is also a bigger issue here—a desire or a dream to use Australian protein from these small pelagic fisheries to feed the world. It is a sad irony that we may use our small pelagic fish to send to and feed countries like Africa who have had their local waters depleted by exactly the same supertrawlers. This is just one of many issues of concern that the community have with this boat. That may be scientifically valid and it may be that daily egg production method studies show that this fishery is sustainable into the future. But that work has not been done yet either. None of that work has been done for eight to 10 years in this fishery. I understand it will happen if the boat arrives and the company pays for it. This is another issue that conservationists would like addressed.


There is also a lot of very strong public concern about the process that has led to the quota allocation—the AFMA process. We have seen significant media on that in recent weeks. The only way we can allay those concerns is to revisit the quota allocation process—stand back, take our time and do this properly. It is my job as a parliamentarian, as it is the job of everyone in this chamber—and I am learning these things very quickly—to represent my constituents, voters for my party, and all concerned Tasmanians, on this issue. Once again, I applaud all the MPs in the lower house of Tasmania today—Labor, Liberal and Greens—for presenting such a strong message to their federal counterparts here tonight that they do not want this supertrawler to operate in Australian waters without the appropriate checks and balances put in place. Only we can put checks and balances in place, and we need to do it now. This boat is due to arrive in Australian waters any day. Any day now we have the potential for more public concern and an escalation of this conflict. It is our duty as parliamentarians to take action.


I know that a lot of my federal counterparts in the Labor Party have concerns about this—it is all documented in the media. I have had discussions with my Liberal senator counterparts, and I know they take this issue seriously as well. I am not pointing fingers at anyone; I am just saying, 'Listen to the spirit of Tasmania tonight.' It is not very often we see such a divided state come together and vote on a conservation outcome. We need to listen to and take note of what they have done and we need to take action on this tonight.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2012-08-22,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (18:04):  I rise somewhat flustered, as I was not actually sure that this was coming on for debate and I just happened to be here at the time. I would like to make a bit of a contribution. Firstly, I would like to congratulate Senator Whish-Wilson for his contribution. It was from the heart, and I believe as a Tasmanian he is reflecting the will of the parliament in Tasmania and, to some degree, the people of Tasmania.


As some of you would know, I have been around in fishery politics for some time—it is a pretty tough game—and I have also been around for long enough to know and to perhaps provide some insight about what we should not be doing. We see the headlines in the papers: 'Supertrawler!' and we read that it is not extraordinarily good, that it is large and a fishing boat—and children have to go to bed earlier—and that this is a very serious threat to our way of life. In fact, from my perspective, it is quite the opposite, and I did not think for a moment that the Tasmanian parliament would come to that conclusion. I thought it would simply pass on.


I had a passing look at the work that AFMA, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, had done—and, again, I acknowledge the credit that Senator Whish-Wilson piled on the scientists from that august body. I will deal with some of the issues about the size. Particularly to Senator Whish-Wilson and the Greens, I would say that the supertrawler is catching a particular amount of fish; it is not just catching any amount of fish. This is actually an output control fishery. So, for example, we say, 'We don't care how you catch it, but you are only allowed to catch 10 fish.' That is how it is. For those who are not familiar with input and output controls, with an input control fishery you are allowed to catch as many fish as you like with one hand behind your back or with a captain with an IQ of four—and I have been in fisheries that have that impediment, I have to say. An output control fishery is considered one of the best ways to manage fisheries.


I will give you a bit of a quantum on that. There is a benefit to this, because you could have maybe 10 or 20 trawlers go out there now and 'pelagically' trawl. So there is a great deal of efficiency with this. You could certainly call it a super-efficient trawler. There is no doubt about that. The efficiency is all about using less fuel to gather the protein. This trawler would undoubtedly provide for a much smaller carbon footprint—and we have certainly been lectured on those sorts of issues by the Greens a number of times in here, and perhaps rightly so.


The last issue I will touch on is that we provide protein. It is a very important foodstuff and we should think very carefully. Last night I was listening to Tim Costello on the television expounding the virtues of looking after people in Africa, particularly in the Horn of Africa, who are going through the most extraordinary drought. We keep talking about extraordinary droughts in Africa, but certainly this drought is having just a horrific impact on the population there, who have, right at the moment, almost no access to protein in particular. This is a market. This particular boat and this particular fishery is targeted specifically at filling that market. I just want to make that clear.


I will just quickly go through the process. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority have made an investment in science. They have not just run out and said, 'Big trawler—no worries, fill your boots; it will all be okay.' They have put so much work into ensuring that they have the total allowable catch. This particular boat will take 18,000 tonnes. That is a lot of jack mackerel—and four other smaller species—but it is out of a conservative estimate that built in precautionary principles of 360,000 tonnes annually, just to put it in context. The total allowable catch for the fishery is about 36,000 tonnes, of which this vessel will be taking 18,000 tonnes. We are talking 3.6 per cent of the total fishery, just to put it in context. It is a big trawler. It can hold it flat, it can do what it likes, but that is the maximum that it is going to be able to take.


I have only just stood up—I am not really across some of the things—but the senator did provide some interesting statistics showing that 99.6 per cent of the quota was not actually fished. I know we may have fundamentally different views on this, but my view is that we have a responsibility to be able to fish and allow fishing sustainably, within sustainable levels. I think if everything stays to the model that AFMA has got, then that is certainly what will happen. I think you could reasonably say that it is an unfished fishery. The senator made a comment along the lines of 'We are only using a super trawler because it is an unfished fishery'. I will use an analogy. I live in Darwin and I can tell you there is a very good reason we do not hook up the house trailer, put some vegies in it and tow it behind the Holden to Darwin, because we have got to use big trucks. It is a critical mass and efficiency issue. I would never be able to afford vegies if we used the house trailer and I can tell you that catching fish in pelagic fisheries any other way would simply would be too much for the market and I think we should also take that into consideration.


This has been heavily politicised in a short time and I have had the experience in my home territory of similar things. I will just deal with a couple of the key issues. I notice that in terms of local fish depletion there were a couple of other issues that the senator brought up. I will quote from a scientific paper by Colin Buxton, Gavin Begg, Jeremy Lyle, Tim Ward, Keith Sainsbury, Tony Smith and David Smith. If you do not know them, take it from me and google them: they are the key scientists in small pelagic fisheries internationally. In regard to local depletion in this exact fishery, they say:


Localised depletion is evaluated as unlikely with the proposed harvesting fractions applied in the SPF because most small pelagic species, and their predators, are highly mobile and local areas replenish quickly provided the overall stocks are not depleted. This has been the experience with small pelagic fisheries that have been similarly managed in Australia.


People say this is the first time this has ever really been done. We have a total allowable catch in the sardine fishery of South Australia, and that total allowable catch is 34,000 tonnes. It is double the quota we are talking about here. They are a very similar fish to manage, and this sardine quota is taken in an area half the size. I am not saying this as a contradiction. I just hope those listening will take that into consideration and that it will provide them with some comfort. I also note their recommendation in regard to by-catch: 


AFMA has committed to 100% observer coverage to monitor by-catch and other aspects of fishery operations for the factory trawler.


I think that will give everybody an awful lot of confidence in what is happening.


I want to briefly touch on fishing politics. We can manage fisheries from this place. We can manage them from here. I was part of a political party that managed fisheries in the Northern Territory. Way back in the day, if we put an Aboriginal and a commercial fisherman in a paddock and threw rocks at them, everybody in the Northern Territory would vote for us. But I tell you, it did not do much for the management of fisheries. It was not useful at all. I would urge all those involved in this debate to simply allow this to be left to the scientists. If you have a question with the science, if it is a question about the validity of it, if it is about 'have not had enough time', I would be the first person to say we need seriously to consider the precautionary principle and go back and look at that particular element. I know Senator Whish-Wilson has called for further consideration and that in the future we might go and do these things. Perhaps I do not know enough about the issue, but I am certainly concerned that this is simply a delaying tactic and that this will never happen. It is a real boat, there is a real quota, it is a real fishery and there is a real protein need in Africa. I have not heard in the debate that there is a particular piece of an element of the science that is flawed or that the scientists do not know enough about it or that somehow the application of the precautionary principle is not there. I suspect this is a reaction after recreational fishermen have come to you and said, 'Look, this is going to cause fish depletion.' And I am sure they have but, frankly, local recreational fishermen—I love them; I am one of them; I have bred them—probably are not quite as switched on to the science as the scientists are. I think we should leave this to science and we need to really think about the fact that a super trawler is actually a super-efficient trawler.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:14):  A few months ago Seafish Tasmania announced that they would be bringing the super trawler FV Margiris into Australian waters and the super trawler would seek to fish there. The super trawler is proposed to be based out of Devonport in Tasmania and has caused deep community concern throughout our state.


We have never had a factory ship super trawler fish in Australian waters before. Tasmanians are concerned about the environmental impact that the Margiris will have on our fish stocks now and for generations to come. The super trawler, as I understand it, is unlike anything that has ever operated in Australian waters. The Margiris is a 142-metre midwater trawler and weighs nearly 10,000 tonnes. It can process over 250 tonnes of fish a day. It has a cargo capacity of 6,200 tonnes. It is being brought here by Seafish Tasmania, which has secured an 18,000-tonne quota for jack mackerel, blue mackerel and redbait—key prey fish which help to sustain populations of the larger animals like southern bluefin tuna, fur seals, dolphins and other marine animals and birds. The Margiris will tow a 300-metre-long net through the waters above the bottom of the ocean. The catch will be frozen whole and most, as I understand it, will then be exported to West Africa.


So what has happened? In response to community concern the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, established a working group, inviting ENGOs, recreational fishing groups and Seafish Tasmania to be part of a group to try to reach an agreement on the super trawler. Of course, the ENGOs did not participate in the working group. The minister established the working group as a means of bringing the company and the community together on a set of additional voluntary measures regarding the operation of the FV Margiris. No outcome was reached and, on exiting the working group process, TARFish CEO Mark Nikolai issued a media statement. I will read some of that:


Reviewing the Small Pelagic Fishery science has heightened our concerns and raised more questions without answers.


Mr Nikolai went on to say:


Recreational fishers call on Minister Ludwig to not allow industrial scale fishing operations to occur in the Small Pelagic Fishery and address the significant public concerns surrounding the risks of local area depletion on fish stocks.


I attended a number of rallies in Hobart in July and August with Senator Lin Thorp which were organised by Tyson Clements, Martin Haley and Neil Clark. Rallies were held around the state. At the rallies we attended we heard the concerns of the recreational fishers and the local community. Many of the main issues were centred around spatial management, the science and, indeed, the science as it relates to the vessel—the size of the trawler and the impact this will have on the local ecosystem. Recreational fishers, game fishers, tuna fishers, tourism operators and conservation groups have been very active and vocal in calling for sound spatial management to ensure that our fishing stocks are a resource that is not just for ourselves but also for our children and our children's children.


We also need to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on our local ecosystems. Indeed, there are concerns regarding the science and how it relates if the volumes are being taken by one large vessel. This super trawler is a size we have never seen before and it throws up a number of questions that I believe were not thought of when the science was last done. It is also worth noting that, due to the important place small fish such as redbait and jack mackerel have in the food chain, there are concerns about the impact on local ecosystems that could occur through overfishing of these species.


At the rally in Hobart Senator Lin Thorp and I accepted a petition on behalf of Julie Collins, the member for Franklin. We also raised the concerns. After that meeting and at the rally we indicated quite clearly to the people who attended the rally that we would go back to Minister Ludwig—indeed, to the Prime Minister's office—and raise the concerns that were given to us at those rallies and at meetings that we held privately with TARFish and other fishing groups.


Last week I was among a group of parliamentarians—Senator Whish-Wilson was there as well—on the Parliament House lawns to view a petition of 35,000 signatures. It was a massive petition. This petition was later presented to Minister Ludwig and has been tabled in the Senate. The size of this petition again highlights the enormous community concern about the FV Margiris across Australia. Minister Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, Lin Thorp and I have also asked the federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Tony Burke, to intervene on the super trawler on environmental grounds. Minister Burke has himself stated his concerns regarding the FV Margiris and highlighted that super trawlers pose new issues for fishery management.


I believe we must see this issue resolved quickly. I am unconvinced of the safeguards that are in place to ensure our local ecosystems are not impacted by the super trawler. Consequently, I am of the view that the FV Margiris should not be here. Senator Whish-Wilson, I know, has genuine concerns about the long-term future of the Tasmanian fisheries. What we—Minister Collins, Senator Thorp and other members of the caucus—have been doing is using avenues available to us to address the valid concerns of our community that we share to deal with the super trawler now and, I hope, into the future.


So, while a disallowance motion is one tactic that can be used, I believe this motion is really nothing more than a gesture, but an empty gesture because it will not succeed and does nothing to address the issues we are facing. It does not address the issues in the long term that we are currently facing. Senator Whish-Wilson even talked in his own motion about the quota being reissued and the like. Anyway, I believe that the action that Senator Thorp, Minister Collins and others have taken in briefing the Prime Minister's office about the real concerns of the recreational fishers and the Tasmanian community, and working with the appropriate ministers to raise these concerns and awareness of the issues, is the best way to resolve this issue. Do I want the super trawler here? No, I do not. Do I think this motion is the best way to proceed? No, I do not.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-08-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:23):  I rise to support this disallowance motion, and I put on the record that, yes, this will succeed if people vote for it. What we are seeing here is a doubling of the quota without scientific support to show the super trawler will deplete our local fish and also take bycatch, which I will address in a minute. But I also go back to the science that Senator Scullion was talking about. He was waving around the Commonwealth Small Pelagic Fishery: general background to the scientific issues report, and he quoted from it. I am aware that Senator Whish-Wilson also quoted from it, but I put in context Senator Scullion's quote. He quoted the first bit of an important point when he said:


Localised depletion is evaluated as unlikely with the proposed harvesting fractions applied in the SPF because most small pelagic species—


and Senator Scullion articulated that. But he left off the important bit:


However given uncertainties about detailed movement patterns of several of the species targeted in the SPF, it would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion. This is consistent with global scientific advice on best practice for managing such species.


Of course, there is not the appropriate data to do a proper risk assessment on the likelihood of localised depletions occurring, and there is not any adequate information on the movement of target species in the region. That is also from scientific papers. So, on this issue that we will just have to rely on the science, that paper is saying we need more information.


We are particularly concerned about the impact that this super trawler will have on our fisheries in Australia. I will point out here that there has been some mention of whether this super trawler is subsidised and whether it is getting subsidised for this action. The fact is that, to operate, this super trawler has to be, has been and is subsidised by the European Union. Whether it is being subsidised to actually operate in our waters is important to know but is not the full story. The fact is that to exist it needs a subsidy. If it is being subsidised to exist, it is therefore being subsidised to operate in our waters.


It is very important that we deal with this quota issue, and it has highlighted the science arguments around our fisheries and the fact that we do not have as much information about our fisheries as AFMA would have us think. If this gets passed, it will send a clear message that we need better management of our fisheries and we are not prepared to support massive super trawlers—in this case the second biggest in the world—to come and fish in a rapacious manner in our waters. As I think other people have said, this super trawler is a game changer in the way we manage our fisheries in Australia, and that is why you are finding fishers, conservationists and industry standing up around Australia—particularly focused in Tasmania—to say no to this sort of fishing in our waters. Australia has in the past claimed that we have some of the best-managed fisheries in the world, and I have in this chamber acknowledged that also, for some fisheries. But this clearly demonstrates that we cannot just rely on our so-called reputation as being among the best fisheries managers in the world. We need to demonstrate that on the water as well.


I know that Senator Whish-Wilson has articulated some of the key issues, but I particularly want to focus on the issues around bycatch and point to what happened in New Zealand, where they have had some issues with the super trawlers there. The New Zealand government experienced difficulty in effectively enforcing fisheries regulations in their well-managed fisheries, and it should provide us with a very sobering lesson about the realities of super trawlers and the way they operate. Recently a local New Zealand company chartered Korean super trawlers to fish New Zealand waters, with observers from the New Zealand government on board. However, the observers were unable to monitor the whole ship the whole time. Catches were done when the observers were either asleep, on the other side of the boat or looking at something else, and the quota apparently was surpassed. As with many super trawlers around the world, the New Zealand experience has ended in legal action and is a very sorry example of the impact that super trawlers can have.


Have we learnt from this experience? It looks as if we may not have when we go back to the issue of bycatch. Apparently we are supposed to believe that this massive, great, big ship will move on when it sights a dolphin, but we have no assurances that this boat will have enough observer coverage to even flag that there is a dolphin there, without contemplating the issue of whether the ship will, in fact, move on or not. I draw attention to our most recent experience in Australia around bycatch, and that is the South Australian experience with sea lions. As we know, AFMA has had to close trawl fisheries in South Australia because of the question of bycatch. I also need to acknowledge that my colleague Senator Wright put a lot of effort into following up this issue. In fact, in this very chamber she raised questions about it. When they started looking at observer studies in that fishery, they identified that 374 sea lions were dying in 18 months.


They also uncovered a further 56 dolphin deaths. Because they started looking, they actually worked out what was happening in that fishery. There were attempts to deal with that, and what has had to happen is that they have had to close some of those fisheries. AFMA had to take decisive action in that case because it was clearly demonstrated that there was adverse impact on bycatch. We are now talking about a boat that is much bigger and which has had a lot of other trouble dealing with bycatch in other areas.


I think that super trawlers have earned a bad name because of their impacts on local depletions and because of their impacts in other countries. In the past 15 years 20 super trawlers off the west coast of Africa are estimated to have killed in bycatch 1,500 critically endangered turtles, 18,000 giant rays and 60,000 sharks. And you can bet your bottom dollar that that number of deaths is adding to what we already know about the low stocks of sharks globally. As a result of this sort of behaviour by super trawlers in West Africa, Senegal has recently banned all super trawlers. Just like New Zealand, they have learnt their lesson the hard way.


Why does Australia have to learn its lesson the hard way? Surely we should be learning from the experiences of our neighbours and from experiences elsewhere? We know that our fish stocks are plummeting globally. Why does Australia have to contribute to that? Why are we so determined to allow that to happen in our waters? We have held ourselves high, saying that we are some of the best fisheries managers in the world, and now it seems like we are coming down to the lowest common denominator with a super trawler that is subsidised to exist.


We have always said, 'No, we shouldn't be doing that,' and yet now we are facilitating the entry into our waters of a super trawler that is subsidised—




Senator Feeney:
  Who subsidises it?




Senator SIEWERT:
  The European Union does. I do not know if you were here a bit earlier, Senator Feeney, when I was saying that whether it is being directly subsidised to operate in our waters or not—to exist—that boat has the potential to come into our waters. It is subsidised to do that. If it were not for European subsidies this super trawler would not be able to operate anywhere. It has to have that to exist.


We are talking about a game changer here. On Radio National this morning we heard that if this season is successful we can expect it to stay. This is not a once off; this is a game changer for the way we manage our fisheries in this country. We are saying that it is okay for massive, great big super trawlers to come into our waters and fish hundreds of tonnes of fish at a time. It is a super trawler that can go into a local area and scoop up all those fish. Not only are those fish important as far as recreational fishers are concerned but other industry players are also concerned that this will have an effect on our ecosystems and other fish species in those ecosystems. We need to think about what we are doing here.


We need to think about why there was a doubling of the quota to enable this super trawler to come into our waters. The background paper that was released yesterday by seven fisheries scientists concludes with this statement, 'It would be prudent to distribute catches to minimise the chance of local depletion'. We do not know what impact this is going to have on our fish species and we do not know what impact it is going to have on local depletions. We do know that fish stocks around the world are at risk and that we have tried hard to get an adequate and good management system in this country—and I am not about to stand here and say that I think it is perfect, because I have said on other occasions that it is not. But it is certainly better than in a lot of other countries. So instead of maintaining that standing and building on it, what we want to do is join the common denominator and let this sort of operation happen in our waters.


I have to say that it is a strange experience to be in the position where rec fishers are lobbying us to oppose something. I have not had that experience too often, I have to say, other than that there are a group of rec fishers who see the benefits of marine protected areas and the way that they operate to help fish stocks—and I am not going to go over that argument here. So I am not saying that we have not worked with rec fishers in the past, but it is fairly unusual for rec fishers to be lobbying us to oppose something like this. It is the same with the broader commercial industry; that is also unusual.


So there has to be something—and I will use it, pardon the pun—'fishy' about this particular proposal if there are so many stakeholders that are opposed to this particular proposal. We need to be operating under the precautionary principle in our management of our fisheries. Any definition of the precautionary principle would say that you do not allow this sort of massive fish-gathering implement to operate in our waters when it will lead to local depletions and when we do not have the science. We do not know what impact it will have.


The science report that people are now holding up as saying that it supports it does not. It does not say it is okay to go ahead. We should be operating under the precautionary principle. We should not allow this material—




Senator Colbeck:
  It actually does. You are misrepresenting the science, as usual—no respect for science.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I hear the coalition across the chamber saying that we are no respecters of science. It is we who have been looking at the science around marine protected areas. It is we who have been looking at that.




Senator Feeney:
  What about climate change science?




Senator SIEWERT:
  Exactly! Do not lecture me about not looking at the science.




Senator Colbeck:
  Read the paper and give it its due!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Senator Siewert, ignore the interjections.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I will take your direction, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I will ignore them.


This approach is not good enough. We should not be doubling the quota and we should not be allowing that super trawler to operate in Australian waters. We have too much to lose: our fisheries are too much to lose by allowing this operation to happen in our waters.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (18:37):  I have had some quite instructive conversations with Senator Whish-Wilson in respect of this issue. We have sat down on a couple of occasions and had a discussion about it. But I have to say that Senator Siewert's contribution was, quite frankly, reminiscent of some of what her state colleagues have done in whipping up fear and frenzy around this issue and causing a large amount of the concern that exists in my home state of Tasmania and in other places, I might add, with absolutely irresponsible rhetoric around this particular issue. I recognise the concern that exists in my home state of Tasmania and I have had conversations with the recreational fishermen myself. I have sat down with them and we have been through the issues and I think that we understand our issues and I understand their concerns around localised depletions. 


As for the paper that came out yesterday, about eight weeks ago when this process started I went to some scientists and said, 'We would like you to publish something. We would like you to put something together that gives some information to the community around this,' because I have to say, the government's approach to this has been dead-set hopeless—absolutely dead-set hopeless. Going and talking to the Prime Minister achieves nothing. This does achieve something, because it provides some information to the community. 


I am really disappointed, Senator Siewert, in your misrepresentation of what is said. I have read the report. Senator Whish-Wilson read the same half of the paragraph out that you read and Senator Scullion read the other half of the paragraph, so when you put them together, you get the actual picture. As Senator Scullion said, here we have seven of the most respected marine scientists in small pelagics in the world. Professor Sainsbury has just spent two weeks at the United Nations FAO on small pelagics, lecturing on this—and I will come to that later in my contribution. These people are highly respected, and to misrepresent their writings as you have done is quite disgraceful. 


I am going to quote a part of the introduction. It says:


Several groups of scientists worldwide, including from CSIRO and IMAS, have recently examined the effects of fisheries on small pelagic species (also sometimes called forage fish) and how they should be managed so as to avoid undesirable flow-on effects of these fisheries on the food web and ecosystem.


Very important, because it comes to the issues that Senator Brown talked about. It continues:


There is now clear and widely agreed understanding about how these fisheries should be managed, and this understanding has a strong scientific basis—


That is the introduction to this paper. So suggestions that the science is not known, that there are doubts about the science, is complete rubbish. This is a very well-studied fishery and it is very well studied globally, and there are a number of papers that I will cite as part of the discussion here today that actually talk about it. So the rhetoric that the Greens have been going on with and the misrepresentation particularly by Paul O'Halloran, the member for Braddon in Tasmania, and Mr Kim Booth, the member for Bass in Tasmania, have been quite outrageous. It has whipped people into a frenzy. I have had people in my office who say that they cannot sleep at night because of the concerns that have been raised. They come in and quote the lines that the Greens are running out in Tasmania.


As Senator Brown said, and I agree with her on this point, this motion will not necessarily achieve anything. This is a typical Greens process—delay, delay, add cost, try and make an industry or a business unviable by applying additional cost to the business. They have done it in the forest industry and they do it in a whole range of other industries. They have said they are going to target the mining industry—same toolkit, same process. They demonise the industry, they destroy the reputation of the business, and then they cause delay after delay after delay, which increases costs and therefore makes the project financially unviable. That is their strategy. That is the strategy that is being used here. As Professor Sainsbury says:


The demand that there is scientific knowledge about the detailed local movement dynamics of fish stocks is an example of the approach that we must know everything about everything before we can do anything.


That is the way that the Greens operate—'unless you know everything'. But we know that science continues to evolve, and we should continue to invest in science so that we get a good outcome, and we must continue to improve our fisheries management. Not only do we say that we are a good fisheries manager, we are globally benchmarked as being a good fisheries manager. According to the fisheries research reports, the 2008 volume, as far as sustainability is concerned, Australia ranks second in the world.


Mr Burke this morning on Radio National made some quite extraordinary statements. He has actually redefined the issue of localised depletion. He is now talking about seals and dolphins and, quite extraordinarily, albatross. I have not seen an albatross 100 metres deep in the water. I have talked to the industry and to the owner of the vessel, who have fished with this method in this fishery previously—so we are not talking about a new process; it has occurred before—using very similar equipment. Mr Burke is now talking about localised depletions in a way that is different from what everybody else who has been talking about it understands. 


The paper that was released by those seven scientists yesterday actually deals with the issue of localised depletion. On top of that, the company is offering a move on provision to deal with the concerns of the local fishermen—quite responsibly. They are not necessarily required to do it; the fishery is already spatially managed. You just cannot go to the east coast of Tasmania, for example, and take fish. It already has some spatial management around it, and he is offering more. There is a huge opportunity. 


I was really disappointed when I heard that the recreational fishing sector had removed themselves from the discussions last week, as I said to you this morning, Senator Whish-Wilson, because we lost an opportunity to work with the recreational sector, those who are concerned, to do some more science around the issue of how we move around the fishery and how the fish move within the fishery. The offer is on the table. In fact, if you go back to the proposal that SeaFish put over nine months ago to gather new science, that was part of it. If you go back and do that research, that was part of their proposal months ago: to do some more research on the movement of the fish around the fishery so that it was better understood.


There was an opportunity that the recreational fishing guys could have taken to do that. I can understand their lack of confidence in the way the government has managed this—I sincerely can. The government should have said there is a shortage of information or there needs to be a compilation of information. That could have been put on the table. We all know that they were asking for it as part of the talks, but they were told it was not there. It has come out afterwards because somebody else asked for it.


Minister Burke said this morning he now accepts the science. He said on Radio National, in respect of localised depletions: 'I accept the science of that absolutely. The question then becomes whether those volumes, if taken by one vessel using these particular fishing methods, throw up anything that was not contemplated when the science was last done. That is the issue where I think it is quite responsible that questions be checked and checked through very thoroughly, and I am still waiting for some work to come back on that.'


Minister Burke, when he was minister for fisheries between 2007 and 2010, actually presided over the drafting of the small pelagics plan. On the very first page of the small pelagics plan, which was initially put out in 2008 and updated in 2009, it says:


there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


That is in the Small Pelagic Fishery Management Plan that was issued twice under Minister Burke when he was minister for fisheries. I am not sure what he was doing back then and whether he was moving a motion of no confidence in his role as a fisheries minister when he was there or whether he was just trying to find ways to intercede in this particular issue now, which I have to say I think is the case because, in my view, Minister Burke is completely out of control on a number of issues. But that is his record in this particular matter: he presided over the management plan that suggested a large trawler might be part of the deal back in 2008 and 2009. So for anybody in government to be suggesting that this is a huge surprise is quite outrageous.


I want to go now to the question of global fisheries and how they are managed. I mentioned that Professor Sainsbury was involved in some work in Europe and for the United Nations recently. I go to a piece of science that was issued back in April this year by the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force. I want to talk about how that works and how our Small Pelagic Fishery Management Plan is established. In the small pelagic fisheries globally, the practice has been to fish down to 20 per cent of the biomass—that is, to take out 80 per cent. That has been the global practice until recently. What this report recommends is that the minimum remaining amount of biomass is doubled to 40 per cent. That is what they observe. The task force also talk about making allowance within that 40 per cent that is to remain for all the other species that forage on the small pelagics—it recognises that they are an important part of the food web.


When we come to the Australian Small Pelagic Fishery Management Plan, where is it set? We say you can take a maximum of 20 per cent. So Lenfest says double it from leaving 20 to leaving 40. We say leave 80, and that is with the most up-to-date science. We then overlay another precaution where we say: as the science decays so does the quota, by 2½ per cent per annum, and when you get to a certain stage you go to a tier-2 level, which has to be below 10 per cent. Where is it set right now? It is set for jack mackerel and blue mackerel at less than 7½ per cent and for redbait at 10 per cent.


So the frenzy that has been whipped up around this, around the science and the level of the quota and the sustainability of the quota, I think is quite outrageous. As Senator Scullion mentioned, there is a small pelagic fishery in South Australian state waters, in a very confined area, that takes 34,000 tonnes per annum. It is well studied. Its impacts are well understood. It does not have impacts on localised depletion and all of the other important marine mammals that are around it because we have a very precautionary approach to the way that we set our quotas and we take into account the importance of these species in the food chain. But nobody has been prepared to say that. Nobody has been prepared to put that important information on the table as part of this debate. All we have had is hysteria and innuendo and claims that will denigrate the name of the business that is operating in this fishery. I think that is an absolute disgrace. We saw that again in the Tasmanian parliament where the press release put out by the Greens does not even reflect the motion that was passed in the house today in Tasmania. Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:51):  In the parliamentary break in July I had the extraordinary opportunity to travel to Dharamsala, the exile capital of Tibet, with my colleague Senator Waters as part of an Australia Tibet Council delegation. The Australia Tibet Council supports this exchange as a way of assisting members of parliament to understand more deeply the situation of the Tibetan people. Tibet lies within Chinese territory, amongst the peaks of the Himalayas, and is home to people with a deep and important connection to their culture and their home. Tibet has over 2,000 years of written history and, prior to occupation by China, existed as an independent sovereign state.


Tibetan identity is built on a foundation of profound spirituality and the leader of the Tibetan Buddhist religion, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, is known and revered the world over.


Tragically, the leadership and the culture it represents has been systematically undermined by an occupying regime. Since China asserted its authority in the region in 1949 the loss of life, property and significant sites of heritage—for example, more than 6,000 monasteries have been destroyed—has been equalled only by the corresponding loss of liberty, freedom of expression and culture. China has falsely imputed motives of violence and separatism to His Holiness in order to justify targeting Tibetan culture and has pursued a deliberate strategy of Chinese immigration and militarisation in order to subsume the local population.


Under Chinese rule, teachers and religious leaders require permission to practise and are typically subject to forced re-education. Local language is totally delegitimised. The everyday commerce and movement of residents in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, is subject to intense surveillance and, as the Prime Minister in exile of the central Tibetan administration, Dr Lobsang Sangay, explained when he was in Australia a short time ago, it is impossible for ordinary citizens to express their deeply-held spirituality without fear of arrest, torture or even disappearance.


Since last year 49 Tibetans have taken the extraordinary step of setting themselves alight in order to highlight the oppression of their people and to assert a level of control over their own destiny. These self-immolations are not just acts of desperation; they are acts of political expression. Indeed, according to Dr Sangay, the self-immolations are somehow an assertion of freedom: 'You can restrain my freedom but I can choose to die as I want.' That a people should feel that their form of death is the only avenue for expression is an indication of the gravity and urgency of the situation in Tibet. Australia has a longstanding position of recognising China's sovereignty over the Tibet Autonomous Region. But the principles of liberty, freedom of speech and expression, and security of heritage that the Tibetan people seek are universal standards. Unfortunately, for many the only option, in order to openly practise their culture, is to seek refuge in the exile capital, Dharamsala, located on the other side of the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh in India. It is a city above the clouds on the slopes of the Kangra Valley, not easily reached by either the southern or the northern approach. It has, however, become home to the exiled government that represents Tibet.


I had the privilege of learning about traditional Tibetan Buddhism and meditation at the Gyuto monastery and meeting his eminence the Karmapa. We also met with the director of the Tibetan Nuns Project, Mrs Rinchen Khandro, at the nunnery at Sidphur and learned of her work and the support given to Tibetan nuns. The new reception centre for new arrivals seeking asylum, which has been funded by the US Congress, provides refuge and the necessary medical attention for new arrivals. Many arrive with frostbite and other injuries after enduring a journey across the Himalayan ranges to get to a place of freedom. The records revealed that from 1991 to 2004 the centre had hosted a total of 42,634 new arrivals from Tibet, more than half of whom were children and young people under the age of 25. Yet I was informed that since 2008, the time of the Olympic Games in China, the military presence had increased dramatically in Tibet across the borders and in the streets, which has led to a reduction of new arrivals at the reception centre in Dharamsala. Nevertheless, while there I was able to talk to some new arrivals, who had only been there a day, about their journey, their hopes and their ambitions now that they were free. Many had never had any formal education and had left their families behind for a future where they could be free to live out their lives.


What Tibetans are doing every day in India is really what they should be able to do in Tibet and what we all take for granted—that is, to keep their culture alive and practise their art, language and religion. I am so pleased the Indian government has provided support and the opportunity for Tibetans to educate their people so that they are able to learn their language and culture, and practise their art through the Tibetan Institute for Performing Arts and Norbulingka in Dharamsala.


The Tibetan Children's Village is a remarkable achievement, with a number of students going on to become Rhodes scholars and leaders all over the world. In 1959, the Dalai Lama recognised that so many orphaned refugee children, separated from their families, would need a centre to care for and educate them. The TCV today houses, cares for and educates thousands of Tibetan children and it was indeed an honour to be able to meet them. Its mission is to ensure that all Tibetan children under its care receive a sound education and cultural identity and become self-reliant, contributing members of the Tibetan community and the world at large. I certainly believe that is being achieved at the TCV.


Not only did we met with the Tibetan parliament in exile, we also met with civil society—a number of Tibetan NGOs, including the Tibetan Youth Congress, the Tibetan Women's Association, Students for a Free Tibet, Gu-Chu-Sum and the National Democratic Party of Tibet. Given the experience of the Tibetan people, it is perhaps no surprise that civil society has thrived when it has been allowed to. All of these organisations are run by passionate, dedicated individuals. 


I am pleased that Australia continues to highlight the question of Tibet in the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. However, China has recently closed entry to the region and refused a request from Australian officials to visit there and neighbouring Sichuan province. At the same time, under the guise of maintaining stability, 3,000 new troops have entered Tibet, with soldiers standing on the street corners and outside people's homes.


Ultimately, the Tibetan character is one of humility, gentleness and hopefulness. Each person I met in Dharamsala is imbued with a powerful conviction that democracy will outlast authoritarianism and Tibetan culture will once again thrive in the open air of their homeland. I sincerely hope that Australia and the world can continue to contribute to that worthy aim of making China understand that with power comes responsibility to all members of the human family.
