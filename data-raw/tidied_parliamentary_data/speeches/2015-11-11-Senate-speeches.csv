Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  As a point of clarification, I just want to confirm that we are discussing the second amendment that was put up by the Australian Greens yesterday evening. Is that the amendment we are discussing at the moment?



The CHAIRMAN:  There is no amendment before the chamber at the moment. It has not been moved.




Senator DASTYARI:
  There is an opportunity that this Senate has before it, this morning, to pass what can potentially be a very good piece of legislation. As those of us on this side of the chamber, certainly in Labor, have previous said, we are very supportive of the bill that the government has put together, the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015. However, we have felt and continue to feel that with some small, minor amendments this bill can be improved. Frankly, this is not the ideal bill. It is not the bill that I would have put forward. It is not the bill that I would have said is the perfect and right bill. But there are some opportunities here to make a few amendments and some small amendments that will be able to improve the bill.


One of the great opportunities is an amendment that has not yet been moved by the Australian Greens. That amendment is looking at being able to restate and put in some of the measures as they relate to tax transparency and making sure that a handful of very large, very powerful, private corporations are not able to hide behind their own structure. Let us be clear here: this is not mum and dad small businesses. These are some major entities. These are some of Australia's largest businesses, and we are talking about businesses that have revenue of over $100 million a year.


In the past few days we have seen an expose where a small, pretend astroturf group took the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for a ride. We found that the representations being made were being put together by a small group of paid lobbyists who were pretending and purporting to represent the broader community. Heath Aston from the Sydney Morning Herald should be congratulated for his expose of this matter and the demonstration of which all of us need to be conscious—that, while we in this chamber go through our committee process, understandably, senators, Senate staff and the secretariats of our various committees will and should work on the principle that the information being presented to them and the witnesses coming before them are genuine. 


What was so disappointing here was that we were all taken advantage of; we were all given a false assessment. It showed that there is not a groundswell of opposition to this information being published. There is a small group of incredibly wealthy, powerful individuals who have structured themselves as private family companies for tax disclosure purposes and who do not want this information out. They are prepared to pay large amounts of money to lobbyists to create pretend organisations, pretend grassroots movements. This was exposed because the phone number that was on the end of their submission turned out to be the law office which also happened to be where this group was registered, which also happened to be one of the other submitters in this process. We found that a con job was being perpetrated against the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. That expose changes some of these material facts.


I think the Australian Greens amendment goes a long way to making sure that there is greater disclosure and greater transparency. Let us be clear: it means that information that has already been collected and gathered by the Australian Taxation Office would be disclosed. This is not any additional burden on the ATO; this is information they already have, information they have already collected, information they were anticipating they would be disclosing in December. If the Australian Greens were to move their proposed amendment, that is what it would do if it were passed.


Minister, does the government believe there is an opportunity, through different amendments, to improve this legislation? Has the government had an opportunity to sit down and have a look at these amendments? Furthermore, Minister, has the government been talking to crossbenchers and other parties about ways this bill could be improved?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (09:38):  As has already been canvassed in relation to the Greens proposed amendment, colleagues would be aware that on 15 October the parliament passed a bill to amend the legislation that directs the Commissioner of Taxation to publish confidential taxation information of Australian controlled private companies. The government introduced the amendment because publication of the taxation information of these companies would have effectively disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and suppliers. 


It is important to note that the amending legislation has no impact on the comprehensive powers of the Commission of Taxation to require companies to produce any information that is relevant to making an assessment of their tax liability. The public disclosure of tax information at law will continue to apply to multinational enterprises operating in Australia and to Australian public companies. The government has made clear that every company, indeed every taxpayer, must pay the right amount of tax and, to that end, has tightened the thin capitalisation laws applicable to the amount of interest that may be deducted. It has introduced new legislation to tackle tax avoidance by large multinationals. 


The government is focused on ensuring that the Commissioner of Taxation has all the powers he needs to ensure multinational companies pay taxes on profits earned in Australia. As has been made clear, the government will not be supporting the Greens amendment.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (09:39):  It is ridiculous to make the point about hiding behind commercialisation; if the information is made available those companies would then be subject to attack by other companies, they would have all of their financial affairs on the record. No-one is suggesting that. These are very tight laws that require disclosure, and if that was the case then it would apply to a publicly listed company as well—but it does not. What I want to hear is why there is a difference between a publicly listed company and a privately listed company as to the proper disclosure of the information. The argument has been simply a broad-brush approach, and if that argument were true then it would also apply to publicly listed companies so that they should not have their annual report, their information, their financial affairs listed because it would somehow be available to their competitors and they would then be short-changed in the market and not have the ability to progress whatever deals they were doing. Of course it does not stop publicly listed companies from doing all of those things properly and appropriately in the marketplace. 


We want to see proper transparency, but this government does not like transparency—it hides behind, now, a new corporate veil to disguise its position because it wants to hide the big end of town. That is the short answer; that is the true answer. I do not think, with respect, that the argument progressed by the minister holds water. If it did hold water, and if that point was valid, why was it passed in first place and why were they going to be compliant with that? I think the piper has been paid the money and the big end of town has said 'Be sure to play this tune.' The government is hiding behind some very loose rhetoric. In any event, it is long overdue that these issues are being dealt with appropriately and properly in this place.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (09:42):  I concur with the remarks made by Senator Ludwig, particularly in relation to raising issues about transparency. That is why Labor has been calling for so long for action by this government to bring legislation like this to the parliament so that we can have more transparency and this government can stop hiding the big end of town away from tax payments and more broadly deal with the issue of tax avoidance. Why has Labor been doing this and why are we here today at this point? We are here because we live very much in a globalised world, a digitised world, a world where our economy is constantly changing, where multinational companies can move their profits from country to country and as a result avoid paying their fair share of tax. Labor has been calling for more action on multinational tax avoidance for over two years. It was six months or maybe even longer than six months ago that we laid out our own package—a package of $7.2 billion to close these tax loopholes and keep revenue here in Australia. You would think the government would think that was a good thing. 


Now that we are going into the detail of this bill, it would be helpful if the government made it clear that they are going to pursue this kind of tax reform under a principle of transparency and accountability of those large multinational companies so that they start paying their fair share of tax and so Australian small businesses and individuals are not left picking up the slack. That has been the reality up until now. Why should Australian small businesses, of which there are a plethora, and individuals end up picking up the slack whilst these large multinational companies that are making massive profits get away with tax avoidance? 


I would like to know, as Senator Ludwig referred to, how the government is going to tighten Australia's tax net in relation to the transparency principle. I think that is the most important thing here, other than, obviously, this legislation passing, multinational companies paying their fair share of tax and this issue of profit-shifting being tackled. I am really pleased that we are now doing this after the couple of years or more that it has taken to get to this point.


I would like to know in some detail how that transparency principle is going to be part of the government's agenda, its approach, as it goes forward in dealing with this issue and this reform. My understanding is that something like three of the five biggest companies in the world are companies that make their money primarily on the basis of intellectual property. If that is the case—I would imagine that could be the case, because we are very much living in a digitised world economy, so those issues could be seen as being part of that—is there is any focus by this government on those particular multinationals? We are talking about intellectual property being an important component of the Australian economy and the rights of small businesses and the like. Again, this goes to the heart of the issue of transparency. It also shows the complexities involved in relation to multinational companies and how they have managed to profit shift for all these years.


I am no expert when it comes to the tax avoidance workings of multinational companies, but I am aware that these issues have been looked at in other countries in great detail. The UK is a good example of that. Australia is not immune to multinationals behaving in this way. It is happening right across the globe, because that is the nature of a globalised economy and that is the nature of these particular large companies and the way that they make their profits, unfortunately. We all bear the brunt of that; we miss out in the process of that.


As I said, without that greater transparency, we will never know whether these major companies, these major corporations, are paying their fair share of tax. The government has started a whole new debate in relation to raising the GST and is particularly looking at everyday, individual Australians, including low-income individuals, because it is a regressive tax that affects everybody. Why is it doing that? It is looking at whether all taxpayers are contributing their fair share. You cannot raise that kind of argument—'Let's look at our tax base, our tax system and whether Australians are paying their fair share'—and, at the same time, allow all of these large multinationals to profit shift and not make their own contribution. This is an issue of transparency. It is a really important that transparency becomes one of the most effective tools for this government to combat profit-shifting and tax avoidance by these multinationals. 


It is my hope that the government not only shows a commitment to ensuring that these major corporations pay their fair share of tax but also pushes transparency laws—that this government does not gut our tax transparency laws but instead stands by them. That would serve not just the interests of good governance—although that would be a start—but the interests of all Australians, who would be benefit from knowing exactly what is going on with tax avoidance by large multinationals. That is something they certainly would not know at this point in time. I ask the minister to outline, as Senator Ludwig has already alluded to, how the government is going to stand by the principle of transparency rather than continuing to hide the big end of town on this issue of multinational tax avoidance.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-11,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:50):  Evidence was heard by the Senate Economics Committee that up to a thousand of Australia's biggest privately owned companies would be exempt from providing information—basic information. I remind the Senate what that information is. We are not asking for much. We are asking for the ABN and the name of the company; we are asking for total income for the income year; we are asking for taxable income or net income, if any, for the income year; and we are asking for income tax payable, if any, for the financial year. That is it. That is what we are asking each of these thousand companies to provide. It is not much. As Senator Xenophon discovered, if you go to ASIC, you get a lot more information than that—you get a thick file of consolidated accounts for all these companies. But what we want is a register that is publicly available, a net that captures all these corporations—because some of them we do not know about. It is hard to seek the information you want from ASIC if you do not know of their existence. The ATO should know of their existence, but that is not, as we discussed yesterday, in the realm of the public debate. Minister, who lobbied you or your government to bring in the original exemption? Have you had any direct discussions with the Family Office Institute of Australia?

That is all we were asking for. I find it hard to believe that that is something that you, the coalition, decided was necessary for the public interest—and I underline the words 'public interest'. Someone must have lobbied the government or Liberal MPs to bring in this exemption. I find it hard to believe that you suddenly woke up one morning and, while shaving and looking in the mirror, decided this was a good exemption to bring to the Senate. All of us in here are a bit smarter than that and we know how it works. Which wealthy individual or business—or which front companies for wealthy individuals—lobbied the government. We know they have astroturfed our Senate recommendation. Unfortunately, to our detriment, we let that happen. But who lobbied you to bring this in, Minister?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:56):  This is a significant matter of public interest, beginning a transparency process around potential tax avoidance, and it is not to say that these 1,000 companies are avoiding tax. But we have all agreed that the evidence we have heard through the committee and elsewhere is that transparency is a good place to start. Minister, if you had presented an argument perhaps today or previously that it was a significant amount of red tape for the ATO to construct this register or for these businesses to comply, then maybe that would be a reasonable argument as to why the coalition might decide to put up an amendment to shield wealthy individuals from providing transparency around their tax affairs. But, as we have discovered, go to ASIC—$38—and it is already there in comprehensive information. So how is it an issue to simply have a register of companies, with the ABN and name, total income for the year, taxable income or net income, if any, and income tax payable? In fact we have looked at the potential costs in the legislation and they are not very big. So what is the argument? Why can we not have a register, if that is what the public want? 


We heard yesterday from second readers and in committee about the big coalition across this country, not just the Tax Justice Network, which constitutes dozens of community groups and social enterprises and those who want to see this country move in the right direction around good public policy. They want to see parliament taking some action. This is actually a really simple place to start. It is not a silver bullet—I totally agree with that—but it is an easy place to start. I still do not get why you brought the legislation forward in the first place, because there is no reasonable argument. We have dismissed the kidnapping theory. Senator Conroy did a very good job on that last night. He has seen this kidnapping theory come up before. We have dismissed that as being an issue, because motivated kidnappers can access the information anyway and there are lots of other things that could potentially trigger kidnapping. Having these four sets of data on a register is a long bow. We have now dismissed, I think quite thoroughly, the idea that this could affect commercial in confidence for corporations in their commercial spheres, because this information is available anyway through ASIC. In fact it is a lot more comprehensive if you go to ASIC. This is a matter of setting up a simple public policy and giving the community what they ask for—and actually it is not a big ask. 


I still do not feel I have an adequate explanation from the minister as to why the government brought this legislation forward in the first place. Can you explain to us here and now why it is in the public interest to shield wealthy individuals from providing transparency around their tax affairs, please?

 (Tasmania) (10:00):  I just have a follow-up to that. I ask the minister to respond to that same question, as I was looking for the public good justification for shielding wealthy individuals from providing their tax affairs. The minister just responded by saying that they respected the confidentiality and they thought that was an important aspect for taxpayers. Do you accept there is also a very compelling case for transparency and disclosure being a strong disincentive for potential tax avoidance, especially around reputational risk? I will let the minister know, if he is not aware, that the evidence that the Senate committee heard on this issue was that disclosure is the first important step to take in providing disincentives to individuals and to companies to avoid tax, because they will get caught out. Senator Dastyari calls it a name and shame register. But I am not saying that these individuals and these companies are actually avoiding tax. I will say, as I said yesterday, if they have done nothing wrong, they have got nothing to hide. So what is the issue? Why not disclose? It is confidentiality on the one hand—respecting the confidentiality of wealthy individuals—and on the other hand we have a compelling argument for policy in the public interest that provides disclosure and a disincentive for tax avoidance. Can the minister please say where she feels the balance of evidence in this argument lies and where the public good component of your policy is?

Senator Bushby, who I understand was part of that committee, also has indicated to me that one of the important things about preserving confidentiality—and I think the ATO also said this, although I am going on what Senator Bushby has indicated to me—is that it ensures that maximum tax is paid and provides confidence in the system. In a former life when I was at the Australian Government Solicitor, I did my fair share of acting for the Commissioner of Taxation. It is very important that the Commissioner of Taxation has available to him or her all the powers necessary to ensure that all taxpayers pay the appropriate amount of tax.

 (Queensland) (10:04):  I want to just touch on a different issue. It goes to the question of the revenue to be collected by this bill. We know that the budget papers have indicated a series of asterisks in relation to the government's projections as to what revenue this bill is going to generate, and this is in contrast to the Labor approach, which is, I think, a real attempt on our part to adopt a bipartisan position on the issue of multinational corporate tax avoidance. I think you would agree, Minister, that it is unprecedented for an opposition to come forward with a series of revenue measures in advance of a budget being handed down. It was an opportunity for the government to look at what Labor had put forward, and when you examine what was put forward it was a properly costed proposition. It was a $7.2 billion package, and it went to a range of issues: changes to the arrangements for how multinational companies claim tax deductions, greater compliance work by the ATO to track down and tackle corporate tax avoidance, cracking down on multinational companies using hybrid structures to reduce tax, and improving transparency and data matching. So Labor took our approach to the PBO, and we were able to come up with some credible estimates as to what the impact of those measures would be. I know that the government has not done that work up to now.


My question is: has the government in recent times had Treasury look at this issue? Is there any more information you can provide to the Senate in terms of what impact the government's measures will have in the future? If that work has not been done, can you please explain why not?

What I was putting to you was that the Labor approach was that we have come up with some measures to address the issue of multinational corporate tax avoidance, we took those measures to the Parliamentary Budget Office, and there was the ability there to provide some credible estimates as to what impact the Labor measures would have.

There has been a lot of pejorative language used in here this morning such as about providing exemptions for 'rich' taxpayers and things like that. Is it not the case that the only exception that relates to the law that they are talking about is the exemption that was introduced by the previous Labor government and that was an exemption to the principle of taxpayer confidentiality, singling out a group of taxpayers and exposing them to a level of scrutiny that is normally protected for taxpayers? Is it not the case that the bill that was passed recently actually reversed that exception and that if there is an issue in terms of any particular class of taxpayers not paying what is considered a fair level of taxes then that is a problem with the law as it applies, given that the tax office indicated at the inquiry that they are entirely confident that they have all the information they need to ensure that the taxpayers in question are meeting their legal obligation to pay taxes and that if there is a need to change anything then that requires a change of law?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:45):  The Greens will be moving an amendment, and I understand that there are other amendments that will come before the chamber. Before we move on, I would still like to ask the minister the question that I did not get an answer to from the previous ministers. I ask whether the minister has met with the Family Office Institute Australia, which presented to the Senate committee around the transparency bill that the Greens will be moving an amendment to and whether the minister thinks that kind of activity—that kind of astroturfing, with a front group being set up with no members and presenting to a Senate committee on behalf of who knows—is acceptable.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (11:46):  I put on record that we are talking about a piece of legislation that is going to implement a new multinational anti-avoidance law. What we are talking about here today is a bill, proposed by this government, that is going to put in place stronger penalties for large companies that engage in tax avoidance and profit shifting. What we are talking about today is a bill that is going to put in place additional responsibilities. But Senator Dastyari and Senator Whish-Wilson come in here and, for some reason, continue to filibuster. It is my understanding, Senator Dastyari, that you actually support this legislation—but you continue to filibuster.


Can we be realistic? In terms of the substance of the amendments that Senator Whish-Wilson has already been debating today, I understand that we, as a Senate, have already debated the substance of these amendments when we passed a previous piece of legislation, the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015, only a few weeks ago. You know our position on these amendments. You know our position on the bill. Can we please stop wasting the Senate's time, because there are other pieces of legislation that need to be debated? I do not think there is any disagreement at all in relation to the intent of this bill and what we are all, I would hope, collectively seeking to ensure, and that is, of course, that multinational companies who are profiting in Australia pay tax. The government's position is very clear. The government's position on the amendments is very clear. Senator Whish-Wilson, I do not think I can help you any further in relation to this debate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:48):  We have made it very clear, Senator Cash, that the Greens will be moving an amendment to bring back what was lost in the Senate a few weeks ago. I am sure you are aware of the debate that we have been having now for several hours. That is not about big multinational corporations, billion-dollar-plus corporations and new disclosure laws and powers to the ATO to help the commissioner with this issue. We support that issue, and we were very clear about that in our speeches in the second reading debate. We will be bringing forward an amendment to replace the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015. That was defeated in the Senate a few weeks ago. I will be moving an amendment to this bill. I am not officially moving it yet, Chair, but I will be. We have all been discussing it. That is the context of my questions.


One of the things that has come to light, for your information, Senator Cash, since that piece of legislation was passed in the Senate is that an investigative journalist has discovered that one of the key witnesses who provided evidence—evidence which senators have admitted in this chamber influenced their decision on how they voted—turned out to be a front group called the Family Office Institute Australia, which was set up with no members to present to the Senate committee to support a coalition bill that effectively shielded privately owned companies from increased transparency. We are trying to get that transparency back. We think that this is a significant matter of public interest. It has been promoted to all of us, as senators, by various groups and organisations over the years, like the Tax Justice Network, as a good way of starting to help combat the problem of tax avoidance.


That is the context of the question I asked. My question was fairly simple: have you met with the Family Office Institute Australia or any of its registered members? This is the group that astroturfed the Senate, in the sense that it ran a campaign to support government removing these transparency laws. Do you believe it is acceptable that a few special interests can come together like this and essentially con the Senate and the Senate committee that this is somehow supported by a large number of individuals or businesses that do not see this legislation as being in their interests?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (11:51):  The answer to your question as to whether I have met with these people, is no. In relation to the actual organisation, my understanding is that what they were referring to does not necessarily have anything to do with this particular piece of legislation. In relation to people being able to present views, anybody is entitled to present a submission to this parliament, to a Senate committee, and it is for the committee to decide, whether or not, based on the rules of the Senate, they accept that particular submission.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-11,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:52):  I will briefly try to put this debate into perspective. That may be of assistance to the chamber and the 33 people listening in on News Radio right now—maybe 34, or 35 at a stretch! Senator Whish-Wilson has done a tremendous amount of work on this. The Australian Greens have not yet moved his amendment. The amendment proposes a repeal of a bill that was passed several weeks ago. I indicated at the time that, to quote Lemony Snicket, there was a series of unfortunate events where the debate was truncated. It was not a conspiracy. It just happened that I did not get to speak in time, I did not get into the chamber on time. Other colleagues were not here in time and the vote went through. It almost never happens like that, but it did happen on this occasion.


The outcome would have been the same: the bill would have gone through. The concern I have, which relates to the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Whish-Wilson, is whether there ought to be a disclosure requirement on private companies with a turnover of $100 million or more a year. I voted with the government that they should be exempt for this very reason: the reason put to me in private conversations was that in the food and grocery sector, where you effectively have a duopoly of Coles and Woolworths controlling something like 75 per cent of the $100-plus billion grocery market in this country, companies with turnover of $3 million or $4 million a year—that is their revenue but their profit margins will obviously be much, much lower than that; they might be making only $3 million, $4 million, $5 million or maybe $10 million a year—would be put at a competitive disadvantage in negotiations with Coles and Woolworths if they had to disclose that information.


I thought there was something in that argument. I gave an undertaking early on to the government to support them—perhaps I gave that undertaking too early—and some of the people who have put their concerns to me in respect of this. I think there was some merit to that argument. But there was absolutely no merit to the 'kidnap' argument given by the government. Frankly, it was ridiculous to suggest that these people would be at risk of being kidnapped by giving this information. That information is effectively the revenue, the taxable income and the tax paid by a company in an easy to access format. The idea that they would somehow become a kidnap risk is, frankly, ridiculous. And the proof is in the pudding: there was no advice given by the Australian Federal Police or any other law enforcement agency in relation to this. The kidnap argument was farcical, nonsensical; it had no credibility.


But I thought there was something in the argument about the $100 million turnover—that if you are a food processor releasing this information may somehow make you more vulnerable and compromise your negotiations with someone 'up the food chain' who has greater economic power. To put that in perspective, what we are talking about is information that can be obtained. I did my bit—and I hope the minister is pleased to hear this—to reduce the government deficit by $38 this morning when I charged to my Visa credit card $38, payable to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to get a copy of the financial statements and reports of Teys Australia Pty Ltd. Now, I am not picking on them. They are a great Australian company involved in meat processing and abattoirs. They are a large Australian company and a family owned business. And they were good enough in the course of this debate to set out their objections. They did not do it behind an astroturfed front group—and the astroturf was not even green on this group; it was pretty parched. If there was ever a drought look astroturf, this is what the Family Office Institute Australia, or FOIA, is—and maybe their acronym should be 'PHOOEY!', because what they provided to us was barely adequate. I thought they represented many, many private businesses—but they had no members!


You can spend $38 at ASIC to get this information. Let's put this in context. There is a reporting requirement. If you are a business that has revenue of more than $25 million a year—not $100 million a year but $25 million a year—you are required to provide financial statements and reports to ASIC. So there is already an even lower threshold that applies. Looking at my copy of the Teys Australia Pty Ltd financial statement report, which I obtained for $38 this morning, it includes at page 5 a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Their profit and loss statement sets it all out. At page 6 is a statement of their financial position as at 30 June 2014 and their current tax liability. I do not need to read out the amount but it sets it out in black and white. Further along, at page 24, there are all sorts of assumptions and details in relation to their tax, their revenue and the like—very comprehensive information. Page 24 sets out their income and the income tax that is paid and payable.


The information is already there. So I do feel somewhat misled by the argument that was put up for this bill in the first place. But I will still buy that part of the argument that having this information easily and readily available may in some circumstances compromise the negotiations of these companies—although presumably, given what is available for ASIC for $38, you get a hell of a lot more information in relation to this. So I wonder whether this amendment is not so much a storm in a teacup—it would be unfair to characterise it that way—but about trying to make it easier for information to be provided publicly about these companies. We can still get that information because of the ASIC requirement that any company with $25 million or more in revenue needs to provide some pretty comprehensive financial statements.


The reservation I have in relation to Senator Whish-Wilson's proposed amendment, which has not yet been moved, is there may be, in some circumstances, an issue of potentially prejudicing that company in negotiations. It is not a strong argument, but I can see the argument in certain circumstances. In order to keep faith with those companies that I think had a genuine concern about this,—although, I now wonder whether their concerns were misplaced—if there were an amendment along the lines of a company being able to say to the tax commissioner, 'We don't think you should release this because it could significantly prejudice our commercial negotiations,' that is the path that I would like to go down. I want to keep faith with the government on the intent of the bill, in terms of private companies, but I think their arguments have been quite weak. Some of them have been farcical in terms of kidnapping.


I think there is a way through this in order to deal with this. But, again, I emphasise to the 34 people listening on NewsRadio, what we are arguing about is the access of this information. If you want detailed information, you can get it anyway through ASIC for $38. It just means that the information is easier to get, even though it is at a much lower level—three lines of information in terms of taxable income and actual tax paid, or revenue and the taxable amount and the amount of tax paid. So that is pretty minimalist, but I think that there might be some circumstances where companies may want the assurance that the information is not publicly released so easily. Although, if you really want to dig around for it, you can get it through ASIC for $38. I am not sure if there will be further amendments moved in relation to this. I would like to think that there is a compromise possible in respect of this.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (12:02):  This is the same issue that I raised earlier with—




Senator Cash:
  With a different minister.




Senator LUDWIG:
  a different frontbencher, from whom I am still waiting to get a reply. So I take issue with your criticism that this is a filibuster. The filibuster is from your side, Senator Cash. I do not know how many frontbenchers who have had carriage of this piece of legislation.




Senator Cash:
  Duty ministers.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I would like one who knew something about it, and then who could pass the information back as requested. Then we could get on to the substantive amendments. The issue raised by Senator Xenophon I raised as well. The answer given by Senator Fifield said that the reason that they can reduce from 1,000 to 200—in other words, only publicly listed companies—was effectively what Senator Xenophon had said, absent the kidnapping. He did not throw the kidnapping one in; I would not have taken much stock of that issue. The answer given was that the exposure of their financial records in the public domain could allow competitors to gain an advantage by being able to trawl through their profit and loss statements, or whatever might be available. Senator Xenophon, much better than I, encapsulated the argument that most of this information—if not more if it, as it would be available through payment of $38 on the ASIC register—could be obtained in any event. An astute company wanting to assess and look at another company would also, similarly, be able to examine ASIC—as I am sure they would—to establish the financial position of that particular company.


This is the first time I have heard this. I am minded to the position where, just as in the share market world of public listed companies, if there is an issue such as an offer or a takeover in the wind, they generally report and suspend trading. It is the same concept—I think Senator Xenophon is looking for a compromise—where, logically, if there were a concern by a particular company that they were ripe for a buyout, a sell-out, a takeover, or whatever it might be, or if they were going to be troubled in the market by a competitor, then they might be able to make a prima facie case for the removal of their name from the register during that period or for a period of time. It would be a logical thing to do. I did not follow the argument put forward by Senator Fifield at the time that it is simply a case of, 'You don't need the register with all of those people on it because of this issue.' The truth is that you can deal with the issue in a more substantive way and still have an appropriate threshold. You do not need an unbelievable threshold, which really only lists into a very small number of companies. What you want to achieve in any legislation that you are bringing forward is a wide and fair application of it so that you do fairly capture all of those companies that you are required to. I am still waiting for the response to that. I am sure I will obtain it now.


Before we get into the substantive amendments, the second issue I wish to raise to get a response for is: in the 2015-16 budget relating to multinational tax avoidance, I want some assurance about the package going forward as to the time line or how it will be rolled out. Other elements in the 2015-16 budget related to the developing of a public tax transparency code to complement country-by-country reporting, which is being developed by the Board of Taxation. What is the time line on that? Will that be a draft? Will it be publicly released? Is there a release date available for that? Also, the same goes for the implementation of treaty abuse rules developed by the OECD and which aim to address the exploitation of tax treaty rules by multinationals to avoid taxation. Will there be a draft? What consultation will be undertaken to give that effect, and is there a time line for that?


Thirdly, I refer to the antihybrid rules developed by the OECD to address the issues of multinationals claiming a tax deduction in one country but not paying tax in another because of different tax rules. Will those antihybrid rules be open for draft consultation? Although they are called rules, will they be regulations which are disallowable and come here, or will they effectively be guidelines or rules used by the tax department? If they are the latter, will they be promulgated or open or draft and able to have some input into them from the various institutes that have an interest in how they would operate, and what is the time line for the implementation of those rules?


Fourthly, in regard to exchanging information with other countries about harmful tax practice and preferential tax deals, the same applies there. Will they be either regulations or rules? Rules obviously would not come here. If they are regulations, will they be disallowable? Following on from that, is there a draft or a consultative process that will surround the development of those practices, and what is the time line that might be associated with that?


Fifthly and lastly, there is the issue of a GST on digital products and services imported by Australian consumers. This would help level the playing field between domestic and international suppliers and ensure that all suppliers pay a fair share of tax. The same goes for that particular one, and it comes from the 2015-16 budget relating to multinational tax avoidance. With a GST on digital products, how would you determine whether or not a GST should be applied to a particular product and, if so, on what basis? What is the broad definition that you are going to use in respect of digital products and services? If a like service is already GST-free, will there be a determination that that particular service would then be subject to a new GST? Will there be a consultative process surrounding the definition of digital products and services and what is the time line for the implementation of that?


It is a good measure which I support. What I would like to ensure is that, in bringing about the level playing field between domestic and international suppliers, all suppliers do pay their fair share of tax. But, ultimately, I would like to ensure that it is brought in in such a way that it does not disadvantage Australian consumers and it does not create red tape for businesses in Australia—and thereby create not a level playing field, in fact, because you have effectively brought in a compliance regime or red tape that surrounds the implementation. 


The broader issue for individuals is that, in doing all of this, there is some view expressed or at least considered that you are then not implementing a raft of red tape for business that they would then have to comply with, particularly given that this government continually trumpets the view that it is a remover of red tape. I would not like to see business suffer significant red tape around the implementation of those measures. I suspect that that will be hard to achieve because much of the implementation will require some regulatory burden and some guidelines, rules and legislation. But, ultimately, in considering all of that, do it in such a way as to be mindful of the minimisation of red tape on business. 


I do take issue with your accusation that it is a filibuster. You have got a couple of minutes. I really do want answers to these questions. This is the opportunity for senators to ask questions about the legislation, and that is exactly what I am doing.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:12):  I have a couple of concerns about this whole bill. The first concern is that it so obviously erodes public confidence because it makes our tax system not as transparent. The biggest concern that I have—and we heard from Senator Xenophon earlier in regard to this and from Senator Ludwig—is this concept of kidnapping, this concept that if big businesses have to report then there is the chance that they or their families might be kidnapped. I do not want to make light of this at all, because kidnapping is obviously a very serious issue. But when the ATO gave evidence during the inquiry that one in five private companies earning over $100 million do not pay any tax and the government is supporting that—that seems to be the whole emphasis behind this bill—then I think that the people of Australia have the right to understand that it is just a furphy. It is just a ridiculous argument. When asked about that particular area of concern, the AFP, the ATO and the Attorney-General's Department could not give any evidence about that happening. So my first question is: where did that evidence come from? If you are going to use the argument of kidnapping, where is the official evidence? Where did that come from?


When people are kidnapped, most of the time there would be a ransom involved and, to me, the only people being held to ransom here are the low and middle income earners of Australia, who pay their fair share of tax. But if you are in one of these companies earning $100 million then the government will find any excuse for you not to have to pay your fair share of tax. It is absurd and it is absolutely logical. There is a complete lack of evidence behind the absolutely clumsy defence of this bill. We know there are few supporters of it. So my question to the minister is: where is the evidence of that? Who actually gave evidence? How did you get that evidence? You cannot just stand up and say that. And also: how do you respond to these comments in general that are being given by other senators?


Just before I sit down, in regard to the 'filibustering' comment: what an absurd comment to make. You come in here, you put up these proposals and you give us the most illogical arguments to defend them. As Senator Ludwig said, he is still waiting for an answer to his question. I have been sitting here through this debate, and I have not heard any logical or believable answer about the kidnapping concept. I really seriously would like to know: where did that evidence come from?




Senator Ludwig:
  That's a weird one!




Senator BILYK:
  It is absolutely weird, Senator Ludwig—and not just weird, but absolutely bizarre, and quite an insult to the intelligence of low and middle income Australians who, as I said, are paying their fair share of tax and expect that big businesses should too.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-11-11,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:16):  I have to say, Senator Ludwig, yours—I will pay you a compliment—was an exceptionally eloquent filibuster. Senator Bilyk, unfortunately, I cannot say the same to you, but I will pick up one comment that you made—albeit that I am almost indulging your filibuster, and I disappoint those listening to this debate by doing so. Senator Bilyk, in your opening statement, you said that this bill currently before the Senate 'erodes public confidence'. I think that I and the hardworking citizens of Australia are going to disagree with you on that point. Let me tell you why. The bill—for the benefit of those who are listening in on broadcast—that is currently before the Senate is the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015. I would have thought—and I think the Australian people, quite genuinely, themselves would have thought—that, when a government brings in a law that is all about combating multinational tax avoidance, which is all about ensuring that multinationals that have activity in Australia pay tax in Australia, that would be a good thing. I would have thought that, but, clearly, I am wrong, because Senator Bilyk, as I said, has clearly stated, on the Hansard, that this is a bill that erodes public confidence.


Let me also tell you a little bit more about the bill, because, again, I do not believe that this is a bill that erodes public confidence. In fact, I believe—as does the government and as do, I would say, the Australian people—that this is a bill that is going to ensure that Australians can continue to have confidence in our taxation system.


What do we know? As a government, we know that some multinationals are artificially structuring to avoid Australian tax by booking revenue from Australian sales offshore. What that means is that they have an unfair advantage over our local businesses and over families and small businesses, who have to shoulder more of the tax burden. What does that then do? It undermines the public confidence in our taxation system.


What does this bill therefore do? The Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill, if it is passed—and I would hope that this is a bill that is going to pass this place—will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to treat these large multinationals as though they have a taxable presence in Australia. What that will do is to ensure that they are subject to Australian tax. So, despite what we have heard, in, as I said, the very eloquent filibuster by Senator Ludwig, this is a good piece of legislation and it should have the support of the parliament.


As to the amendment that I understand will be moved by the Australian Greens and to which Senator Ludwig has been referring: Senator Ludwig, my instructions are that you have already asked this question a number of times—and that is fine; as you rightly say, you are entitled to do that. But you have already been provided by relevant ministers with an answer to your question. I am happy, though, to again provide you with the information in relation to your question.


I am instructed that, on 15 October—and that is why, apparently, this amendment is going to be moved—parliament passed a bill to amend the legislation that directs the Commissioner of Taxation to publish confidential tax information of Australian-controlled private companies. The government introduced the amendment because publication of the taxation information of these companies would have effectively disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and to their suppliers. And, Senator Ludwig, it is important to note that the amendment has no impact on the comprehensive powers of the Commissioner of Taxation to require companies to produce any information that is relevant to making an assessment of their tax liability. The public disclosure of tax information law will continue to apply to multinational enterprises operating in Australia and to Australian public companies.


The government has made it exceptionally clear that every company and indeed every taxpayer must pay the right amount of tax. To that end, we have tightened the thin capitalisation laws applicable to the amount of interest that may be deducted, and we have introduced new legislation to tackle tax avoidance by large multinational groups.


Senators Whish-Wilson and Ludwig do make relevant points. If you are so concerned about this information—and I understand this has been said several times now in this chamber, and I believe Senator Xenophon also may have made the point—apparently you can purchase it from ASIC for $38. So, there you go.


Senator Ludwig, you also asked some questions about when these laws would commence et cetera. My understanding is that the Commissioner of Taxation is currently working with approximately 80 companies. The Commissioner of Taxation is waiting for this legislation to pass, so indeed that particular person is then equipped with these powers and can set about implementing the law. In answer to your question, the sooner we can pass this legislation and the sooner we can get it through executive council, the sooner the Commissioner of Taxation will be able to undertake what we believe is an important part of ensuring that there remains integrity within the Australian taxation system.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:23):  In the budget this year the government was looking at bringing in a voluntary corporate disclosure code. You may remember, Senator Cash, that the previous Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey, said:


The voluntary code will highlight companies that are paying their fair share of tax. It will also discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.


…   …   …


The Board of Taxation will provide a business and broader community perspective to the development of a voluntary corporate disclosure code.


The Government would like more companies, particularly large multinationals operating in Australia, to publicly disclose their tax affairs. In developing the code they will need to consider what information is disclosed and how it is disclosed.


This was said in May this year. The point being that the government was looking at a voluntary code.


You are bringing in a mandatory code for multinationals over $1 billion. When the Treasurer said 'the government would like more companies, particularly large multinationals,' why did you make the cut-off $1 billion, and what is wrong with applying standards of disclosure to companies of $100 million, because that is what we are trying to do in the Greens amendment. We are trying to provide a mandatory code for Australian and offshore companies over $100 million, and you have brought in a mandatory code for $1 billion. So, my questions are as follows. What is wrong with doing it for $100 million versus $1 billion? How did you determine that cut-off? Clearly you believe disclosure is important, otherwise you would not have made these comments. Also, what is the public good argument for not supporting disclosure for companies over $100 million.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:27):  With all due respect, I think we have determined that the information ASIC already requires these companies to lodge is significantly more detailed and comprehensive than what we are asking for. For your information, as you were not in the chamber a little bit earlier—as Senators Bilyk and Ludwig pointed out—in the Greens amendment with which we are seeking to bring back the better disclosure requirements, we are asking for four things: an ABN and name; total income for the year; total taxable income, or net income; and, income tax payable. This is only a fraction of what is on ASIC. So, in relation to your answer to me about this being about red tape, I fail to see how there can be any red tape involved with just asking for four simple things on a register, considering that the information is already available. The Senate looked at this when the bill was first introduced, and there was very little cost involved in bringing this in. This was looked at in 2013 by the Labor government and by various committees. We are not talking about a significant amount of red tape here. Could you please address that question?

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:29):  Minister, thank you for your not so complimentary comments about my questions! Even so, I think that they are very legitimate questions. The question was: where did the evidence come from? The argument was used by your side, so surely you can validate where the evidence came from that people could have a higher chance of being kidnapped if they were one of these businesses. Where does that evidence come from? In the inquiry the AFP, the ATO and the Attorney-General's Department could offer up no evidence, so you cannot come in here and make statements that are very dramatic—lots of amateur dramatics go on on that side—if you cannot back them up. I want to know: where did the evidence come from?


We see on that side, so often, that you can talk the talk but you do not walk the walk. We see it in every question time. There are people on your side who have to constantly prove which drama school they went to by their amateur dramatics. With all the puffing up of your chests and all the claims that it is a crackdown on multinational companies, just because it says it in the title of the bill does not mean that is what is happening. In this case, it is not happening. So where did the evidence come from in regard to kidnapping?

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:31):  I would remind Senator Bilyk that Labor is supporting this bill. Do not get too excited in your arguments against it. As has been stated several times in this debate—and perhaps if those on the other side had a little more experience in the real world of business they would understand—the government introduced the amendment that we are all referring to because publication of the taxation information of these particular companies would have, effectively, disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and their suppliers.




Senator Bilyk:
  Where does the evidence come from?




Senator Dastyari:
  That is just a lie!




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator Bilyk and Senator Dastyari, the minister has the call.




Senator CASH:
  The Senate, as I have stated, has already debated the substance of this amendment when it passed the tax and superannuation laws—




Senator Bilyk:
  I rise on a point of order, Temporary Chairman. The minister is not answering the question that is pretty simple. I have asked it a couple of times. Where did the evidence come from? Is there any evidence? Let me make it easy for the minister: is there any evidence?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Bilyk, there is no point of order.




Senator CASH:
  For the benefit of those in the gallery who have to endure this, and for those listening to broadcast, the good news is that I think there is only 12½ minutes left before we go to senators' statements. This has been canvassed time and time again. My understanding is that the Senate has already debated the substance of this amendment.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator Dastyari:
  You are misleading the chamber, Senator.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Bilyk and Senator Dastyari, the minister has the call. I have already said that there is no point of order. The minister is answering your question.





Senator Dastyari:
  I did not call a point of order.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  You are saying exactly the same thing as you did with your point of order. The minister is answering your question. Let her be heard.




Senator CASH:
  Again, as I said, the government introduced the amendment because publication of the taxation information of these companies would have, effectively, disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and suppliers. Because it appears that we are going to be going through until 12.45 pm, if I could perhaps take a few minutes, for the benefit of those in the gallery, and for the benefit of those listening to this debate on broadcast, to explain what we are, in fact, debating. We are debating multinational anti-avoidance law. This is all about ensuring that in Australia we have some of the strongest integrity rules in the world. That is something that, as Australians, we should be very proud of.


When we ascertain that there are multinationals who are artificially structuring to avoid tax being paid in Australia by booking revenue offshore from Australian sales, as a government we should do something about that. Why? Because, obviously, these companies have an unfair advantage over local businesses, over families and over small businesses, who end up shouldering the greater tax burden. What this ultimately does is to undermine confidence within the Australian taxation system. Again, it might surprise those listening and those in the gallery that the opposition do support this bill. You would not yet think that by the manner in which they are behaving, but they do support this bill. Before the end of today and perhaps before we go to senators' statements, given that this is a bill that is going to ensure that multinationals engaging in deliberate tax avoidance have to pay tax in Australia, I would hope that this bill does pass the Senate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:35):  I want to ask the minister another direct question, and this is a very genuine question. I am not filibustering at all. It is a very genuine question. When we looked at the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill it exempted Australian companies from a set of disclosure laws, but it kept—as the minister is aware—offshore companies under the same disclosure laws that were passed in 2013. Let me read this to you from the Parliamentary Library:


The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (TAA 1953) to provide an additional threshold before the Commissioner of Taxation is obliged to publish information about a corporate tax entity with a total income equal to or exceeding $100 million for an income year. The additional threshold to be met must be one of three alternatives:


• the entity is not an Australian resident that is a private company or


• the entity is a member of a wholly-owned group that has a foreign resident ultimate holding company or


• the percentage of foreign shareholding in the entity is greater than 50 per cent.


So we, in this country, have a law at the moment that demands foreign companies with subsidiaries in Australia meet these disclosure requirements if they are worth over $100 million. My question is quite simple. Why did we exempt Australian companies? What was the logic behind cutting out Australian companies and individuals with a net worth of more than $100 million? Why do we keep it on offshore companies and exempt Australian companies?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:38):  Perhaps I can have a crack at answering the question that you refuse to answer, Minister. The answer to the question, I think—and I am happy for you to correct the record—is that a group of very influential and wealthy people in this country lobbied the Liberal Party to have Australian corporations and individuals exempt from these laws. How is it that, six days after a Senate inquiry is announced into these laws, a front group gets it up in this country to help shield wealthy individuals and companies over $100 million from disclosing their laws—laws we have kept in place for foreign companies, but we have now exempted Australian companies. I think you have been lobbied quite hard—who knows, potentially by some of your donors—and that you have changed this law to suit them. I can see no public good reason why you would exempt Australian companies from these laws and keep the same laws for foreign corporations. We have heard no reason as to why this is in the public good.

 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:39):  Perhaps you do not need to hear it from me as to why this particular piece of legislation is in the public good, because I think anybody who read this legislation in relation to combating multinational tax avoidance would understand that it is within the public good. In fact, Senator Sam Dastyari summed it up himself in his speech in the second reading debate on Monday, 9 November. He said:


The former Treasurer should be congratulated for saying and doing many good things in this policy area.


He then said:


This is a bill that fundamentally addresses many important concerns around multinational tax avoidance.


…   …   …


We—


the Labor Party—


have been calling for more action on multinational tax for over two years. It is good to see that the government has actually come on board—


and, if you want to take a little bit of credit for the legislation, Senator Dastyari, that is fine—


with this legislation. 


If you do not want to believe from me, Senator Whish-Wilson, that this is a piece of legislation that is in the public good, please take it from your former coalition partners in the Australian Labor Party, the now opposition, from Senator Dastyari himself, that this is a good piece of legislation. He indeed compliments the former Treasurer for the work he has done in this area. Again, I would thank the Labor Party for the fact that they will be, despite the filibustering—




Senator Dastyari:
  It is a good bill. It just needs amending.




Senator CASH:
  It is a good bill, thank you, Senator Dastyari—supporting this legislation and therefore I believe it is in the public good. I would say that anything that ensures that multinational companies who are avoiding tax pay their tax in Australia is within the public good.

  I did not want to be disorderly in that respect, so thank you, Senator Bernardi. What I wanted to come back to were the three issues that I spoke to. I was seeking a legitimate answer to the questions that I raised. You answered the first one. Although I disagree with it, I am not going to continue to reiterate that question. It is an answer and it at least meets the courtesy that it was asked in. The second part of the series of questions I asked relates effectively to the BEPS 15 implementation. BEPS 15 is due to be put forward at the OECD in the next short while. The questions came out of 2015-16 budget. They have not been implemented yet, including the time frames for that. I could do it in a shorthand way and simply ask for the decision around how and when you are going to implement BEPS 15 post the OECD implementation. That is the short question to the issue I went to. I am happy for your advisors to go back and look at the transcript of the questions I asked and provide an answer to them at a later stage in the debate. I do not need them right now and I do not expect that you would have those readily at your fingertips.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  As a point of clarification, I just want to confirm that we are discussing the second amendment that was put up by the Australian Greens yesterday evening. Is that the amendment we are discussing at the moment?



The CHAIRMAN:  There is no amendment before the chamber at the moment. It has not been moved.




Senator DASTYARI:
  There is an opportunity that this Senate has before it, this morning, to pass what can potentially be a very good piece of legislation. As those of us on this side of the chamber, certainly in Labor, have previous said, we are very supportive of the bill that the government has put together, the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015. However, we have felt and continue to feel that with some small, minor amendments this bill can be improved. Frankly, this is not the ideal bill. It is not the bill that I would have put forward. It is not the bill that I would have said is the perfect and right bill. But there are some opportunities here to make a few amendments and some small amendments that will be able to improve the bill.


One of the great opportunities is an amendment that has not yet been moved by the Australian Greens. That amendment is looking at being able to restate and put in some of the measures as they relate to tax transparency and making sure that a handful of very large, very powerful, private corporations are not able to hide behind their own structure. Let us be clear here: this is not mum and dad small businesses. These are some major entities. These are some of Australia's largest businesses, and we are talking about businesses that have revenue of over $100 million a year.


In the past few days we have seen an expose where a small, pretend astroturf group took the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for a ride. We found that the representations being made were being put together by a small group of paid lobbyists who were pretending and purporting to represent the broader community. Heath Aston from the Sydney Morning Herald should be congratulated for his expose of this matter and the demonstration of which all of us need to be conscious—that, while we in this chamber go through our committee process, understandably, senators, Senate staff and the secretariats of our various committees will and should work on the principle that the information being presented to them and the witnesses coming before them are genuine. 


What was so disappointing here was that we were all taken advantage of; we were all given a false assessment. It showed that there is not a groundswell of opposition to this information being published. There is a small group of incredibly wealthy, powerful individuals who have structured themselves as private family companies for tax disclosure purposes and who do not want this information out. They are prepared to pay large amounts of money to lobbyists to create pretend organisations, pretend grassroots movements. This was exposed because the phone number that was on the end of their submission turned out to be the law office which also happened to be where this group was registered, which also happened to be one of the other submitters in this process. We found that a con job was being perpetrated against the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. That expose changes some of these material facts.


I think the Australian Greens amendment goes a long way to making sure that there is greater disclosure and greater transparency. Let us be clear: it means that information that has already been collected and gathered by the Australian Taxation Office would be disclosed. This is not any additional burden on the ATO; this is information they already have, information they have already collected, information they were anticipating they would be disclosing in December. If the Australian Greens were to move their proposed amendment, that is what it would do if it were passed.


Minister, does the government believe there is an opportunity, through different amendments, to improve this legislation? Has the government had an opportunity to sit down and have a look at these amendments? Furthermore, Minister, has the government been talking to crossbenchers and other parties about ways this bill could be improved?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (09:38):  As has already been canvassed in relation to the Greens proposed amendment, colleagues would be aware that on 15 October the parliament passed a bill to amend the legislation that directs the Commissioner of Taxation to publish confidential taxation information of Australian controlled private companies. The government introduced the amendment because publication of the taxation information of these companies would have effectively disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and suppliers. 


It is important to note that the amending legislation has no impact on the comprehensive powers of the Commission of Taxation to require companies to produce any information that is relevant to making an assessment of their tax liability. The public disclosure of tax information at law will continue to apply to multinational enterprises operating in Australia and to Australian public companies. The government has made clear that every company, indeed every taxpayer, must pay the right amount of tax and, to that end, has tightened the thin capitalisation laws applicable to the amount of interest that may be deducted. It has introduced new legislation to tackle tax avoidance by large multinationals. 


The government is focused on ensuring that the Commissioner of Taxation has all the powers he needs to ensure multinational companies pay taxes on profits earned in Australia. As has been made clear, the government will not be supporting the Greens amendment.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (09:39):  It is ridiculous to make the point about hiding behind commercialisation; if the information is made available those companies would then be subject to attack by other companies, they would have all of their financial affairs on the record. No-one is suggesting that. These are very tight laws that require disclosure, and if that was the case then it would apply to a publicly listed company as well—but it does not. What I want to hear is why there is a difference between a publicly listed company and a privately listed company as to the proper disclosure of the information. The argument has been simply a broad-brush approach, and if that argument were true then it would also apply to publicly listed companies so that they should not have their annual report, their information, their financial affairs listed because it would somehow be available to their competitors and they would then be short-changed in the market and not have the ability to progress whatever deals they were doing. Of course it does not stop publicly listed companies from doing all of those things properly and appropriately in the marketplace. 


We want to see proper transparency, but this government does not like transparency—it hides behind, now, a new corporate veil to disguise its position because it wants to hide the big end of town. That is the short answer; that is the true answer. I do not think, with respect, that the argument progressed by the minister holds water. If it did hold water, and if that point was valid, why was it passed in first place and why were they going to be compliant with that? I think the piper has been paid the money and the big end of town has said 'Be sure to play this tune.' The government is hiding behind some very loose rhetoric. In any event, it is long overdue that these issues are being dealt with appropriately and properly in this place.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (09:42):  I concur with the remarks made by Senator Ludwig, particularly in relation to raising issues about transparency. That is why Labor has been calling for so long for action by this government to bring legislation like this to the parliament so that we can have more transparency and this government can stop hiding the big end of town away from tax payments and more broadly deal with the issue of tax avoidance. Why has Labor been doing this and why are we here today at this point? We are here because we live very much in a globalised world, a digitised world, a world where our economy is constantly changing, where multinational companies can move their profits from country to country and as a result avoid paying their fair share of tax. Labor has been calling for more action on multinational tax avoidance for over two years. It was six months or maybe even longer than six months ago that we laid out our own package—a package of $7.2 billion to close these tax loopholes and keep revenue here in Australia. You would think the government would think that was a good thing. 


Now that we are going into the detail of this bill, it would be helpful if the government made it clear that they are going to pursue this kind of tax reform under a principle of transparency and accountability of those large multinational companies so that they start paying their fair share of tax and so Australian small businesses and individuals are not left picking up the slack. That has been the reality up until now. Why should Australian small businesses, of which there are a plethora, and individuals end up picking up the slack whilst these large multinational companies that are making massive profits get away with tax avoidance? 


I would like to know, as Senator Ludwig referred to, how the government is going to tighten Australia's tax net in relation to the transparency principle. I think that is the most important thing here, other than, obviously, this legislation passing, multinational companies paying their fair share of tax and this issue of profit-shifting being tackled. I am really pleased that we are now doing this after the couple of years or more that it has taken to get to this point.


I would like to know in some detail how that transparency principle is going to be part of the government's agenda, its approach, as it goes forward in dealing with this issue and this reform. My understanding is that something like three of the five biggest companies in the world are companies that make their money primarily on the basis of intellectual property. If that is the case—I would imagine that could be the case, because we are very much living in a digitised world economy, so those issues could be seen as being part of that—is there is any focus by this government on those particular multinationals? We are talking about intellectual property being an important component of the Australian economy and the rights of small businesses and the like. Again, this goes to the heart of the issue of transparency. It also shows the complexities involved in relation to multinational companies and how they have managed to profit shift for all these years.


I am no expert when it comes to the tax avoidance workings of multinational companies, but I am aware that these issues have been looked at in other countries in great detail. The UK is a good example of that. Australia is not immune to multinationals behaving in this way. It is happening right across the globe, because that is the nature of a globalised economy and that is the nature of these particular large companies and the way that they make their profits, unfortunately. We all bear the brunt of that; we miss out in the process of that.


As I said, without that greater transparency, we will never know whether these major companies, these major corporations, are paying their fair share of tax. The government has started a whole new debate in relation to raising the GST and is particularly looking at everyday, individual Australians, including low-income individuals, because it is a regressive tax that affects everybody. Why is it doing that? It is looking at whether all taxpayers are contributing their fair share. You cannot raise that kind of argument—'Let's look at our tax base, our tax system and whether Australians are paying their fair share'—and, at the same time, allow all of these large multinationals to profit shift and not make their own contribution. This is an issue of transparency. It is a really important that transparency becomes one of the most effective tools for this government to combat profit-shifting and tax avoidance by these multinationals. 


It is my hope that the government not only shows a commitment to ensuring that these major corporations pay their fair share of tax but also pushes transparency laws—that this government does not gut our tax transparency laws but instead stands by them. That would serve not just the interests of good governance—although that would be a start—but the interests of all Australians, who would be benefit from knowing exactly what is going on with tax avoidance by large multinationals. That is something they certainly would not know at this point in time. I ask the minister to outline, as Senator Ludwig has already alluded to, how the government is going to stand by the principle of transparency rather than continuing to hide the big end of town on this issue of multinational tax avoidance.

I remind the Senate what that information is. We are not asking for much. We are asking for the ABN and the name of the company; we are asking for total income for the income year; we are asking for taxable income or net income, if any, for the income year; and we are asking for income tax payable, if any, for the financial year. That is it. That is what we are asking each of these thousand companies to provide. It is not much. As Senator Xenophon discovered, if you go to ASIC, you get a lot more information than that—you get a thick file of consolidated accounts for all these companies. But what we want is a register that is publicly available, a net that captures all these corporations—because some of them we do not know about. It is hard to seek the information you want from ASIC if you do not know of their existence. The ATO should know of their existence, but that is not, as we discussed yesterday, in the realm of the public debate. Minister, who lobbied you or your government to bring in the original exemption?

Someone must have lobbied the government or Liberal MPs to bring in this exemption.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (09:55):  Again, I do not accept the premise of Senator Whish-Wilson's proposition, which is that there are particular individuals of greater than usual influence who are getting the government to do something that the government would not otherwise have done. It sounds like Senator Whish-Wilson is presenting a conspiracy theory that involves government, darkened rooms and individuals. That is the scenario that Senator Whish-Wilson is seeking to paint, and it is wrong.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:56):  This is a significant matter of public interest, beginning a transparency process around potential tax avoidance, and it is not to say that these 1,000 companies are avoiding tax. But we have all agreed that the evidence we have heard through the committee and elsewhere is that transparency is a good place to start. Minister, if you had presented an argument perhaps today or previously that it was a significant amount of red tape for the ATO to construct this register or for these businesses to comply, then maybe that would be a reasonable argument as to why the coalition might decide to put up an amendment to shield wealthy individuals from providing transparency around their tax affairs. But, as we have discovered, go to ASIC—$38—and it is already there in comprehensive information. So how is it an issue to simply have a register of companies, with the ABN and name, total income for the year, taxable income or net income, if any, and income tax payable? In fact we have looked at the potential costs in the legislation and they are not very big. So what is the argument? Why can we not have a register, if that is what the public want? 


We heard yesterday from second readers and in committee about the big coalition across this country, not just the Tax Justice Network, which constitutes dozens of community groups and social enterprises and those who want to see this country move in the right direction around good public policy. They want to see parliament taking some action. This is actually a really simple place to start. It is not a silver bullet—I totally agree with that—but it is an easy place to start. I still do not get why you brought the legislation forward in the first place, because there is no reasonable argument. We have dismissed the kidnapping theory. Senator Conroy did a very good job on that last night. He has seen this kidnapping theory come up before. We have dismissed that as being an issue, because motivated kidnappers can access the information anyway and there are lots of other things that could potentially trigger kidnapping. Having these four sets of data on a register is a long bow. We have now dismissed, I think quite thoroughly, the idea that this could affect commercial in confidence for corporations in their commercial spheres, because this information is available anyway through ASIC. In fact it is a lot more comprehensive if you go to ASIC. This is a matter of setting up a simple public policy and giving the community what they ask for—and actually it is not a big ask. 


I still do not feel I have an adequate explanation from the minister as to why the government brought this legislation forward in the first place. Can you explain to us here and now why it is in the public interest to shield wealthy individuals from providing transparency around their tax affairs, please?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:00):  I just have a follow-up to that. I ask the minister to respond to that same question, as I was looking for the public good justification for shielding wealthy individuals from providing their tax affairs. The minister just responded by saying that they respected the confidentiality and they thought that was an important aspect for taxpayers. Do you accept there is also a very compelling case for transparency and disclosure being a strong disincentive for potential tax avoidance, especially around reputational risk? I will let the minister know, if he is not aware, that the evidence that the Senate committee heard on this issue was that disclosure is the first important step to take in providing disincentives to individuals and to companies to avoid tax, because they will get caught out. Senator Dastyari calls it a name and shame register. But I am not saying that these individuals and these companies are actually avoiding tax. I will say, as I said yesterday, if they have done nothing wrong, they have got nothing to hide. So what is the issue? Why not disclose? It is confidentiality on the one hand—respecting the confidentiality of wealthy individuals—and on the other hand we have a compelling argument for policy in the public interest that provides disclosure and a disincentive for tax avoidance. Can the minister please say where she feels the balance of evidence in this argument lies and where the public good component of your policy is?

 (New South Wales—Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs) (10:02):  The government has focused on ensuring that the Commissioner of Taxation has available to him all the powers that he needs to ensure that multinational companies pay taxes and pay the appropriate amount of tax. Senator Bushby, who I understand was part of that committee, also has indicated to me that one of the important things about preserving confidentiality—and I think the ATO also said this, although I am going on what Senator Bushby has indicated to me—is that it ensures that maximum tax is paid and provides confidence in the system. In a former life when I was at the Australian Government Solicitor, I did my fair share of acting for the Commissioner of Taxation. It is very important that the Commissioner of Taxation has available to him or her all the powers necessary to ensure that all taxpayers pay the appropriate amount of tax. I think that is a general principle, and it is a principle that applies irrespective of who the taxpayer is.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (10:04):  I want to just touch on a different issue. It goes to the question of the revenue to be collected by this bill. We know that the budget papers have indicated a series of asterisks in relation to the government's projections as to what revenue this bill is going to generate, and this is in contrast to the Labor approach, which is, I think, a real attempt on our part to adopt a bipartisan position on the issue of multinational corporate tax avoidance. I think you would agree, Minister, that it is unprecedented for an opposition to come forward with a series of revenue measures in advance of a budget being handed down. It was an opportunity for the government to look at what Labor had put forward, and when you examine what was put forward it was a properly costed proposition. It was a $7.2 billion package, and it went to a range of issues: changes to the arrangements for how multinational companies claim tax deductions, greater compliance work by the ATO to track down and tackle corporate tax avoidance, cracking down on multinational companies using hybrid structures to reduce tax, and improving transparency and data matching. So Labor took our approach to the PBO, and we were able to come up with some credible estimates as to what the impact of those measures would be. I know that the government has not done that work up to now.


My question is: has the government in recent times had Treasury look at this issue? Is there any more information you can provide to the Senate in terms of what impact the government's measures will have in the future? If that work has not been done, can you please explain why not?

What I was putting to you was that the Labor approach was that we have come up with some measures to address the issue of multinational corporate tax avoidance, we took those measures to the Parliamentary Budget Office, and there was the ability there to provide some credible estimates as to what impact the Labor measures would have. I know that the government did not do this work prior to the budget. My question is: has the government asked Treasury recently to look at this in light of the opposition's package? We have had the capacity to put some figures—some dollars. I would like to know whether in recent times the government has done this work to look at what revenue is expected to be generated by the passage of this legislation. If the answer is, 'No, nothing's been done,' my question is: why hasn't anything further been done about it?

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (10:12):  I am wondering if the minister could clarify a couple of things. There has been a lot of pejorative language used in here this morning such as about providing exemptions for 'rich' taxpayers and things like that. Is it not the case that the only exception that relates to the law that they are talking about is the exemption that was introduced by the previous Labor government and that was an exemption to the principle of taxpayer confidentiality, singling out a group of taxpayers and exposing them to a level of scrutiny that is normally protected for taxpayers? Is it not the case that the bill that was passed recently actually reversed that exception and that if there is an issue in terms of any particular class of taxpayers not paying what is considered a fair level of taxes then that is a problem with the law as it applies, given that the tax office indicated at the inquiry that they are entirely confident that they have all the information they need to ensure that the taxpayers in question are meeting their legal obligation to pay taxes and that if there is a need to change anything then that requires a change of law? The actual bill that we are here today to discuss is, in fact, making an attempt to do that.

What we are talking about here today is a bill, proposed by this government, that is going to put in place stronger penalties for large companies that engage in tax avoidance and profit shifting. What we are talking about today is a bill that is going to put in place additional responsibilities. But Senator Dastyari and Senator Whish-Wilson come in here and, for some reason, continue to filibuster. It is my understanding, Senator Dastyari, that you actually support this legislation—but you continue to filibuster.


Can we be realistic? In terms of the substance of the amendments that Senator Whish-Wilson has already been debating today, I understand that we, as a Senate, have already debated the substance of these amendments when we passed a previous piece of legislation, the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015, only a few weeks ago. You know our position on these amendments. You know our position on the bill. Can we please stop wasting the Senate's time, because there are other pieces of legislation that need to be debated? I do not think there is any disagreement at all in relation to the intent of this bill and what we are all, I would hope, collectively seeking to ensure, and that is, of course, that multinational companies who are profiting in Australia pay tax. The government's position is very clear. The government's position on the amendments is very clear. Senator Whish-Wilson, I do not think I can help you any further in relation to this debate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (11:48):  We have made it very clear, Senator Cash, that the Greens will be moving an amendment to bring back what was lost in the Senate a few weeks ago. I am sure you are aware of the debate that we have been having now for several hours. That is not about big multinational corporations, billion-dollar-plus corporations and new disclosure laws and powers to the ATO to help the commissioner with this issue. We support that issue, and we were very clear about that in our speeches in the second reading debate. We will be bringing forward an amendment to replace the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015. That was defeated in the Senate a few weeks ago. I will be moving an amendment to this bill. I am not officially moving it yet, Chair, but I will be. We have all been discussing it. That is the context of my questions.


One of the things that has come to light, for your information, Senator Cash, since that piece of legislation was passed in the Senate is that an investigative journalist has discovered that one of the key witnesses who provided evidence—evidence which senators have admitted in this chamber influenced their decision on how they voted—turned out to be a front group called the Family Office Institute Australia, which was set up with no members to present to the Senate committee to support a coalition bill that effectively shielded privately owned companies from increased transparency. We are trying to get that transparency back. We think that this is a significant matter of public interest. It has been promoted to all of us, as senators, by various groups and organisations over the years, like the Tax Justice Network, as a good way of starting to help combat the problem of tax avoidance.


That is the context of the question I asked. My question was fairly simple: have you met with the Family Office Institute Australia or any of its registered members? This is the group that astroturfed the Senate, in the sense that it ran a campaign to support government removing these transparency laws. Do you believe it is acceptable that a few special interests can come together like this and essentially con the Senate and the Senate committee that this is somehow supported by a large number of individuals or businesses that do not see this legislation as being in their interests?

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:52):  I will briefly try to put this debate into perspective. That may be of assistance to the chamber and the 33 people listening in on News Radio right now—maybe 34, or 35 at a stretch! Senator Whish-Wilson has done a tremendous amount of work on this. The Australian Greens have not yet moved his amendment. The amendment proposes a repeal of a bill that was passed several weeks ago. I indicated at the time that, to quote Lemony Snicket, there was a series of unfortunate events where the debate was truncated. It was not a conspiracy. It just happened that I did not get to speak in time, I did not get into the chamber on time. Other colleagues were not here in time and the vote went through. It almost never happens like that, but it did happen on this occasion.


The outcome would have been the same: the bill would have gone through. The concern I have, which relates to the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Whish-Wilson, is whether there ought to be a disclosure requirement on private companies with a turnover of $100 million or more a year. I voted with the government that they should be exempt for this very reason: the reason put to me in private conversations was that in the food and grocery sector, where you effectively have a duopoly of Coles and Woolworths controlling something like 75 per cent of the $100-plus billion grocery market in this country, companies with turnover of $3 million or $4 million a year—that is their revenue but their profit margins will obviously be much, much lower than that; they might be making only $3 million, $4 million, $5 million or maybe $10 million a year—would be put at a competitive disadvantage in negotiations with Coles and Woolworths if they had to disclose that information.


I thought there was something in that argument. I gave an undertaking early on to the government to support them—perhaps I gave that undertaking too early—and some of the people who have put their concerns to me in respect of this. I think there was some merit to that argument. But there was absolutely no merit to the 'kidnap' argument given by the government. Frankly, it was ridiculous to suggest that these people would be at risk of being kidnapped by giving this information. That information is effectively the revenue, the taxable income and the tax paid by a company in an easy to access format. The idea that they would somehow become a kidnap risk is, frankly, ridiculous. And the proof is in the pudding: there was no advice given by the Australian Federal Police or any other law enforcement agency in relation to this. The kidnap argument was farcical, nonsensical; it had no credibility.


But I thought there was something in the argument about the $100 million turnover—that if you are a food processor releasing this information may somehow make you more vulnerable and compromise your negotiations with someone 'up the food chain' who has greater economic power. To put that in perspective, what we are talking about is information that can be obtained. I did my bit—and I hope the minister is pleased to hear this—to reduce the government deficit by $38 this morning when I charged to my Visa credit card $38, payable to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to get a copy of the financial statements and reports of Teys Australia Pty Ltd. Now, I am not picking on them. They are a great Australian company involved in meat processing and abattoirs. They are a large Australian company and a family owned business. And they were good enough in the course of this debate to set out their objections. They did not do it behind an astroturfed front group—and the astroturf was not even green on this group; it was pretty parched. If there was ever a drought look astroturf, this is what the Family Office Institute Australia, or FOIA, is—and maybe their acronym should be 'PHOOEY!', because what they provided to us was barely adequate. I thought they represented many, many private businesses—but they had no members!


You can spend $38 at ASIC to get this information. Let's put this in context. There is a reporting requirement. If you are a business that has revenue of more than $25 million a year—not $100 million a year but $25 million a year—you are required to provide financial statements and reports to ASIC. So there is already an even lower threshold that applies. Looking at my copy of the Teys Australia Pty Ltd financial statement report, which I obtained for $38 this morning, it includes at page 5 a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Their profit and loss statement sets it all out. At page 6 is a statement of their financial position as at 30 June 2014 and their current tax liability. I do not need to read out the amount but it sets it out in black and white. Further along, at page 24, there are all sorts of assumptions and details in relation to their tax, their revenue and the like—very comprehensive information. Page 24 sets out their income and the income tax that is paid and payable.


The information is already there. So I do feel somewhat misled by the argument that was put up for this bill in the first place. But I will still buy that part of the argument that having this information easily and readily available may in some circumstances compromise the negotiations of these companies—although presumably, given what is available for ASIC for $38, you get a hell of a lot more information in relation to this. So I wonder whether this amendment is not so much a storm in a teacup—it would be unfair to characterise it that way—but about trying to make it easier for information to be provided publicly about these companies. We can still get that information because of the ASIC requirement that any company with $25 million or more in revenue needs to provide some pretty comprehensive financial statements.


The reservation I have in relation to Senator Whish-Wilson's proposed amendment, which has not yet been moved, is there may be, in some circumstances, an issue of potentially prejudicing that company in negotiations. It is not a strong argument, but I can see the argument in certain circumstances. In order to keep faith with those companies that I think had a genuine concern about this,—although, I now wonder whether their concerns were misplaced—if there were an amendment along the lines of a company being able to say to the tax commissioner, 'We don't think you should release this because it could significantly prejudice our commercial negotiations,' that is the path that I would like to go down. I want to keep faith with the government on the intent of the bill, in terms of private companies, but I think their arguments have been quite weak. Some of them have been farcical in terms of kidnapping.


I think there is a way through this in order to deal with this. But, again, I emphasise to the 34 people listening on NewsRadio, what we are arguing about is the access of this information. If you want detailed information, you can get it anyway through ASIC for $38. It just means that the information is easier to get, even though it is at a much lower level—three lines of information in terms of taxable income and actual tax paid, or revenue and the taxable amount and the amount of tax paid. So that is pretty minimalist, but I think that there might be some circumstances where companies may want the assurance that the information is not publicly released so easily. Although, if you really want to dig around for it, you can get it through ASIC for $38. I am not sure if there will be further amendments moved in relation to this. I would like to think that there is a compromise possible in respect of this.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (12:02):  This is the same issue that I raised earlier with—




Senator Cash:
  With a different minister.




Senator LUDWIG:
  a different frontbencher, from whom I am still waiting to get a reply. So I take issue with your criticism that this is a filibuster. The filibuster is from your side, Senator Cash. I do not know how many frontbenchers who have had carriage of this piece of legislation.




Senator Cash:
  Duty ministers.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I would like one who knew something about it, and then who could pass the information back as requested. Then we could get on to the substantive amendments. The issue raised by Senator Xenophon I raised as well. The answer given by Senator Fifield said that the reason that they can reduce from 1,000 to 200—in other words, only publicly listed companies—was effectively what Senator Xenophon had said, absent the kidnapping. He did not throw the kidnapping one in; I would not have taken much stock of that issue. The answer given was that the exposure of their financial records in the public domain could allow competitors to gain an advantage by being able to trawl through their profit and loss statements, or whatever might be available. Senator Xenophon, much better than I, encapsulated the argument that most of this information—if not more if it, as it would be available through payment of $38 on the ASIC register—could be obtained in any event. An astute company wanting to assess and look at another company would also, similarly, be able to examine ASIC—as I am sure they would—to establish the financial position of that particular company.


This is the first time I have heard this. I am minded to the position where, just as in the share market world of public listed companies, if there is an issue such as an offer or a takeover in the wind, they generally report and suspend trading. It is the same concept—I think Senator Xenophon is looking for a compromise—where, logically, if there were a concern by a particular company that they were ripe for a buyout, a sell-out, a takeover, or whatever it might be, or if they were going to be troubled in the market by a competitor, then they might be able to make a prima facie case for the removal of their name from the register during that period or for a period of time. It would be a logical thing to do. I did not follow the argument put forward by Senator Fifield at the time that it is simply a case of, 'You don't need the register with all of those people on it because of this issue.' The truth is that you can deal with the issue in a more substantive way and still have an appropriate threshold. You do not need an unbelievable threshold, which really only lists into a very small number of companies. What you want to achieve in any legislation that you are bringing forward is a wide and fair application of it so that you do fairly capture all of those companies that you are required to. I am still waiting for the response to that. I am sure I will obtain it now.


Before we get into the substantive amendments, the second issue I wish to raise to get a response for is: in the 2015-16 budget relating to multinational tax avoidance, I want some assurance about the package going forward as to the time line or how it will be rolled out. Other elements in the 2015-16 budget related to the developing of a public tax transparency code to complement country-by-country reporting, which is being developed by the Board of Taxation. What is the time line on that? Will that be a draft? Will it be publicly released? Is there a release date available for that? Also, the same goes for the implementation of treaty abuse rules developed by the OECD and which aim to address the exploitation of tax treaty rules by multinationals to avoid taxation. Will there be a draft? What consultation will be undertaken to give that effect, and is there a time line for that?


Thirdly, I refer to the antihybrid rules developed by the OECD to address the issues of multinationals claiming a tax deduction in one country but not paying tax in another because of different tax rules. Will those antihybrid rules be open for draft consultation? Although they are called rules, will they be regulations which are disallowable and come here, or will they effectively be guidelines or rules used by the tax department? If they are the latter, will they be promulgated or open or draft and able to have some input into them from the various institutes that have an interest in how they would operate, and what is the time line for the implementation of those rules?


Fourthly, in regard to exchanging information with other countries about harmful tax practice and preferential tax deals, the same applies there. Will they be either regulations or rules? Rules obviously would not come here. If they are regulations, will they be disallowable? Following on from that, is there a draft or a consultative process that will surround the development of those practices, and what is the time line that might be associated with that?


Fifthly and lastly, there is the issue of a GST on digital products and services imported by Australian consumers. This would help level the playing field between domestic and international suppliers and ensure that all suppliers pay a fair share of tax. The same goes for that particular one, and it comes from the 2015-16 budget relating to multinational tax avoidance. With a GST on digital products, how would you determine whether or not a GST should be applied to a particular product and, if so, on what basis? What is the broad definition that you are going to use in respect of digital products and services? If a like service is already GST-free, will there be a determination that that particular service would then be subject to a new GST? Will there be a consultative process surrounding the definition of digital products and services and what is the time line for the implementation of that?


It is a good measure which I support. What I would like to ensure is that, in bringing about the level playing field between domestic and international suppliers, all suppliers do pay their fair share of tax. But, ultimately, I would like to ensure that it is brought in in such a way that it does not disadvantage Australian consumers and it does not create red tape for businesses in Australia—and thereby create not a level playing field, in fact, because you have effectively brought in a compliance regime or red tape that surrounds the implementation. 


The broader issue for individuals is that, in doing all of this, there is some view expressed or at least considered that you are then not implementing a raft of red tape for business that they would then have to comply with, particularly given that this government continually trumpets the view that it is a remover of red tape. I would not like to see business suffer significant red tape around the implementation of those measures. I suspect that that will be hard to achieve because much of the implementation will require some regulatory burden and some guidelines, rules and legislation. But, ultimately, in considering all of that, do it in such a way as to be mindful of the minimisation of red tape on business. 


I do take issue with your accusation that it is a filibuster. You have got a couple of minutes. I really do want answers to these questions. This is the opportunity for senators to ask questions about the legislation, and that is exactly what I am doing.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:12):  I have a couple of concerns about this whole bill. The first concern is that it so obviously erodes public confidence because it makes our tax system not as transparent. The biggest concern that I have—and we heard from Senator Xenophon earlier in regard to this and from Senator Ludwig—is this concept of kidnapping, this concept that if big businesses have to report then there is the chance that they or their families might be kidnapped. I do not want to make light of this at all, because kidnapping is obviously a very serious issue. But when the ATO gave evidence during the inquiry that one in five private companies earning over $100 million do not pay any tax and the government is supporting that—that seems to be the whole emphasis behind this bill—then I think that the people of Australia have the right to understand that it is just a furphy. It is just a ridiculous argument. When asked about that particular area of concern, the AFP, the ATO and the Attorney-General's Department could not give any evidence about that happening. So my first question is: where did that evidence come from? If you are going to use the argument of kidnapping, where is the official evidence? Where did that come from?


When people are kidnapped, most of the time there would be a ransom involved and, to me, the only people being held to ransom here are the low and middle income earners of Australia, who pay their fair share of tax. But if you are in one of these companies earning $100 million then the government will find any excuse for you not to have to pay your fair share of tax. It is absurd and it is absolutely logical. There is a complete lack of evidence behind the absolutely clumsy defence of this bill. We know there are few supporters of it. So my question to the minister is: where is the evidence of that? Who actually gave evidence? How did you get that evidence? You cannot just stand up and say that. And also: how do you respond to these comments in general that are being given by other senators?


Just before I sit down, in regard to the 'filibustering' comment: what an absurd comment to make. You come in here, you put up these proposals and you give us the most illogical arguments to defend them. As Senator Ludwig said, he is still waiting for an answer to his question. I have been sitting here through this debate, and I have not heard any logical or believable answer about the kidnapping concept. I really seriously would like to know: where did that evidence come from?




Senator Ludwig:
  That's a weird one!




Senator BILYK:
  It is absolutely weird, Senator Ludwig—and not just weird, but absolutely bizarre, and quite an insult to the intelligence of low and middle income Australians who, as I said, are paying their fair share of tax and expect that big businesses should too.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-11-11,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:16):  I have to say, Senator Ludwig, yours—I will pay you a compliment—was an exceptionally eloquent filibuster. Senator Bilyk, unfortunately, I cannot say the same to you, but I will pick up one comment that you made—albeit that I am almost indulging your filibuster, and I disappoint those listening to this debate by doing so. Senator Bilyk, in your opening statement, you said that this bill currently before the Senate 'erodes public confidence'. I think that I and the hardworking citizens of Australia are going to disagree with you on that point. Let me tell you why. The bill—for the benefit of those who are listening in on broadcast—that is currently before the Senate is the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015. I would have thought—and I think the Australian people, quite genuinely, themselves would have thought—that, when a government brings in a law that is all about combating multinational tax avoidance, which is all about ensuring that multinationals that have activity in Australia pay tax in Australia, that would be a good thing. I would have thought that, but, clearly, I am wrong, because Senator Bilyk, as I said, has clearly stated, on the Hansard, that this is a bill that erodes public confidence.


Let me also tell you a little bit more about the bill, because, again, I do not believe that this is a bill that erodes public confidence. In fact, I believe—as does the government and as do, I would say, the Australian people—that this is a bill that is going to ensure that Australians can continue to have confidence in our taxation system.


What do we know? As a government, we know that some multinationals are artificially structuring to avoid Australian tax by booking revenue from Australian sales offshore. What that means is that they have an unfair advantage over our local businesses and over families and small businesses, who have to shoulder more of the tax burden. What does that then do? It undermines the public confidence in our taxation system.


What does this bill therefore do? The Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill, if it is passed—and I would hope that this is a bill that is going to pass this place—will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to treat these large multinationals as though they have a taxable presence in Australia. What that will do is to ensure that they are subject to Australian tax. So, despite what we have heard, in, as I said, the very eloquent filibuster by Senator Ludwig, this is a good piece of legislation and it should have the support of the parliament.


As to the amendment that I understand will be moved by the Australian Greens and to which Senator Ludwig has been referring: Senator Ludwig, my instructions are that you have already asked this question a number of times—and that is fine; as you rightly say, you are entitled to do that. But you have already been provided by relevant ministers with an answer to your question. I am happy, though, to again provide you with the information in relation to your question.


I am instructed that, on 15 October—and that is why, apparently, this amendment is going to be moved—parliament passed a bill to amend the legislation that directs the Commissioner of Taxation to publish confidential tax information of Australian-controlled private companies. The government introduced the amendment because publication of the taxation information of these companies would have effectively disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and to their suppliers. And, Senator Ludwig, it is important to note that the amendment has no impact on the comprehensive powers of the Commissioner of Taxation to require companies to produce any information that is relevant to making an assessment of their tax liability. The public disclosure of tax information law will continue to apply to multinational enterprises operating in Australia and to Australian public companies.


The government has made it exceptionally clear that every company and indeed every taxpayer must pay the right amount of tax. To that end, we have tightened the thin capitalisation laws applicable to the amount of interest that may be deducted, and we have introduced new legislation to tackle tax avoidance by large multinational groups.


Senators Whish-Wilson and Ludwig do make relevant points. If you are so concerned about this information—and I understand this has been said several times now in this chamber, and I believe Senator Xenophon also may have made the point—apparently you can purchase it from ASIC for $38. So, there you go.


Senator Ludwig, you also asked some questions about when these laws would commence et cetera. My understanding is that the Commissioner of Taxation is currently working with approximately 80 companies. The Commissioner of Taxation is waiting for this legislation to pass, so indeed that particular person is then equipped with these powers and can set about implementing the law. In answer to your question, the sooner we can pass this legislation and the sooner we can get it through executive council, the sooner the Commissioner of Taxation will be able to undertake what we believe is an important part of ensuring that there remains integrity within the Australian taxation system.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:23):  In the budget this year the government was looking at bringing in a voluntary corporate disclosure code. You may remember, Senator Cash, that the previous Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey, said:


The voluntary code will highlight companies that are paying their fair share of tax. It will also discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.


…   …   …


The Board of Taxation will provide a business and broader community perspective to the development of a voluntary corporate disclosure code.


The Government would like more companies, particularly large multinationals operating in Australia, to publicly disclose their tax affairs. In developing the code they will need to consider what information is disclosed and how it is disclosed.


This was said in May this year. The point being that the government was looking at a voluntary code.


You are bringing in a mandatory code for multinationals over $1 billion. When the Treasurer said 'the government would like more companies, particularly large multinationals,' why did you make the cut-off $1 billion, and what is wrong with applying standards of disclosure to companies of $100 million, because that is what we are trying to do in the Greens amendment. We are trying to provide a mandatory code for Australian and offshore companies over $100 million, and you have brought in a mandatory code for $1 billion. So, my questions are as follows. What is wrong with doing it for $100 million versus $1 billion? How did you determine that cut-off? Clearly you believe disclosure is important, otherwise you would not have made these comments. Also, what is the public good argument for not supporting disclosure for companies over $100 million.

But I do not think I have anything further that I can add that is going to satisfy you. But, please feel free. We have until 12:45 to ask the question in another way.

 (Tasmania) (12:26):  I would like to highlight to you that my question is actually new. This is not something that has been discussed at all since we started this last night. Let me put it to you a different way. Why did the government bring in a mandatory code when you had been working on a voluntary code? Was it that you realised a voluntary code was not going to work?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:27):  With all due respect, I think we have determined that the information ASIC already requires these companies to lodge is significantly more detailed and comprehensive than what we are asking for. For your information, as you were not in the chamber a little bit earlier—as Senators Bilyk and Ludwig pointed out—in the Greens amendment with which we are seeking to bring back the better disclosure requirements, we are asking for four things: an ABN and name; total income for the year; total taxable income, or net income; and, income tax payable. This is only a fraction of what is on ASIC. So, in relation to your answer to me about this being about red tape, I fail to see how there can be any red tape involved with just asking for four simple things on a register, considering that the information is already available. The Senate looked at this when the bill was first introduced, and there was very little cost involved in bringing this in. This was looked at in 2013 by the Labor government and by various committees. We are not talking about a significant amount of red tape here. Could you please address that question?

 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:29):  Minister, thank you for your not so complimentary comments about my questions! Even so, I think that they are very legitimate questions. The question was: where did the evidence come from? The argument was used by your side, so surely you can validate where the evidence came from that people could have a higher chance of being kidnapped if they were one of these businesses. Where does that evidence come from? In the inquiry the AFP, the ATO and the Attorney-General's Department could offer up no evidence, so you cannot come in here and make statements that are very dramatic—lots of amateur dramatics go on on that side—if you cannot back them up. I want to know: where did the evidence come from?


We see on that side, so often, that you can talk the talk but you do not walk the walk. We see it in every question time. There are people on your side who have to constantly prove which drama school they went to by their amateur dramatics. With all the puffing up of your chests and all the claims that it is a crackdown on multinational companies, just because it says it in the title of the bill does not mean that is what is happening. In this case, it is not happening. So where did the evidence come from in regard to kidnapping?

Do not get too excited in your arguments against it. As has been stated several times in this debate—and perhaps if those on the other side had a little more experience in the real world of business they would understand—the government introduced the amendment that we are all referring to because publication of the taxation information of these particular companies would have, effectively, disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and their suppliers.

  The Senate, as I have stated, has already debated the substance of this amendment when it passed the tax and superannuation laws—




Senator Bilyk:
  I rise on a point of order, Temporary Chairman. The minister is not answering the question that is pretty simple. I have asked it a couple of times. Where did the evidence come from? Is there any evidence? Let me make it easy for the minister: is there any evidence?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Bilyk, there is no point of order.




Senator CASH:
  For the benefit of those in the gallery who have to endure this, and for those listening to broadcast, the good news is that I think there is only 12½ minutes left before we go to senators' statements. This has been canvassed time and time again. My understanding is that the Senate has already debated the substance of this amendment.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator Dastyari:
  You are misleading the chamber, Senator.

Senator Dastyari:
  I did not call a point of order.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  You are saying exactly the same thing as you did with your point of order. The minister is answering your question. Let her be heard.




Senator CASH:
  Again, as I said, the government introduced the amendment because publication of the taxation information of these companies would have, effectively, disclosed the owners' financial affairs and posed a risk to their position in the market by making key economic information available to their competitors and suppliers. Because it appears that we are going to be going through until 12.45 pm, if I could perhaps take a few minutes, for the benefit of those in the gallery, and for the benefit of those listening to this debate on broadcast, to explain what we are, in fact, debating. We are debating multinational anti-avoidance law. This is all about ensuring that in Australia we have some of the strongest integrity rules in the world. That is something that, as Australians, we should be very proud of.


When we ascertain that there are multinationals who are artificially structuring to avoid tax being paid in Australia by booking revenue offshore from Australian sales, as a government we should do something about that. Why? Because, obviously, these companies have an unfair advantage over local businesses, over families and over small businesses, who end up shouldering the greater tax burden. What this ultimately does is to undermine confidence within the Australian taxation system. Again, it might surprise those listening and those in the gallery that the opposition do support this bill. You would not yet think that by the manner in which they are behaving, but they do support this bill. Before the end of today and perhaps before we go to senators' statements, given that this is a bill that is going to ensure that multinationals engaging in deliberate tax avoidance have to pay tax in Australia, I would hope that this bill does pass the Senate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:35):  I want to ask the minister another direct question, and this is a very genuine question. I am not filibustering at all. It is a very genuine question. When we looked at the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill it exempted Australian companies from a set of disclosure laws, but it kept—as the minister is aware—offshore companies under the same disclosure laws that were passed in 2013. Let me read this to you from the Parliamentary Library:


The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (TAA 1953) to provide an additional threshold before the Commissioner of Taxation is obliged to publish information about a corporate tax entity with a total income equal to or exceeding $100 million for an income year. The additional threshold to be met must be one of three alternatives:


• the entity is not an Australian resident that is a private company or


• the entity is a member of a wholly-owned group that has a foreign resident ultimate holding company or


• the percentage of foreign shareholding in the entity is greater than 50 per cent.


So we, in this country, have a law at the moment that demands foreign companies with subsidiaries in Australia meet these disclosure requirements if they are worth over $100 million. My question is quite simple. Why did we exempt Australian companies? What was the logic behind cutting out Australian companies and individuals with a net worth of more than $100 million? Why do we keep it on offshore companies and exempt Australian companies?

The answer to the question, I think—and I am happy for you to correct the record—is that a group of very influential and wealthy people in this country lobbied the Liberal Party to have Australian corporations and individuals exempt from these laws. How is it that, six days after a Senate inquiry is announced into these laws, a front group gets it up in this country to help shield wealthy individuals and companies over $100 million from disclosing their laws—laws we have kept in place for foreign companies, but we have now exempted Australian companies. I think you have been lobbied quite hard—who knows, potentially by some of your donors—and that you have changed this law to suit them. I can see no public good reason why you would exempt Australian companies from these laws and keep the same laws for foreign corporations.

In fact, Senator Sam Dastyari summed it up himself in his speech in the second reading debate on Monday, 9 November. He said:


The former Treasurer should be congratulated for saying and doing many good things in this policy area.


He then said:


This is a bill that fundamentally addresses many important concerns around multinational tax avoidance.

If you do not want to believe from me, Senator Whish-Wilson, that this is a piece of legislation that is in the public good, please take it from your former coalition partners in the Australian Labor Party, the now opposition, from Senator Dastyari himself, that this is a good piece of legislation.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (12:45):  I rise today to raise a matter involving a man claiming to be an international business leader but who has demonstrated through his words and actions that he is a person who clearly has limited—if any—association with the truth. I am talking about a gentleman by the name of Mr Mohamed El-Mouelhy, who is head of the Halal Certification Authority. My attention was first drawn to Mr El-Mouelhy's intentions by his Facebook page in which he made the following comment about me: 'Mr Cory Bernardi is a well-known bigot and Muslim hater. A couple of years ago when halal certification became an issue for the bigots, Bernardi sent me an unsolicited, offensive and racist email. I did not dignify him with a response then, and I am not about to dignify him now.'


Having never heard of this man before, and establishing I had never had any previous contact with him, I was perplexed as to his claim. Upon further review of his distasteful, bigoted and racist social media rantings, I actually thought this was a grubby parody account. Imagine my shock when I discovered that Mr El-Mouelhy was actually a real person claiming to be a respected businessman. I contacted him through his business email asking for evidence of his defamatory claim that I had sent him an unsolicited, offensive and racist email. He responded by not providing any evidence at all and refusing to engage in any further conversation.


Accordingly, I am completely at peace in referring to Mr El-Mouelhy's claims about me as completely false, and I can only consider him to be a liar. This prompted me to conduct a further review of Mr El-Mouelhy's public statements. Clearly, he is no stranger to the limelight. With an increasing interest in halal certification, and as the head of the Halal Certification Authority, he has taken every opportunity to have his views heard. He pops up in TV interviews, on radio and in print. He is constantly offering opinions that halal certification has made him a multimillionaire. In fact, you could probably think that he is the quasi-face of halal certification in Australia. Yet, when given his opportunity to appear before a Senate committee about this precise topic, he refused to appear. I am guessing that the requirement to tell the truth in giving evidence before a Senate committee was enough to scare him off.


But that does not stop him from abusing the Senate inquiry. On Facebook he called the inquiry an 'exercise in bigotry' and a 'sham'. He labelled as bigots all those who called for the inquiry and all the senators who voted for it. He insulted almost every submission to the enquiry and he claimed, quite incorrectly, that the inquiry wants to destroy the halal certification industry. Amid proclamations that the government had 'shut down' the inquiry—again, another lie—he boasted further about the money he makes and mentioned alleged corruption within halal certification in Indonesia.


A large part of me wonders whether we should take anything he says seriously. In addition to defaming me on the internet, Mr El-Mouelhy is happy to abuse many others. He insults the whole of New South Wales as a 'bigots dreamland'. He describes Queensland as a 'bigots hinterland' and the ACT as 'foil hat territory'. I will not list them all now, but he said the same about virtually every state and territory in Australia. On Facebook, he doles out opinions and insults in equal measure. I will characterise just a few of these sorts of abuses today. Next to photos of pork rectums for sale, he writes: 'Favourite food for bigots. They are what they eat!' He accuses the Reverend Fred Nile of watching pornography on his computer and reading 'free porn mags'. In a comment to someone who posted on his page he wrote: 'You are a jealous bogan … die in your rage, bigot'. In another comment about someone on his page he said: 'This guy must have been to a Catholic school; he is besotted with paedophilia.' When asked about animal suffering, he said: 'I don't mind seeing you suffer.' He labels those who do not agree with him as 'bogans, bigots, religiously intolerant, rednecks and hicks'. His comments about a photo of short-cut bacon, where the word 'cut' has been misspelled through the addition of an additional consonant is simply repulsive, and it would be unparliamentary for me to repeat it here.


Such comments do not reflect well on any Australian businessman, especially someone who claims to be as successful and prominent as Mr El-Mouelhy. I have lost count of the number of times he has labelled me an Islamophobe, a bigot or a Muslim hater. Frankly, I put no stock in his insults against me. It is not the first time someone has called me names—and, coming from someone like him, I wear it as a badge of honour.


But the telling thing about all these online rantings and arrogant insults is what they tell us about the character of Mohamed El-Mouelhy. He is willing to spend a significant amount of time abusing people on social media and peddling lies in the public domain. And, by his own admission, he has been involved in corrupt dealings—bribery, to be specific—to attempt to gain access to the Indonesian halal food market. On ABC's Four Corners he was asked whether the $28,000 he spent on a visit to Australia by Indonesian halal officials was, in his mind, a bribe. This is what he said: 


In my mind … as an after fact, yes, it is a bribe.


Why would anyone want to do business with a corrupt businessman? But, according to Mr El-Mouelhy himself, business is booming. He arrogantly talks about how much money he makes from the halal certification industry. On Today Tonight he said it had made him a millionaire. On Four Corners he said that everything he touches turns to gold. His business website claims that it has an '80 per cent market share of halal certification in Australia'—something which I have seen no evidence of, but that is what he claims.


Yet beneath these dodgy boasts there are many questions to be answered. He portrays himself and his business as an Islamic body or authority. The name alone—Halal Certification Authority—implies that it is some sort of peak community representative organisation. It even has a '.org' domain name instead of the usual '.com'. But is it really an Islamic body or authority? Is it really a not-for-profit organisation as suggested by the domain name? As far as I can tell it is neither. It is simply a private business formed to make money for Mr El-Mouelhy through any means possible.


Descriptions of his company, on various websites, claim the Halal Certification Authority 'is the most authoritative national Islamic body on the application of Islamic dietary laws' and it is an 'Islamic body appointed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, according to federal legislation'. Mr El-Mouelhy is not an imam or Islamic religious leader, so I do not know on what basis he makes the claim of being a credible authority. And AQIS does not appoint Islamic certifiers. The certifiers apply to AQIS to gain approval to certify certain products for export. Further, El-Mouelhy boasts on Facebook that `Sharia rules' and is associated with another organisation that includes a special religious or sharia subcommittee.


Despite these statements and associations, El-Mouelhy also denies the existence of sharia or Islamic law. On 11 Feb 2015, during an interview on SBS, El-Mouelhy stated—in relation to a court case—'The defendants have said I am actually working to install sharia law—whatever that is—in Australia.' On 18 March 2015, during an interview on the ABC's The Drum program, El-Mouelhy claimed: 'There is no such thing in Islam called sharia law, by the way.' They are just more contradictions by a man unwilling to be confined by the truth.


Alarmingly, El-Mouelhy also boasts about contributing to the global Islamic charity Human Appeal International, HAI, an organisation that has been banned in Israel, since 2008, because it channels funds to Hamas and has links to Hezbollah. Mr El-Mouelhy claims he knows of no links from HAI to Hamas, but a quick internet search reveals the HAI logo in use at Hamas ceremonies. Hamas, I remind the Senate, has been listed by the United Nations as a terror group since 2001. In 1996 a CIA report said HAI was used as a conduit to fund terrorism. HAI also sponsored two visits to Australia by a bloke named Tareq Al-Suwaidan, a man banned from the US and Belgium for his violent anti-Semitism. And this is the charity that Mr El-Mouelhy chooses to support.


In short, based on his words and actions, I consider Mr El-Mouelhy to be an untrustworthy person. In fact, he does a great disservice to the Muslim community and the halal certification industry. During evidence to the committee on halal certification, one witness described the shonks and con men operating within the industry and endorsed calls for reform. In my opinion, Mr El-Mouelhy is the embodiment of such a description. I know he has made false statements about me and I know he has made admissions to being involved in corrupt practices. On that evidence alone, El-Mouelhy must be considered one of the halal industry shonks and con men that no reputable organisation should have anything to do with.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


I will confine my remarks, primarily, to the contribution from Senator Brandis about the question of innovation. I think everyone here understands that we are in a period of transformation in the Australian economy. I hope that some people here reflect on the occasional naivety during the long period of the mining boom, where there were those who asserted that this boom would go on forever, that it would never end and that it should be the only thing that underpinned the Australian economy.


That was not the understanding of people on this side of the chamber, and in government we relentlessly pursued a process of establishing the architecture for an ongoing, sustainable, serious, transformative innovation investment that would leverage the abilities in the public sector and the private sector to achieve a great transformation for Australian business and Australian industry. We did that with the confidence that Australia possesses some of the great researchers globally. We possess some of the great research institutions. We possess great innovative and entrepreneurial people who are keen to participate in private enterprise and to use the achievements in the private sector to build an economy that all of us can be proud of and that all of us can benefit from.


It is disappointing to hear in the answers provided today that not a single element of Senator Brandis's answer related, in any way, to the issues that I have been speaking about. They did not really speak to innovation, structure, collaboration, universities and research institutions. Instead, they addressed questions like consumer confidence and the government's overweening confidence in the abilities of the Prime Minister. It is nice that they are confident, but I think that what we would like to see is some actual action in relation to these questions, because, in the Abbott-Turnbull government, there has been an enormous gap between the rhetoric that has been presented in recent weeks and the reality of their period in government. 


They are the government that, in their 2014 and 2015 budgets, ripped out investment in science, research and innovation to the tune of $3 billion. Indeed, the Prime Minister, as the Minister for Communications, oversaw the demise of NICTA, a world-class research facility focused on information and communications. They voted for cuts to the R&D tax incentive. They backed the abolition of Commercialisation Australia, an entity which had supported 500 ventures that each raised $2 for every $1 invested by the government. They supported cuts to university research, to CSIRO and to ANSTO. They supported $107 million in cuts to the Cooperative Research Centres program. They are a government that are in no way interested in leveraging the power of the public sector to support the private sector in innovation, and it is a very great shame, because what we know is that when we see firms that undertake innovation it almost doubles the productivity of those firms. 


We know that firms that collaborate with public sector research entities, with CSIRO or with a university are 2.5 times more likely to report an increase in their own productivity. We know that all of our international competitors—the people that we seek to emulate in building a spatially and sectorally diverse economy—invest themselves most significantly in public sector research, yet every action for this government has been about dismantling the comprehensive system of structures that we put in place in government to support activities of exactly this kind. 


I want to say to people who are listening to this debate that, in government, Labor will place innovation at the centre of our approach. We will build on our record. We will build on an approach which sought to establish positive relationships and collaborative relationships between the private sector and the public sector. We will not be involved in a race to the bottom. We will not be involved in a naive reliance on commodities alone. We see a future for Australia that builds on all of our talents, and that is something that I am very proud to support.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-11-11,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:10):  It gives me great pleasure to follow Senator McAllister, who was very determined to talk about Labor's track record in innovation. Labor's history of innovation, of course, lies within the union movement: when they want to innovate and when they want to rejuvenate the union movement, they take the tired old union workhorses and shuffle them off into the Senate, where they can mouth the latest platitudes in order to assuage the Australian people, use some buzzwords, use plenty of acronyms and, hopefully, establish that they are somehow innovate people. During her speech, I challenged Senator McAllister to outline exactly what NICTA stands for. She was unable and unwilling to do so. What about the acronym ANSTO? Could she please elaborate on what that stood for? She was unable and unwilling to do so. The shallow rhetoric of those opposite is apparent for all Australians to see. If you want to go through their buzzwords, we have seen them: 'spatially' and 'collaboratively', and they have all been used because they are meant to make people feel good. 


But let us have a look at the track record of those opposite. For Senator Carr, in his innovation ministry, the highlight to me was when he decided that he would have a program and a policy of sending text messages into outer space in the hope of getting a response from some alien being! For the atheists on that side of the chamber, they were hoping for divine innovation, but they were simply sending things into outer space in the hope of some innovative enlightenment from above. It was nonsense then; it is nonsense now. They have no substance. They are shallow and full of poppycock. 


What this country needs is reform. It needs genuine innovation, and that does not come from sending 180 characters to Mars! It comes from corporate reform. It comes from a very agile, diligent and adaptive corporate sector. It comes from taxation reform that does not take away the incentives for people to work harder, to go out and get a job and to help themselves move from a welfare to a work mentality. It comes from reform that is going to encourage people to get into business. It takes industrial relations reform where people are encouraged to employ people, without the fear of being stuck in difficult circumstances or unable to pay their bills. It requires flexibility. It requires a truly innovative approach, not the tired old rhetoric and not the same ham-fisted centralised government initiatives and the ridiculous positions and policies that have been pursued previously. It also requires government reform. Government itself needs to be more agile. It needs to accept the fact that the central command planned economy that has been so loved by the socialists on the other side—particularly the former minister for innovation, Senator Carr—is yesterday's failure. It is no longer the way for a modern country to adapt, grow and prosper. We need to empower individuals. We need to empower individuals to innovate, to take risks, to build businesses, to employ, to grow our economy and to generate wealth. It is not government that does that. Government is an impediment to that, and it needs to get out of the way.


If you want true innovation in this country, you also need to have educational reform, not slogans like, 'I give a Gonski,' or anything like that. You actually need to give people educations that generate value in the community. You need to equip people with skills that are of financial value to others in the community, because, that way, they are always going to get a job and they are always going to have a chance to get ahead. We need to make sure, as I said, that people are encouraged to pursue the riskier options, if you will, of entrepreneurship, where they can say 'I'm going to have a go at this and maybe it will work and if it doesn't work I'll pick myself up again and I'll have another go and another go and another go.' That is the culture that we need to foster in this country, not this central command and bureaucracy. We do not need the bigger taxes that have been advocated by the other side; we do not need the corporate impediments that limit the job growth and the technological growth that can promote our prosperity into the future.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:15):  Senator Bernardi let the cat out of the bag when he talked about Gonski just being a slogan. That is not the case. Before the last election the then opposition was saying that they were on a unity ticket on education funding. Of course Senator Bernardi does not seem to be on anyone's unity ticket—he has been on the losing side so many times he just does not know how to win. I want to take issue with Senator Brandis's response to the very first question asked by the opposition, which was on the GST. As usual we do not get a straight answer from the government when it comes to the GST. They talk about being innovative, agile or creative but they do not want to talk about what their real plans are. They talk about having a conversation with the community, but it is not about that—it is about hiding what they are intending to do. We know and the community knows that they said they were not going to increase the GST. I can talk about the other broken promises that they have carried out since the very beginning of the Abbott government. Now we have Mr Turnbull, who is supporting another broken promise—the promise not to increase the GST. The community knows what they intend to do.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  How can you say he is supporting it when the minister clearly said he wasn't?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Senator Macdonald may want to inject, as he often does, but we know that increasing the GST is in the coalition's DNA. They made the promise that they would not increase the GST. 



Government senators interjecting—




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  All you have to do is rule it out. You did prior to the election. You know that this is exactly what you want to do. You are trying to blame the states; you are pushing the states into a position by blaming them for having the discussion on the GST. You ripped billions of dollars out of the states' health budgets and their education budgets. You told the community a number of things prior to the last election and you broke nearly every single promise that you made. You broke your promises to the pensioners, you broke your promises to parents and families, you broke your promises to the premiers of the day. You did that as soon as you came in. An increase in the GST in Tasmania would have a massive impact. 




Senator Conroy:
  Disastrous.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  It would be absolutely disastrous. Tascoss CEO Kim Goodes has already highlighted the impact that any rise in the GST would have on Tasmania, pointing of course to the GST modelling that showed that higher income households would pay less tax as a proportion of their income if the GST rose to 15 per cent than families on lower incomes. This conversation is going on with most of the coalition backbench—most of them not named—being concerned about increasing the GST not because they are concerned about their constituents but because they are concerned about their seats. And they should be, because this is another broken promise by this government to the Australian community. Tasmania has received some of the worst impacts from these broken promises. There has been a massive impact on education and on our health system as well. We even had the Liberal Treasurer in Tasmania talking about the $2.1 billion cuts, saying 'Where is the money? Show me the money.'




Senator Bushby:
  You're misleading parliament.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  This is your own state Liberal Treasurer who said 'Give us our money back.' This is what happened. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:21):  Dear, oh dear—how the Labor Party has fallen! No wonder their polls are at such a low level, and no wonder the union movement, which they represent in this parliament, has fallen to 11 per cent of workers in the private sector. When you hear the questions asked today, you understand why people have lost interest in the Labor Party.




Senator Conroy:
  Well we all heard your question.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Conroy, you did not hear my question because it was about Northern Australia, which none of you on that side are interested in. I can understand your sensitivity, since you have dumped the only northern senator you have had in this chamber for a long period and replaced her with a male from Brisbane. That means that you have absolutely no interest in Northern Australia, and I can well understand why you attempted to drown out my question on Northern Australia to such an extent that the President, for the first time that I can remember in my long term in the Senate, had to ask that the question be repeated three times because the Labor Party clearly did not want to hear what the coalition is doing about developing Northern Australia.


Not sufficiently satisfied with that, the Labor Party then make up a story: the coalition is going to increase the GST by 15 per cent. I have never heard any coalition senator or member or minister say that once. I have never seen it reported. But does that stop the Labor Party—and the ABC, I might say, and the Fairfax press—headlining that the Turnbull government is going to increase the GST by 15 per cent? It has never been raised in the party room. I am not in cabinet, but I suspect it has never been raised there either. Yet that does not stop the Labor Party making up a story and then running a campaign on the story they have made up. Senator Bullock, I can understand why you have left your faction in Western Australia; the way the Labor Party is going, I am surprised that you do not leave the Labor Party as well. I do not think anyone would blame you. I know you will not. But I cannot understand why you stay with such a mob of ignoramuses who cannot have a policy, and so they make up a policy that the coalition might have.


Similarly, there was a question from the Labor Party about penalty rates and, as the minister answering the question pointed out, the only one that has ever reduced penalty rates in Australia is none other than Mr Bill Shorten, the current leader of the Australian Labor Party in this parliament. Penalty rates are normally a matter for the Fair Work Commission. But in Mr Shorten's case, he did a deal with the bosses—you know, at the top end of town—to take away penalty rates. And we hear a bit of silence for the first time from the opposition when the truth comes out.


I do not know what is wrong with the comprehension of Labor Party senators. Senator Brandis was asked about the GST and he said that a 15 per cent increase in the GST is not a proposal of the Turnbull government. Is that what you said, Senator Brandis?




Senator Brandis:
  Correct.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  That is very, very clear. And yet the Labor senators come here and, in spite of that very clear and direct answer by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, they still try and pretend it is around there. Now, methinks that the Labor state premiers have got onto the Labor Party and said,' hey fellas, how about an increase in the GST?' It seems to me this might almost be a subterranean plot by Labor to get more money for their mates in the state governments. The Labor Party have—




Senator Conroy:
  You are becoming the Bill Heffernan of Queensland!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, I would be proud of that description; Senator Heffernan has done more for Australia, Senator Conroy, than you could ever contemplate doing. He is a fine man who has made a real contribution to parliamentary debate here. But contrast that with the Labor Party, who simply do not have any policy—so they make up policy for the coalition. They talk about penalty rates, where the only one that has reduced penalty rates is the current leader of the Labor Party. What a sad decline for a once great party. (Time expired)

"Bullock, Sen Joseph",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator BULLOCK
 (Western Australia) (15:26):  Back in the 1940s, there was an organiser working for the SDA in Western Australia called Backshall. He organised hairdressers. Backshall went out on his own with his hairdresser members and registered the Hairdressers & Wigmakers Industrial Union of Workers. When Backshall retired, he passed on the union to his son, Ron.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You can't do that, can you?




Senator BULLOCK:
  Frank Belan did! Over the following decades, the union ran down. Ron found winning wage rises for hairdressers difficult, and by 1990 a four-year-trained tradesperson hairdresser was earning less than a shop assistant. I had a few discussions with Ron, and somehow found myself secretary of the hairdressers' union. I immediately engaged in negotiations with the master ladies' and master gentlemen's hairdressers' associations, and managed to persuade them to increase wages by $150 a week—not bad shooting in 1990. One of the issues which concerned employers was the penalty rates payable for work on the one late night and on Saturday. In the course of negotiations, we valued these penalties at 10 per cent of the total wage costs, and I traded these penalties for a 10 per cent across-the-board wage rise plus a provision in the award—which as far as I know is unique—under which, if there were any future national wage case increases awarded in flat dollar terms rather than a percentage—unusual in those days—the increase awarded to hairdressers would be increased by 10 per cent to preserve the value of the 10 per cent buyout.


It is fair to say that the employer associations were extraordinarily pleased with this outcome. Nevertheless, as soon as the award was varied, employers came out of the woodwork to complain. 'We do not trade on Thursday night; why should we pay?' 'We do not trade on Saturday; why should we pay?' 'We have some employees who only work Monday to Friday; why should we pay them a loaded rate?' These employers were effectively arguing for the penalty rate system—rewarding workers engaged during unsociable hours for the work performed during those hours. Even though the employer associations taking a macro view were satisfied that, across the industry, a 10 per cent across-the-board wage increase was required to ensure cost neutrality, at a micro level there were some employers who were disadvantaged by the buyout as well as some employees, while some employees were being compensated for hours of work which they did not perform. If penalty rates are to be bought out, there is no avoiding these problems.


In the enterprise bargaining era, my union—the SDA—has worked with employers to improve efficiency in the retail industry and to improve wages for members. Implementing simpler pay scales which absorb some penalties into higher base rates has been part of these negotiations. In the 1990s, agreements struck under the no-disadvantage test facilitated these arrangements, as 'no disadvantage' was assessed on an on-balance basis across the affected workforce. Today, the better-off-overall test provides a different challenge because it is, arguably, applied to each individual worker. Take Coles, for example: if a Coles shop assistant was employed under the award, their gross would be $721.50 week. Our agreement pays such a worker $821 a week—an hundred extra dollars a week; locked into the base, flowing into overtime payments, superannuation contributions and leave payments. Such an increase makes a huge difference to a low-paid worker. They are unquestionably better off. Yet it could be possible to find a worker, perhaps a casual who is engaged only to work at what would be penalty times under the award such as on Sundays for example—such an employee could be worse off. All of this demonstrates how hard it is to properly and fairly compensate workers when moving away from penalties. It also highlights how much value there is for a worker in the penalty system for those who regularly work at unsociable hours. 


A few years ago I had a chat with the Premier who raised the issue of penalty rates and suggested that he might like to personally be involved in reducing penalty rates. He said that he wanted to be fair and not cut workers' pay but offer some compensating increase in base rates. I explained to him some of the complexities that this involved. After some reflection, he said that perhaps he did not want to be personally involved with it at all. And here is the problem: compensation arrangements are hard to effect; they can be globally cost neutral but are likely to be disadvantageous to some employers and employees, and this is unavoidable. What businesses and most politicians who are advocating reducing penalty rates mean is cost cutting. They are not interested in grappling with the issue of compensation. Yet penalty rates comprise a significant proportion of the take-home pay of those workers who work at unsociable hours, the majority of whom are already low paid. Labor's view is that imposing wage cuts on the low paid workers is simply unthinkable. (Time expired)

VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (EXPANDED GOLD CARD ACCESS) BILL 2015


Mr President,


An unprecedented veterans' suicide and homelessness crisis grips Australia today.


This crisis was created because of poor management of Australia's military resources and defence personnel - by successive governments. 


These governments compounded their error by attempting to cover up the true nature and scale of our veterans' suicide and homelessness crisis.


The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Expanded Gold Card Access) Bill 2015 I present to the Senate today will properly address our nation's shameful veterans' suicide and homelessness crisis.


By guaranteeing with this legislation, automatic free access to the best possible medical treatment in Australia, for the men and women of our ADF and Federal Police, who have served their country in war or war-like operations this Parliament will stop the harmful and all too often—deadly, bureaucratic fight our veterans are forced to undertake so they can obtain a health Gold Card.




General Outline



As described in this Legislation's Explanatory Memorandum:


1. The purpose of the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Expanded Gold Card Access) Bill 2015 is to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) so that all veterans, including peacekeepers and peacemakers or former members of Australia's Defence Force, who have served in war or war-like operations, (and for related purposes) are provided medical and psychological treatment free-of-charge—as a right of service - the best medical treatment Australia has to offer i.e. Health Gold Card benefits.


2. At present, there are three categories of repatriation, depending on service and medical needs:


1. Orange Card (pharmaceutical only);


2. White Card (specific conditions); and a


3. Gold Card (all clinical health needs).


3. While repatriation efforts have improved in recent decades, as witnessed by high rates of self-harm and homelessness - there are still many people who have served Australia whose medical and psychological needs are not addressed.


4. The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Expanded Gold Card Access) Bill 2015 is an important first step in ensuring a more effective transition between national service and civilian life.


5. The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Expanded Gold Card Access) Bill 2015 broadens the terms of reference of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to ensure everyone who served in war or war-like operations receive vital, necessary and timely medical and psychological treatment—whether or not the condition or injury was caused by war or contracted during war or war-like operations.




History



This legislation is a direct result of events that transpired at a meeting of veterans that was organized Dr Raymond Huntley at Burpengary, Queensland on Wednesday the 21st of May 2014.


At the gathering of veterans - consisting of former ADF members mainly from the Army, who had served in Vietnam and younger veterans who had recently served in Middle East conflicts—Dr Huntley asked all the Health Gold Card holders to stand.


About a dozen people stood. Dr Huntley then asked those who had obtained their gold cards in 2 years or less to sit. 2 veterans sat.


Through this process of gradually increasing the number of years it takes to obtain Gold Cards, questioning, and then asking veterans to sit—it became clear very quickly, that most veterans had to wait about 5 years before they received a health gold card.


Two veterans had to wait over ten years to access the medical benefits that the coverage of a Health Gold card gives. After Dr Huntley had finished that exercise - which in reality was for the benefit of myself and two other Liberal politicians, a former digger who had served in the Middle East spoke to the group.


He had a tragic story. He said a number of his comrades that he'd served with in war in the Middle East had taken their own lives. And one of the main reasons, he said - which had pushed his Veteran friends to take that terrible decision to kill themselves—was the psychological harm that occurred to his mates while they fought the Government to obtain a Gold Card.


He said words that must hurt some public servants who are very dedicated to their jobs and take pride in their work—but nonetheless must be spoken in the debate.


The Middle East veteran said that many of his friends would have preferred to fight the Taliban, rather than fight the bureaucrats who decided whether our Diggers received the best possible medical care that Australia can provide to her wounded warriors.


Then from the floor of the meeting this younger veteran suggested that many lives could be saved - if the Australian government automatically gave a Health Gold Card to all veterans who have served in war or war-like conditions.


By making access to a Gold Card a tick and flick exercise - or a simple bureaucratic process, for those members of the ADF who had served in a war or war-like conditions—it will allow vulnerable and often damaged people to bypass a traumatic and further damaging administrative process and immediately receive the medical care they need to get well.


This was the light bulb moment for my team and I. And from that moment my office has worked hard to present this legislation to the parliament, in the unshakable belief that it will lessen the risk of further harm and help stop our veterans from taking their own lives.


From that day, Wednesday of May 2014—my team and I have had thousands of conversations with veterans of all conflicts, which confirm the observations of that young veteran who had served in the Middle East.


Some veterans reacted in a hostile manner when I said that we should make it much easier for all veterans who have served in war or war-like conditions to access the speedy and quality medical treatment guaranteed by a Gold Card.


They had a mindset which strangely supported the hard and convoluted bureaucratic process in place though the Department of Veterans' Affairs for their clients to access the benefits of a Gold Card.


To those few individuals, a Gold Card became a status symbol, which gave holders, a greater sense of self-esteem and self-worth.


When it was pointed out to these rare individuals that it was the bureaucratic fight for a Health Gold Card that was significantly contributing to the suicides of our veterans—then most doubters of this new policy accepted the obvious truth of the matter—and became supporters.


The passage of this legislation, which enables the automatic issuing of a health Gold Card entitling free treatment, is an effective early intervention action, which will save hundreds of Australian lives, billions of dollars and a million heartaches.


It will take steps to repair the wound that Australia inflicts on the hearts and minds of those who are prepared to take great risks and sacrifice all.


When our warriors come home hurt under the current system - their country, instead of welcoming them with warm handshakes, hugs, kisses and the recognition of being special citizens - turns its back on our wounded heroes and makes them fight to access proper medical care.


A major cause of Australia's obscene veterans' suicide rate (apart from systemic under-resourcing and over-commitment to international operations) is the unnecessary psychological damage caused during our veterans' bureaucratic fight for Gold Card guaranteed medical treatment.




Gold Card Cost



When the issue of cost is raised - the saying that comes immediately to mind is: if we can't afford to properly care for our wounded veterans when they come back from war-like and war service—then we shouldn't send them in the first place.


Australia has a moral as well as a legal duty to give our veterans access to the best medical care our country can offer.


And under the current broken DVA system we—the politicians who make the decision to send our sons and daughters into harm's way, have failed to live up to the example those young people have set.




Veterans' Suicide Rate



Today we have a Prime Minister, Minister for Defence and Minister for Veterans' Affairs who cannot tell the people of Australia how many of the 70,000 contemporary cohort of veterans, have taken their own lives - or are forced to live rough among our homeless.


Our veterans' suicide rate - intentionally kept secret by all major political parties and senior military commanders to protect their reputations, is a national disgrace and shame.


A major cause of Australia's obscene veterans' suicide rate (apart from systemic under-resourcing and over-commitment to international operations) is the unnecessary psychological damage caused during our veterans' bureaucratic fight for Gold Card guaranteed medical treatment.


JLN believes that when properly considered, the automatic grant of Health Gold Cards to Australia's veterans will be cost neutral after the extremely high expense of doctors, lawyers and suicides are removed from the assessment process - and taken into account.




Closing



I close my speech as I opened. An unprecedented veterans' suicide and homelessness crisis grips Australia today.


This crisis was created because of poor management of Australia's military resources and defence personnel - by successive governments. 


These governments compounded their error by attempting to cover up the true nature and scale of our veterans' suicide and homelessness crisis.


The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Expanded Gold Card Access) Bill 2015 I present to the Senate today will properly address our nation's shameful veterans' suicide and homelessness crisis.


Indeed Mr President—this Bill is the first legislative step to solving these terrible problems and I urge all Senators to support this Bill.

The speeches read as follows—



MIGRATION AMENDMENT (CHARGING FOR A MIGRATION OUTCOME) BILL 2015


The Migration Amendment (Charging for a Migration Outcome) Bill 2015 amends the Migration Act 1958 (""the Act"") to introduce a new criminal and civil penalty regime that will make it unlawful for a person to ask for, receive, offer or provide payment or other benefits in return for a range of sponsorship-related events. The Bill also allows visa cancellation to be considered where the visa holder has engaged in such conduct, referred to as 'Payment for Visas' conduct. 


This Bill will implement a key integrity recommendation of the Independent Review into Integrity in the Subclass 457 Programme: that it be made unlawful for a sponsor to be paid by visa applicants for a migration outcome and that this be reinforced by a robust penalty and conviction framework. 


This Bill will apply to a range of temporary sponsored work visas and skilled permanent employer sponsored visas, including the 457 visa. 


'Payment for Visas' conduct is not currently unlawful. This conduct is unacceptable to the Government and the Australian people because it undermines the genuine purposes for which visas are intended to be granted. This Bill will strengthen the integrity of Australia's migration programme by allowing action to be taken where 'Payment for Visas' conduct has occurred. 


'Payment for Visas' conduct may occur through an employer offering to sponsor a visa applicant in return for a payment or benefit. It may occur before the applicant applies for a visa or during the visa holder's stay in Australia. Evidence obtained through monitoring sponsors indicates that the sponsor and applicant are complicit in the majority of 'Payment for Visas' activity. Employers may also exploit an employee by requiring payment in return for ongoing sponsorship.


A strong response is required to ensure that this practice does not continue.


The Bill will amend the Act to make it a criminal offence for a sponsor or other third party to ask for or receive a benefit in relation to a sponsorship‑related event. The offence will be punishable by a maximum of two years' imprisonment or a fine of up to 360 penalty units. This currently equates to $64,800 for an individual person or five times higher - $324,000 - for a body corporate. 


The Bill introduces civil penalties applicable to a sponsor, visa applicant or any other third party who asks for or receives, or provides or offers a benefit, in relation to a sponsorship-related event. The maximum pecuniary penalty is 240 penalty units, which currently equates to $43,200 for an individual person or five times higher - $216,000 - for a body corporate. 


The maximum penalties reflect the high upper limit of amounts paid in 'Payment for Visas' cases. 


The Bill defines ""benefit"" in wide terms to include any payment or deduction, and any kind of real or personal property, advantage, service or gift. It does not include payments of reasonable amounts for the provision of a professional service such as by a migration or recruitment agent.


The Bill includes a definition of ""sponsor-related event"" to capture the types of conduct between a sponsor and a visa applicant or visa holder to which the offence will apply.


The Bill defines ""sponsorship-related event"" to capture 'Payment for Visas' conduct that occurs at any point in the visa application process or throughout the duration of the visa. 


The Bill provides for further types of ""sponsorship-related events"" to be prescribed in the future, ensuring the legislation will be flexible to respond to emerging 'Payment for Visas' conduct. The Bill also provides for a criminal or civil penalty to be imposed on an executive officer of a body corporate, which has been found to be involved in 'Payment for Visas' activity.


The criminal and civil penalty framework will have extended extraterritorial application, so that the offence and penalties apply to conduct by an Australian citizen or body corporate outside Australia, or to an Australian resident outside Australia if there is an equivalent offence in the law of the local jurisdiction. 


The Bill will also allow existing inspector, investigation, search warrant and notice to produce powers, which are currently used to investigate work-related offences, to be used in relation to 'Payment for Visas' activity. 


Finally, the Bill will introduce a new discretionary power to consider visa cancellation where any person engages in 'Payment for Visas' conduct. 


Visas granted at any time may be considered for cancellation, where conduct occurred on or after the commencement date of this Bill. 


Consistent with other cancellation powers in the Act, the visa holder would be afforded procedural fairness during the cancellation process. Where a decision to cancel a visa is made, consequential cancellation of the same visas held by family members would automatically apply. A person whose visa is cancelled would have the ability to seek merits or judicial review of that decision. 


It is my intention to later expand the 'Payment for Visas' provisions to family and other visas where there is the potential for this conduct to occur. The Bill ensures that the Department is able to take appropriate action against unscrupulous people who have engaged in 'Payment for Visas' conduct.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.


MIGRATION AND MARITIME POWERS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2015


The Migration and Maritime Powers Amendment Bill (No.1) 2015 contains a number of amendments to the Migration Act and a separate amendment to the Maritime Powers Act. These amendments will strengthen and clarify the legal framework in those Acts, ensuring they will be interpreted consistently with original policy intention and operate effectively as intended.


Specifically, the Bill will:


ensure that when an unlawful non-citizen is in the process of being removed to another country and before they enter the other country the person is returned to Australia, then that person has a lawful basis to return to Australia without a visa; 


ensure that when such a person does return to Australia without a visa, the visa application bars in sections 48 and 48A of the Migration Act will continue to apply as if they never left Australia;


make a technical amendment to ensure that the prohibition against the making of further protection visa applications in section 48A of the Migration Act operates as intended under policy; 


ensure that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal can review certain character or security based decisions to refuse to grant a protection visa to a fast track applicant; 


ensure that the visa ceasing provisions in sections 82, 173 and 174 of the Migration Act operate as intended under policy;


make a number of amendments to give full effect to the substantive amendments made by the Migration Amendment (Character and General Visa Cancellation) Act 2014; 


make a minor technical amendment to address an incorrect referencing error in section 38B of the Migration Act, relating to maritime crew visas; and


confirm that the powers in the Maritime Powers Act are able to be exercised in the course of passage through or above the waters of another country in a manner that is consistent with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 


The proposed amendments in Schedule 1 ensure that when an attempt is made to remove an unlawful non-citizen from Australia, but that non-citizen does not enter the destination country and is instead returned to Australia, the non-citizen can be returned to Australia without a visa. In addition, they will be treated as if they had never left Australia for the purposes of the visa application bars imposed by sections 48 and 48A of the Migration Act.


Currently the Migration Act allows an unlawful non-citizen who was been removed from Australia to return without a visa if the unlawful non-citizen was refused entry into the destination country. It does not currently allow for the return without a visa of a non-citizen who we have attempted to remove from Australia in other circumstances where it may be necessary. For example, there is no facility to return a person to Australia without a visa if a transit country refuses to allow the removed person to transit, or if the United Nations Human Rights Committee makes an interim measures request that the removal not be completed. The amendments in Schedule 1 will address this inconsistency.


Similarly, the current law provides that when a non-citizen is returned to Australia without a visa because they were refused entry to their destination country then the bars on making further applications imposed by sections 48 and 48A of the Migration Act will continue to apply as if they had never left Australia. The amendments will ensure that the same rule applies to a non-citizen who is returned to Australia without a visa in any circumstance covered by these amendments. 


The amendments in Schedule 2 of this Bill are required to give full effect to the substantive amendments made to the Migration Act last year by the Migration Amendment (Character and General Visa Cancellation) Act 2014. The Character and General Visa Cancellation Act significantly strengthened the character and general visa cancellation provisions in the Migration Act to ensure that non-citizens who commit crimes in Australia, pose a risk to the Australian community or represent an integrity concern are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation.


The Character and General Visa Cancellation Act also introduced mandatory cancellation of visas held by non-citizens in prison who do not pass certain limbs of the character test, a revocation power specifically for mandatory cancellation decisions, and a new power for the Minister to personally set aside, in the national interest, a decision made by his or her delegate or the AAT to revoke a mandatory visa cancellation decision.


The consequential amendments set out in Schedule 2 of this Bill will ensure that the mandatory cancellation- related powers are reflected comprehensively throughout the Migration Act, according to the original intent of the changes made last year. This will ensure that the Government has the capability to proactively and robustly address character and integrity concerns.


In particular, Schedule 2 of the Bill will ensure criminal intelligence and related information which is critical to the making of all character-related decisions can be protected from disclosure under section 503A of the Migration Act. This Bill will also give full effect to the policy of mandatory cancellation, by putting beyond doubt that a non-citizen who is the subject of a mandatory character cancellation decision is available for removal from Australia if they do not seek revocation within the relevant time period, or are unsuccessful in having their visa reinstated.


Further, Schedule 2 of the Bill seeks to strengthen my department's ability to identify non-citizens suspected of being of character concern by aligning the definition of 'character concern' in the Act with the strengthened 'character test' in section 501. Consistent with the original intent of the Character and Cancellation Act, this will facilitate the lawful disclosure of non-citizens' identifying information where a non-citizen is suspected of being of character concern. 


Part 1 of Schedule 3 of the Bill makes an amendment to subsection 48A(1C) of the Migration Act to clarify that a person who has previously been refused a protection visa application that was made on their behalf (for example because they were a minor at the time), cannot make a further protection visa application, irrespective of the ground on which the further protection visa application would be made or the criteria which the person would claim to satisfy, and irrespective of the grounds on which the previous protection visa application was made. This amendment is a technical amendment to ensure that the bar on further protection visa applications in section 48A of the Migration Act operates as originally intended.


Part 2 of Schedule 3 of the Bill includes a number of separate amendments to the Migration Act :


The first of these are amendments to give full effect to the amendments made to the Migration Act last year by the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014 (the Legacy Act), which introduced the Fast Track process for certain protection visa applicants who are defined in the Migration Act as a fast track applicant. The applicant cohort to which this process applies are unauthorised maritime arrivals in Australia who came on or after 13 August 2012, but before 1 January 2014, and any other person, or class of persons, specified by the Minister as a fast track applicant by legislative instrument.


This Government's intention during the development of the Legacy Act was always that a fast track applicant, whose protection visa application is refused on certain character or security grounds, should be able to make an application for review of that decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) under the existing provisions in the Migration Act. These amendments implement this intention, and clarify the types of fast track decisions that can be reviewed by the Immigration Assessment Authority which is established within the Migration and Refugee Division of the AAT.


Certain character or security decisions relating to protection visa applications are often evidentially and legally complex. The Government is providing a consistent and rigorous, but fair and expert process by ensuring that the AAT's current jurisdiction to review these types of character or security based decisions will also apply where the applicant is a fast track applicant.


Consistent with the rest of this Bill, these items demonstrate this Government's clear and continuing commitment to ensuring that non-citizens who pose a risk to the Australian community are dealt with effectively, efficiently and comprehensively.


The second group of amendments in Schedule 3 of the Bill clarify the ways that visas can cease under the Migration Act. As the Act currently provides for visas to be extinguished by ""ceasing to be in effect"", it has created room for possible argument that a visa which is dormant, i.e. not in effect, cannot cease to be in effect even if a relevant ceasing provision applies to it.


To ensure that the visa ceasing provisions under the Act are interpreted consistently with policy, amendments in Schedule 3 to this Bill clarify the operation of the visa ceasing provisions. That is, a visa will always cease or be extinguished if a relevant ceasing provision applies to it, even if the visa is not in effect at the relevant time, except in one expressly carved out circumstance.


Schedule 3 of the Bill also makes a minor technical amendment to subsection 38B(5) of the Migration Act to fix an incorrect referencing error.


Finally, the amendments proposed in Schedule 4 of the Bill are intended to confirm the Government's clear intent that powers under the Maritime Powers Act are able to be exercised in the course of passage through or above the waters of another country in a manner consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the Convention).


Section 8 of the Maritime Powers Act defines a 'country' to include the territorial sea and archipelagic waters of the country. Section 40 prevents the exercise of powers under the Maritime Powers Act at a place in another country except in defined circumstances. Section 40 could be interpreted as preventing the exercise of powers under the Maritime Powers Act in waters within another 'country' in circumstances where, under the Convention, it would be permissible to exercise those powers, for example when a vessel is in the course of 'transit passage' through an international strait. 


Schedule 4 to the Bill amends section 40 to confirm the ability to exercise powers under the Maritime Powers Act in circumstances where vessels or aircraft are permitted or entitled under the Convention to exercise rights of passage through or above those waters. Under the amendments, the exercise of the maritime powers in these circumstances can occur when three criteria are met.


First, the exercise of the powers is to be part of a continuous exercise of powers that commenced in accordance with the existing framework for the exercise of powers. Secondly, the exercise of the powers occurs in the course of passage of a vessel or aircraft through or above waters that are part of a country (which includes the territorial sea, archipelagic waters and international straits). Finally, a relevant maritime officer (including a commander of a vessel. as well as more senior maritime officers who have knowledge, involvement in, or command over the operation) or the Minister, considers that the passage is in accordance with the Convention.


Schedule 4 demonstrates this Government's clear intent to ensure that the powers exercised under the Maritime Powers Act are consistent with the Convention.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

 (New South Wales) (16:06):  Minister, I think you are the fourth or fifth minister who has been asked questions about this. Perhaps we will be able to get some answers from you that we have been unable so far to get from others. Why is this not a bill that can be improved or should be improved through potential amendments designed to increase the amount of disclosure? So far, the debate we have been having and the questions we have been asking have centred around why different information has or has not been provided and why different reasoning has been provided. I want to ask a more specific and direct question: does the government believe that this bill can be improved through the supporting of amendments?

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-11-11,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (16:08):  I want to reiterate the position of those of us on this side of politics. I believe—and Senator Cash made a point of referring to earlier remarks I had made in this chamber—that this is a good bill. I believe this bill warrants support. I believe this bill goes a long way towards making sure that there is a greater level of transparency and that there are stronger rules around multinational tax avoidance. I believe that former Treasurer Mr Joe Hockey should be commended for the work he has done on this bill. But I also believe that this is not a perfect bill. I also believe that this bill, while it is a good bill and is better than the current situation and circumstances, is one that could actually do with improvement. It is a bill that could do with some changes.


I want to draw your attention to potential changes around the area of making sure there is greater disclosure for private Australian companies that have over $100 million in revenue in any given year. I know this is slightly unfair on the minister, because some of us in this chamber have been part of this debate for the past day and are coming into this with a lot more information. I note that the minister is acting in the capacity at the moment. Minister Cormann, who is perhaps the person who would normally have carriage of this, is at the moment on very important government business in Turkey. So, acknowledging that there is perhaps a limited level of information you may have available to you, Minister, I do believe there is an opportunity.


We heard from Senator Xenophon today about his concerns for the releasing of information about companies of over $100 million. The concern that Senator Xenophon had was one of ensuring that businesses that released this information were not taken advantage of in the chain of responsibility, and also by other companies. The concern would be this. If I were a company, a family business, I may have quite significant revenue—let us say it is $100 million, $120 million or $150 million. I may have a concern that the publication of that information would materially hurt my business in its negotiations with some larger suppliers, a classic example being your Coles or your Woolworths, who are well-known for being quite aggressive in some of their techniques and in how they drive these things.


I do not believe those concerns are right. The reason I do not believe that Senator Xenophon is right in this is that the information made available is available elsewhere. In fact, you can get all of that information, and more, by paying $38 to ASIC. ASIC will provide you with a more detailed series of that type of information, simply with the payment of $38. I believe there is the potential, however, to allow the exclusion of those types of companies by giving the tax office the opportunity to remove them. Would the government consider supporting an amendment that would actually address the concerns raised by Senator Xenophon but would nonetheless address those issues?

To make it clear for you, the disclosure requirements we are seeking to include are: the ABN and name of the company or individual; the total income for the income year; the taxable or net income, if any, for the income year; and, income tax payable, if any, for the financial year.


We are asking for four things which are nowhere near as substantial as what has been lodged at ASIC. In fact, Senator Xenophon showed me an ASIC request, which he had done this morning, I presume, for another South Australian company. I looked at it very briefly and it was full of consolidated accounts and information. So where does the red-tape argument come from if we are simply asking for four things to be taken out of that and added to a register for around 1,000 companies? Perhaps that is the last piece of information. We estimate that around 1,000 companies would be captured by this register.

Let me try another tack where I do want information. Your government was talking in the budget this year about a voluntary corporate disclosure code. Could you explain to the committee why you have moved from a voluntary to a mandatory code in the legislation that we were debating for multinationals with a turnover of more than $1 billion?

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-11,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:18):  We often have this debate between mandatory and voluntary codes, or regulations, let's say. In this budget the previous Treasurer, Joe Hockey, introduced an idea to have a  voluntary corporate disclosure code where the Treasurer was very clear about the need for disclosure by corporations in paying their fair share of tax, and he even said that it will discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance. This is the idea of disclosure, and I presume that is behind the bill that you originally brought in that we are about to move an amendment to.


I think that, clearly, we are on the same page with the government, the LNP, and I suppose I should include the Nationals in that. The Greens, Labor and the crossbenchers all think that disclosure is a good thing, which is the whole basis of your bill. The Treasurer made it very clear that disclosure was important and said:


It will also discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.


He then said:


The Government would like more companies, particularly large multinationals … to publicly disclose their tax affairs.


That is what we are asking for. You are saying that it is for $1 billion or more. I am asking: why, firstly, did you move from the idea of a voluntary code to a mandatory code—hence the legislation—and, secondly, why you did not go with the $100 million as the threshold, because that was the previous legislation? Why $1 billion?

Application of amendments



   The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to an entity for the 2013‑14 income year and each later income year unless the Commissioner has, before the commencement of this Schedule, made publicly available information about the entity for the income year under subsection 3C(2) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.


This amendment before us is a slightly amended version of the amendment that the Greens put up last night, which had not been put through the committee. We had circulated it but it was not moved. I thank the ALP for doing some hard work in the last 24 hours to improve the amendment, and thank some of the Independents who have given us feedback on the amendment.


The amendment that I have just moved relates to the repeal of the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Act 2015, which we have discussed for well over a day, but there is additional information which Senator Xenophon will no doubt want to talk to. We have included a clause, part 3, clause 4, after subsection 3C(2), where we have inserted, under 2A:


If:


   (a) an entity applies to the Commissioner in writing; and


   (b) at the end of the income year the entity is an Australian resident that is a private company for the income year that neither:


      (i) is a member of a wholly owned group that has a foreign resident ultimate holding company; or


      (ii) has a foreign shareholding percentage of 50% or greater; and


   (c) the Commissioner—


that is obviously the Tax Commissioner—


is satisfied that to make the information publicly available may be significantly prejudicial to any of the entity's current or future commercial negotiations;


the Commissioner may determine that subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the entity. An expression used in this subsection that is also used in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 has the same meaning as in that Act.


This is to allay concerns that some senators, including Senator Xenophon, have received from companies that somehow the disclosure of their information may be prejudicial, so we wanted to be very cognisant of the fact that, if that is the case and there is a basis for that, those companies can actually receive a judgement from the commissioner on the particular circumstance that relates to their commercial considerations.


We have also inserted in clause 5:


After subsection 3C(3)


   Insert:


   (3A) The Commissioner must ensure that the information made publicly available under subsection (2) includes:


   (a) a statement to the effect that:


      (i) the information may not reflect the full financial position of the entity; and


      (ii) more comprehensive information may be available from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission; and


   (b) the address for the part of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's website via which the information referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) may be found.


We have put in a really simple clause that makes a lot of sense. We are putting it up-front that, if you are going to make judgements about, say, people's tax avoidance from the register, or tax evasion or tax minimisation or tax paid, look at the detail first. In other words, go to ASIC, go to the website, and get the information before you make a judgement. Let's make it clear: that is a very important piece of information. If you are worried that the tabloid press might use this to beat up on rich people or whatever, there is a very clear sign that there is more detailed information available on the ASIC website and that you should not draw those conclusions.


Nevertheless, this information will increase transparency and the disclosure will help raise awareness and educate the public on the importance of avoidance of tax and tax minimisation. Let's be honest: the government has been happy to keep these regulations on foreign companies with over $100 million. Foreign companies have to put this information on a register, but you seem to have a reason for not explaining why Australian companies with over $100 million have been exempted. Now both foreign and domestic companies will be required to put this information on a register. That is what we have been asking for.


As I very importantly pointed out, Senator McGrath, this is what the Treasurer was talking about in his budget statement this year. I will read you his words again. He was talking about a voluntary code, but this is a mandatory code and it will highlight companies that are paying their fair share of tax. It could be a good thing for companies that are paying their fair share of tax and it will put to bed any potential issues that people may have. It will also discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance. So it rewards the companies that are doing the right thing and it may be a disincentive, through reputational risk or otherwise, for companies that are doing the wrong thing.


The Treasurer then said:


The government would like more companies—


we estimate 1,000 domestic companies will have to comply with this legislation or the ATO will have to provide their details—


particularly large multinationals operating in Australia, to publicly disclose their tax affairs.


That is it. That is from your own government. That is what we are doing here tonight, but we are not shielding Australian companies with over $100 million or wealthy Australians from disclosure of their tax affairs. The whole point is to have that disclosure up-front and put it in the public domain, and raise education, awareness and debate around issues on tax avoidance, which is what a broad range of stakeholders has been asking for. The Greens—and I think Labor and hopefully others in this chamber—believe this is good legislation and that you will support it and make sure that we have a good set of laws in this country relating to disclosure of tax affairs.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-11,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:28):  I indicate that I will be supporting this amendment for these reasons. I want to set them out and I want to put this in appropriate context. A few weeks ago, the government's bill exempting companies with more than $100 million in revenue, not in profits, from publishing some basic headline details—essentially of revenue, taxable income and tax payable—was passed. I reluctantly supported that legislation because the argument that was put to me, which I thought had some credibility at the time, was that there could be companies, particularly food processors that may have turnover of $100 million a year or more in their commercial dealings with, say, Coles or Woolworths, that would be prejudiced by the publication of this information. I apologise to the Senate because I did not do my due diligence as I ought to have in relation to that piece of legislation. If you look at what is currently available, if you are a company with a turnover of $25 million a year or more—not $100 million but $25 million a year or more—you are required to provide to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC, a copy of financial statements and reports.


Today, I spent $38 and got a copy of Teys Australia Pty Ltd—not because I am picking on them, but because they are referred to in the Senate inquiry report on this and they were a company that were good enough to express concerns about that transparency measure. If you look at that, the information given is very comprehensive. It gives statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income at page 5. It gives statements of financial position at page 6, including current tax liability, and at page 24, in the notes for the financial statement, it actually talks about the level of income tax paid. So it is not as though Coles and Woolies would not have this information if they wanted to find it. I think it is stretching it to say that those companies would be prejudiced in their commercial dealings with Coles and Woolies, because there is, in any event, a requirement to publish this information with a much lower threshold of $25 million.


But I will support these amendments because they take into account that, if there were, in exceptional circumstances, a case where the publication of this headline information of revenue, taxable income and tax paid would in any way be prejudicial to a company, you could seek an exemption from the commissioner. That is why I supported the government's bill in the first place. I do not accept that there is unreasonable red tape with these amendments, for the simple reason that these companies, once they hit a threshold of $25 million—not $100 million—have to provide this information to ASIC in any event. But you need to pay $38 for that. That is the case. I am very happy for the assistant minister to correct me on that if that is not the case, but that is my clear understanding, based on the evidence that has been provided to me. 


I will support these amendments. They still keep the integrity of what the government passed several weeks ago intact, in that, if there were any suggestion that a company would be prejudiced by the release of headline information in their commercial dealings with a much larger company in any negotiations, they would still be protected from that—although, for the cost of $38 you can get a hell of a lot of information by going on the ASIC site. I think it is appropriate to pass these amendments. I see these amendments as being within the context of the very good intent of this bill introduced by the government as a result of the very hard work done in relation to this by former Treasurer the Hon. Joe Hockey. I support these amendments. I know the government's position is that this is not relevant, like the general purpose reporting amendment that was passed last night—the amendment that I moved, which was supported by a majority of the Senate—but I say it is relevant because it is all about having a level of transparency, encouraging public debate on the issue of multinational tax avoidance, and making sure that people pay their fair share of tax. I see these amendments within that broader context.


So, for those reasons, I support these amendments. They provide a very important protection in the very unlikely event that there could be any risk to any food processors—for instance, any agricultural company—in their dealings with a much bigger company. And I am thinking of Coles and Woolworths—not that I would suggest that they would behave unfairly with any suppliers, but those allegations have been made. These amendments provide that protection. So, for those reasons, I support the amendments.

So far, the debate we have been having and the questions we have been asking have centred around why different information has or has not been provided and why different reasoning has been provided.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (16:08):  I want to reiterate the position of those of us on this side of politics. I believe—and Senator Cash made a point of referring to earlier remarks I had made in this chamber—that this is a good bill. I believe this bill warrants support. I believe this bill goes a long way towards making sure that there is a greater level of transparency and that there are stronger rules around multinational tax avoidance. I believe that former Treasurer Mr Joe Hockey should be commended for the work he has done on this bill. But I also believe that this is not a perfect bill. I also believe that this bill, while it is a good bill and is better than the current situation and circumstances, is one that could actually do with improvement. It is a bill that could do with some changes.


I want to draw your attention to potential changes around the area of making sure there is greater disclosure for private Australian companies that have over $100 million in revenue in any given year. I know this is slightly unfair on the minister, because some of us in this chamber have been part of this debate for the past day and are coming into this with a lot more information. I note that the minister is acting in the capacity at the moment. Minister Cormann, who is perhaps the person who would normally have carriage of this, is at the moment on very important government business in Turkey. So, acknowledging that there is perhaps a limited level of information you may have available to you, Minister, I do believe there is an opportunity.


We heard from Senator Xenophon today about his concerns for the releasing of information about companies of over $100 million. The concern that Senator Xenophon had was one of ensuring that businesses that released this information were not taken advantage of in the chain of responsibility, and also by other companies. The concern would be this. If I were a company, a family business, I may have quite significant revenue—let us say it is $100 million, $120 million or $150 million. I may have a concern that the publication of that information would materially hurt my business in its negotiations with some larger suppliers, a classic example being your Coles or your Woolworths, who are well-known for being quite aggressive in some of their techniques and in how they drive these things.


I do not believe those concerns are right. The reason I do not believe that Senator Xenophon is right in this is that the information made available is available elsewhere. In fact, you can get all of that information, and more, by paying $38 to ASIC. ASIC will provide you with a more detailed series of that type of information, simply with the payment of $38. I believe there is the potential, however, to allow the exclusion of those types of companies by giving the tax office the opportunity to remove them. Would the government consider supporting an amendment that would actually address the concerns raised by Senator Xenophon but would nonetheless address those issues?

 (Tasmania) (16:13):  Senator McGrath, welcome to the chamber—the chamber of horrors for you guys, no doubt, given that I think you are the fifth person we have had on the front bench dealing with this bill and the proposed amendments. You referred to greater red tape. Could you be more precise about that, given that the financial information these companies have to give to ASIC is already lodged, and it is a lot more extensive than what we are asking for. To make it clear for you, the disclosure requirements we are seeking to include are: the ABN and name of the company or individual; the total income for the income year; the taxable or net income, if any, for the income year; and, income tax payable, if any, for the financial year.


We are asking for four things which are nowhere near as substantial as what has been lodged at ASIC. In fact, Senator Xenophon showed me an ASIC request, which he had done this morning, I presume, for another South Australian company. I looked at it very briefly and it was full of consolidated accounts and information. So where does the red-tape argument come from if we are simply asking for four things to be taken out of that and added to a register for around 1,000 companies? Perhaps that is the last piece of information. We estimate that around 1,000 companies would be captured by this register.

In this budget the previous Treasurer, Joe Hockey, introduced an idea to have a  voluntary corporate disclosure code where the Treasurer was very clear about the need for disclosure by corporations in paying their fair share of tax, and he even said that it will discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance. This is the idea of disclosure, and I presume that is behind the bill that you originally brought in that we are about to move an amendment to.


I think that, clearly, we are on the same page with the government, the LNP, and I suppose I should include the Nationals in that. The Greens, Labor and the crossbenchers all think that disclosure is a good thing, which is the whole basis of your bill. The Treasurer made it very clear that disclosure was important and said:


It will also discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.


He then said:


The Government would like more companies, particularly large multinationals … to publicly disclose their tax affairs.


That is what we are asking for. You are saying that it is for $1 billion or more. I am asking: why, firstly, did you move from the idea of a voluntary code to a mandatory code—hence the legislation—and, secondly, why you did not go with the $100 million as the threshold, because that was the previous legislation? Why $1 billion?

Application of amendments



   The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to an entity for the 2013‑14 income year and each later income year unless the Commissioner has, before the commencement of this Schedule, made publicly available information about the entity for the income year under subsection 3C(2) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.


This amendment before us is a slightly amended version of the amendment that the Greens put up last night, which had not been put through the committee. We had circulated it but it was not moved. I thank the ALP for doing some hard work in the last 24 hours to improve the amendment, and thank some of the Independents who have given us feedback on the amendment.


The amendment that I have just moved relates to the repeal of the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Act 2015, which we have discussed for well over a day, but there is additional information which Senator Xenophon will no doubt want to talk to. We have included a clause, part 3, clause 4, after subsection 3C(2), where we have inserted, under 2A:


If:


   (a) an entity applies to the Commissioner in writing; and


   (b) at the end of the income year the entity is an Australian resident that is a private company for the income year that neither:


      (i) is a member of a wholly owned group that has a foreign resident ultimate holding company; or


      (ii) has a foreign shareholding percentage of 50% or greater; and


   (c) the Commissioner—


that is obviously the Tax Commissioner—


is satisfied that to make the information publicly available may be significantly prejudicial to any of the entity's current or future commercial negotiations;


the Commissioner may determine that subsection (2) does not apply in relation to the entity. An expression used in this subsection that is also used in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 has the same meaning as in that Act.


This is to allay concerns that some senators, including Senator Xenophon, have received from companies that somehow the disclosure of their information may be prejudicial, so we wanted to be very cognisant of the fact that, if that is the case and there is a basis for that, those companies can actually receive a judgement from the commissioner on the particular circumstance that relates to their commercial considerations.


We have also inserted in clause 5:


After subsection 3C(3)


   Insert:


   (3A) The Commissioner must ensure that the information made publicly available under subsection (2) includes:


   (a) a statement to the effect that:


      (i) the information may not reflect the full financial position of the entity; and


      (ii) more comprehensive information may be available from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission; and


   (b) the address for the part of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's website via which the information referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii) may be found.


We have put in a really simple clause that makes a lot of sense. We are putting it up-front that, if you are going to make judgements about, say, people's tax avoidance from the register, or tax evasion or tax minimisation or tax paid, look at the detail first. In other words, go to ASIC, go to the website, and get the information before you make a judgement. Let's make it clear: that is a very important piece of information. If you are worried that the tabloid press might use this to beat up on rich people or whatever, there is a very clear sign that there is more detailed information available on the ASIC website and that you should not draw those conclusions.


Nevertheless, this information will increase transparency and the disclosure will help raise awareness and educate the public on the importance of avoidance of tax and tax minimisation. Let's be honest: the government has been happy to keep these regulations on foreign companies with over $100 million. Foreign companies have to put this information on a register, but you seem to have a reason for not explaining why Australian companies with over $100 million have been exempted. Now both foreign and domestic companies will be required to put this information on a register. That is what we have been asking for.


As I very importantly pointed out, Senator McGrath, this is what the Treasurer was talking about in his budget statement this year. I will read you his words again. He was talking about a voluntary code, but this is a mandatory code and it will highlight companies that are paying their fair share of tax. It could be a good thing for companies that are paying their fair share of tax and it will put to bed any potential issues that people may have. It will also discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance. So it rewards the companies that are doing the right thing and it may be a disincentive, through reputational risk or otherwise, for companies that are doing the wrong thing.


The Treasurer then said:


The government would like more companies—


we estimate 1,000 domestic companies will have to comply with this legislation or the ATO will have to provide their details—


particularly large multinationals operating in Australia, to publicly disclose their tax affairs.


That is it. That is from your own government. That is what we are doing here tonight, but we are not shielding Australian companies with over $100 million or wealthy Australians from disclosure of their tax affairs. The whole point is to have that disclosure up-front and put it in the public domain, and raise education, awareness and debate around issues on tax avoidance, which is what a broad range of stakeholders has been asking for. The Greens—and I think Labor and hopefully others in this chamber—believe this is good legislation and that you will support it and make sure that we have a good set of laws in this country relating to disclosure of tax affairs.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-11,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:28):  I indicate that I will be supporting this amendment for these reasons. I want to set them out and I want to put this in appropriate context. A few weeks ago, the government's bill exempting companies with more than $100 million in revenue, not in profits, from publishing some basic headline details—essentially of revenue, taxable income and tax payable—was passed. I reluctantly supported that legislation because the argument that was put to me, which I thought had some credibility at the time, was that there could be companies, particularly food processors that may have turnover of $100 million a year or more in their commercial dealings with, say, Coles or Woolworths, that would be prejudiced by the publication of this information. I apologise to the Senate because I did not do my due diligence as I ought to have in relation to that piece of legislation. If you look at what is currently available, if you are a company with a turnover of $25 million a year or more—not $100 million but $25 million a year or more—you are required to provide to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC, a copy of financial statements and reports.


Today, I spent $38 and got a copy of Teys Australia Pty Ltd—not because I am picking on them, but because they are referred to in the Senate inquiry report on this and they were a company that were good enough to express concerns about that transparency measure. If you look at that, the information given is very comprehensive. It gives statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income at page 5. It gives statements of financial position at page 6, including current tax liability, and at page 24, in the notes for the financial statement, it actually talks about the level of income tax paid. So it is not as though Coles and Woolies would not have this information if they wanted to find it. I think it is stretching it to say that those companies would be prejudiced in their commercial dealings with Coles and Woolies, because there is, in any event, a requirement to publish this information with a much lower threshold of $25 million.


But I will support these amendments because they take into account that, if there were, in exceptional circumstances, a case where the publication of this headline information of revenue, taxable income and tax paid would in any way be prejudicial to a company, you could seek an exemption from the commissioner. That is why I supported the government's bill in the first place. I do not accept that there is unreasonable red tape with these amendments, for the simple reason that these companies, once they hit a threshold of $25 million—not $100 million—have to provide this information to ASIC in any event. But you need to pay $38 for that. That is the case. I am very happy for the assistant minister to correct me on that if that is not the case, but that is my clear understanding, based on the evidence that has been provided to me. 


I will support these amendments. They still keep the integrity of what the government passed several weeks ago intact, in that, if there were any suggestion that a company would be prejudiced by the release of headline information in their commercial dealings with a much larger company in any negotiations, they would still be protected from that—although, for the cost of $38 you can get a hell of a lot of information by going on the ASIC site. I think it is appropriate to pass these amendments. I see these amendments as being within the context of the very good intent of this bill introduced by the government as a result of the very hard work done in relation to this by former Treasurer the Hon. Joe Hockey. I support these amendments. I know the government's position is that this is not relevant, like the general purpose reporting amendment that was passed last night—the amendment that I moved, which was supported by a majority of the Senate—but I say it is relevant because it is all about having a level of transparency, encouraging public debate on the issue of multinational tax avoidance, and making sure that people pay their fair share of tax. I see these amendments within that broader context.


So, for those reasons, I support these amendments. They provide a very important protection in the very unlikely event that there could be any risk to any food processors—for instance, any agricultural company—in their dealings with a much bigger company. And I am thinking of Coles and Woolworths—not that I would suggest that they would behave unfairly with any suppliers, but those allegations have been made. These amendments provide that protection. So, for those reasons, I support the amendments.

I notice, Senator Xenophon, that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, of which you are a member, recommended that there be no amendments to this bill and recommended that it be passed.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-11-11,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  I do find the rules here quite restrictive when we are interrupted mid-sentence. It should be like being on a plane where you can finish the sentence you are typing on your laptop before you have to put it away.


Tonight I would like to speak about the enormous opportunities that would exist for our nation if we were to develop the water resources of the Fitzroy Basin. Enormous opportunities exist in the Fitzroy Basin in Central Queensland. All of us in this chamber would know of, have heard of, and would understand, somewhat, the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a food bowl for our nation. It has been of great public policy interest in the past decade, and it is something that has been inquired into and looked at many, many times. It is part of our history as a nation.


Few people would know much, if anything at all, of the Fitzroy Basin in Central Queensland. There are two Fitzroy Basins in Australia—there is another in Senator Bullock's state in WA. The Fitzroy Basin in Central Queensland is the second biggest water catchment in our country. The Murray-Darling is the biggest—we all know that—but the second biggest in our country is the Fitzroy Basin around Rockhampton. More water flows out of the Fitzroy River south of Rockhampton and south of Yeppoon than any other river system on our eastern seaboard. It is the largest water catchment on our eastern seaboard, and it has enormous potential and opportunity to develop our nation and to develop a new regional economy in our country.


In the Murray-Darling system, if you add up all the major storages and dams in the system, those dams and storages have the capacity to store around 80 per cent of the annual average flows of water in the Murray-Darling Basin. There are about 33,000 gigs of that. Eighty per cent of those can be stored in dams or storages in that system. I should say that is 80 per cent as a consequence of the development that has occurred as a nation: we built dams, we got ahead, we built the Snowy Mountains scheme and we did other things in the Northern Basin to store water—offstream storages and other options. The nation has benefited greatly from all of the development.


In the Fitzroy Basin, less than 30 per cent of the average annual flows can be stored in dams or storages, which of course means that it is a much less regulated system, which of course means it is much harder for us to harness the opportunities that exist in that system currently. I believe that there is enormous potential for us to do more of that and invest in that region so that we can capture and store more of this water—put it behind a wall or in a tank and store it for later use—because water in a dam or in offstream storage is money in the bank. It is the equivalent of putting money in the bank, because at some point in the future you will use that water to grow food and help underpin the development of industry or simply the growth of towns and communities, and that is certainly needed in Central Queensland. I want to talk about all of those aspects.


Two weeks ago, the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, the member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd, and I hosted a Fitzroy water workshop in Rockhampton to discuss the options for better use of water and to discuss the need for more water in the region. I want to thank the community of the Fitzroy Basin proper. People from all over the place—from as far down as Theodore, out from Emerald and also, of course, from Rockhampton and Yeppoon—came to that meeting. We had about 130 people there. It was a very successful discussion. I also want to thank the minister for Northern Australia, Mr Josh Frydenberg, who was able to be at that forum as well to hear about the enormous opportunities that exist in this part of Northern Australia.


There are detailed proposals in place for water storage in this region and there are specific needs for more water as well. Down on the coast, around Yeppoon, the Livingstone Shire Council needs more water to underpin the development of its community and town. It is a fast-growing and beautiful community on the coast. Gladstone, further south down the road, needs more water to develop its industry. It is a hub of aluminium smelting and other industries, like fertiliser production, and it has traditionally been a high user of energy, but, wherever you want to use energy, you usually need water as well, and they will be restricted in the future if new water sources are not found. In Rockhampton, where my office is, while traditionally they do not run out of water, there is a risk that in dry years Rockhampton could be facing water storages and new storages could help them manage that risk and ensure that the substantial city of Rockhampton does not face a drought in water supply.


On top of all those things in the towns, cities and industries, there is of course enormous potential for agricultural production in the Fitzroy Basin. It already is an enormous agricultural producer for our nation. More cattle live, breathe and ultimately, unfortunately, sometimes have to do die in the Fitzroy Basin than in the Northern Territory. There is more cattle in that little region, in the Fitzroy Basin, than in the Northern Territory. It is the most productive cattle producing region in our country, but it has enormous potential for additional production and turnover, particularly through the development of more grain, more cotton and consequently more feedlots to increase throughput in that region. That will mean more jobs in the meat processing facilities that are resident in Rockhampton. There is great potential in this region.


In the time left available to me I want to spell out some of the detailed proposals that are on the table at the moment in the region and options for development. There are four main potential options at the moment, although there will be many more in the future. Four have been worked up into some level of detail. I appreciate the input we had from SunWater, the Queensland government water supplier in regional areas, who was generous enough to present to the water conference about the options. First of all, near Rockhampton is a weir called the Eden Bann Weir. It could be lifted higher to store more water and it would deliver around 80,000 megalitres a year—quite a substantial amount. Further down the road is the proposed Rookwood weir—it is not a weir at the moment—and it has the potential to generate similar amounts of water per year. Those projects would largely be for the towns and communities that I mentioned and the industries in Gladstone. There would also be some boutique and opportunistic agricultural opportunities, particularly with horticulture, in that region.


There are other projects in other places. There is the Connors River Dam, which is north of Rockhampton, in the north-east of the catchment. It receives the most rainfall in the catchment and is probably the most productive dam that is under consideration. It has already received federal and state environmental approvals—a very important aspect to developing these projects, particularly when you are talking about an area that is in the Great Barrier Reef catchment area. It was close to being built. Indeed, people on the ground were starting the early works on the dam. It was principally going to be used to supply coalmines in the Bowen Basin and possible future mines in the Galilee Basin. However, with the coalmining downturn, some of those customers have left and the mine is not proceeding as is. But there are opportunities to rework that proposal to expand agriculture, particularly at the Isaac and Mackenzie rivers—there are very productive and fertile plains close to the rivers—and irrigation in that area could potentially produce more broadacre and high-value crops like cotton, grain and others.


Much further south in the Basin, near a place called Taroom, west of Harvey Bay, is a project called the Nathan Dam. Some in this place may be familiar with the Nathan Dam. It has been spoken about for almost 100 years. It was first raised in the Queensland parliament in 1926, if I am correct, and it has been an ongoing saga. A few years ago, I believe it was the Beattie government—and I give credit to the former Queensland Labor government—that put it back on the table to expand cotton production largely in the region. It was worked up as a proposal. As part of the environmental approval process, 850 boggomoss snails were found on the site and the federal department of the environment at the time said that the proponents would need to see if the snails could be relocated before the project could continue. Subsequently, they found 18,000 snails nearby and said, 'We know that they can exist and there are plenty of these guys. Surely we can go ahead.' But not so fast—




Senator Payne:
  A snail's pace?




Senator CANAVAN:
  It is going at a snail's pace, Senator Payne. That joke has been mentioned before but it is worth repeating. Some environmental officials are now saying that those 850 snails are an important subspecies that needs protection as well. I think we need to get over this dam phobia in our nation and get ahead and build some things. I look across the chamber and see Senator Gallagher, who was a chief minister of a state which massively expanded a dam here in the ACT. I believe it was the Cotter Dam.




Senator Gallagher:
  And then it rained.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Then it rained, did it—or it did not rain? We may need to take some hints from her, because we certainly need that kind of drive in Central Queensland. (Time expired)
