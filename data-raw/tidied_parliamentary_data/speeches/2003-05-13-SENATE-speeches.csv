"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-05-13,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Minister, do you support the statement of the Prime Minister that there is no reason to terminate Dr Hollingworth's commission, because he has done nothing wrong while holding the position of Governor-General? How then does the minister respond to the fact that a sworn declaration made by Dr Hollingworth about a serial paedophile was dismissed by the independent Aspinall report as demonstrably faulty and unreasonable? Minister, was not this declaration sworn and tendered by Dr Hollingworth during the time he has been Governor-General?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-05-13,"—I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. Does the clear finding of the Aspinall report concerning Dr Hollingworth's actions during his term as Governor-General not cast serious doubt on Dr Hollingworth's truthfulness and Dr Hollingworth's judgment? And is not Dr Hollingworth's judgment also in doubt following the statement he made on the Australian Story program? He said:
... this was not sex abuse, there was no suggestion of rape or anything like that, quite the contrary. My information is that it was rather the other way round.
Minister, was not this an attempt to blame the victim of child abuse rather than the perpetrator? Was not that also an action by Dr Hollingworth while he occupied the position—while he occupied the office—of Governor-General?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-05-13,"—Not surprisingly, I support the statement of the Prime Minister, which was the first question that was asked. It is the view of the Prime Minister and it is my view as well that, during his tenure as Governor-General, Dr Hollingworth has fulfilled his statutory responsibilities in a way that has been more than satisfactory, and there is nothing arising out of the fulfilment of his duties that would warrant his dismissal. In relation to the matters that were considered by the so-called Aspinall report, there were statements made by the Governor-General at the request of that inquiry and there were findings resulting from consideration of those statements by the two inquirers, but they were not tested in a way that gave Dr Hollingworth an opportunity to respond to them. Even if they were, I do not think that they could be regarded as the equivalent of judicial findings and, therefore, they are really just the views or impressions of these two individuals who were giving advice, in effect, to the Anglican Church. The fact that they might disagree with conclusions that were reached by Dr Hollingworth is a matter of interest, but I certainly do not think that it suggests in any way that the Prime Minister should take action to dismiss him.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-05-13,"—As I have said, the inquiry by the church is obviously of interest, particularly to the church, because it was looking at a range of different occurrences and some nine different circumstances and seeking to learn from those experiences in terms of the church doing better in the future in relation to child abuse matters. Even with that qualification, I do not recall it finding against Dr Hollingworth on the issue of truthfulness. In relation to the Australian Storyprogram, that is of course an issue that was dealt with in the last—
—Bedside reading. Did you curl up with that?
—I have read the whole 470-odd pages. On the issue of the Australian Story program, that is a matter that has been canvassed before. If Senator Faulkner had read the report, he would have read Dr Hollingworth's subsequent statement in relation to that matter in which he regretted what he had said.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-05-13,"—My question is to Senator Hill, Leader of the Government in the Senate, representing the Prime Minister. Is the Minister aware that there are still civil legal cases pending which seek damages from the Brisbane diocese of the Anglican Church alleging that then Archbishop Hollingworth failed to act appropriately by responding sensitively to their complaints? How many of these cases are still outstanding?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-05-13,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Will the minister undertake to find out how many of these cases are still outstanding and report back to the Senate? In light of the damage already done to the standing of the office of Governor-General of Australia by the findings contained in the Aspinall report, which the minister is quoting selectively from, will the Prime Minister now ask for the permanent withdrawal of Dr Hollingworth's commission?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-05-13,"—I do not know how many cases are outstanding, but I know there has been quite a lot of litigation in relation to the church's handling of the issue of child abuse. There is no secret about that. Some cases are settled; some are still unresolved. Obviously, in some cases there is an attempt to lay the blame on individuals. But what I was trying to say in answer to an earlier question is that I think there is a widely held view in the community that the churches were a touch soft on this particular issue and that was probably because they were putting their emphasis upon the perpetrator and how the perpetrator could be recovered in terms of the church—how he could be forgiven or, if the honourable senator reads the Aspinall report, how to look for forgiveness and reconciliation, which I think is the language that Dr Hollingworth used. It is not surprising that the church puts an emphasis upon forgiveness and reconciliation. We who are not in the church might not be of such a mind.
—Have you read the report?
—Yes, I have read the report. I am not sure whether you have read the report.
—I have read bits of it.
—I suggest you read the bit that relates to forgiveness and reconciliation, because that is clearly the emphasis that has been put on it by the church. In many ways, most of us would say that the emphasis should be on the party that has been hurt and, furthermore, on what can be done to avoid such abuses in the future.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-05-13,"—I think the answer is no and no. It is not my job to go chasing the church and finding out how many cases remain.
—He's your Governor-General.
—No, he is our Governor-General actually, Senator. In relation to his appointment, as the Prime Minister has said, he does not see anything in his action as Governor-General that would warrant such action.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-05-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to the Governor-General (the Right Reverend Dr Peter Hollingworth, AC, OBE) and a report of the Diocesan Board of Inquiry.
There is now a sense of deep disquiet and concern among Australians about Mr Howard's choice of Governor-General. Revelation after revelation has emerged about Dr Hollingworth's management of child abuse complaints in the Anglican diocese of Brisbane in the 1990s. The independent report commissioned by the diocese is a testament to the failure of Dr Hollingworth's management of sex abuse complaints. I seek leave to table the May 2003 Report of the board of inquiry into past handling of complaints of sexual abuse in the Anglican Church Diocese of Brisbane.
Leave granted.
—This report reveals a high-handed and remote response by Dr Hollingworth, who allowed old colleagues like Bishop Shearman and Bishop Elliot to continue in high office after they admitted to child sex abuse. The government's subsequent inept reaction to the controversy, particularly the Governor-General's performance on the ABC's Australian Story program, has meant Australians have lost confidence in their Governor-General. Dr Hollingworth has behaved inappropriately. He lacked compassion for the victims of child sex abuse. That is deeply regrettable. I note the quite significant change in the words used by Minister Hill in question time today. We had the old protective line from Prime Minister Howard, who said:
... there is nothing in his conduct as Governor-General, and indeed no proper basis in relation to other matters, for me to recommend to the Queen that his commission be terminated.
That is what Mr Howard said about Dr Hollingworth on 4 May this year. What has Senator Hill done today? He has redefined this matter. Senator Hill has made it even narrower. His words today about Dr Hollingworth were that he has done nothing wrong in carrying out his statutory responsibility. He defined right down what Mr Howard had said. We assume as a result of this new definition—more than a nuance—from Senator Hill that he may be concerned about activities other than those statutory responsibilities that were carried out while Dr Hollingworth was Governor-General. I do hope that Senator Hill has cleared this new line with the Prime Minister.
It is not just Dr Hollingworth's handling of these matters that is a matter for scrutiny; Mr Howard's handling of the matter is just as inept. As Dr Hollingworth unfortunately covered up for paedophiles, Mr Howard is covering up for Dr Hollingworth. The opposition called for Dr Hollingworth's removal in February 2002. Eventually, last Sunday Mr Howard stood him down for something that was unproven—the rape allegations before the Victorian Supreme Court—but he failed to sack him when he went on Australian Story last year and continued to make excuses for Bishop Shearman. There is no choice in this matter: either the Governor-General should immediately resign or Mr Howard must request the Queen to terminate Dr Hollingworth's commission.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-05-13,"—It should be a matter of great regret to honourable senators that Senator Faulkner has approached an issue of acute public concern and real sensitivity determined to do nothing other than score cheap political points. May I say through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am very disappointed with you, Senator Faulkner, that you would try to turn an issue of acute public concern into an occasion for scoring cheaper political points. I thought better of you than that, Senator Faulkner. Your allegation that the Aspinall report, which I have read—you obviously have not—
—I have read it. Not only have I read it; I have tabled it.
—Well, you cannot have understood it very well, because if you read the relevant sections of the Aspinall report—the section concerning complaint No. 5—it would be impossible for you to have honestly asserted that the report reveals that Dr Hollingworth dealt with this complaint in a remote and high-handed fashion. Dr Hollingworth has acknowledged that he made an error of judgment—that is not in dispute. The gravity of that error of judgment is not in dispute. But Dr Hollingworth's approach could not—as the Aspinall report itself finds out—possibly be described as being remote and high-handed.
If you read the report, particularly between pages 380 and 419, you see a very detailed and painstaking response to the situation by Hollingworth—albeit an inadequate one, albeit a response that was clouded by errors of judgment and albeit a response which the Governor-General now freely admits was not a sufficient or proper response but nevertheless a conscientious response seeking to deal with a difficult situation with sensitivity. It is not to the point that he did not go far enough, as he now freely concedes he should have done. But to paint a portrait of this man as somebody who did not give two hoots about the difficult matter with which he was dealing concerning people under his pastoral care is a dishonest representation of the Aspinall report. The Aspinall report finds the opposite. The Aspinall report finds a careful and painstaking—albeit, in hindsight, insufficient—response by the Governor-General.
Child sex abuse is an issue which has arisen in various contexts over the years and has rightly become a matter of more and more pressing concern. But may I say, I hope delicately, to members of the Australian Labor Party: people in glasshouses should not throw stones when it comes to the matter of covering up allegations of child sex abuse. In doing so, I remind the Senate that, of all the most shameful and notorious cases of cover-ups of child sexual abuse in recent Australian history, one of the most shameful was that of Mr Bill D'Arcy, the former deputy leader of the Labor Party in Queensland. Mr D'Arcy, who served as a Labor member of parliament between 1972 and 1974 and then again between 1977 and 2000, was convicted of serial paedophilia in the 1960s. For every minute of every day that Mr D'Arcy served as a Labor member of the Queensland caucus, it was known widely in political circles in Queensland that these allegations were about. And what did the Labor Party do about it? Nothing.
—They made him deputy leader!
—As Senator Santoro says, they made him the deputy leader—the alternative deputy premier of Queensland. And who was the state secretary of the Labor Party at the critical time? It was none other than the current Premier, the man who now points the finger of blame at Dr Hollingworth, Mr Peter Beattie.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Governor-General</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-05-13,"—I rise to take note on the same matter. Following Senator Brandis's comments, I say: yes, this is a matter of very serious regret. The points that we are now seeking to raise are not about cheap point-scoring. They are dealing with the fact that the man involved in this case in the Aspinall report that we have been commenting on is still the Governor-General of Australia. That is the point. Nobody doubts or disputes that there are many other serious, atrocious examples of child sexual abuse, but the point here is that this case relates to the current Governor-General. Senator Brandis claims that, if you read this case, it shows an error of judgment. Let me put this to senators: please read this case and understand. This case should be a case study for anybody learning about child sexual abuse, covering about practically every error of judgment that you could apply. Let me list a few, because they dispute what Senator Brandis just put to us. Let us read what Dr Hollingworth describes as the major difficulty at hand in this case. His letter to the respondent in 1993 says:
The major difficulty is that in not taking disciplinary action I and the Church could subsequently charged with culpability ...
As Senator Hill said, he was meant to be concerned about erring on the side of forgiveness and reconciliation. No—what this correspondence shows is that he was more concerned about potential culpability. But the whole point of this matter is that this case shows that what the Governor-General did not apply was compassion for the victims of sexual abuse. There are a lot of examples of very poor process in managing these cases. You might anticipate that that would have been the case perhaps 20 or 30 years ago when child sexual abuse was regarded by much of the community as taboo, but we are talking about dealings with this matter less than 18 months before he became Governor-General. Should we accept what the Governor-General says when he says that he has learnt from his past error of judgment? Certainly his performance on the Australian Story program gave us no confidence. Maybe he has had a crash course, but I tell you that what is written in this report leaves us highly sceptical of that point. Let us look at one example at 8.6 in the report. It quotes the Governor-General's response to the inquiry where he says that he `personally carried out a detailed pastoral and disciplinary investigation'. There is nothing in this report that shows a detailed pastoral investigation.
Dr Hollingworth did not even seek to test the allegation. He did not seek to test the allegation of the perpetrator that there had been no other children involved in child sexual abuse. There had been no attempt to test that point at all. He denied that he was told that information, but he did not attempt to test that claim. Now we know that this man—the perpetrator—has been jailed for multiple cases of sodomy. Why did the Governor-General back then not test that simple claim by this perpetrator? He had advice from the psychiatrist he referred this man to that he should not be put back in touch with public pastoral care. He had that advice.
—The psychiatrist did not say that he should be sacked.
—Yes, he did. He said that he should not have dealings with the public.
—So he is supervised.
—That is not what `don't have dealings with the public' means. Senator Hill, let me say to you, any understanding of how a pastor could act in pastoral care under permanent supervision is simply implausible. You cannot expect a parish to accept a pastor who must conduct all of his activities in the public under supervision, and you certainly cannot put that sort of onerous obligation on a wife. That was the point of my question to Senator Vanstone, the point she missed. I encourage Senator Vanstone to read this report, because if she has any inkling of how you should manage cases of child sexual abuse she will understand that this is, as I claim, a case study of every major error of judgment you could conduct.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-05-13,"—There is a veil of deep concern over this issue that we are debating today in relation to child abuse and the victims, and we all join in that concern. The veil has been lifted ever so slightly, but as this debate rolls on we are going to see the veil lifted well and truly. It was given away by Senator Faulkner when, within a minute of his speech, he was saying, `This was the Prime Minister's choice.' Therein lies the motivation of the opposition in this debate. It is all about the Prime Minister's choice. Let us drag this most sensitive issue—not only for the child abuse issue we are discussing but for the office itself—right into the political arena, and who do you best get to lead the charge than Senator Faulkner himself: `Mr Gutter Politics A1'. That is where this issue is heading. All through the weekend the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, whenever he made television appearances, showed his obsession to link all this to John Howard's choice. That is where this debate and this issue is heading.
—Senator McGauran, you might withdraw that reference to Senator Faulkner. I had a think about it and I have been advised that it should be withdrawn.
—Quite rightly. I do withdraw it. Knowing Senator Faulkner, he would probably wear it as a badge of honour, but I do withdraw it.
—You are asked to withdraw the comment.
—I withdraw the comment.
—Thank you.
—Like Senator Faulkner, Mr Crean has used every media opportunity he can to make this an issue of the Prime Minister's choice, John Howard's choice—of the error being with the Prime Minister, John Howard. The trouble there is that the opposition will just sink themselves lower than they already are. The opposition will go lower than they already are and, in fact, the Leader of the Opposition will go lower, if that is possible, than he already is. That is the last thing the Australian people want. They will be awake to that sort of political tactic, of the opposition dragging this sensitive issue into the political arena for their own rank advantage. The Australian people will wake up to that and condemn them for it, and that is quite obviously where this debate is heading.
From what we heard from the questioners today in question time, I have no doubt that Senator Faulkner read the report. Among the questioners, he is quite obviously the only one who has read the report. Senator Hill certainly flushed that out from some of the questioners in question time. They have not really read the report; at best, they have read a summary of the report. When you look at the report, there were some nine complaints inquired into by the Anglican Church. You will find that, of those nine, Dr Hollingworth has acted properly on eight occasions. Of course, the occasion on which the report concluded that he did not act fairly, reasonably, properly and correctly was the well-known Elliot case, which is complaint No. 5.
In raising this issue, the opposition always read selectively from the report; they never read the whole paragraph that brings Dr Hollingworth into criticism. I am going to read for the record that whole paragraph, because the selective reading is not a fair analysis of the report itself. In some respects, paragraph 15.9 brings things into perspective. It states:
Dr Hollingworth's decision, whilst made in good faith, and in consultation, and without demur of the bishops whom he consulted, and in the belief that precautionary conditions imposed minimised the risk of recurrence, was untenable. Thus the Board finds that this complaint was not handled fairly, reasonably and appropriately.
Quite correctly, they have come to that conclusion. But, when you are debating this issue, that whole paragraph needs to be read to put it into some perspective. Complaint No. 1, which I believe was probably the issue that triggered this report, was the Toowoomba Preparatory School issue. Again, it has to be read in its full context.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-05-13,"—I rise today to take note of answers given by Senator Hill to questions asked of him in relation to the conduct of the Governor-General, Dr Peter Hollingworth, as highlighted in the Aspinall report. This is a serious matter facing the nation; it is one of child sexual abuse, its perpetrators, paedophiles and also those who protect the perpetrators of these crimes. It is clear that this government will not face up to its responsibility to address this serious matter which was raised in the Aspinall report and raised in the Senate today by way of the opposition's questions. These matters in the Aspinall report that we have heard of today bring into serious question the behaviour of the existing, serving Governor-General of this nation, and they provide clear reasons for him to vacate the office of Governor-General.
The Hollingworth crisis has left Australia in a state of constitutional limbo. The Governor-General has decided to step aside, pending the resolution of the rape allegations that have been made against him in the Victorian Supreme Court. If this were the only cloud hanging over the Governor-General's head then it might well be appropriate for him to step aside in such circumstances. But, as we know, this is not the only cloud hanging over the Governor-General. It is not the only reason for him to vacate the office of Governor-General. As we heard today, the independent report of the board of inquiry of the Diocese of Brisbane, known as the Aspinall report, found that, as Archbishop of Brisbane, Hollingworth allowed a priest to remain in the ministry after an admission of sexual abuse. The report found that Dr Hollingworth's decision in this regard was untenable. Before that, there were concerns about Dr Hollingworth's conduct, as revealed in the ABC's Australian Story last year. Senator Collins referred to that in her remarks a moment ago. The findings of the Aspinall report and the conduct of the Governor-General as revealed in Australian Story are the reasons why Hollingworth must resign as Governor-General. He must do so for the reasons that were clear last week, before the rape allegations before the Victorian Supreme Court became public. He must resign for the reasons highlighted in the independent Queensland report, the Aspinall report, whether there is any substance to the rape allegations or not. I have no knowledge of the matter; no-one does. The matter is yet to be heard, and no judgment can be made. Nevertheless, the Governor-General must resign. The reason is that there are existing grounds for his resignation. Resignation is the only course of action for him to take.
Senator McGauran spoke to us today about Labor emphasising that it is all about the Prime Minister's choice in this matter. That is quite right: it is solely the Prime Minister's responsibility. Under our Constitution, it is for the Prime Minister to both appoint and remove the Governor-General. The Prime Minister is the only office holder who has any bearing on this matter, and that is why action must be taken. If the Governor-General, Dr Hollingworth, refuses to resign then the only course of action is for the Prime Minister to demand his resignation. A failure on the part of the Governor-General to resign in these circumstances will only continue the already significant damage that this crisis has caused to the office of Governor-General.
We all know that the Governor-General has, through his own conduct, lost the support of a majority of Australians. Although I usually would not advocate looking to opinion polls to determine the future of an independent office holder, it is pretty clear that, in the case of the office of the Governor-General, the Governor-General must have community support to fulfil its symbolic and ceremonial functions. It is not acceptable for the Governor-General to stand aside while the rape allegations are dealt with and then, if he is cleared, to resume office. That is unacceptable, for the reasons I have stated. There are already sufficient grounds for him to vacate the office. If he remains in the office he will do damage to it. It is clear that he can no longer exercise his constitutional duties as required of him. He no longer has the support. (Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-05-13,"—One of the most pleasurable and most privileged tasks of a senator is to attend the ceremonies organised by veterans' organisations. At this time in particular, with the successful conclusion of war operations in Iraq behind us, it is a particular honour. Today's service men and women are tomorrow's veterans, and the Australian community is forever in their debt. In recent weeks I have attended four such functions, three of them as the representative of the Prime Minister and one representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.
The iconic event in Australia's remembrance calendar is of course Anzac Day. It is truly the one day of the year of legend. It is the most emotive—and most motivating—of occasions, particularly in relation to the dawn service. I represented the Prime Minister at the Brisbane dawn service this Anzac Day. When you stand in the official party at a dawn service and you look across the darkened cenotaph and the eternal flame and see the people in their thousands crowding the pavement and the surrounding area, you know that Australia is a unique and beautiful and brave land. You know that its people are unique and beautiful and brave. It is an immensely moving experience and one, whenever possible, not to be missed.
Each year the crowds are getting bigger, which says something else about Australia and Australians. And each year, too, more and more young Australians for whom the cataclysmic conflicts of the past are historic events—not things with which they themselves have a physical link—prove by their attendance at dawn services that, while time moves on, the spirit that moves us gets deeper and deeper into our national psyche. It says that the vast majority of Australians understand and honour the sacrifice that has brought us to where we are today.
On 30 April it was my honour and privilege to represent the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the Long Tan Bursary presentation in Brisbane. The bursary was introduced as part of the government's response to the validated findings of the Vietnam Veterans Health Study. It was designed to address the findings that suicide was three times more prevalent among the children of Vietnam veterans than in the general community of young Australians. This is the sort of practical measure that underpins the obligations the Australian people have to the veteran community.
The Long Tan bursaries, which were introduced in 2000 and are administered by the Australian Vietnam War Veterans Trust, assist the children of Vietnam veterans through their tertiary studies. They were named for the action in South Vietnam on 18 August 1966 when 150 Aussie diggers of Delta Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, came up against an enemy force estimated to have numbered at least 2,500. In those critical hours during which 18 Australians were killed in action, personal courage, teamwork, training, determination and straight-out bravery prevailed. In other words, ordinary blokes became extraordinary. Giving ordinary people an opportunity to be extraordinary is what Australia is all about.
The seven Queensland recipients of this year's bursaries were Anthony Branch of Carina, who is studying for a Bachelor of International Hotel Management degree at Southbank TAFE in Brisbane; Jessie Taylor of Eatons Hill, who is studying for a Bachelor of Primary Education degree at the Australian Catholic University in Brisbane; Katharine Regnart of Alderley in Brisbane, who is studying for a Bachelor of Biological and Medical Science at the University of Queensland; Jenna Wieden of Tamarind Gardens, who is studying for a Bachelor of Education degree at James Cook University in Cairns; Timothy Hamlyn of Toowoomba, who is studying for arts and chemistry degrees at the University of Queensland; David Rowe of Palm Beach, who is studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at Griffith University's Gold Coast campus; and Bettina Armistead of Kirwan, who is studying for a Bachelor of Psychology at James Cook University.
Also at the function, Helena King, a second-year Aboriginal student studying for a Bachelor of Health Science degree at the Queensland University of Technology, received the RSL Reg Saunders Scholarship. Reg Saunders wrote himself into the history of our country by becoming the first Aboriginal officer in the Australian Army. He served with distinction, commanding infantry troops in the Korean War. These young people are a credit to themselves, to their families and to Australia. It should also be noted that the government has expanded the Long Tan Bursary program, increasing the number of bursaries available nationally from 14 to 30.
On Anzac Day it was also my privilege to represent the Prime Minister at the National Reunion of Veterans of the Korean War 50th Anniversary of Cessation of Hostilities Commemoration in Brisbane. I place on the record my thanks to the Prime Minister for the honour he did me in asking me to represent him at this and other recent ceremonies of which I speak. I also recognise and applaud the role that Major General Digger James made as chairman of this important event. Digger's commitment to veteran matters is legendary, and his energy in advancing the cause of the veteran community, unflagging.
At this time, as we exit from the successful military air and naval campaign in Iraq, we can pause to reflect with pride that once again Australian armed forces have performed in an exemplary way in the pursuit of freedom for other people. That is precisely what we were doing in Korea half a century ago. We have every reason to be proud of our role in Korea. We have traditionally gone out to help those who are threatened or under actual attack. That is the Australian way. We have always accepted the noble challenge to help a mate. In Korea half a century ago and in Iraq this year we rose, as we have always risen, to that challenge. We put our blood and treasure on the line to give people the opportunity to regain their identity, to choose for themselves and to experience the full benefits of the democratic way of life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with fighting for freedom and democracy for others. In fact, there is everything right about doing so.
In Korea we fought successfully to make it possible for Koreans to prosper and benefit from their own brand of democracy. We helped make it possible for South Korea to build a renewed nation free from oppression and largely free from assault by the hermit kingdom that the rulers of North Korea have made of their country. In doing this, our Korean War veterans won honour for themselves and for our country. But it may be that they sometimes wonder, as Australian society and other Western societies become more self-critical—often, I fear, in a remarkably self-destructive way—whether it was really all worth it. I believe that history proves the point about past conflicts and shows that there is no reason for our country or our Korean War veterans to have any doubt at all as to the honour of the cause they served.
In March, I also had the privilege of representing the Prime Minister at the birthday celebrations of the Royal Australian Air Force held at the RAAF Memorial in Queen's Park, Brisbane. On that occasion, a special focus was placed on the women who have served our country in the Air Force, beginning with the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force in World War II. It was a particular personal privilege to be present on that occasion because my mother-in-law, Ruth Down, a World War II WAAAF and a stalwart of the veterans association afterwards, was in the contingent at the memorial.
Ruth was a wireless operator in the WAAAF, one of the many people in the critically important role of communications. Communications were vastly different in World War II from the secure data transmissions and digital equipment with which today's Air Force communicates. But it has always been the case that clear communications are essential to success, and Ruth and her cohorts did a grand job in very difficult circumstances. They deserve our continuing salute today.
It is also the case that these personal links, these family ties, help keep alive in every one of us the deep and abiding influence war service has on the lives of participants and on their contributions to the post-war world. Today, Australian women serve in combat arms of the Defence Force—in the Navy and the Air Force and, increasingly, in Army employments where you have to go willingly in harm's way. In World War II, in a different era, women were employed in support and administrative roles outside the scope of normal combat operations. They freed up a lot of male service personnel for operational jobs at the sharp end. Their service was invaluable and not without risk, from accidents and of course from actual warlike activity that from time to time invaded the so-called rear areas.
This year the Royal Australian Air Force reached its 82nd birthday. It was apposite that, as this milestone was being marked in Brisbane, the RAAF was in action over Iraq, where in World War I its precursor, the Australian Flying Corps, did a lot of difficult and dangerous work with the British and Empire forces operating against the Turks. Our Defence Force has a long and proud record of service in our national interest, and this deserves to be recognised frequently and remembered always. It has been my privilege to be able to add a little bit of that recognition tonight.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Anzac Day</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech

(1)	I am advised that Dr Tricia Szirom is a director of both Success Works Pty. Ltd. and Strategic Partners Pty. Ltd. 
(2)	See answer (1)
