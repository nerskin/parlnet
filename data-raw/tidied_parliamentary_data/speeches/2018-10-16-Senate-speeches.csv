Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:05):  I seek leave to make a brief statement in relation to the government's position on motion No. 1092.


Leave granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  When the Senate voted on motion No. 1092 in the name of Senator Hanson yesterday, the government should have voted to oppose that motion. Indeed, when this motion was first lodged in September and we considered our position on it then, we made a clear decision to oppose it to make a statement in our own words that, as a government, we deplore racism of any kind. We did not make a decision to actually support the motion as circulated. While the motion was not dealt with on 20 September 2018, that is the position that should have been maintained when it was ultimately moved yesterday. As a result of an administrative process failure, that did not happen. As leader of our team in the Senate, I take responsibility for that and apologise to the Senate.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:06):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the government's stated position on racism in Australia.


I rise to respond to that somewhat pathetic attempt at a clean-up. That's what it was: a pathetic attempt at a clean-up, where this minister has to come in and try and take on the chin the fact that they all voted for a motion that included a phrase that everybody knows is used by white supremacists—all of you did so. Now you want to come in and say, 'Oops, we made a mistake.' Well, we don't believe you; no-one believes you. Everybody knows that this is a just a craven and pathetic attempt to try and clean up your mess.


The reality is yesterday's decision by government senators to vote in favour of a phrase created and disseminated by white supremacist groups around the world is a shameful episode in this chamber. It is a phrase created by white, right-wing extremist groups in the United States with the sole purpose of causing a backlash to help convert people to the cause of the neo-Nazis and extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan. There is nothing innocent, nothing unknown and nothing hidden about this phrase. Frankly, the claim that somehow the government didn't understand this or didn't know about it is not believable. Frankly, if Mr Christian Porter wasn't aware of the true meaning behind this phrase, then how is he fit to be the Attorney-General?


As for the government senators who walked in here like sheep yesterday to stand up behind One Nation and Senator Hanson, frankly, do you really deserve to be here? Who is running the government? Are you so lacking in basic decency, so lacking in understanding and so lacking in commonsense you just walk in and vote for a motion like that without actually looking at it on the basis that somebody in some office somewhere supposedly made a mistake? Do you really have no understanding of what One Nation was trying to achieve here?


It's not as if this was a surprise. Senator Hanson gave notice of this motion almost a month ago on 19 September. It was due to be voted on the next day. There was extensive publicity at that time about the motion, its true meaning and what supporting it would say about the parliament and the people in it. It sat there for nearly a month on the Notice Paper, and yet we are now supposed to believe that no-one in the government paid attention, some junior staffer ticked it off and then government senators just filed in and sat behind Senator Hanson, oblivious to the fact that they were endorsing a racist motion designed to promote Nazis, the Klan and other white supremacist groups? It is simply not believable.


Then, when this is finally pointed out to them, do they apologise? Do they seek to recommit the vote? No. They doubled down. One after the other they lined up on Twitter to defend their actions. The Attorney tweeted:


The Government Senators' actions in the Senate … confirm that the Government deplores racism of any kind.


Senator Cormann is so outraged by this that he retweets that and then adds his own comments in support for good measure.


But do you know what actually made them change position? Not principle; not the fact that they were standing behind a white supremacist slogan; and not the fact that they were yet again lining up behind Senator Hanson in some hopeless and vain attempt to protect their right-wing base. No. It was only when the Liberal candidate for Wentworth came out against the motion that it started to dawn on the government that they might have made a mistake—not that it was wrong in principle to support a motion that can be characterised as akin to something a neo-Nazi would support; not that it was wrong to be led by the nose by Senator Hanson. What they really responded to was that it might cost them votes in Wentworth.


And hasn't that been a pattern today! The Prime Minister flagged that he's prepared to dump Julie Bishop and Alexander Downer's longstanding bipartisan foreign policy because he thinks it might save the seat of Wentworth. And, now, the government are belatedly trying to walk away from their support for this appalling motion, again, because they're worried about the seat of Wentworth—not because it was wrong. So this doesn't have anything to do with correcting the record, and it certainly has nothing to do with doing the right thing. It's entirely about trying to clean up the mess ahead of a by-election they're worried about losing.


In closing, my challenge to the government is this: if you're serious about fixing this up, why don't you recommit the motion? Why don't you recommit the motion and not allow, in a multicultural nation, this stain to remain on the record of this Senate?



The PRESIDENT:  I'll give the Leader of the Government in the Senate precedence and then come to you, Senator Di Natale.

I thank Senator Wong for her contribution and, on behalf of the government, I seek leave to recommit the vote on motion No. 1092, which was voted on yesterday.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:12):  Thank you, Mr President. What happened in this chamber yesterday was an absolute disgrace. Let's be clear about what happened. The Liberal Party endorsed the words used by white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Those words are the catchcry of people who wear white hoods on their heads. Those words are the catchcry of people who believe that African-Americans should swing from trees. They are the people who use those words, and yesterday you got together and endorsed them and gave them succour. You said to people across the country that you think it's okay to demean people on the basis of their skin colour; that you believe that it's okay that people who aren't white should be treated as second-class citizens. That's what you did yesterday. And you know what you're doing today: you don't have the guts to stand behind those words, which were deliberate and calculated.


Let's be honest. Let's actually name what is going on here. This is a party that fears losing to its competitors in One Nation the votes of people who vote on the basis of a racist ideology, and it is trying to get them back. When debate on that motion was being conducted yesterday we saw those people sitting over there who felt uncomfortable, but the racists and bigots on your team won. They won, as they have won comprehensively on every debate that has been about decency in this chamber. You should be ashamed yourselves for what you did. Rather than having the guts and owning up to it and being clear about why you've done it, today, when you've got a backlash and because you're about to lose a seat in Wentworth—where there are decent people who want to see a Liberal Party stand up for people no matter where they come from—you're caving in. You didn't have the guts to do it yesterday, and you're caving in today.


And where's the Prime Minister on this? He says it's 'regrettable'. Well, it's more than regrettable; it's shameful. It's unacceptable. There was a time when the Liberal Party would never have even considered contemplating a motion like that. With the passage of every day, you are looking more and more like One Nation and less like a party of government.


This was about politics. This wasn't about decency. This wasn't a mistake. For goodness sake, there were two lines in this motion. All you had to do was read the two lines and decide which side of the chamber you were going to sit on. That's not an administrative error; that's an error. That is on the basis of a party that has lost its moral compass. That was an error of morality and decency, not an administrative error. For goodness sake, we understand that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has problems counting. He proved that a few weeks ago when he tried to roll the Prime Minister. But that's not what this was about. This was about making a decision about the future of the Liberal Party. Do you want to be a party that represents people right across this country who have chosen to make it their home or do you want to be a party that represents the worst of Australia—a party that appeals to those people who vote for One Nation on the basis of race?


Being white in Australia is like winning the lotto. Being white in Australia affords you all sorts of privilege. Let me tell you what it's not okay to be in Australia. It's not okay to be an Aboriginal person because you're more likely to get locked up and to be exposed to your families being torn apart and you're more likely to end up dying younger and sicker. It's not okay anymore to be an African in this country because you've got people like Peter Dutton trying to sow the seeds of fear and division. It's not okay to be a Muslim in Australia because, if you're a Muslim in Australia, you get the dog whistling from members of the Liberal Party telling you that it's not okay to express a different faith. We hear a lot about religious freedom in this country, but not if you're a Muslim. If you're a card-carrying conservative Catholic, you might be able to express your views, but not if you're a Muslim.


This was a shameful episode in the history of the Liberal Party. We may be poles apart politically, but there was a time when the Liberal Party would never have contemplated supporting this motion. And now it doesn't have the guts to stand up and say why it did it. It's trying to rewrite history. We know why you did it. You did it because you are chasing those people who have deserted you, and, rather than standing up to them, you caved in to them.


Australia is a proud multicultural country. People from right across the world have chosen to make Australia home, and we are better because of it. I fear for what this election holds for those people because this is a taste of things to come. We are going to see an election fought on racism, on fear, on division. And let me tell you that we on this side of the chamber are going to stand up to you every second of every day. There are people going about their daily lives right now who, as a result of the actions in this chamber, are going to suffer the racism and bigotry that you are helping to unleash. The actions in this chamber send a message to the community about what standards are acceptable. And when a governing party stands up and says to the country, 'We endorse the words of neo-Nazis, of white supremacists, of racists and bigots,' it gives licence to those people in this country—small in number but loud in voice—who will seek to attack good people in our country. We stand up against it. We condemn you for your actions. At least have the courage to say why you did it.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-10-16,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:19):  For Senator Cormann to get up and say this was an 'administrative process failure' is a disgrace. We all sat here yesterday. We know what happened. I sat next to Senators Waters and Faruqi and looked across the chamber after Senator Hanson moved her motion. I stood and argued against it and said it was so bad and so racist and bigoted that it could have been written on a piece of toilet paper.


We sat there as the bells started to ring for four minutes, and I saw a couple of government members walk in and sit down on this side of the chamber. I turned to Senator Waters and said, 'They've made a mistake.' I was genuinely shocked that a government member would come and vote in support of this disgusting, despicable motion. And then we read this morning that it was 'regrettable' for the Prime Minister. Senator Di Natale is right: it's not regrettable; it's bloody disgraceful. 


Senator Cormann, who I've respected in the past, and the Attorney-General now say it was an administrative process failure. Where was the process failure when you put your bloody tweets out yesterday saying how wonderful it was? You voted with Senator Hanson because you wanted to prove how lovely and nonracist you are. You supported that, Senator Cormann. You backed it up. And now we're being told some poor junior in the Attorney-General's office has been thrown under the bus because you made the deliberate decision to back Pauline Hanson on this disgusting issue.


You can't say you didn't know it was coming. We sat here yesterday afternoon as you started to come in and sit down. You heard Labor and Greens senators yelling at you: 'What are you doing here? Are you crazy? Are any of you actually thinking about this?' I actually got a short tweet from Peter FitzSimons asking, 'Did any of them—did one government member of the Senate—vote against it?' I said, 'Not one.' At least some of you—very few of you—had the decency to sit there looking uncomfortable because you knew that what you were doing was wrong. Overnight, some of you have said, 'We've got to get out of this.' I guess those senators were thinking that Redfern is not inside the Wentworth constituency. This is disgusting. This was wrong. The fact that you are now trying to weasel your way out of it is just not right. It is dishonest. The Greens are right, and Labor is right: you knew it was a slogan by the KKK. You know it's from neo-Nazis and extremists. You know that. This was like the final solution speech—'Oh, we didn't know!' You have a hundred more staff than I have and I knew. My few staff knew, so you can't hide behind that.


You've known for a month about this. I stood here that day that Senator Hanson was about to launch us on the 'I'm white and I'm okay' debate. I wrote down some words. I didn't get to use them because the government and I presume the President, with respect, decided to push it down the list and we ran out of time and didn't get there. I saw Senator Hanson sprint up to the President at the end of that time for motions and complain to the President that she hadn't been heard. She knew she'd lose the vote, so she went on Sky the night before and boasted about what she was going to do. She went on Twitter the day before and said, 'Look at me—we're going to do the ""I'm white and I'm okay"" number.' She knew and she was disappointed that she couldn't get off the ground what I call the verbal burka stunt. She did yesterday. The verbal burqa stunt got off the ground yesterday, and you—the government—voted with her. You backed her, and you should be bloody ashamed of yourselves.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (12:23):  Clearly the position taken by the government yesterday was most disturbing. That has been dealt with by the speakers thus far. I know there are some very good people on the other side of the chamber, and I'm a bit disappointed that someone didn't actually intervene yesterday when that motion was being put. I want to add to something that Senator Hinch touched on slightly. It's an important thing. I want to read what the Attorney-General has put out in relation to this. I'm just reading one paragraph of what he said. He said:


It appears that, of the very large number of motions on which my office's views are routinely sought, this one was not escalated to me because it was interpreted in my office as a motion opposing racism. The associations of the language were not picked up. Had it been raised directly with me those issues would have been identified. 


I'm a bit disturbed that a staffer in this place would be held responsible for something that took place in the chamber, for a position that was taken by the government in the chamber. We all have very hardworking and very intelligent staffers. It's not appropriate for people to blame staffers for positions taken here in the chamber. I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate to seek clarification that no staffer is being held responsible for it and to perhaps get someone to put up their hand and say, 'Look, that was my mistake.' I think a member or a senator would be most appropriate.

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-10-16,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (12:25):  Let's talk about Wentworth. Specifically, let's talk about the most recent member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull. He used to be fond of saying that we, in Australia, are the most successful multicultural nation on earth. How the times have changed. How they have changed in the Liberal Party in just a few short weeks. How they have changed in Australia thanks to the lack of leadership from the government when it comes to the issue of race.


John Howard, a former leader of the Liberal Party and a former Prime Minister of this country, knew that One Nation and its divisive and racist rhetoric was the wrong prescription for this country. He shunned them. He rejected the racist rhetoric. How times have changed. Yesterday, the Liberal Party did a complete 180. They walked into this chamber and, instead of following the lead of John Howard and of Malcolm Turnbull, they followed the lead of Pauline Hanson. They followed the lead of One Nation. They deliberately chose, knowing exactly what they were doing. Does anyone in this chamber or this country really believe that Senator Cormann and the ministers and the senators in the Liberal Party are so poorly prepared and so ill equipped to be senators and officeholders in this country that they don't know what they're voting on? They walked into this chamber and knowingly voted with white supremacist racist rhetoric, to stand with Pauline Hanson and One Nation.


We have a by-election in Wentworth this Saturday. We have a by-election in Wentworth where the Liberal Party has endorsed a Jewish candidate. He must be appalled.




Senator Molan:
  He's not Jewish. He's Indian.




Senator KENEALLY:
  He was the ambassador to Israel. He has strong links to the Jewish community, and he must be appalled. He must be appalled by what is happening to the Liberal Party. It's no surprise, given the by-election reality that the Liberal Party is facing in Bennelong, that they came in here with this fiction that somehow they didn't know and that somehow they were unaware that we were talking about white supremacy rhetoric, white supremacy positioning and white supremacy ideology when we were looking at that motion moved by Senator Hanson yesterday. What is their excuse? The excuse from Minister Cormann was that it was an administrative error. An administrative error? Come on. This is the man who's the minister for finance. He's in charge of the nation's finances and he can't even manage a simple motion that comes before the Senate? It was a motion, as Senator Hinch said, that was only two lines. It wasn't hard to read.


What was Minister Porter's argument? Minister Porter's argument today was to blame the help. What a classic Liberal approach: blame the help. They say, 'It's the staff who got me into this trouble.'




Senator Cameron:
  The Michaelia Cash excuse. It's the Michaelia.




Senator KENEALLY:
  As Senator Cameron observes, it's a tactic that's been used by Senator Cash. Senator Porter picked it up yesterday. While we are on the subject of Minister Porter: Minister Porter, the Attorney-General of this nation, is the one who tweeted yesterday in support of the vote taken by his Liberal Party colleagues in the Senate to back in One Nation and their divisive, white supremacist, racist rhetoric.


Senator Cormann retweeted Minister Porter's tweet. Minister Porter was quite happy to own this yesterday. And why do you think Minister Porter might have had a view that yesterday the Liberal Party should back in a One Nation motion supporting white supremacy? Is it by any happenstance that, just on the weekend, One Nation endorsed their candidate for Pearce, which is Minister Porter's seat? He's running scared—he's got a close race there and he's up against One Nation, so what does he do? He thinks he can just pull a fast one and throw the One Nation Party a bone—and no-one's going to notice, are they? Well, guess what Minister Porter? Guess what, Senator Cormann? This Senate noticed. We were gobsmacked when you all sat over there backing in One Nation's white supremacy rhetoric. We were gobsmacked. And the nation noticed. That is why you're in here today with this humiliating backdown—'Oh, it was an administrative error;' 'Oh, I'm blaming the staff';' 'Oh, it wasn't me.'


How can you look at this motion and not see it for what it is? It is divisive white supremacist rhetoric. If you don't know that, let me acquaint you with recent history. A report from the Anti-Defamation League last year said:


On top of everything else, the phrase 'It's okay to be white' actually has a fairly long history in the white supremacist movement. While far from the most common white supremacist slogan, it was in use enough that white power music band Aggressive Force even used the phrase as the title of one of its songs—a song that dates back at least to 2001, if not earlier. ADL has tracked white supremacist fliers featuring the phrase 'It's okay to be white' as long ago as 2005. In 2012, a member of Ku Klux Klan group United Klans of America actually even used the hashtag #IOTBW on Twitter.



Newsweek, November 2017, discussed the recent history of the phrase:


'It's Okay to Be White' started on the imageboard site 4chan, a favorite online hub for young, white males who consider themselves part of the so-called alt-right movement. Anonymous users of that site posted a 'game plan' urging people to hang 'It's Okay to Be White' signs on college campuses in an attempt to bait people into an overreaction against an ostensibly benign statement. 


It is not an ostensibly benign statement, Minister Cormann. You should know that. Minister Porter should know that. Every single one of your senators and ministers should know that. It is a white supremacist statement.


David Duke, former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, tweeted on 29 July 2018, 'Never forget it's okay to be white.'


He went on to say:


Our clear goal must be the advancement of the white race and separation of the white and black races. This goal must include freeing of the American media and government from subservient Jewish interests.


This is where the white supremacy movement marries up with the anti-Semitic movement. Understand this: this dissembling by Minister Cormann is nothing more than an attempt to try and distance the government from the anti-Semitic movement while they are facing a tight by-election in an electorate that has a high Jewish population. If we weren't facing a by-election this Saturday, I have no doubt that they would stand by this motion and they would stand by One Nation. They are only in here today because they have been caught out just days away from a crucial by-election in a seat with a high Jewish population. It is not principle that brings Minister Cormann to the chamber today to attempt to clean this up; it is political necessity and convenience. It is not principle at all.


The people of Wentworth, as they are looking at their choices this weekend, have the opportunity to send a clear message to Minister Cormann, to Minister Porter and to the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. They have a great opportunity to send a message on behalf of the whole nation: 'We reject racism. We reject the divisive rhetoric of One Nation. We reject any suggestion of white supremacy entering into the mainstream of Australian politics.' It is the Liberal Party that brought white supremacy into the mainstream of our political debate yesterday. It is the Liberal Party that brought white supremacy into this Senate yesterday and endorsed it. It is not just up to us who are privileged to serve here in this Senate but it is also up to our nation to send a clear message to the Liberal Party: 'We reject it.' As the people of Wentworth go to the polls this weekend, they know that they have a choice and that they can send a clear message. They know that if they vote for Dave Sharma, they are actually voting for a party that stands with One Nation and some of the most divisive rhetoric that we have seen enter this chamber. 


Minister Cormann may well seek here to reverse this vote. Senator Wong has opened the opportunity for him to do so.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  She recommended it.




Senator KENEALLY:
  Indeed, Senator Wong, in fact, recommended it. If Minister Cormann takes up that recommendation, it is just another step in his humiliating backdown. It is not a backdown of principle. It is a backdown of convenience.


Minister Cormann got up today and said: 'I'm not racist. I'm just sloppy.' Frankly, we don't believe you're sloppy. We believe the Liberal Party yesterday showed us their racist colours. They deserve to be condemned, and I am very happy to stand with those senators—Hinch, Wong, Di Natale and Patrick—who have spoken today to condemn yesterday's vote.

  Senator Dodson, I'll take that objection because I want to make this point: when it comes to the fact that it's a white supremacy statement that it's okay to be white, I was ignorant. I had no idea what the statement meant. It was something that was never discussed in the shearing sheds, Senator Dodson, in the trucks or on the farms. I had no idea of that. So I admit my ignorance on that very issue. Life is a learning experience. I've learnt now.

 (New South Wales) (12:39):  What the coalition government did yesterday was shameless and it was shameful. You knew exactly what was in the motion; you had it for three whole weeks! So don't try to give us this rubbish that it was an administrative error. Senator Pauline Hanson's motion was exactly about white supremacy, and you knew that. You just don't give a damn! Now that you've had a little bit of a backlash, you're trying to backtrack. How low can the Liberal-National government get in this parliament?


I do want to put your minds at ease about one thing though. I can assure you, I can assure the government and I can assure everyone else that it is, and it absolutely should be, okay to be who you are—black, brown, white, or anyone else. But also let me tell you what it's not okay to be. It is not okay to be a racist. It is not okay to come in here and peddle white supremacy. It is not okay for the Minister for Indigenous Affairs to vote for a white supremacist motion. And it is not okay for this parliament—in any way, shape or form—to affirm a phrase that is heavily associated with and heavily rooted in neo-Nazi groups, the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi websites like the Daily Stormer. You all know that. And if you don't, then you should know that.


Yesterday we saw the Liberals and the Nationals file in here, one after the other, to vote for Senator Pauline Hanson's motion that was, as we all know, a slogan and a strategy that came straight out of the white supremacist and neo-Nazi playbook in the United States. Some, I must admit, did walk in here a little bit sheepishly, obviously browbeaten by the party rule. Others, however—the far Right majority it seems—walked in here quite triumphantly. So don't try to pull the wool over our eyes, saying you didn't know what this motion was all about. You knew exactly what this motion was about, yet you all sat there and you voted for racism. You voted against a multicultural Australia.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  In fact some of them were proud of it.




Senator FARUQI:
  Absolutely; they walked in here triumphantly. By voting for this motion, the government sent a message that white supremacy is okay. That's what you did yesterday. That's probably what you believe in anyway. It is a complete disgrace and it has absolutely no place in Australia.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (12:42):  I was very pleased to be part of the majority that defeated Senator Hanson's motion yesterday. It's very important to note that this motion was on the Notice Paper in September, so it's been there for a significant period of time. There was plenty of time to review it, no matter what sort of a status you have in your office regarding advisers and the like. It's easy to say that coalition senators should have been thinking more deeply, but this was ridiculous and it was disgraceful. I see children above us here, watching us, and I hope that they can have this situation explained to them in a way that gives them faith in what the adults in this room are doing.


White oppression is not a problem in Australia, and to say so is quite clearly drawing an extremely long bow. Senator Hanson then added in a phrase that was clearly designed to bait and exacerbate the situation. This motion was something that was easily accessible; it was able to be read and reviewed within 30 seconds. This slogan is used by white supremacists, and we want to move as far as we can away from that sort of behaviour in Australia. We are one of the most successful multicultural nations in the world. Motions like yesterday's, particularly when a major party is supporting them, are extremely disturbing, and I'm very glad that I wasn't part of it.

We might stand up here for minutes or for hours discussing all sorts of things, but the Australian people actually listen to what we say. There have been numerous comments on social media pages; there have been phone calls about the absolute hurt, disgust and distress at why this was something that the Senate would even consider. The Senate has so many important issues to debate and to put forward in motion to improve the lives of disadvantaged people in this country and to improve the lives of all people of all colours, creeds and races.


When Senator Hanson moved the motion in here that it's okay to be white, I was looking for a champion on that side—a bit like Ron Boswell, a former Nationals leader who stood up, fought very strongly and knew, when it came down to it, that it really mattered that our country respected the differences and did so in a way that didn't denigrate and put down the lives of others. It is not okay to pinpoint, to humiliate or to make people feel that their achievements are less important than the next person's. When I sat in here and watched senators on the other side support the motion, I was looking for that Ron Boswell. I was wondering who was going to stand up and say, 'Hey, we're on the wrong side.'


We all know that Senator Hanson has form. We know in this Senate, in the parliament and right across Australia that Senator Hanson has form. The last champion who stood up against her sat in that seat: the former Attorney-General, George Brandis. Not only did we have a champion in him but all of this side stood up and applauded. What did we applaud? We applauded the real values of this country and that we will not tolerate racism; that we here in the parliament of Australia that represents all Australians will not tolerate racism. We will not accept it in any form, least of all a senator parading about in a very important guise that matters to so many Australians and not because there was any sincere intent—the intent was not sincere—to portray the different multicultural aspects of our country. That was not sincere intent, and George Brandis picked it for what it was. You failed to do that, Senator Cormann, and every senator on that side failed to do that.


There are moments when our country needs its leaders to see things for what they are. You were wilfully blind and wilfully deaf, and you come in here now and do not even have the graciousness to say, 'I'm really sorry.' Senator Dodson and myself, and Linda Burney in the House, as First Nations people, and other members of multicultural backgrounds, sit in here hoping that the parliament will always rise above those worst kinds of our human nature, which is what we must always unite in doing in this country. We must unite against those things that divide us based on our race and against those things that divide us on our disadvantage and differences in this country.


I am totally disappointed in the indigenous affairs minister. That is someone who should have been the champion on that side. That is someone who knows what it's like for First Nations people in this country to fight to have equal rights and to be unemployed to such an extent where they're being breached at extraordinary levels in this country, entrenching them in poverty to such a degree that it's a treadmill they cannot escape from. That is the champion we needed to see on that side of the Senate. The injustices that face First Nations people are injustices that continue. Just ask the families of Bowraville, who, decade after decade after decade, still do not have the answers to the murders and disappearances of their children.


Senators, there are 76 of us. We debate so many issues in this house, but there really does come a time when we have to call things for what they are. Motion No. 1092 was the most disgraceful day for our Senate.

"Anning, Sen Fraser",KAP,2018-10-16,"



Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (12:50):  Yesterday Senator Hanson moved a motion that merely condemned the rise of antiwhite racism and said it's okay to be white. There is absolutely nothing racist about these words, no matter how many on the other side try to bully us into believing it. Senator Hanson and I have had our differences, but she is completely correct on this. I agree it is okay to be white and I commend the government for supporting this motion, at least yesterday. However, the hysterical response of the opposition, the Greens and the media to anyone daring to say it's okay to be white only proves Senator Hanson's point. Right now in the Senate what we are seeing is antiwhite racism in action.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-10-16,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:51):  I rise to make a brief contribution to this debate and explain to the government why the Greens will not be granting leave to recommit this motion. I was in the chamber yesterday for the whole of motions. When this motion came up and the division bells were rung and the government senators started filing in, I was one of the ones who were—I'll admit, Mr President—being unruly, as I was yelling across the table saying: 'What are you doing? What are you doing?'


Senators who came into this chamber from the government side of things knew what they were doing and chose to sit in those seats, so much so that, when Senator O'Sullivan came in and I was yelling at him, asking him if he knew what he was doing, he said: 'I don't know and I don't care, because you're over there, which means I'm over here. That's all I need when I come in. I don't look for the whip. I look for you people.' He then got out the Notice Paper and was looking at the Notice Paper. So it's a fiction to say that the government senators did not know what they were voting for. They did know what they were voting for, or many of them who sat there did—because he still sat there. When he read the motion, did he say: 'Oh my goodness me! I'm on the wrong side. We are making a mistake'? Did he say that? No, and neither did any of the other senators. 


The Greens are not going to let the government get away with the fiction that this was a mistake, because it wasn't a mistake. We can't grant them leave to recommit, because you do that when there is a mistake that has been made or someone was out of the chamber. I've been in this place many times when this has occurred, including with some of my own senators, because they missed a vote. This is not that situation. The government knew what they were doing, and they've come back in here because they've seen the backlash from the community—and you've heard very eloquent contributions about the impact that has had on the government. What we will do, however, is give the government leave to bring in a new motion—if they want to do that today—that expresses this Senate's support for a strong multicultural community in Australia. We will support and give the government leave to bring in a motion of that nature, but we are not about to contribute to the fiction that there was a mistake made. 


We all make mistakes. I acknowledge that. We have. I'm sure that none of us can stand, hand on heart, and say that we don't make mistakes. But this was not a mistake. Senators on that side of the chamber knew what was going on. They could not have not known what was going on, given the ruckus, quite frankly, that this end of the chamber was making yesterday—and I freely admit that I was one of those people saying, 'What are you doing?' In fact, I was probably using stronger language than that. They knew what they were doing and they still sat on that side of the chamber. Thank goodness yesterday the majority did not support that view, but it would be good for this chamber to pass a motion that expresses its strong support for our multicultural community in this country.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-10-16,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (12:55):  I'll be brief. I've seen some racist claptrap in my time in this place, but I have to say that what we saw yesterday from the LNP was down there with the worst of it—the very, very worst of it. And then they compounded the terrible error they made yesterday by coming in here today and claiming that it was because they'd made an administrative error. Leave aside the fact that the bells rang for four minutes. Leave aside the fact that everyone on that side of the chamber can read okay, I presume, and had the Notice Paper in front of them and had the capacity to make their own decisions. Leave aside all those things, and look at the context in which the LNP made the decision to vote for white supremacy in this Senate chamber yesterday. When you look at the context, you can actually understand that this was yet another step down a path that the LNP has been walking with absolute and utter deliberation for some time now in Australian politics.


We only found out in the last few days that neo-Nazis have infiltrated the Young Nationals. And, as an aside I might add, we found out in this chamber yesterday that they didn't even need to bother! Look at what the government has been saying. Government ministers were out there asserting that people in Melbourne were too scared to go out to dinner because of Sudanese gangs, ignoring the fact the Victoria Police have been very clear that there are no such things as Sudanese gangs operating in Melbourne. Again, not so much the dog whistle but the racist foghorn from Minister Dutton and ultimately former Prime Minister Turnbull, who backed his minister to the hilt when he was asked about Minister Dutton's assertion that Melburnians were too scared to go out for dinner and visit their local restaurants because of Sudanese gangs.


This government has made an absolute art form out of dancing with, and embracing, white supremacy. The only surprise about yesterday's vote was how blatant they were about it. Let's not forget they are running an offshore detention system based on torture and child abuse, and there is not a single white person locked up on Manus Island or Nauru. That regime has racism at its very core. We've seen them trying to introduce the White Australia policy by stealth, making it more difficult to get citizenship in this country if you come from a non-English-speaking background. Again, that is inherently racist. They're locking up Indigenous people, our First Australians, in record numbers. Yesterday was not an administrative error. This was a carefully calculated step down a path that the Liberals and Nationals have been walking with absolute deliberation for some time now. We do not accept that this was an administrative error, and that is why we're not going to give the leave that Senator Cormann will shortly seek.


What we are going to do is to continue to stand up for multicultural Australia and continue to stand up for every Australian to be treated equally no matter where they're from, no matter what language they speak at home, no matter how good their English is, no matter the colour of their skin, because it's only when we do that that we can give everyone in this country the maximum opportunity to prosper and the maximum opportunity to live a good life. If we are not about providing people with the best chance to lead a good life, what in fact are we doing in this chamber?

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-10-16,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:59):  I'd like to put a few comments on the record in relation to this discussion. Yesterday, when the motion was being voted on, it was clear what the motion was. It was clear that it had been put up as a provocative stunt by Senator Hanson and One Nation. What was shocking was that the coalition decided to vote in support of it. And there was jeering across the chamber yesterday from some members of the coalition who said, 'I don't know what it is, and I don't care.'


Most of us in this place knew what it was about, and most of us cared. Thankfully, the majority of this chamber was able to defeat the motion. But the government has one of two problems or possibly both. Either they have members on their bench who are just so dull that they can't read the motion that they're voting on, or they don't care. Or in fact it was all a much more calculated decision and they just got caught out. I suspect that it was the latter because we know this motion has been sitting on the books for three weeks. There had been discussions. Apparently the Attorney-General's office knew about it. The leader of the government in this place knew about it. There was obviously a decision to vote yes for this motion, hoping that only the racists would notice and nobody else would. You got caught out, and why is that? It's because, fundamentally, Australia is a decent country.


The majority of people in this country are shocked and horrified that this type of attitude is being represented in this place. And the backlash from yesterday's support of the government of Pauline Hanson and One Nation was swift and it was fast, which is why we see the grovelling response today. But to try and blame this on some administrative mistake is laughable. No-one believes it. We know there are members on your own benches who would prefer to sit with Pauline Hanson than to sit alongside their own colleagues. You're a party riddled with division. And, as you fight amongst yourselves, you want to expose divisions that are in the broader community for your own political expediency. It's revolting, it's unbecoming of a government and you should be ashamed of yourselves. You're only coming into this place today because you're worried it might cost you the seat of Wentworth. I hope it does. You don't deserve to win that seat. You don't deserve to be in government. You've shown over and over again you don't deserve to represent and govern this country, with attitudes like this stinking on your benches.


There are decent people in the Liberal Party and there are decent people in the National Party, and those people must be horrified by some of the attitudes that surround them in that party room. We know there are decent people in the Liberal Party because we've seen three of them stand up today. We've seen three members of the Liberal Party stand up and say, 'Enough is enough,' in relation to how children are being treated on Nauru, and I tip my hat to them. What a pity their voice is so squashed, muffled and suffocated inside the rest of the coalition.


You're not sorry for voting for the motion yesterday; you're sorry you got caught out. You don't deserve to win the by-election. You don't deserve to be in government. The attitude presented by voting for this motion yesterday is not an attitude of a government that is prepared to govern for all; it's a government that is prepared to do whatever it takes to grovel to the darkest corners of society, to exploit division and hatred and fear. Senator Anning stood up here today clearly articulating that he knew exactly what this motion yesterday was about. Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation knew exactly what this motion was about, and so did the government. It is appalling that it took decent Australians to have to call you out so swiftly for you to realise that you perhaps had better come in and clean it up. I'm not prepared to just allow you to recommit this vote. You don't deserve it. If you want to put in a motion that says you condemn that attitude then I'll think about supporting it. But you stuffed up and got caught.


There are members within the Liberal Party and the National Party who think the same as Pauline Hanson, and the sooner you get them out of your party and out of government, the better. It is time to stand up for decency and the history of this country, which has built itself on welcoming people. We don't need to go back to a white Australia. We don't need to pretend that there was some romanticised view of the world back then. It's 2018, and we are a proud multicultural nation. One in every three Australians in this country was born overseas. I'm glad they've chosen to make Australia their home. I'm glad to be and proud of living in a multicultural nation, in a community that accepts and celebrates diversity. We're much better and stronger for it. But we are being let down every day by the cowardice and racism that is reeking from inside this government.

 (South Australia) (13:19):  I have some questions for the government, if the minister is able to answer some questions. I want to know what the impact will be. This TPP agreement includes 22 clauses that are effectively on ice and that were insisted on by the United States in the first round of negotiations. This includes the intellectual property chapter, which contains a series of rules which lock in strong monopolies for patents on medicines at the expense of affordable access to medicines. This is particularly in relation to cancer medications and treatments, in addition to longer monopolies on data protection for biologic medicine. It's making it much harder and a much longer wait for affordable cancer medicines to be available. These clauses are effectively on ice. They haven't been deleted. Could the minister please explain how these clauses may be reinstated, should the United States agree to be a party to this agreement at any point from today onwards?

Surely the Australian people would like to know if their government tried to have these clauses deleted. If there is cancer medication and health advances available when dealing with the very traumatic issues of the various different cancers across the country that patients are suffering from today, that cancer medication should be as affordable as possible. I don't think that big pharmaceutical companies should be able to exploit time lines on patents to make them more expensive at the expense of patients being able to have access to that medication at an affordable rate. Could the government minister please explain whether they argued for those clauses to be deleted in the first place?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (13:28):  Senator Hanson-Young, as you'd be aware if you'd listened to the debate and to both the minister's and my speech yesterday, the Australian government very strongly supports the ISDS considerations in here. We heard the rhetoric from, I think, four Greens senators yesterday, ad nauseam, about neoliberalism and all of these other great Greens conspiracy buzzwords in relation to ISDS. But, as we both said yesterday, these are not new provisions. This conspiracy—I think you described it yesterday as a great neoliberal, whatever that means, conspiracy—about large corporations and losing sovereignty is simply nonsense. These are provisions that have been in place in other treaties for a considerable amount of time. There is no company that has been successful. As we heard yesterday, there was one company, and they were unsuccessful because the courts had no jurisdiction over that matter. So, yes, they are reciprocal requirements. And if we're expecting to get that benefit out of the treaty ourselves, it is only logical that others expect us to provide the same clauses. There is no loss of sovereignty and there is no breach. In fact, if we did do that, we would now be in breach of the treaty itself. Penny Wong, Senator Kitching and Senator Farrell last night all gave very cogent arguments as to why this treaty must be signed. And if it's not, and if we did do anything with the ISDS or the labour-market testing then we would be in breach of this. Again, they gave very cogent reasons last night why this has to be moved without these amendments.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (13:30):  I would like to put on the record that whilst there has been one ISDS litigation against Australia, the Philip Morris case, and that's well-known, of course there is another matter on foot right now. Inconsistent with the views of DFAT, where they've said that in actual fact there are only limited circumstances where ISDS can be invoked, there is a matter on foot at this present moment where the government disputes the ability to litigate. I wonder if that particular matter had any impact on the consideration that the government had when discussing ISDS?

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (13:31):  Indeed, it's not a matter before the courts, because as you well understand the ISDS is not litigated in a court, so it's not a matter sub judice. It can be commented on. I've asked the government, just to be very clear, how much that litigation is costing. Former Senator Xenophon and I went through a fairly detailed process in relation to the Philip Morris case. The government resisted. They eventually gave us the number on that: $39 million was spent on litigation. I have asked the Attorney to provide data on that, so the matter is live. It is not before a court and, indeed, the government's very well aware of it.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:32):  At this point I re-emphasise—and it's a point Senator Reynolds has made and it was a point made in the debate yesterday—that the purpose of ISDS provisions is to provide certainty for investors. Those are provisions that, yes, do flow in both directions. However, when the Philip Morris case is raised it should always be made clear that ultimately that case was not successful, that case did not proceed and that Australia's arguments for ensuring that case did not proceed were successful. However, these provisions provide protections for Australian entities and investors operating in other overseas jurisdictions in countries that sometimes have less well established judicial and legal frameworks, less predictable policy settings and possibly less regard for retrospective legislation or actions not being pursued than Australia has.


Senator Patrick asks about another matter. In relation to that other matter I'm happy to talk in a less public forum with Senator Patrick about some of the arguments that Australia may make in that regard. We continue to believe that on balance—and these matters are always a matter of balance—the benefits to Australians operating in other markets far outweigh the risks to Australia in the maintenance of these provisions, particularly when you then consider the carve-outs and exclusions    that are clearly made in them that enable the Australian government to continue to make policies in relation to health care, the environment, education standards or the like, which are clearly within the Australian national interest.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:35):  The point that I just made—and the provisions have never been used successfully against Australia—is that these provisions have existed in our investment agreements and otherwise for more than 30 years. They're not some new concept dreamed up just the other day or exclusive to only this matter. They have been around for more than 30 years. There's only one case that's occurred to a point of finality. That case ultimately did not proceed and was thrown out, and the Australian government's position was upheld. So, no, I can't give you a case where they've been used successfully by a multinational company or any other against Australia, because none exists in 30 years of history.


There are, however, instances where Australian investors have, in limited cases, used these provisions. I'd also just note—and it's something that happens from the extremes at both ends of the chamber—the pejorative use of the term 'multinational companies'. These provisions could well be used by Australian family companies who also happen to invest in other markets and ought to have their investments protected, too.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (13:37):  I want to go back to the matter that has been raised. I want to clarify for the chamber that the matter I was referring to is actually a matter being raised under the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. They are exercising a right to not be treated any differently to another nation that may well have an ISDS right. So that's the controversy. I just wanted to clear that up. But I do want to ask a question. No doubt as you diligently went through the negotiations—and I understand that you say that the position of the government was to support ISDS—when you got to those provisions you would have worked through those provisions. At that point in time, was the negotiating team aware of what New Zealand was doing in respect of the side letters that they were having written up?

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (13:38):  Also, as part of those deliberations—and I understand the timing may have been an issue here—it's quite apparent now that the European Union are walking away from ISDS and not allowing them to be included in free trade agreements. Indeed, under NAFTA, President Trump has managed to remove that as well. I'm wondering: in the consideration of government, firstly, did that occur after the government had already negotiated the ISDS position for the TPP? Alternatively, what effect or what consideration has the government given to other First World nations that are now pulling away from ISDS? Have they conducted an analysis of why they're doing that and considered those particular instances?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:39):  The government—and I, as a relatively new trade minister—will always consider the best possible approach that we can take in each and every trade negotiation. It is for others, such as the EU, to make and determine their own positions. However, I do emphasise the point made before—that provisions that provide a degree of investment certainty to Australian businesses operating in other jurisdictions are, we think, important. They provide that opportunity for Australian businesses to look abroad, to invest abroad and to create opportunities that then may see profits and opportunities repatriated back to Australia to some extent. Encouraging that activity by Australian businesses is good for us. It's also good for the nation in which they're investing; they are creating jobs and opportunities and paying taxes in that nation. We ought to be realistic enough to recognise that Australia is a stand-out nation in global terms, when you look at matters such as the rule of law, judicial process and, frankly, governments of both political persuasions acting in generally responsible ways that don't go and see retrospective actions that could be detrimental to investment decisions that have been taken. Not every other nation has such a strong track record. That's why we think, on balance, such provisions are useful and important for Australian companies and their operations overseas.

 (South Australia) (13:41):  Thank you, Minister, for articulating the thought process that you went through. Obviously, if I went to the Europeans or to the US, they probably would think about matters in much the same way as you have; but they've managed to come to a different conclusion. The burden of my question is: have you looked at their reasoning and have we discussed with the Europeans, and indeed the US, why they have now taken a different course on ISDS? We may well benefit from some of their experience. I'm just wondering if we've had conversations, whether we've looked to why it is that they have done what they've done, and then tried to consider whether or not that was relevant for Australia. Maybe you did and maybe you came to a different conclusion. I'm just going to the due diligence that you've been through in coming to the conclusion you have come to.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:42):  I have indicated the thought process and the benefits that we see, on balance, to Australian companies. I have also indicated that, in relation to future trade negotiations and deliberations, we will always seek to apply the best practice provisions that we can see as being available to Australia in our operations as a nation at any time. In relation to the EU, I think it's important not to completely mischaracterise the EU's stance. I'm advised that the EU has stated that investment agreements, where deemed necessary, should in principle be negotiated in parallel to FTAs. On 20 March this year the European Council adopted and published the negotiating directives for a convention establishing a multilateral court for the settlement of investment disputes. So the EU is looking at processes that do still provide for the impartial settlement of investment disputes. Both the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and the EU-Vietnam free trade agreement include ISDS and foresee setting up a permanent multilateral mechanism and contain such reference to it. So to simply take the argument and suggest that the EU have said 'no ISDS or equivalent' would be a misrepresentation of the position.


Of course, as I said, each area of a trade agreement, when we enter into new deliberations, ought to be thought of in a wise and sensible way about how we get the best possible outcomes in the interests of Australia—across goods, across services, across investment and across the whole range of different factors that a comprehensive trade agreement encompasses. When it comes to investment, providing certainty and stability around investment is important. I've outlined the reasons as to why we think, on balance, there's far greater upside for Australian businesses investing overseas than there are risks. Indeed, there are a number of cases and instances where Australian companies have taken advantage of those provisions and been successful, unlike the fact that nobody has ever been successful in using them against Australia.

Maybe this can be taken on notice if you don't know the answer, or you can perhaps come back to the chamber. Having looked at the differences, we can see there's clearly a reason why they have taken a different pathway. The sensible thing in this circumstance, I imagine—and I know you try to do your work as diligently as possible—would be to examine, perhaps, the jurisdictional issues, the bounds in which the claims may get made and all of those sorts of things that the Europeans are doing slightly differently, no doubt from lessons learned. They have had a number of ISDS cases brought against them, so they have, perhaps, more experience. I ask whether or not you could give some advice as to what their motives were, what they're trying to do with this new arrangement and, indeed, why we don't think those new arrangements would be applicable for Australia.

They could well be taken upon, in most instances, as a claim under normal domestic law and processes were the government of Australia to act in such a way. Governments of Australia of both political persuasions don't tend to act in those ways. That's why, of course, these provisions have not been used successfully against Australia. They have been used successfully by Australian businesses operating elsewhere, and I would have thought, Senator Hanson, that you would have believed that Australia's systems of government were capable and responsible and did not pose a threat to investors but that perhaps Australian businesses operating in other markets deserved appropriate protections.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:49):  Senator Hanson, I'll try to spell it out even more simply than I did in the previous answer. If Australian governments undertake actions that would, in most cases, be a breach of our constitutional principles or our laws of the land and that in some way damage, in a retrospective sense, the investments of investors, governments are held to account for that. Overwhelmingly that happens through our domestic legal processes. If you go and seize the assets of a company unfairly, they'll sue you in a court of law, because Australia's court system and legal frameworks recognise and respect that already, but the ISDS would provide an additional fallback, potentially, for investors in Australia. The reasons that the ISDS has never been used successfully are twofold. First, Australian governments don't tend to behave in that way. Second, if they did, our domestic legal procedures already provide probably better, easier and more secure avenues for investors to take action against governments that behave in such ways against basic principles.


Senator Hanson, you asked the question: why would we include such provisions? It is to protect Australian companies operating in other markets, to protect Australian businesses who think: 'You know what? I can do better than just doing business in Australia; I can also grow my business by operating in other countries, in other investment scenarios.' And we ought to back those businesses. We can be a tiny, shallow, little, inward-looking country if you like and not actually encourage our businesses to look outwards or we can be a nation that encourages Australian businesses to seize investment opportunities to go and work in other nations, and these provisions provide some protection over and above the domestic legal frameworks of those countries. We support them because, on balance, they are proven, over time, to give greater protection to Australian businesses operating in more uncertain legal environments than they give to foreign investors operating in Australia's well-established and quite certain and secure legal environment.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (13:51):  I would like to outline the opposition's position in regard to these amendments. There are a series of amendments and I won't waste the committee's time by speaking on each and every amendment. I explained yesterday the opposition's position on these questions in general terms. This bill is effectively a customs bill. It's not subject to amendment in terms of whether or not we like the agreement. It's not a question of ratification. It is a bill that seeks to implement the tariff reductions that come into force as a result of this agreement. We should be clear about what we're actually doing here.


I don't think the number of times you repeat the same question over and over again changes one thing. You've got your answer from the government. The government's position has been explained quite clearly, to my mind. I don't agree with what the government has said. The Labor Party doesn't agree with what the government has said, and we will seek to make changes to these measures if there is a change of government at the next election. But, when it comes to the specifics of these measures, the Labor Party will not be supporting any of these amendments. We will not be supporting any of these amendments, because they are essentially irresponsible, reckless and, frankly, against the national interest. They have been moved by South Australian senators, and I am surprised that they don't have a better understanding of their own domestic industrial interests. I would have thought that an understanding of what is actually going on in the steel industry would be pertinent, that an understanding of what is actually happening in the meat industry would be pertinent; and that an understanding of what is going on in the cotton industry and the wine industry in South Australia—and seafood, horticulture, cereal and what have you—would be a matter of some significance.


I don't agree with many of the provisions that this government has embarked upon, but I don't want to see circumstances, as a result of actions taken by this Senate, which advantage New Zealand and Canada against the interests of Australia. And what we've been asked to endorse here is a proposition which would do exactly that: provide advantage to our international competitors. That you can possibly suggest that that would be in the national interest strikes me as somewhat more demented than is normal in this place. Those are the circumstances in which we've been asked to consider these provisions today.


So, the Labor Party won't be supporting these propositions. This is a tariff bill that goes to change the structure of the tariff provisions. If you want to talk about the general principles of the TPP, you had the chance in the second reading debate yesterday, and you did so. But you won't be able to prosecute it through these specific amendments with our support.

The government may say that that's not likely, but actually that's not a matter for the government to decide. An applicant can simply make the application, and you can contest jurisdiction or the appropriateness of that. Say we have a situation where a policy has changed and an international company makes an application and they choose to do so, because they can, and to use ISDS as the mechanism for doing so. I just want to confirm that in the same circumstances an Australian company who is affected by the policy change doesn't have the ability to make application under ISDS for the same potential damage to the Australian company.

 (South Australia) (13:58):  The burden of my question really relates to, in circumstances in which the company chooses not to use the court—because of course the multinationals can use our court system; we don't constrain them in any way from doing that—the difference between an Australian company raising an ISDS application and an international company raising an ISDS application, because that's the mechanism they wish to go down. Can an Australian company raise an ISDS application against the Australian government?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:58):  I don't believe that would be the case. I stand to be corrected, and will double-check for the senator. But, as I indicated in my answer to Senator Hanson previously, if you look at the reasons ISDS has not been used against the Australian government, you will find that there are two primary reasons. One relates to the behaviour of Australian governments of both persuasions, which don't give cause to the types of behaviours that would necessitate the use of an ISDS provision or indeed any other claims against Australian governments. The second reason relates to the strength of the rule of law that is operable in Australia and the opportunities that investors in Australia, be they domestic or foreign investors, have to pursue any claims they may have against Australian governments in relation to the decisions of those governments. So I think the compounding factors there are such that, as I say, there's no scenario I can conceive of where an ISDS provision would provide preferential access for people to dispute matters in Australia in a way that couldn't be done through normal domestic provisions and arrangements.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:19):  I have some questions for the government, if the minister is able to answer some questions. I want to know what the impact will be. This TPP agreement includes 22 clauses that are effectively on ice and that were insisted on by the United States in the first round of negotiations. This includes the intellectual property chapter, which contains a series of rules which lock in strong monopolies for patents on medicines at the expense of affordable access to medicines. This is particularly in relation to cancer medications and treatments, in addition to longer monopolies on data protection for biologic medicine. It's making it much harder and a much longer wait for affordable cancer medicines to be available. These clauses are effectively on ice. They haven't been deleted. Could the minister please explain how these clauses may be reinstated, should the United States agree to be a party to this agreement at any point from today onwards?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:21):  Why is it that the Australian government and negotiators allowed them to stay in the agreements as simply on-ice clauses, as opposed to having them deleted? Surely the Australian people would like to know if their government tried to have these clauses deleted. If there is cancer medication and health advances available when dealing with the very traumatic issues of the various different cancers across the country that patients are suffering from today, that cancer medication should be as affordable as possible. I don't think that big pharmaceutical companies should be able to exploit time lines on patents to make them more expensive at the expense of patients being able to have access to that medication at an affordable rate. Could the government minister please explain whether they argued for those clauses to be deleted in the first place?

Why hasn't Australia gone down that route? It seems absolutely crazy that the Australian government is signing us up to something that allows our government and our taxpayers to be sued by multinational companies.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Home Affairs) (13:28):  Senator Hanson-Young, as you'd be aware if you'd listened to the debate and to both the minister's and my speech yesterday, the Australian government very strongly supports the ISDS considerations in here. We heard the rhetoric from, I think, four Greens senators yesterday, ad nauseam, about neoliberalism and all of these other great Greens conspiracy buzzwords in relation to ISDS. But, as we both said yesterday, these are not new provisions. This conspiracy—I think you described it yesterday as a great neoliberal, whatever that means, conspiracy—about large corporations and losing sovereignty is simply nonsense. These are provisions that have been in place in other treaties for a considerable amount of time. There is no company that has been successful. As we heard yesterday, there was one company, and they were unsuccessful because the courts had no jurisdiction over that matter. So, yes, they are reciprocal requirements. And if we're expecting to get that benefit out of the treaty ourselves, it is only logical that others expect us to provide the same clauses. There is no loss of sovereignty and there is no breach. In fact, if we did do that, we would now be in breach of the treaty itself. Penny Wong, Senator Kitching and Senator Farrell last night all gave very cogent arguments as to why this treaty must be signed. And if it's not, and if we did do anything with the ISDS or the labour-market testing then we would be in breach of this. Again, they gave very cogent reasons last night why this has to be moved without these amendments.

 (South Australia) (13:30):  I would like to put on the record that whilst there has been one ISDS litigation against Australia, the Philip Morris case, and that's well-known, of course there is another matter on foot right now. Inconsistent with the views of DFAT, where they've said that in actual fact there are only limited circumstances where ISDS can be invoked, there is a matter on foot at this present moment where the government disputes the ability to litigate. I wonder if that particular matter had any impact on the consideration that the government had when discussing ISDS?

And, clearly, even if we were aware of it, it would be a matter before the courts and we couldn't comment on it.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (13:31):  Indeed, it's not a matter before the courts, because as you well understand the ISDS is not litigated in a court, so it's not a matter sub judice. It can be commented on. I've asked the government, just to be very clear, how much that litigation is costing. Former Senator Xenophon and I went through a fairly detailed process in relation to the Philip Morris case. The government resisted. They eventually gave us the number on that: $39 million was spent on litigation. I have asked the Attorney to provide data on that, so the matter is live. It is not before a court and, indeed, the government's very well aware of it.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:32):  At this point I re-emphasise—and it's a point Senator Reynolds has made and it was a point made in the debate yesterday—that the purpose of ISDS provisions is to provide certainty for investors. Those are provisions that, yes, do flow in both directions. However, when the Philip Morris case is raised it should always be made clear that ultimately that case was not successful, that case did not proceed and that Australia's arguments for ensuring that case did not proceed were successful. However, these provisions provide protections for Australian entities and investors operating in other overseas jurisdictions in countries that sometimes have less well established judicial and legal frameworks, less predictable policy settings and possibly less regard for retrospective legislation or actions not being pursued than Australia has.


Senator Patrick asks about another matter. In relation to that other matter I'm happy to talk in a less public forum with Senator Patrick about some of the arguments that Australia may make in that regard. We continue to believe that on balance—and these matters are always a matter of balance—the benefits to Australians operating in other markets far outweigh the risks to Australia in the maintenance of these provisions, particularly when you then consider the carve-outs and exclusions    that are clearly made in them that enable the Australian government to continue to make policies in relation to health care, the environment, education standards or the like, which are clearly within the Australian national interest.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2018-10-16,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:35):  The point that I just made—and the provisions have never been used successfully against Australia—is that these provisions have existed in our investment agreements and otherwise for more than 30 years. They're not some new concept dreamed up just the other day or exclusive to only this matter. They have been around for more than 30 years. There's only one case that's occurred to a point of finality. That case ultimately did not proceed and was thrown out, and the Australian government's position was upheld. So, no, I can't give you a case where they've been used successfully by a multinational company or any other against Australia, because none exists in 30 years of history.


There are, however, instances where Australian investors have, in limited cases, used these provisions. I'd also just note—and it's something that happens from the extremes at both ends of the chamber—the pejorative use of the term 'multinational companies'. These provisions could well be used by Australian family companies who also happen to invest in other markets and ought to have their investments protected, too.

 (South Australia) (13:37):  I want to go back to the matter that has been raised. I want to clarify for the chamber that the matter I was referring to is actually a matter being raised under the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. They are exercising a right to not be treated any differently to another nation that may well have an ISDS right. So that's the controversy. I just wanted to clear that up. But I do want to ask a question. No doubt as you diligently went through the negotiations—and I understand that you say that the position of the government was to support ISDS—when you got to those provisions you would have worked through those provisions. At that point in time, was the negotiating team aware of what New Zealand was doing in respect of the side letters that they were having written up?

It was a separate side arrangement that New Zealand did.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (13:38):  Also, as part of those deliberations—and I understand the timing may have been an issue here—it's quite apparent now that the European Union are walking away from ISDS and not allowing them to be included in free trade agreements. Indeed, under NAFTA, President Trump has managed to remove that as well. I'm wondering: in the consideration of government, firstly, did that occur after the government had already negotiated the ISDS position for the TPP? Alternatively, what effect or what consideration has the government given to other First World nations that are now pulling away from ISDS? Have they conducted an analysis of why they're doing that and considered those particular instances?

 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:39):  The government—and I, as a relatively new trade minister—will always consider the best possible approach that we can take in each and every trade negotiation. It is for others, such as the EU, to make and determine their own positions. However, I do emphasise the point made before—that provisions that provide a degree of investment certainty to Australian businesses operating in other jurisdictions are, we think, important. They provide that opportunity for Australian businesses to look abroad, to invest abroad and to create opportunities that then may see profits and opportunities repatriated back to Australia to some extent. Encouraging that activity by Australian businesses is good for us. It's also good for the nation in which they're investing; they are creating jobs and opportunities and paying taxes in that nation. We ought to be realistic enough to recognise that Australia is a stand-out nation in global terms, when you look at matters such as the rule of law, judicial process and, frankly, governments of both political persuasions acting in generally responsible ways that don't go and see retrospective actions that could be detrimental to investment decisions that have been taken. Not every other nation has such a strong track record. That's why we think, on balance, such provisions are useful and important for Australian companies and their operations overseas.

Obviously, if I went to the Europeans or to the US, they probably would think about matters in much the same way as you have; but they've managed to come to a different conclusion. The burden of my question is: have you looked at their reasoning and have we discussed with the Europeans, and indeed the US, why they have now taken a different course on ISDS? We may well benefit from some of their experience. I'm just wondering if we've had conversations, whether we've looked to why it is that they have done what they've done, and then tried to consider whether or not that was relevant for Australia. Maybe you did and maybe you came to a different conclusion. I'm just going to the due diligence that you've been through in coming to the conclusion you have come to.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2018-10-16,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:42):  I have indicated the thought process and the benefits that we see, on balance, to Australian companies. I have also indicated that, in relation to future trade negotiations and deliberations, we will always seek to apply the best practice provisions that we can see as being available to Australia in our operations as a nation at any time. In relation to the EU, I think it's important not to completely mischaracterise the EU's stance. I'm advised that the EU has stated that investment agreements, where deemed necessary, should in principle be negotiated in parallel to FTAs. On 20 March this year the European Council adopted and published the negotiating directives for a convention establishing a multilateral court for the settlement of investment disputes. So the EU is looking at processes that do still provide for the impartial settlement of investment disputes. Both the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and the EU-Vietnam free trade agreement include ISDS and foresee setting up a permanent multilateral mechanism and contain such reference to it. So to simply take the argument and suggest that the EU have said 'no ISDS or equivalent' would be a misrepresentation of the position.


Of course, as I said, each area of a trade agreement, when we enter into new deliberations, ought to be thought of in a wise and sensible way about how we get the best possible outcomes in the interests of Australia—across goods, across services, across investment and across the whole range of different factors that a comprehensive trade agreement encompasses. When it comes to investment, providing certainty and stability around investment is important. I've outlined the reasons as to why we think, on balance, there's far greater upside for Australian businesses investing overseas than there are risks. Indeed, there are a number of cases and instances where Australian companies have taken advantage of those provisions and been successful, unlike the fact that nobody has ever been successful in using them against Australia.

Maybe this can be taken on notice if you don't know the answer, or you can perhaps come back to the chamber. Having looked at the differences, we can see there's clearly a reason why they have taken a different pathway. The sensible thing in this circumstance, I imagine—and I know you try to do your work as diligently as possible—would be to examine, perhaps, the jurisdictional issues, the bounds in which the claims may get made and all of those sorts of things that the Europeans are doing slightly differently, no doubt from lessons learned. They have had a number of ISDS cases brought against them, so they have, perhaps, more experience. I ask whether or not you could give some advice as to what their motives were, what they're trying to do with this new arrangement and, indeed, why we don't think those new arrangements would be applicable for Australia.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:47):  Senator Hanson, if the government of Australia goes and seizes land from individuals and they seek compensation for that, the government of Australia is indeed responsible for that or for other assets or for other things that might be, in that way, taken upon as a claim against Australia. They could well be taken upon, in most instances, as a claim under normal domestic law and processes were the government of Australia to act in such a way. Governments of Australia of both political persuasions don't tend to act in those ways. That's why, of course, these provisions have not been used successfully against Australia. They have been used successfully by Australian businesses operating elsewhere, and I would have thought, Senator Hanson, that you would have believed that Australia's systems of government were capable and responsible and did not pose a threat to investors but that perhaps Australian businesses operating in other markets deserved appropriate protections.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (13:48):  Minister, if you believe that we have a very good government and system in Australia, why put the ISDS in in the first place? The whole fact is you have not answered the question. Who is responsible for paying it? If you have a multinational company that comes out here and is then suing the government, whether because of a change of legislation which has caused it to lose profits from its business or for whatever other reason, is the taxpayer responsible for that payment?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2018-10-16,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:49):  Senator Hanson, I'll try to spell it out even more simply than I did in the previous answer. If Australian governments undertake actions that would, in most cases, be a breach of our constitutional principles or our laws of the land and that in some way damage, in a retrospective sense, the investments of investors, governments are held to account for that. Overwhelmingly that happens through our domestic legal processes. If you go and seize the assets of a company unfairly, they'll sue you in a court of law, because Australia's court system and legal frameworks recognise and respect that already, but the ISDS would provide an additional fallback, potentially, for investors in Australia. The reasons that the ISDS has never been used successfully are twofold. First, Australian governments don't tend to behave in that way. Second, if they did, our domestic legal procedures already provide probably better, easier and more secure avenues for investors to take action against governments that behave in such ways against basic principles.


Senator Hanson, you asked the question: why would we include such provisions? It is to protect Australian companies operating in other markets, to protect Australian businesses who think: 'You know what? I can do better than just doing business in Australia; I can also grow my business by operating in other countries, in other investment scenarios.' And we ought to back those businesses. We can be a tiny, shallow, little, inward-looking country if you like and not actually encourage our businesses to look outwards or we can be a nation that encourages Australian businesses to seize investment opportunities to go and work in other nations, and these provisions provide some protection over and above the domestic legal frameworks of those countries. We support them because, on balance, they are proven, over time, to give greater protection to Australian businesses operating in more uncertain legal environments than they give to foreign investors operating in Australia's well-established and quite certain and secure legal environment.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (13:51):  I would like to outline the opposition's position in regard to these amendments. There are a series of amendments and I won't waste the committee's time by speaking on each and every amendment. I explained yesterday the opposition's position on these questions in general terms. This bill is effectively a customs bill. It's not subject to amendment in terms of whether or not we like the agreement. It's not a question of ratification. It is a bill that seeks to implement the tariff reductions that come into force as a result of this agreement. We should be clear about what we're actually doing here.


I don't think the number of times you repeat the same question over and over again changes one thing. You've got your answer from the government. The government's position has been explained quite clearly, to my mind. I don't agree with what the government has said. The Labor Party doesn't agree with what the government has said, and we will seek to make changes to these measures if there is a change of government at the next election. But, when it comes to the specifics of these measures, the Labor Party will not be supporting any of these amendments. We will not be supporting any of these amendments, because they are essentially irresponsible, reckless and, frankly, against the national interest. They have been moved by South Australian senators, and I am surprised that they don't have a better understanding of their own domestic industrial interests. I would have thought that an understanding of what is actually going on in the steel industry would be pertinent, that an understanding of what is actually happening in the meat industry would be pertinent; and that an understanding of what is going on in the cotton industry and the wine industry in South Australia—and seafood, horticulture, cereal and what have you—would be a matter of some significance.


I don't agree with many of the provisions that this government has embarked upon, but I don't want to see circumstances, as a result of actions taken by this Senate, which advantage New Zealand and Canada against the interests of Australia. And what we've been asked to endorse here is a proposition which would do exactly that: provide advantage to our international competitors. That you can possibly suggest that that would be in the national interest strikes me as somewhat more demented than is normal in this place. Those are the circumstances in which we've been asked to consider these provisions today.


So, the Labor Party won't be supporting these propositions. This is a tariff bill that goes to change the structure of the tariff provisions. If you want to talk about the general principles of the TPP, you had the chance in the second reading debate yesterday, and you did so. But you won't be able to prosecute it through these specific amendments with our support.

I thank all senators for their contributions on this bill. But, as Senator Carr has just noted, these are customs amendment bills, and the majority of the debate has been a re-prosecution of issues that go to the heart of the TPP itself and not to these customs amendment bills.

I'd also like to ask the minister to confirm for me a circumstance—and I apologise: I use a hypothetical, just to give context to the question—where Australia changes a policy in this place that gives rise to an application under ISDS. The government may say that that's not likely, but actually that's not a matter for the government to decide. An applicant can simply make the application, and you can contest jurisdiction or the appropriateness of that. Say we have a situation where a policy has changed and an international company makes an application and they choose to do so, because they can, and to use ISDS as the mechanism for doing so. I just want to confirm that in the same circumstances an Australian company who is affected by the policy change doesn't have the ability to make application under ISDS for the same potential damage to the Australian company.

Can an Australian company raise an ISDS application against the Australian government?

 (South Australia—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (13:58):  I don't believe that would be the case. I stand to be corrected, and will double-check for the senator. But, as I indicated in my answer to Senator Hanson previously, if you look at the reasons ISDS has not been used against the Australian government, you will find that there are two primary reasons. One relates to the behaviour of Australian governments of both persuasions, which don't give cause to the types of behaviours that would necessitate the use of an ISDS provision or indeed any other claims against Australian governments. The second reason relates to the strength of the rule of law that is operable in Australia and the opportunities that investors in Australia, be they domestic or foreign investors, have to pursue any claims they may have against Australian governments in relation to the decisions of those governments. So I think the compounding factors there are such that, as I say, there's no scenario I can conceive of where an ISDS provision would provide preferential access for people to dispute matters in Australia in a way that couldn't be done through normal domestic provisions and arrangements.

Today's announcement by the Prime Minister is one that follows consideration of a number of important issues that affect Australia's interests in the Middle East. I do want to emphasise that there is no change in this process—and the Prime Minister has emphasised this several times this morning—in support of peace and stability in the Middle East. Australia remains firmly committed to a durable and resilient two-state solution, one that allows Israel and the Palestinian state to exist side by side, within internationally recognised borders.


The Prime Minister has made observations this morning about the location of Australia's embassy in Israel. He has said that he has considered the arguments put forward by a number of commentators, including our former ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma, that those arguments are ones which have contributed significantly to the international debate, that, in that process, Australia should consider recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, without prejudice to its final boundaries, that we acknowledge East Jerusalem as an expected capital of a future Palestinian state and that we should be open to examining the merits of moving Australia's embassy in the context of our support for a two-state solution. He looks forward to the discussion on this matter with other world leaders and counterparts through the upcoming series of international meetings: the G20, the East Asia Summit and, of course, APEC itself. Any consideration will be subject to a rigorous consideration of Australia's national interests.

He wants to engage with the Australian people in terms of this issue. He believes that the Australian people should know what their Prime Minister is thinking, so he has placed these matters on the agenda so there can be a discussion, so there can be a process of examination of Australia's policy in this regard.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (14:06):  I thank Senator Gichuhi for her question, and the answer is very simple: it is because of good economic management. Because of the good economic management of those of us in government, millions of small and family businesses will now pay less tax sooner because we are able to bring forward our tax cuts five years earlier than planned. How have we been able to do this? It's by putting in place economically responsible policies. 


For example, under the economic stewardship of the coalition government, the economy has now grown 3.4 per cent throughout this year. That is actually the best since the mining boom. It is also a fact that, as a result of the policies that the coalition government has put in place, in excess of 1.1 million jobs have been created. Our economy is getting stronger, and our budget position is improving. The policies that have been implemented by our government will ensure, as well, that we're able to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. We will bring the budget back to balance sooner rather than later. But we will also be able to provide tax relief to small and family businesses in Australia five years earlier than planned. 


These are types of policies you as a government are able to deliver when you put in place responsible economic management. You are able to build a strong and a resilient economy that gives every single Australian—in particular, those who are out there having a go—the opportunity to pursue their dreams. It's because of our responsible economic management that small and family businesses in Australia will receive tax cuts five years earlier than planned. (Time expired)

In the 2018 budget, we continued to put in place policies that will improve the economic conditions for small and family businesses. As you'd be aware, we extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off for another 12 months. As I travel around Australia, I have the opportunity of meeting so many small and family businesses that have told me about—or, at least, shown me—the equipment they have invested in, again as a result of this government's policy. Those of us on this side of the chamber will back small and family business every step of the way.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (14:09):  When you actually get a tax cut, like we're giving, bringing them forward five years early, it means you as a business keep more of the money that you have generated. We want to see businesses being able to keep more of the money that they work hard to generate. For example, if you're a small business and you're turning over a profit of around half a million dollars a year, as a result of this government, the Liberal-National government, bringing forward its tax cuts you will have an additional $7½ thousand in 2021 to reinvest back into your business and your staff and to help manage cashflow. The following year, when the 25 per cent tax rate cuts in, these businesses with half a million dollars profit will have approximately $12½ thousand extra. We will back small and family business every step of the way. We want to ensure they have, and they keep, more of their money, which they work so hard to generate.

The Australian government remains firmly committed to a two-state solution that allows Israel and a future Palestinian state to exist side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:30):  I thank Senator Stoker for her question and her interest in the development of northern Australia, particularly North Queensland in her home state. It's been just over three years now since the government announced the first white paper to develop northern Australia in our nation's history. Tonight I will join a function of more than 150 people from northern Australia here at Parliament House to recognise the annual statement that is made to parliament around the development of northern Australia. It's important to remember this is a 20-year plan. We have a 20-year plan to develop northern Australia, and we need to keep the pace going. We need to have persistence to see this plan through and to develop opportunities for all Australians but, of course, particularly those Australians that live in the 40 per cent of Australia that makes up northern Australia.


Since announcing that white paper just over three years ago, we have provided $700 million for roads right across northern Australia. That includes 37 projects, 32 of which are complete, underway or fully approved. We have put aside more than $200 million to develop water infrastructure across northern Australia, including $176 million for the Rookwood Weir in Central Queensland, as well as 15 other feasibility studies, nine of which are complete. The CRC funding innovative research in food, agriculture and tropical health in northern Australia has also been established; there is $75 million towards it. Overall, 38 of the 51 measures that were in the white paper three years ago are now complete, and the rest are continuing to be underway and moving towards completion.


As I said, this is a decades-long nation-building plan for our country. The key thing now is that we do get buy-in from all sides of politics and from state and territory governments to continue to push forward with the development of our nation, not just for the people of northern Australia but so that all Australians can benefit from the development of Australia and more economic opportunity therein.

 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:32):  In the time permitted, I might just focus on a few particular projects, because our agenda is project focused. It is focused on delivering tangible, concrete things that can deliver results for northern Australia. The Rookwood Weir in Central Queensland that I mentioned earlier will double agricultural production in the Fitzroy Basin, the second largest water catchment in our whole nation. That will deliver 2,100 jobs. It will drought-proof the towns of Rocky and Gladstone as well. There are some of the roads I mentioned. The development of the Hann Highway will make the first sealed route from Cairns to Melbourne in our country. That road will cut travel times by eight hours for the freight sector and shorten the trip by 800 kilometres, an enormous benefit, particularly to our banana growers and horticulture producers in North Queensland. We're also building the Outback Way. We've put $330 million towards building just the third sealed route across our continent in our nation's history, a massive nation-building project. Almost $1 billion has been allocated by the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility towards projects that will create jobs in northern Australia too.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (14:33):  We've already built on the $6 billion white paper process to develop northern Australia in this year's budget, where a further $1½ billion was allocated to the Roads of Strategic Importance program. This program is to build on the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program and the Northern Australia Roads Program, which I mentioned in answers to previous questions. That will help unlock even more economic opportunity for northern Australia. We are receiving back some of those water feasibility studies which show that dams can be built across northern Australia, including recent CSIRO work which has identified six new dam proposals across northern Australia. We must support development for our Indigenous Australians, who make up more than 15 per cent of the population in northern Australia, and particularly respect their views when they want development to occur, whether it's in the cape or with the development of the Carmichael coal project, where 294 out of the 295 Wangan and Yagalingu people who voted on this project voted for the Adani mine. They want it to go ahead, and we should support the views of the Aboriginal Australians who want to see jobs.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Dodson today relating to a vote on a motion concerning anti-white racism.


When I was a boy I grew up with the slogans whereby white folks were referred to as 'merinos'. That meant that they dominated the land and they took control of the best pieces of land, and that particular activity was known as 'peacocking'. So, they stole the best pieces of land from the Aboriginal peoples. It seems that we haven't moved very far in terms of this notion of greed that underpins racism.


What is the problem with being white? What is the problem? You have privilege. You have influence. You control every strata of life where we as First Nations exist—our social, our religious and our economic positions. And you've been in control of these lands and these waters and have managed them for the last 200 years. So, what's your problem? Over this time you have sought, through your policies, to exterminate the First Nations people, who happen to be different in colour from your whiteness. As I've said, you've managed every activity of our life, through policies and practices, if not of the gun then of bureaucrats and police. You've usurped our sovereign lands, and the waters, and you continue to deny us a rightful place in the Constitution of this nation. So, what's your problem? You've got the power, you've got the influence, you've got the status and you've got the might, and you say you're being discriminated against.


Well, join my side of the tracks, where we're the most poverty-stricken group in the country. We're the most incarcerated group in the country. Our kids are being taken off us and being put out into out-of-home care with the hope they'll be fostered out to white folks. We're people who are denied our rightful place in this country at every point. When it butts up against the multinationals, you amend the Native Title Act to suit the corporates. And you say you're disadvantaged and that you're being discriminated against. Well, join my side of the tracks and you'll find out what that means.


This is not really a question of colour. This is not a question of black and white. We're human beings. Maybe you want to study that a bit, and find out from people who understand that we come from one set of genes, with variations in our cultures, our customs and our practices. There's no superiority in white or black. We're human beings. And the day you want to become an Australian, then start to learn from the First Australians how to live in this country.


The act of government senators yesterday in support of this slogan by white supremacists really happened not because of a staffer who they tried to condemn and not because of some overworked senators who have responsibility for government business in the Senate. Let me suggest: it comes from being privileged. It comes from being privileged and allowing greed to reign. It comes from being white being synonymous with privilege and power. That's what has to be taken stock of, if we're ever going to lead to fairness for the rest of the nation's populations.


As I've said, the First Nations are poverty-stricken, powerless, overincarcerated and do not live with privilege or opportunities to exercise a voice in these halls of power and fame. If you want to fight racism—and I really doubt whether you do after this performance and previous performances going back to the last Prime Minister—you have to do something about greed and power. You definitely do. Take stock of it. You're leading the country nowhere, from a civil society point of view. You can argue about economics, but from a civil society point of view you're not contributing to the building of this nation as a coherent, social, civil society. You're seeking to drive wedges and drive further discord and division amongst people who are honest and fair in the main, and you'd do that on the basis of colour. I condemn you for it. You use power so well, not just to send a dog whistle; you actually had a bull's roar in here. It's not a dog whistle— (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-10-16,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:07):  Senator Cash gave a very sensitive answer to the question that was posed to her earlier in question time. Let's be very clear in this debate. There is the suggestion that we on this side are somehow racist, but we were the first party to endorse and have elected to this parliament somebody from the First Nations—namely, former senator Neville Bonner. This just destroys Senator Dodson's political argument. And it is a very political argument that is not based on the evidence. 


We then move on to ask: which party provided the first Indigenous minister of the Crown in the federal parliament? Well, it's Minister Wyatt, from Western Australia. Yet, somehow, we are trying to discriminate against the First Nations people when we have embraced them into our party, endorsed them and, indeed, ensured that they are part and parcel of mainstream democracy in Australia. I would invite Senator Dodson to listen to a former president of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Mundine, who has a lot of things to say about the sort of politics and rhetoric in which Senator Dodson has just engaged. It is not assisting the Indigenous community or in building bridges between the various communities within Australia. I would also invite him to listen to the Indigenous councillor, the Country Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Lingiari, Councillor Jacinta Price. She has also spoken very strongly about the sort of divisive rhetoric that Senator Dodson engaged in and which is not helpful.


Let there be no doubt that this country has to continually deal with the legacy of white settlement and the impact that it has had on the Indigenous community, but it's not assisted by the sort of language that was unfortunately used by Senator Dodson. I would just invite him to come with us on the journey of seeking, for example, to engage the Indigenous community with education, because, within the Indigenous community, if people have achieved a certificate IV, then in relation to matters economic and being part and parcel of mainstream society it is very difficult to show that there has been discrimination. That is part and parcel of the work that Andrew Forrest has been able to provide to this parliament on a number of occasions. That is why Minister Scullion, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, is so anxious to ensure that we get our Indigenous community to have their children attend school so that they too can benefit from the economic wellbeing within Australia. If they are able to achieve certificate IV, they are well and truly on the track, along with every other Australian.


That is how we seek to address the difficult elements that the Indigenous community face. That is how one deals with these things, not by the sort of rhetoric, with respect, from Senator Dodson. That does not help the debate. That does not help Indigenous people to become part and parcel of enjoying all the things that we all, as Australians, ought to be able to enjoy. So I say divisive rhetoric does not help; practical solutions do. We on this side do celebrate the likes of former senator Neville Bonner, the Hon. Ken Wyatt, Country Liberal Party candidate Jacinta Price and, of late, Warren Mundine. (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2018-10-16,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:12):  What a regrettable contribution on the part of Senator Abetz to this very, very serious question. Now, Senator Abetz and those opposite really are taking the people of Australia for mugs in this whole exercise. To put to us that this exercise was just an administrative error really beggars belief. I would put it to those opposite to seriously consider that there is something wrong at the very heart of the decision-making processes of this dysfunctional government. For a government to pretend that there was an administrative error involved in supporting this appalling One Nation motion just beggars belief, and I'm sure the people of Australia will understand that.


What is quite clearly evident here is that this is a government which is totally driven by polls. It's quite clear to me that Mr Porter, in his decision to wave through the One Nation resolution, was really looking at the situation in his own seat of Pearce, where it was reported recently that his primary vote is down by 20 per cent to 26.1 per cent. One Nation is now looking at polling at about 12.6 per cent. So, is Mr Porter looking at that issue? That's what drove the government's initial approach to this resolution. Once again, it's a poll-driven response from the Prime Minister looking at the Wentworth by-election some days away and deciding now there's a reason to adopt a different position. This government is taking us for mugs and the people of Australia for mugs. So, perhaps the dog ate the Liberal Party's homework this morning. Maybe Minister Cormann should bring us a note from Prime Minister Morrison. But, no, it was Prime Minister Morrison who threw his Senate colleagues under a bus in what he said.


It's been pointed out a number of times that it was former Senator Boswell who really took a high road on this particular issue. In his valedictory speech he said that a defining moment for him was his tackling of the League of Rights—a far-right-wing anti-Semitic organisation which he saw as trying to exert influence over churches and other areas of society—and also what he described as the fight of his life against Pauline Hanson—Senator Hanson now. He said he risked everything to stand up against her aggressive, narrow view of Australia, and he defined defeating Senator Hanson and One Nation in 2001 as being his greatest political achievement. He made the point that you have to stand for something, and I think that's something that is forgotten by this government. They do not stand for anything. They're entirely poll driven.


The Prime Minister said it was regrettable that his Senate colleagues voted in favour of the One Nation, resolution, but he would say that, wouldn't he? This is the Prime Minister that voted against a banking royal commission 26 times—'regrettable but necessary'. How embarrassed Minister Cormann has been, delivering his mea culpa in this place today. He has been thrown under the bus by the Prime Minister—all of the coalition senators have been—and he had to stand and cop it. He mentioned conspiracy theories. We don't believe that there are any conspiracy theories here. This was a poll-driven response by this government, devoid of any values and principles. This is a government in its death throes. Let's be very clear about that. This is a government which is divided amongst itself, fighting itself and not focused on the issues.


What is deplorable to me is that the issue of racism should be something which is above politics. The alternative parties of government should join together and stand together against racism, and the fact that this government chose to turn its back on that approach is absolutely appalling. What we need to see is an election as soon as possible. Let's get rid of this rabble. We need to have a government which is up to the task of representing the people of Australia and making the decisions that the people of Australia require of us.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2018-10-16,"



Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:17):  One of the unfortunate challenges of the Australian Senate is that often statesmen in our community come to the Senate and succumb to the opportunity to be a politician. It's a great shame. Senator Dodson is someone from Western Australia, my home state, who is very well regarded and trusted across the Kimberley. He's a man of great eminence, and he's a true Australian statesman. That's why someone like me can't help but be very disappointed with the contribution that Senator Dodson just made, because he chose to be a politician and not the statesman that he is.


As disappointing as that is, I do accept that as we approach the end of this year, as we approach Christmas, unfortunately it does get a little bit silly in this place. As we approach the end of any parliamentary year, and as we succumb to the temptation to play politics in the lead-up to the next general election, I suppose it's beholden on each of us to think carefully and perhaps exercise greater caution when political opportunities like the one that we saw yesterday present themselves.


Senator Dodson stepped back from being a well-regarded Australian statesman to being a politician. I say that because of the evidence—two important sets of facts Senator Dodson chose to ignore. The first set of facts Senator Dodson chose to ignore was the set of facts that surrounded the unfortunate circumstances—and I'm a member of the coalition—of the vote yesterday in regard to a very bad, very unfortunate, very unnecessary notice of motion by One Nation. What are the facts in regard to that? The facts are very clear. Senator Cormann, as the leader of the coalition in the Senate, took ownership. He came to the Senate this morning and asked for the vote to be recommitted, meaning the vote was put again, and every coalition senator voted against that atrocious motion from Pauline Hanson's One Nation. We took ownership of what was an error—not an error of policy, not an error of judgement but an error of administrative process. And I know that many Australians are not aware of the arcane nature of governing from the Australian Senate; they might not know what that means, but this is the point: coalition senators came back into the Australian Senate and corrected the situation. That's the first set of facts that Senator Dodson chose to ignore. He didn't even have the courtesy of reflecting on that in his five-minute contribution.


What's the other set of facts that Senator Dodson chose to ignore? Senator Dodson's contribution quite rightly pointed to the very, very serious disadvantage that Indigenous Australians face in our country. I know this. I'm a Senator from Western Australia. I spend time in the Kimberley and regional areas of my home state. I don't spend as much time in the Kimberley as Senator Dodson does, but I like to think that in my own way I, like him, am doing what I can be doing to draw attention to the issue of Indigenous disadvantage and improve it. So what is happening with regard to Indigenous disadvantage? I'll be the first to admit that we need to do more and that we need to act faster, and I've had lots to say about Indigenous health issues, particularly with regard to the explosion of STIs and HIV across Indigenous communities. There's always more to be done. But let's be clear, together, through bipartisanship, this parliament is doing the best it can do.


If Senator Dodson had chosen to be the statesman rather than the politician, he would have reflected on the fact that Indigenous child mortality has declined by 35 per cent between 1998 and 2016. The overall Indigenous mortality rate has declined by 14 per cent since 1998. Fewer Indigenous Australians are dying from chronic conditions. The rate of alcohol drinking during pregnancy has halved, and there's been a significant improvement in the proportion of Indigenous 20- to 24-year-olds achieving year 12 or equivalent schooling—up from 47 per cent in 2006 to 65 per cent in 2016. Like I said, there's always more to be done. And on the difficult issue of constitutional recognition, the coalition government has continued the process in an effort to bring Australians together on this. So, Senator McCarthy, your challenge is not to be a politician but to be a stateswoman. Over to you.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Smith. Senator McCarthy.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:22):  One thing that we've not heard from the other side is condemnation—not one word of condemnation against what we know in this Senate has been a complete focus on division and racism. There's been no word of condemnation from either of the senators on the other side who stood up to speak. Senator Abetz, no regret for the commentary that he made yesterday; no apology. I quote his statement to Fairfax:


While the motion wasn't as elegantly written as it could have been, this crazy notion that people of Anglo-Saxon descent can't be discriminated against because of their skin colour but others can is just strange.


Show some leadership. How about standing up and saying that conversation, which we all know Senator Hanson has form on, is not the kind of debate we want in this country. Show some backbone. Stand up and admit that, yes, it may have been an error on your part, but there has still been no condemnation for the very fact that the whole purpose of the motion was to divide the country. And guess what? That's what it's doing, and that's what it's going to continue to do throughout the rest of this day and in weeks to come. There has to be greater condemnation when these sorts of things happen, in particular from you in leadership, in government.


To stand up here and patronise Senator Dodson for reflecting on his history as a First Nations man in this country and the deep hurt, the trauma and the tragedy of First Nations people in this country is not the way to go. You have missed the point completely again. You've been fooled again by One Nation, by this complete distraction dividing this nation, and none of you have condemned her for it. You take the road of condemning a senior Aboriginal elder, the father of reconciliation, who stood in this house to say to you that this is something that you can do much better. We know, as I said earlier in the house this afternoon, that it's about the content of your character. We do not want to see this country always focusing on our differences. Find out what it is that unites us as a nation. But come out and call it for what it is when those people stand up and seek to divide us by putting a wedge between all of us—to get our country all tied up in knots—over whether they're black enough, white enough, brown enough, short enough, tall enough, Christian or Muslim. Stand up and have some backbone. Show real leadership in condemning One Nation.


I see that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs has gone out in the media to apologise. I call on the Minister for Indigenous Affairs: don't just apologise out there; do it right in here, in this chamber. It takes a great deal of responsibility to be a leader in this country, a responsibility that all Australians expect us to take very seriously. For the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, and, as Senator Eric Abetz has mentioned, the CLP candidate for the Northern Territory and a Alice Springs councillor to come out so irresponsibly on this issue is a sad indictment for the people of the Northern Territory, a deeper disappointment for First Nations people in this country and certainly shows a real abrogation of understanding the importance of your role to represent in an appropriate, responsible and effective way that cares about bringing people together, not dividing this nation. I call on the Minister for Indigenous Affairs: come into the Senate and explain yourself to the Senate. Let us know in here what it is you really mean.

  The expert panel that conducted the Religious Freedom Review undertook a comprehensive engagement with the community and received over 15,000 submissions. As a result, the government is carefully considering the expert panel's report and will respond to it in due course. The Prime Minister has already announced changes to strengthen protections for students from discrimination by proposing restrictions to the law introduced in 2013 by the previous Labor government, which gave religious schools greater ability to expel students where the school considered that it was necessary according to the doctrines of their religion. Recent misreporting about the proposal and the current law has created unnecessary confusion and anxiety for parents and students alike. The government are currently working on the proposed amendments, and we will consult with the opposition and others to work on a bipartisan basis to provide certainty in this area.

  We welcome this referral by Labor of the independence of the APVMA to inquiry, particularly given the massive collapse in that agency's capacity, during the relocation to Armidale, to undertake the chemical reviews that it needs to do. However, in light of the Californian court ruling and the World Health Organization's finding that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic, the fact that this inquiry will only touch on the ability of the APVMA to assess chemicals like glyphosate does not abrogate the need for an independent, transparent, science based inquiry into the safety of glyphosate.

That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 1 February 2019: 


The independence of regulatory decisions made by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), with particular reference to:


   (a) the responsiveness and effectiveness of the APVMA's process for reviewing and reassessing the safety of agricultural chemicals in Australia, including glyphosate, and how this compares with equivalent international regulators;


   (b) the funding arrangements of the APVMA, comparisons with equivalent agricultural chemical regulators internationally and any impact these arrangements have on independent evidence-based decision making;


   (c) the roles and responsibilities of relevant departments and agencies of Commonwealth, state and territory governments in relation to the regulation of pesticides and veterinary chemicals;


   (d) the need to ensure Australia's farmers have timely access to safe, environmentally sustainable and productivity enhancing products;


   (e) the impact of the APVMA's relocation on its capability to undertake chemical reviews in a timely manner; and


   (f) any other related matters.

Senator RUSTON:
  The government does not support this inquiry. The APVMA is an independent and competent regulator of agrichemicals. The government has taken steps to further protect its independence by introducing legislation to have a skills based board to protect transparency and accountability of the APVMA and its functions. Rather than waste time on an inquiry, the opposition should back the bill.

Senator RICE:
  We welcome this referral by Labor of the independence of the APVMA to inquiry, particularly given the massive collapse in that agency's capacity, during the relocation to Armidale, to undertake the chemical reviews that it needs to do. However, in light of the Californian court ruling and the World Health Organization's finding that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic, the fact that this inquiry will only touch on the ability of the APVMA to assess chemicals like glyphosate does not abrogate the need for an independent, transparent, science based inquiry into the safety of glyphosate.

World Heritage sites have to be administered according to management plans prepared and implemented by the minister. The conservation management plan for the Sydney Opera House says:


The Sydney Opera House exterior, particularly the shells … should not be regarded as a giant billboard or commercial/advertising opportunity.


Labor has asked a number of questions of the minister, including: 'At what point did the minister ask for advice on the values of the Opera House and whether they had been breached or impacted? What was the advice provided to the minister? What decisions has the minister taken as a result of this advice?' So far, all we have heard from the minister is silence.

   (ii) the Australian Bureau of Statistics has released alarming national data that shows intentional self-harm is now ranked the 13th leading cause of death, moving up from 15th position in 2016,


   (iii) in 2017, suicide was the leading cause of death among people aged between 15 and 44 years, and the second leading cause of death among those 45 and 54 years of age,


   (iv) suicide is the 10th leading cause of death for males – the suicide rate among males is more than three times greater than that for females,


   (v) in 2017, there were 165 suicides of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and 162 deaths the year before,


   (vi) in 2017, suicide remained the leading cause of death of children between 5 and 17 years of age, with 98 deaths occurring in this age group – this is a 10% increase in deaths from 2016, and


   (vii) in 2017, approximately 80% of intentional self-harm deaths had co­-morbidities mentioned as contributing factors to death – mood disorders, including depression, were the most common mentioned condition with intentional self-harm, followed by drug and alcohol disorders;

  The government's target for suicide is zero per cent. The idea that 75 per cent, or over 2,200 deaths per year, is acceptable is simply not acceptable to the government. The Minister for Health and the government have elevated mental health to be one of the four fundamental pillars of the long-term National Health Plan. Both the minister and the government regard mental health as inseparable and a central part of the Health portfolio and would regard such a separation as both a downgrade of mental health and a potentially damaging separation of mental health from physical health.

We know that a robust target, backed by real resources from all levels of government, and an effective plan that supports long-term reform is what is needed to drive change. Today, we again call on the government to adopt the National Mental Health Commission's target to reduce suicide by 50 per cent over 10 years. Labor is proud to have had a minister or shadow minister for mental health since 2010, reflecting our dedication to this crucial issue.

The speech read as follows—



It's unacceptable in 2018, a year after we came together to expand the rights of all Australians to marry the person they love, that religious schools in some states are still able to discriminate against students and teachers on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identification.


Our schools should be safe and welcoming places for all of us, regardless of your sexuality or gender identity. If you're a student or a teacher or a support worker at a religious school, you shouldn't face being expelled or fired just for coming out as gay or transgender.


That is why today, we are moving a bill to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to bar religious schools from discriminating against students, teachers and other employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identification.


This would mean that teachers and contractors can't be sacked simply because of their gender identity or the person they're attracted to. It would mean that schools can't expel their students simply because of their sexual orientation. 


Religion plays an important role in the lives of so many Australians and the role of religion in society is indeed a dynamic one. Religion promotes welfare and teaches us to 'love thy neighbour'. Churches, mosques, synagogues, temples—they serve not only as places of worship, but also as places of social gathering and spiritual enlightenment. 


Religion provides solace for so many during their darkest days, and it can provide a level of unimaginable peace and joy for millions of Australians. Religion is a deeply personal endeavour, and the Greens believe that the right to freedom of religion should be protected in this country.


However, it must be acknowledged that not all human rights are absolute. We need laws that protect our right to hold a religion, but limit the so-called right to discriminate.


Indeed, there are already provisions under the Sex Discrimination Act for religious institutions to act in a manner that is consistent with the teachings of their faith. This includes the ""ordination of Priests, Ministers of Religion or members of any other religious order"". So there are already clear provisions in the Act which protect the rights of these institutions, however what's been unclear in the past is when a religious institution crosses over into the territory of providing an essential service. 


Take aged care for example. This matter has already been resolved under the Act, and prohibits aged care providers, which have religious ties and receive Government funding, to discriminate based gender identity or sexual orientation. And why is that? Because it's recognised that aged care providers deliver an essential service to the Australian community, and while the religious doctrine may be relevant, it is not central.


We believe the same understanding should be afforded to our schools. Yes, the religious doctrine may be relevant to many aspects of an educational institution. But this is not the sole purpose for the existence of the institution. Its sole purpose of existing is to educate to next generation of young people.


The Ruddock review into Freedom of Religion has been a shamble to say the least. While the report was handed down in May of this year, we are still yet to receive the findings. Indeed, the media have received a copy before the Parliament has. 


We know, through these leaks to the media, that the review recommends that religious schools have the 'seal of approval' to discriminate against LGBTIQ students. Provided they make their policies known, discrimination is fair game.


The Government knows that the majority of the community won't stand for this. They definitely know that the voters in Wentworth won't stand for it. And rather than rip off the bandaid, they've decided to delay the release of this report, and by doing so cause unnecessary pain for so many people in our community. Indeed the commentary that we have seen on this in the past week by some has been truly horrifying, and I will not be giving any oxygen to those vile, disgusting beliefs in this chamber.


The refusal of the Government to release the Ruddock Report is just another example of the Liberal Government acting in its own self interests, rather than in the interests of the people who elected them there in the first place.


The Prime Minister came out and said that he doesn't support religious schools being able to expel students based on their sexuality. The Leader of the Opposition also came out and said that he'll work to ensure that no child is denied human dignity. Well today, I say to Mr Morrison and I say to Mr Shorten, now is your chance. Now is your chance to put your money where your mouth is and do what you were elected to do. Rather than just say that you are in opposition to this giant leap back to the 1950's you need to show some leadership and act on it. No more excuses. No more delays.


I want to share with you the experience of one man coming out, because I think it illustrates what is a common experience for so many young people. He came out to his parents when he was 21 years old and it took moving out of his home town and having a few years of slowly letting people know before he could truly come out.


He says that he grew up feeling different to the people around him as he realised he was more interested in guys than in girls. He thought he could hide that part of himself. He wouldn't drink much at parties because he feared that he might somehow betray the image he had concocted, and in high school, he joined the students who were hostile to openly queer students - something he deeply regrets to this day.


He only began feeling comfortable with his sexuality when he realised that he could be open about this, and still be loved by the people around him. He slowly came out to those close to him. First his best friend, then his sister. And then slowly but surely he began living a life that reaffirmed that he didn't need to change, that he belonged.


Right now, there are thousands of children around Australia going through the exact same thing. Right now they are struggling with their sexual and gender identity, in a culture that tells them they are somehow 'different'. And right now, during probably the most vulnerable stages of their lives, our religious schools have the ability to expel a student going through this same experience, rather than providing them with the safe, supportive environment that our schools should be. 


These laws. These debates. These attacks. They hurt. They cause harm. They cost people their lives.


The Greens support the right of people to practice religion, but that should not come at the expense of the human rights of LGBTIQ people. Our laws should protect LGBTIQ people from discrimination, not enshrine the right to discriminate against them. That is why the Greens have called for a Charter of Rights, and we'll continue to do so.


Australia is exceptional. Indeed, we stand alone in being the only democracy without some form of national human rights act or bill of rights incorporating protection of freedom of religion. And until we do so we'll continue to have debates like this. And we'll continue to cause harm. And we'll continue to sit in this chamber, week in and week out and not do what it is we were elected to do, and that is to represent the rights of all Australians. Because right now, with the current exemptions in our laws, how on earth can we say we are.

Senator CHISHOLM:
  Labor is disappointed the Prime Minister has been hiding the report of the Ruddock review, which the government has been sitting on for almost five months now. The refusal of the Morrison government to release the Ruddock review raises questions about what this government is trying to hide from the Australian people and prevents the voters of Wentworth from being fully apprised of the facts before making their decision on how they vote this Saturday.

Senator HANSON:
  This motion was to actually define anti-Semitism, as it is by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, as a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed as:


… hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism … directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.


This has been introduced into the UK and it's a shame that people here won't support this motion today. The Jewish community will be absolutely gobsmacked that you have not supported them in this. They have been asking for this to be introduced and you have not done it. So you can answer to the Jewish community.

Senator RUSTON:
  In 2013, every federal coalition parliamentarian signed the London declaration. The declaration calls upon governments, parliaments, international institutions, NGOs and civil society to affirm democratic and human values, build societies based on respect and citizenship, and combat any manifestation of anti-Semitism or discrimination. The London declaration endorses the European Union monitoring mission's working definition of anti-Semitism, which is the predecessor to the working definition of anti-Semitism adopted in May 2016 by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an international organisation of 31 democratic countries, that is set out in this motion. The government completely condemns anti-Semitism.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-10-16,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:49):  I rise to speak on the matter in the letter that, in fact, I put in for this matter of public importance. This week is Anti-Poverty Week. We've heard overwhelming evidence of the level of poverty in this country. But before I articulate that evidence I'd like to go to this notion of inequality in this country.


Just recently, the Productivity Commission released a report that has, in fact, been widely misinterpreted—some unkind people would perhaps say misquoted—in terms of what it does and doesn't say about inequality in this country. Some in the media have used it to say that inequality in this country isn't an issue. But, if you bother to look into the detail of the report, you will see that it talks about the fact that, despite all those years of economic growth, we have not seen a decrease in the number of people living in poverty. We also see that some of the facts in there are being misquoted and glossed over to misinterpret the level of inequality that does exist. I will come back to some of those issues shortly. But, of course, what goes hand in hand with inequality is poverty, and, given that this is Anti-Poverty Week, I thought it was important that we look at some of the issues and facts around poverty in this country.


ACOSS has just released its latest report and, in fact, Dr Cassandra Goldie was down in the Press Club today talking about the report that they have just released, giving us an up-to-date picture of poverty in this country. The report was done by ACOSS and the University of New South Wales. It points out that Australia is rated as the second-wealthiest country in the world but we still have over three million people living below the poverty line, including 739,000 children. It finds that those experiencing poverty at the highest rates are those on youth allowance, at 64 per cent, and Newstart, at 55 per cent. The poverty rate for people on Newstart has risen by 17 per cent in the last 16 years. The highest 20 per cent of income earners are receiving more than the lowest 60 per cent combined. I'll repeat that: the highest 20 per cent of income earners are earning more than the lowest 60 per cent combined.


Most people below the poverty line, 53 per cent, rely on the social security system as their main source of income. We're seeing that the poverty rate for sole parents has risen from 35 per cent in 2013 to 59 per cent in 2015, which is a large increase of 24 per cent in just two years. I'd like to give some context to that figure. In 2006, the Howard government started moving sole parents from parenting payment to Newstart once their youngest child turned six. People who were here in this place at the time will remember that the Greens spoke long and hard, and voted, against that measure, and I have been pursuing it ever since. At the time, the parents who were on parenting payment single were grandfathered. In other words, they weren't shifted over to Newstart. But, in 2013, 80,000 sole parents—the previous group that were grandfathered—were moved by the Gillard government off parenting payment single and onto Newstart.


Can you see the correlation with the very steep increase in the number of sole parents living in poverty by 2015? It was a 24 per cent increase, because those grandfathered single sole parents were moved off parenting payment single to Newstart in one fell swoop, sending those people into poverty—hence my claim that both the opposition and the government have neoliberal policies that drive people into poverty and increase inequality. Foodbank released their latest report on their work on Sunday, and they found that there had been a three per cent increase in the number of people experiencing food inequality. To put some figures on that, that's four million people in the last 12 months experiencing food insecurity, and the most common cause of that was low income.


In my remaining time I want to address this issue of inequality and the misinterpretation of the Productivity Commission report. The report clearly demonstrated that people are living in poverty, that there is inequality. If you look at the detail in the Productivity Commission report, the 'damned statistics' can actually be misleading, showing that all income quintiles are supposed to have increased. But if you actually drill down and look at what happened particularly in those lowest levels of income, where it is claimed that inequality was reduced, it was for age pensioners. That's because the Rudd government, after a concerted campaign by the Greens to increase the age pension, did increase the age pension, which basically instantaneously lifted the income of age pensioners and addressed some of those issues around inequality. But that masks the rest of the people who are stuck on income support payments that leave them below the poverty line, such as those on youth allowance and Newstart, neither of which have had an increase since 1994. Those people are still living in poverty. It increases inequality for those people because they have not had that increase.


So it shows that government intervention can impact very significantly on income support payments. The mistruth that the government speaks—that people on Newstart don't need an increase because the Productivity Commission said that inequality's not such an issue—are wrong: a significant increase in Newstart of $75 a week will significantly impact on people living in poverty and inequality and will start addressing that issue. Look at that report. Read the details of the report. (Time expired)

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2018-10-16,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (16:58):  I have a confession to make: I am a neoliberal. I don't have the handbook; it's just something I learnt with my parents: to believe in freedom, to believe in cutting taxes and to believe in free trade. But, if there is a handbook, I would love the Greens to be able to perhaps use their communications allowance to buy copies of this neoliberal handbook, read through it themselves and understand that free trade and cutting taxes are good for Australia and good for people. If you want to get people out of poverty, if you want to diminish inequality in society, the best thing to do is give people a job. And how do people get a job? They get a job through business. Governments don't create jobs; they create the environment for business to employ people. And this government, more than any government in the history of Australia, since our election in 2013 has created jobs—over one million jobs for people who have been employed by big, medium and small businesses. If you want business to grow, if you want Australia to grow and if you want to have a strong social safety net for Australia then you must have a strong business community.


For the Greens to come in here and talk about the welfare of Australian workers and the welfare of Australians is absolute hypocrisy, because the greatest threat to the Australian economy and our ability to look after those who need help comes from those on the Left, those who want to tax more and those who want to stop free trade agreements. We've got the Greens, with their support for crippling renewable energy targets that have helped push up the price of electricity in this country and brutalise businesses. If can ask a member of the Greens, 'What is the greatest impost upon businesses in Australia today?' they will say, 'The price of electricity,' and then they'll say, 'Taxes.' This government is cutting taxes and dealing with the price of electricity in Australia.


I want to focus on tax cuts, because I think that tax cuts are good. I think that tax cuts are brilliant. The more taxes we can cut, the happier everybody in Australia will be. The more free trade agreements we can have, the happier everybody in Australia will be. The sad thing is that tax cuts and free trade agreements—two quite simple concepts—are concepts that both the Labor Party and the Greens have trouble understanding. How many free trade agreements were enacted while Labor were last in power, between 2007 and 2013? It's pretty simple, for those listening at home, sitting on your tractor or on the back verandah having a cheeky cup of tea: zero free trade agreements. It's this government, since 2013, that has been pushing strongly for free trade agreements.


Let's just focus on tax cuts. Let's just focus on our long-term economic plan to cut taxes for Australian businesses. Why do we want to do that? It's for those who run those small and medium businesses, those mums and dads, those people who want to give it a go and those people who see that empty shop in a shopping centre or on the main street—where my office is in Nambour it's Currie Street—and say: 'I want to start a business there. I have a dream to start a business there, just like so many other people have done.' Every medium business and every large business in Australia started off with someone's dream: someone looking at an empty shop space, someone starting off in their garage and someone in their lounge room or at their dining room table late at night working out how to get people to pay their bills, sending out invoices. What we want to do for those aspirational people who want to get ahead is cut their taxes. That is a good thing.


I note, for those listening at home, that none of the Greens are here. There is an empty space over there. It's the most intelligent those benches have looked for a long time, with no Greens sitting there. It's a pity. I hope they're watching on the TVs in their offices and learning why the mum-and-dad businesses—or the mum businesses or dad businesses; whatever it is; I don't care—want tax cuts. Why do they want tax cuts? It's so that they can reinvest back into their businesses, so they can grow their businesses and so they can employ more staff. Do you know where the staff come from? They come from other businesses, school leavers, people leaving university or people who have been out of work, who've been unemployed, which is why this government has facilitated the conditions for businesses to employ over one million Australians since 2013. That's an additional one million Australians.


If a business makes half a million dollars in turnover, it will have an additional $7,500 in 2021 or $12,000 in 2021-22. That will be invested back into businesses and back into employing more people. That is good for Australia. If people have jobs, they are better off. This Greens motion is about inequality and getting people out of poverty. The best way to get anyone out of poverty—or to diminish inequality where it exists—is to have them get a job, because once they get a job they're earning money. They then understand the importance of money and they understand how they can start a business themselves. They can see how their bosses operate and go, 'I want to start my own business.'


What we want to do through our neoliberal agenda—this scary neoliberal agenda that those on the left talk about like it's the bogeyman but don't really understand—is make it easier for people to get on with their lives without a heavy-handed government coming in, bossing people around and telling them what to do. We think, if you have tax cuts, you know what's best to do with your own money. Whether you're a PAYE taxpayer, a small-business person or a medium-business person, the money you get back is actually your money. It's not the government's money and it's not the politicians' money; it's your money.


This is one of the fallacies of this argument in Australia when people talk about giving money to business or to PAYE taxpayers. It's not giving money. It's their money. It's their money that they give to the government to fund services. And what we say on our side of politics is that government is at its best when it's small—to enable people to get on with their lives, to get on with making those decisions without government bossing them around. We've finished seven free trade agreements since 2013. That's pretty good. Compare that to Labor. Between 2007 and 2013, they didn't do anything. They were asleep at the wheel. When Labor and the Greens were in power, they were having a good old doze at the wheel when it came to free trade agreements. That is because we understand that, if Australia is to grow and if our economy is to grow, we cannot just trade amongst ourselves. That is a false economic argument. We've got to get out there and sell our goods and our services to the world. And the best way to do that is through free trade agreements. 


Five years ago, only 26 per cent of our goods and services received duty-free or preferential access to overseas markets. After completing a range of negotiations, we have now signed agreements with countries that account for nearly 70 per cent of our trade, with current negotiations potentially taking that figure up to 88 per cent. So we're going to keep working hard for those farmers and those businesses to make sure that we get the conclusion of more free trade agreements. Why is this important? Because each new overseas market opportunity we open up for Australian businesses is a chance to grow. That is good for Australian families and workers and good for the economy.


In 2017-18, we achieved record exports of $401 billion and our global trade surplus was $6.3 billion. We know that Australian businesses that export pay their employees, on average, 11.5 per cent more than businesses that do not export. And household incomes are estimated to be $8,448 higher due to the trade liberalisation taken in Australia since the 1980s. For example, our agreement with the United States has served us well by enabling cheaper inputs to be imported into Australia to feed our high export growth to countries like China, Japan and Korea. This free trade agreement, recognised by the United States as a model free trade agreement, allows the Liberal-National government to secure the only country exemption from recent US tariffs on steel and aluminium.


Let's talk about the TPP-11, those five letters that send the left into spasms. They're so scared about this. This will eliminate more than 98 per cent of tariffs for 11 countries with a combined GDP of $13.8 trillion and close to 500 million consumers. Australian farmers, manufacturers, service providers, small businesses and exporters and small businesses are all winners from the TPP-11 because it will be easier to sell their goods and supply services to a free trade area that spans America and Asia.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-10-16,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:08):  I'm pleased to be able to contribute to this matter of public importance. Every now and again, it would be really nice if the Greens would actually come together with the Labor Party and attack the reality of this coalition government, who are about ensuring more and more inequality. It would be really good if you could once in a while actually focus on the Liberal and National parties for the damage that they are doing, instead of roping us in—the Labor Party—as being exactly the same as the Liberal Party. The Greens know that's not the case. But the Greens have a view that the enemy, to them, is the Labor Party. I've got a lot of respect for Senator Siewert. I looked at this resolution where she says that the only solution the Liberal and Labor parties have to inequality and wage stagnation comes straight from the neoliberal handbook—like ever-increasing company tax cuts and free trade deals that hurt workers. I wasn't surprised that Senator Siewert didn't go there. She actually dealt with issues of inequality. I really can't understand why the Greens, at every chance they get, attack the Labor Party, who are in there arguing for penalty rates to be given back, who are arguing to ensure we have a decent health system and a decent education system and who are making sure big business pay their proper amount of tax.


But let's have a look at the Greens' record over a period of time. They did a dodgy deal with the Liberal Party to give Tony Abbott of all people—former Prime Minister Abbott—a massive victory in voting down the CPRS. We could have had 10 years of dealing with carbon pollution in this country if not for the purity and the inability of the Greens to actually focus on a long-term position, rather than take cheap shots at the Labor Party. We could have been making a big difference right now. The Greens teamed up with the Liberal Party to do a backdoor deal to cut the pensions of 370,000 Australians. That did a lot for poverty alleviation in the country! They teamed up with the Liberals to water down the tax transparency bill. Imagine the Greens teaming up with the Liberals to make how tax is paid in this country less transparent!


I had a long working relationship with former senator Lee Rhiannon. What happened when former senator Lee Rhiannon stood up for public schools? She was expelled from the Greens' party room. That was a great service to inequality in this country! That was fantastic! And then you look at Senator Peter Whish-Wilson. One of the big issues facing workers now is cuts to penalty rates, and Senator Peter Whish-Wilson believed that the Greens could double their vote by courting small business. And he backed a 'bigger national discussion' about weekend penalty rates, suggesting they are outdated. Then he said:


I think it's just a white Anglo-Saxon cultural thing that we've inherited.


Penalty rates, to just remind the Greens, put food on the table of working families in this country. Penalty rates were absolutely essential for me as a blue-collar worker. I could never have survived without penalty rates when I first came to this country. I needed penalty rates to take my kids on holiday every now and again. I didn't go on holiday every year—I couldn't afford it—but my penalty rates gave me an opportunity to take my two kids on a holiday now and again. My penalty rates made sure I could pay my mortgage. My penalty rates made sure I could pay my rent when I didn't own a house. And yet Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson wanted a 'bigger national discussion' about penalty rates, saying they were an 'Anglo-Saxon cultural thing that we'd inherited'. No. Let me tell the Greens that penalty rates were actually about putting food on the table of working-class Australians. I'm not surprised that some of the Greens have got no idea about penalty rates, never having had to actually depend on them and representing some of the richest Australians in the country. That's fine; I don't have a problem with that. But don't attack working-class people because you don't understand how working-class people survive in this country.


Instead of drafting resolutions like this, why don't you come to the Labor Party and say: 'We want to do something about neoliberalism. We want to do something about ensuring that inequality is dealt with in this country'? Instead of pulling stunts like this attacking the Labor Party, when we've got a rabble of a government in this country that day in, day out demonstrate how out of touch they are, why don't you attack the Liberal-National Party now and again instead of constantly tying Labor in with the Liberals and the Nationals? It's an absolute joke. We know why it is. It's because the Greens see Labor as their competitors. The Greens see Labor as their opponents. They don't see the Liberal-National Party as the people who are destroying decent wages and conditions in this country. They don't target the Liberal-National Party on these issues. They attack Labor. It's an absolute nonsense.


Let me just turn to Senator McGrath's contribution and this idea that the best thing for people in this country is tax cuts and free trade agreements. Maybe we'll hear from the Greens' contributors on this when they have an opportunity. Give us a break. 'Free trade agreements and tax cuts will resolve poverty in this country' is the argument you hear all the time from across the chamber—the argument that 'the best form of welfare is a job'. There are not enough jobs in this country to give a job to everyone who needs a job. That's the reality. You've only got to look at some of the National Party seats in this country to see the poverty there. Why people continually vote for the National Party has got me beat, when the National Party attack their social security payments, attack pensions, attack welfare, attack provisions for women who find themselves in domestic violence situations and have nowhere to go, and take $44 million a year out of support for temporary accommodation for women in crisis.


How about attacking those over there instead of drafting a stupid resolution like this? You could have easily come to us and we could have been on a unity ticket on the issue of inequality. Labor has never had a better raft of policies across the board to deal with inequality. I'm proud to be a member of the Labor Party.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-10-16,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:18):  It may be that Labor has never had better policies on inequality, but, as Senator Cameron well knows, that's because they've pinched them all from us and then watered them down. I agree with senior political commentators in this country who say that, if you want know to know what Labor's policy is going to be in five or 10 years time, have a look at what the Australian Greens' policy is now. I'm actually quite fond of Senator Cameron—and that's a dangerous thing to say on the public record—but it's fair to say that that was one of the worst contributions I've heard him make in this place. At the top of that contribution, Senator Cameron attacked the Australian Greens for fixating on the Australian Labor Party and for having a crack at the ALP, and then he spent 95 per cent of the rest of his speech having a crack at the Australian Greens. So, tick one in the box for hypocrisy, Senator Cameron.


The second point I would make to Senator Cameron and his colleagues is: aren't they a bit touchy on the TPP? Of course, the reason Senator Cameron is touchy on the TPP is that he was comprehensively rolled inside Labor's caucus. He personally doesn't support the TPP, but do you know what he's going to do? He's going do what Labor people always do, put aside their principles in a convenient place to pick up later when they've ended up their political careers, and he's going come in here and vote for it. Every single time that's what he's going do: vote for the TPP, just like he voted to lock up refugees on Manus Island and Nauru. Just like Labor, last time they were in government, slashed the single parenting pension. Do you remember that one, Senator Cameron? If you want to play these silly games, I can play them all day. The fact of the matter is that one of the only true and reasonable things you said in your contribution was that the enemy are sitting over there. The enemy are sitting over there. They are a rabble of a government. They deserve to be kicked out of office at the first available opportunity and, as far as the Australian Greens are concerned, that opportunity cannot come around quickly enough.


I want to talk about tax cuts, because I think the Australian people understand that the TPP cedes our sovereignty and hands over matters that should be left under the sovereign auspices of this parliament to foreign multinational corporations. There's another reason, by the way, that the Labor Party should be ashamed that they've rolled over and abandoned their principles on the TPP. On tax cuts, again, one of the absolute foundations of neoliberalism is trickle-down economics, and trickle-down economics does not work. It has never worked and it never will work. There are people in this country who were told many, many years ago that, if we cut taxes for the well-off and big business, the wealth would trickle down to them. Well, they are still waiting at the bottom of the pile, with their hands outstretched, for the first drops. Do you know what? They're not going to arrive, because trickle-down economics is a demonstrated policy failure. It is actually about reverse income redistribution. It's about making the well-off even more wealthy and the big corporations even more wealthy and powerful. It has terrible impacts on the lives of far too many people and on the environment that ultimately sustains us all.


The big narrative arc of recent decades is parliaments handing over power to the big corporations. That has resulted in environmental degradation—trashing that beautiful environment—and, in fact, in the wealth of this country being concentrated in the hands of far too few while far too many have missed out. In my home state of Tasmania we have a wilderness World Heritage area of incredible beauty and diversity, with habitats including rainforests, alpine meadows, ancient pines, saltwater lagoons and glacial lakes. The rich, vibrant cultural heritage of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, and their awe-inspiring survival through the last ice age, is represented in the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area, with shell middens, stone tools and petroglyphs dating back over 20,000 years. In fact, the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area is one of only two properties on earth to meet seven of the 10 World Heritage criteria. It's critical to understand the essence and value of wilderness, which is a decreasing commodity on earth, in large part because governments and corporations have handed over too much power to the great profiteers—the rent seekers, the rapers of our commons.


People have spent decades in Tasmania defending our wilderness from logging, mining and dam construction, but right now we face a new threat: the selling of our wilderness to tourism developers, to private sector profiteers. It's all happening behind closed doors in the Coordinator-General's office run by the Tasmanian Liberal government. That government said in 2014 that it would open up our reserves to commercial tourism and invited the private sector to make submissions. We have seen submissions for inside our pristine wilderness areas, inside our World Heritage area and inside national parks around lodges, tracks, bike trails, helicopter pads, roads, boats and cable cars. I'll tell you what: many Tasmanians are appalled. Enough is enough.


Attracting high-end tourism in our wilderness areas is a focus for the rich. It necessitates helicopter access, plane access and boat access. The World Heritage Committee has recommended strict restrictions on tourism developments, which the Tasmanian and federal governments have given lip service to and agreed to but failed to carry out. The state government has approved intrusive developments after confidential environmental assessments and lease arrangements, with taxpayers' money. We've got to stop the handover of our wilderness to the private sector and protect it for the beautiful values that it has.

I find this amazing. Let's turn the clock back to the Hawke-Keating government. What happened? They opened up trade, and it hurt us, I can tell you. My brother Peter and I were pig farmers. We built a large piggery. It was hard yakka. We got 100 tonnes of gravel out of the creek and we got 16 tonnes of bagged cement, and we shovelled it into a cement mixer to lay the floors, the slabs, the drains et cetera, only to find that the Hawke-Keating government allowed the importation of pig meat. It was not a very good time, especially come 1994 and the drought, when we sold our pigs as bacon, as heavy pigs at the end of the month. What we sold them for did not cover the cost of the grain we were buying to feed the pigs. Cheap imports came in. Even if the imports didn't come in, they could quote a price, and that was enough to make the market stay low here, because the buyers could say, 'Hang on, I can buy it for $2 from Canada or Denmark; I won't pay more than $1.80 in Australia by the time I add the processor to it.' So that put a dampener on it, and the five or six large piggeries in our area, the Inverell area, shut down, costing jobs. So I thought: 'What's Australia doing? It's crazy with all these trade deals, removing all our barriers—removing the excise, the tariff and the quotas—and letting everything come into Australia.' I tell you that it hurt. However, we've gone past that, and now the other countries are doing the same thing Australia did in the late eighties and early nineties. We're doing these deals where they're removing their barriers and quotas, and it's working.


During my life in rural Australia, you usually got one commodity that was good. It might be wool at the time when cattle were bad, lamb prices were bad and wheat prices were bad. There are exciting times in rural Australia now when we have record prices for wool and we just had a record price for lamb. I pity those who have to buy legs of lamb in the shop at the moment. Lambs made over $300 a head just recently, which is amazing in a drought. All of my life, whenever there was drought, livestock markets just crashed and sheep and cattle sold cheaply, but not this time, because people need and want our food.




Senator Gallacher:
  You've only got 67 million sheep left.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  You make a very good point, Senator Gallacher. During the boom times for wool in the late eighties and early nineties, we had 180 million sheep. Now we're down to fewer than 70 million sheep. Why? Because people are staying with the cattle. The price has been good. So you're not going from commodity to commodity. Normally cattle would crash when wool was good. There was a guaranteed floor price for wool in those days. People sold the cattle, turned tractors off, went into sheep and oversupplied the sheep market and the wool market, and of course it all crashed. Now it is much, much better and the future looks brilliant, except for the rainfall, and we know that will come in time anyway.


What has brought these good times on in rural Australia? I will tell you: trade agreements—$60-odd billion worth of agricultural trade each year and the price going up. It is very exciting. I know it's hard for Australian consumers when they have to pay so much for their beef, lamb and mutton these days, but the trade agreements are bringing wealth into our country. We talk about wages, poverty and lack of wage growth. I'll bet you that good workers on farms today who have been at those farms for some time are getting paid above award wages, and they're probably getting free accommodation, electricity, fuel for their vehicle and some meat provided as well, and the farmer would be paying the fringe benefits tax, because good workers are scarce. We talk about jobs, yet we are desperate for workers in many areas in rural Australia. Getting good workers is the problem.


These agreements have brought wealth back to rural Australia. When the Rudd government was in power, what saved us from recession? Agricultural exports saved us from recession. It has been so many years since we've had a recession in Australia, and I hope that continues. The wealth from exports through these free trade agreements means that we can employ more people and we can pay them more. Sure, it's a tough time. It's probably a poor analogy I'm giving now, because of the drought we're experiencing, but that will break. Of course, the price of land has gone up, simply because they're not making any more of it. That's just a fact. Agricultural land has gone up because it's earning more. It's more valuable. It's providing equity. It's providing a relief to many people on the land through the drought because they can go to their bank and borrow some money to help them keep going, along with government support et cetera. 


My experience was that we got done over big time by the Labor Party. That's how I saw it. I thought it was crazy times when Paul Keating was removing barriers and letting in all these imports. Why would we want to import pig meat? We had plenty of pigs in Australia. We had our own market: about 99 per cent was consumed here and three per cent was exported. Why would we want to import pig meat? But we did. We freed up the trade. As I said, it hurt us. It hurt me personally and my brother Peter. It destroyed our life as pig farmers, which was seven days a week and a lot of work to set it all up. Now the benefit is here. We have seen other countries removing those barriers, as I said, and now we are reaping those benefits. 


The problem with the Greens is that they have no idea of economics. One of the Greens senators is shaking their head; yes, you have no idea, I promise you. When are they going to learn that it is the private sector, the business sector, that derives our nation's wealth? That's where the wealth comes from. The private sector employs the people, and they pay the taxes to keep this place and the government services going. The more you cripple the private sector, the more you cripple a sector which derives our nation's wealth, the more you will reduce our nation's living standards in the future. So they're up the Labor Party and the Liberal-National party government for giving tax cuts to businesses—oh, those terrible businesses that employ people, that create our wealth and that give government the money to provide services! What a shocking mob they are! This is the attitude of the Greens. And, of course, there are these trade deals. 


Why can't we get workers? Why do I have to talk to the management of an abattoir in Inverell where they employ 800 people about workers? It's a great business; it's competing in a world market. Why do we have to have so many workers from Brazil and the Philippines working in an abattoir in Inverell? Why won't the locals work there? We've got plenty of unemployment. The fact is that they don't want to work, or, if they do work, they might fail a grog test when they go to work on Monday morning. 



Senator Dodson interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It's a fact, Senator Dodson. It happens—not only the grog test, but the drug test as well. They won't look after themselves on the weekend or at night, and then they get booted out of work because they've failed the grog test or the drug test. Why do we desperately have to train so many people from overseas?


Why can't our people here pick fruit? That amazes me. We had a big argument in this place—and the Greens actually sided with us to solve the problem—about the backpacker tax. There were 730,000 unemployed Australians and we complained about who was going to pick our fruit. Something doesn't add up to me. What doesn't add up is that some simply don't have a work ethic; they don't want to work. Some are not capable of work. They've probably done enormous damage to themselves through all sorts of drugs and other things which they've put into their body. That probably hasn't helped them mentally or physically one way or the other. These are the problems that we've got and that's why we rely on these overseas workers. 


As we grow the economy with these trade agreements and with the lower taxes—guess what?—business grows. What does business do when it grows? It employs more people. If businesses can't get the people and demand exceeds supply, they have to put their wages up and then prices must go up. Of course, we have our regulator, Fair Work Australia. The fact is that we need trade. We need those barriers removed. And now it's working. I remember politicians coming round to meetings of the National Party, saying, 'Times are going to be good in the future.' I heard this 30 years ago. Well, finally, it has arrived. The trade agreements are here. We're getting the money into rural Australia, we're employing more people and the future looks brilliant. 


The tax cuts we give to those businesses is to let them grow more. What do you think they're going to do with those tax cuts? They're going to grow their businesses. They're going to spend some of that money and help it go around, especially in rural Australia, where we need money to be spent. The drought has not only affected farmers but also severely affected businesses. The wealth is not coming into those regions, because of the drought and the lack of production, and so businesses are suffering badly. That's why we're putting these million dollar grants now into the councils in the drought areas—to get some money into the local areas. So, thinking that tax cuts are bad and free trade agreements are bad is, to me, simply crazy, and I think this motion by the Greens is outrageous.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-10-16,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:35):  I, too, read the letter containing the matter of public importance, a couple of times, and it does bear repeating. It says:


The only solutions that the Liberal and Labor parties have to inequality and wage stagnation come straight from the neoliberal handbook, like ever-increasing company tax cuts and free trade deals that hurt workers.


I didn't know what a neoliberal was until Senator McGrath stood up and owned up to being one. Now I've got some idea of what a neoliberal is. If you google it, you'll find it talks about something in the 19th century that has become a resurgent philosophy for some.


I've seen Senator Siewert's contributions in this chamber and I've seen her contributions in committees, and I would say that she always comes from a reasonably well thought out position. It's very clear she's very passionate—articulate, coming from the right place—about a lot of these issues, and they are deeply felt. This MPI looks like it's been drawn up by the 16-year-old in the office who wants to be in TheWest Wing or some other place, because it's not of a standard that we should be debating. It's from a party that's got a very small vote that wants to get a vote that's a tiny bit bigger, and it's got to appeal to that other half a person that it hasn't quite got in its corner yet. It really is pretty ordinary stuff.


For goodness sake, we know that there's division in the Greens party. Former Senator Rhiannon would have been at one end and other members would have been at the other end of the party room when they debated this sort of stuff. But, honestly, it's pretty low quality. I think it's a pretty ordinary attempt to get a debate going, which is an attempt to get them a couple of extra votes. But let's go to the issues they have raised.


Labor will deliver tax cuts. There's no argument about this. The Labor Party will deliver tax cuts for small and medium businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million a year, delivering certainty in this sector in a fiscally responsible way. Under Labor, small and medium businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million a year will have their tax rate reduced to 25 per cent by 2021-22. Labor have always been a friend of small business; let's not be shy about that. Small business is the engine room of employment. In my previous life, outside this place, I dealt with small business every day. Most of the people in transport are small businesses—thousands and thousands of them. Occasionally, you deal with the multinationals and the larger businesses, who employ lots of small businesses. So our supporting that measure for small business is no great surprise at all, but we'll accommodate the decision in our bottom line by delaying the introduction of the Australian Investment Guarantee by 12 months, building on our record of hard and sensible budget decisions to pay for priorities. There's no bashfulness on the Labor Party side about looking after small business in terms of tax relief.


If we go to the free trade agreements, this is where I do have some level of involvement and perhaps even, dare I say, some level of knowledge, having chaired the Senate inquiries into the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the TPP-12 and the TPP-11. They have all come through the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, which I chair. So, over the years, we've had the ability to go through each and every one of those free trade agreements at length, and tax relief has been a very common feature of all of those free trade agreements. When I had problems with those free trade agreements, I'd approach a minister or a cabinet secretary—say, the Hon. Joe Ludwig—and I'd say, 'Joe, this doesn't seem quite kosher; what's the deal here?' He would say, 'Name a Westminster government anywhere in the world that has its trade agreements approved by parliament.' And you'd go away and you'd have a look at all the Western-type governments anywhere in the world and see that free trade agreements are not approved by parliament; they are an executive prerogative of government.


The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in this parliament, controlled by the government, has made serious recommendations about improving the way trade agreements are formulated, about transparency, about a national interest test and about—dare I say it—ISDS and labour market testing. There have been comments by the government controlled committee in this area. The Senate committee that I chaired held an inquiry into treaty making. It was called 'blind treaty', because essentially that's what all senators in this place are faced with. The treaties are negotiated by the department, usually in secrecy. They're finalised and signed before the parliament gets a look at national interest or before the joint standing committee looks at human rights implications or any of those things, and they're presented to the parliament as a fait accompli. When you dig into that, if you don't want to pass the customs tariff amendment or the enabling regulations, you're putting a sector of agriculture or business—wine, pork or dairy—at a competitive disadvantage.


The imperative to sign the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement was that if we didn't sign it we'd be six per cent worse off compared to American beef. The imperative in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement was that we would face a higher quota than we currently had in competing against New Zealand, or against Chile. So these free trade agreements—I agree with Senator Cameron that it is the greatest misnomer in the world; there's nothing 'free' about these free trade agreements—are exceedingly detailed and complex. And usually, in Australia's case, they involve competition with New Zealand, the United States, Chile or anyone else who's got a very good product and has excess capacity and wants to supply into very valuable markets.


So we make no apology for having done what everybody in the last 25 years has done, which is pass the enabling regulation or custom tariff amendments to put into place free trade agreements, because the alternative is quite unpalatable: putting our very efficient export sectors at a commercial disadvantage compared with other nations and other sectors, and that is really not how we build prosperity, employment and opportunity in this country. I will say this: I do not agree with the absence of labour market testing. I do not agree that ISDS is a common feature of these agreements. If you actually look at the evidence that was put to the Senate committee inquiry into the TPP-11, there is only one sector that wanted ISDS. It wasn't agriculture. In fact, when we asked all the people who submitted, the only ones who actually had a view on it were the Minerals Council of Australia. Appropriately, they had a view that they needed ISDS in case they had an operation in Africa or some other jurisdiction with less-visible legal mechanisms than we currently have in our country or that are in most countries that we deal with. So, it's not a common thing for ISDS to be supported by anybody other than the Minerals Council of Australia. But we had a minister, the Hon. Steve Ciobo, who said, 'By hell or high water, I'm getting these things signed.' He didn't get the best deal. The TPP was started in 2010, and he didn't get the best deal. Senator McGrath said that there'd been seven free trade agreements signed. Well, the negotiations basically were: 'Let's get it done, because it's a political trophy. We can wave it around and get some votes out of it. We'll be saying that the Liberal Party's the one that can get things done.'


There is no national interest evaluation or assessment on these treaties. And, surprisingly, even though we've done about 230 treaties over 90 years, there's no historical assessment of them either. If you want to go back and work out what the net economic benefits of these treaties were, that's almost impossible to find. If you press the government on what the economic benefit of these treaties is, they point to some think tank over there. My view is that we, the Senate and the House of Representatives, should be doing this under the national interest assessment. You should have quantified figures done by the Productivity Commission or some similar organisation. You should have transparency when you're negotiating all the clauses, and you shouldn't have anything that's against the national interest. But that's not the way that these treaty agreements are done in the Westminster system. Essentially, it boils down to this, and the department will tell you so if you press them: whatever the minister wants, the minister gets. Those are their instructions at the end of the day. If the minister wants it signed, it'll be signed, whether it's a good deal or a bad deal.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-16,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:45):  In the same way as Little Red Riding Hood failed to recognise the big, bad wolf, the coalition and Labor have failed to recognise foreign-owned multinationals for the danger they represent to the economy and to Australian workers. Too many multinational companies and their subsidiaries pay little or no tax in Australia. To put that in perspective, taxpayers in the working-class electorate of Longman in Queensland paid more in personal income tax in 2015-16 than all the foreign-owned multinational subsidiaries operating in Australia paid in company income tax.


The pitiful collection of company income tax from multinationals and their subsidiaries represents the strongest argument for reform of the tax system for multinationals. The same pitiful collection of company income tax from multinationals and their subsidiaries removes any economic argument that free trade agreements are good for Australians or the national economy. Additionally, free trade agreements often put Australian workers in direct competition with low-wage workers in countries where child workers are tolerated and where there are few protections for workers or the environment. We are told free trade agreements open up new markets, but the next thing we know jobs have moved abroad to low-wage nations, and that is one of the reasons Trump pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.


The Trans-Pacific Partnership, like every other free trade agreement, was entered into by the government of the day without ever coming before the parliament. It is only later that the government of the day comes to the parliament to seek the passage of enabling legislation like customs tariff schedules. These agreements are about more than trade, because they include the movement of people from other countries to take jobs and they give multinationals the right to sue our government and get the matter arbitrated outside the Australian court system. Who would have imagined that Philip Morris, the cigarette company, would sue the Australian government for losses associated with the plain packaging of cigarettes? It is ridiculous that we are expected to pay multinationals for changes in government policy, but our government keeps agreeing to these investor-state dispute settlement provisions, known as ISDS. New Zealand has managed to void these ISDS provisions with side letters, and I wonder what has stopped Australia from doing the same.


One Nation cannot support trade agreements which put the interests of foreigners and foreign corporations ahead of the interests of Australian workers and the national economy. The government must reform the tax system which applies to foreign-owned multinationals and their subsidiaries in Australia and fill the revenue black hole left by them. The government must have noticed that the interest rate on 10-year US Treasury notes has risen sharply in the past few months. It is over three per cent and expected to rise again. This means the cost of servicing our external debt of $600 billion will rise and make more urgent the need to fill the multinational black hole caused by these companies not paying tax.


One Nation will always put the interests of citizens first, which is why we support tax cuts for businesses with a turnover under $50 million. We do so because we want to see small and medium Australian businesses thrive in Australia and employ Australians in Australia. One Nation supported the corporate tax cuts for turnover of up to $50 million, but the only way to move forward with this and create employment in Australia is to work with the states to reduce payroll tax. That will create employment in the states. Why are companies and businesses paying payroll tax when the average median price in Western Australia or anywhere in Australia can be up to $80,000 a year? A lot of Australians don't get that amount of money, but it only takes 11 people to put them above the threshold. Then you've got businesses who are not putting on more employment, and, with wage increases and superannuation, they are over the threshold and they are not employing more people. In terms of the Greens' policies, their idea of saving this country is to: stop mining resources—billions of dollars gone; shut down farming more—billions of dollars gone; pay all Australians $30,000 each—as if we can afford this; and open the floodgates to immigration and refugees. That is what the Greens' policies are, and Australia would soon become a Third World country.

 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:51):  On behalf of Senator Collins, I present the 171st report of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, entitled Person referred to in the Senate: Mr John Lloyd PSM.


Ordered that the report be adopted.




Senator KETTER:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This report is the 75th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to in the Senate, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified.


On 28 August 2018, the President received a submission from Mr John Lloyd PSM, relating to a report tabled in the Senate on 21 August 2018. The President referred the submission to the committee under Privilege Resolution 5. The committee considered the submission and recommends that the proposed response be incorporated in Hansard.




The document read as follows—



Appendix 1


Attachment


Statement pursuant to Section 5 - Protection of persons Referred to in the Senate Privilege Resolutions


By John Lloyd


1. The Merit Protection Commissioner (MPC) submitted a report to the Presiding Officers on 7 August 2018. The Report was titled:




Report of the Results of Inquiries by the Merit Protection Commissioner under Section 50(1
) (
b) of the Public Service Act 1999 to the Presiding Officers into Alleged Breaches of the Code of Conduct by the Australian Public Service Commissioner received on 11 January and 4 June 2018.



2. I resigned as Australian Public Service Commissioner on 8 August 2018.


3. I submit that I am named in the Report. I claim that I have been adversely affected in reputation by the references to me in the Report.


4. I set out in this paper a summary of the adverse references that adversely affected my reputation and my response to the references.


5. The impact of the adverse references was amplified by what I consider were most unsatisfactory processes adopted in the handling of the complaints leading to the Report. My rights to a fair hearing were not respected.


Findings of the Report


6. The Report finds that my decision to provide a document to the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) amounted to a failure to uphold the good reputation of the Australian Public Service (APS).


7. The rationale for this conclusion is flawed.


8. The first aspect of the complaint against me is that the document was created for the sole purpose of providing it to the IPA. This was not sustained. Ample evidence was produced to prove that the paper was created for another purpose. The MPC accepted this point and made a finding that this ground of the complaint was not sustained.


9. The second aspect of the complaint was that providing the document to the IPA was inappropriate.


10. It is asserted that I should have diverted the request for the document to a Media Team, another SES officer or I should have directed the IPA to submit a Freedom of Information request for the material.


11. The reasoning for this conclusion is unsound. The Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) receives numerous requests for information. It is a normal and embedded part of the business of the


APSC. Agencies like the APSC have a responsibility to share information with outside bodies and the public.


12. The APSC as a central government agency compiles extensive information that is of interest to others. The APSC shares an enormous amount of data and information with outside entities. The entities typically include think tanks like the IPA, academic researchers, unions, employer groups, international entities e.g. the OECD and other government bodies in Australia and overseas. The clear operating context is to provide the information if it is within our possession .


13. The document containing the information that the IPA requested was in our possession. It was therefore straightforward to provide the document to the IPA.


14. I submit it would be ludicrous to request the IPA to submit a FOI report. This would involve unnecessary delay and cost for both parties. I have never adopted such an approach in circumstances like this.


15. A decision to pass the request to another SES officer would have the appearance of a contrived arrangement. It would be seen as simply a device for me to avoid responsibility. The document was in existence, a number of officers had contributed to it. I informed others of the request that was made to me by the IPA. The straightforward, efficient and simple approach was to email the document to the Executive Director of the IPA.


16. The Report observes that a contributing factor to its finding was that by providing the report controversy arose for myself, the APSC and the public service . I assume this view is based on a reaction from those opposed to the Government's bargaining policy, particularly union officials.


17. Such an assertion displays a staggering ignorance and naivety of the way workplace bargaining is conducted.


18. The APSC was responsible for coordinating the implementation of the policy in a hard bargaining environment. The policy contained an explicit objective of removing restrictive content from enterprise agreements. The unions and the Opposition were very critical of the Government's policy. As APS Commissioner I was expected to take a leading role in implementing the policy.


19. The Report argues the provision of the paper to the IPA would be seen as ""building a coalition of support for his views."" This observation misconstrues the nature and fierceness of the workplace bargaining circumstances and my responsibilities as APS Commissioner. It is entirely reasonable and appropriate to build support for the Government's policy. The opponents employed a range of tactics with vigor to build support for their position. It is would be contrary to my obligation as APS Commissioner, responsible for the good reputation of the APS, not to build support for the policy position of the Government.


20. Most statements I or the APSC made were vigorously rebutted by strong language and attacks from union officials. Misrepresentation of APSC statements and advice by the unions occurred regularly. It is ridiculous in the extreme to assert that the action to build support and to use the term "" soft agreements"" in these circumstances was inappropriate e.


21. The MPC and the Report has consistently ignored the backdrop to this early period of my tenure as APS Commissioner. The unions and some ALP parliamentarians opposed my appointment to the posit ion from day one. They indulged in very personal attacks. Any position I advocated inevitably generated strong opposition and criticism. I am accustomed to this tone of response from such people. I have never chosen to succumb to personal abuse. The reasoning in the Report takes one down the path of yielding to such tactics. Such an approach would have been contrary to my responsibilities as APS Commissioner.


22. The Report observes that I did not act with dishonesty or a lack of integrity. However, curiously I did not act ethically. I find the reasoning hard to follow. It conveys the sense of a hard search to find something adverse.


23. All other elements of the two complaints were not sustained.


Conduct of the Inquiry


24. I wrote to the Presiding Officers on 6 August 2018 setting out my concerns about aspects of t he conduct of the Inquiry. I also wrote to the MPC on 2 August 2018 outlining the concerns in some detail. The letter to the MPC is attached to the Report.


25. I consider that the inquiry was conducted in such a deficient manner that it miscarried and that my right to a fair hearing were manifestly infringed.


26. I now summarise my concerns .


27. Conflict of Interest. Mr John McMillan was appointed by the Acting MPC on about 14 June 2018 to investigate the complaints. I discovered in late July 2018 that he had given a media interview in September 2015 strongly criticising an aspect of my performance as APS Commissioner. Mr McMillan was upset about views I had ventured about freedom of information He described my position as ""terrible."" Three media outlets carried the interview and associated commentary. My discovery occurred at a time when the investigation was near completion.


28. I then learnt from the Report on 7 August 2018 that the Acting MPC knew of this public criticism at the time Mr McMillan was appointed. Apparently, he and the MPC conclude d that this did not constitute a conflict of interest. It is reasoned that the comments concerned matters unrelated to this inquiry.


29. That position with respect does not stand scrutiny. The criticism are adverse comments about how I was discharging my responsibilities in the position of APS Commissioner. The position subject to the investigation Mr McMillan conducted. It is crucial that such inquiries are seen to be impartial in a manner that is beyond doubt. I deal with many code of conduct complaints. I treat conflict of interest considerations with the utmost care. I would decline to personally conduct an investigation in these circumstances.


30. Mr McMillan has, given his career experience, some expertise in the area of freedom of information. He was obviousl y aggrieved by my comments; to such an extent he felt compelled to call them out in a media interview about his career. Debate about FOi is ongoing and many people articulate views on the matter. It is clear however that Mr McMillan took note of my views to such an extent that he wanted to challenge and denigrate them publicly. This to me presents a real conflict situation.


31. The Acting MPC did not bother to alert me to this potential conflict. Neither did Mr McMillan. I was denied the opportunity to make a submission on the question of whether Mr McMillan should recuse himself. If I had been given the opportunity I would have sought that outcome.


32. The course of events gives rise to an alarming incongruity. I was being examined on the question of whether my actions constituted a conflict of interest. However, the inquiry itself is compromised by a potential conflict of interest that was concealed from me.


33. Terms Exceeded. The terms of the inquiry conducted by Mr McMillan were to investigate whether the document had been prepared for the sole purpose of providing it to the IPA. These terms are clear and are stated in letters that passed between the Acting MPC, Mr McMillan and myself.


34. Mr McMillan concluded that the document was not created for the sole purpose of providing it to the IPA. Howe ver, he proceeds to make a finding that the provision of the document resulted in a breach of the Code of Conduct. This mean t he made a finding that was beyond the terms of his investigation. I submit due process was ignored.


35. I was never informed that the investigation was going to travel beyond its terms. If I had been so informed my evidence and the documents I relied on would have been materially different. This is a crucial point. My interpretation of the limited scope of the inquiry was not challengednor explicitly repudiated in any form. The MPC case rests on me interpreting the subtleties in the scope of questioning during an interview of almos t 2 hours conducted by Mr McMillan. The M?C clearly fai led to clarify a changed or expanded scope of the inquiry on any occasion. No advice was provided such as - the terms of the inquiry advised to you by the Acting MPC and Mr McMillan are limited/repudiated and a broader scope of Inquiry is to be followed


36. In a conversation responding to Mr McMillan's draft report I raised this issue of going beyond the terms of the inquiry. Mr McMillan responded with words that troubled me. He said something like"" they (or there would be) disappointment if the broader issue was not addr essed ."" When I challenged him who they were he was evasive and did not answer.


37. Also, the Acting MPC decided in June 2018 that there was no case to answer regardin g the provision, rather than the creation, of the documen t to the IPA. It was a concluded decision. The decision was then reflect ed in the terms of Mr McM illan 's investigation. It is invalid for the MPC to subsequently reopen and reconsider the June 2018 decision. Even if the MPC believed this course was defensible, I should have been afforded an opportunity to respond to the broader consid erations. I was not given such an opportunity.


38. Transcript. Mr McMillan conducted a 1 hour 50 minute recorded int erview with me. I was promised a transcript of the interview. This would allow me to verify its accuracy and rely on the transcript to respond to any findings that emerged from the interview.


39. This arrangement failed to be upheld. I had to request the transcript to be provided to me. I received it only hours before I was required to reply to the draft findings of Mr McMillan. The reports that encompassed those findings were 21 and 12 pages in length respectively. The transcript was 102 pages in length.


40. Haste of Inquiry. The inquiry was delayed. Several months elapsed between the lodging of the first complaint and the commencement of the inquir y. I then ann ounced my retirement from the APS Commissioner position with effect from 8 August 2018. The announcement was made on 4 June 2018.


41. This has resulted in rushed processe s and unreasonable timelines compounded by a very formal and legal disposition to the conduct of the matter. The end result was unreasonable deadlines being


imposed on me and a firm resistance to any extensions of time.


42. Witnesses were not interviewed to my know ledge. I find it surprising that witnesses such as Mr Roskam of the IPA, senior APSC executives and former Minister Abetz were not apprcached to give evidence.


43. Leaks. I have been dismayed by at least two very damaging leaks to media outlets. One was the details of a complaint. The other was the leaking of large and important aspects of the Report almost two weeks before it was tabled in the Senate.


44. I complained on both occasions to the i\/lPC. I have not even had the courtesy of a response to my complaints. I have no evidence or assurance t herefore that the MPC t akes the leaking of material as a serious transgression.


45. The leaks of course were intended to damage my position and reput at ion. The result was more adverse publicity pre-judging the outcom e of proper process and an enlivening of abusive social media commentary.


46. Conclusio n. Many aspects of the inqu iry have been most unsatisfactory and prejudiced my right to a fair procedure. Also, the report's finding adversely affect ed my reputation.


47. I acted openly, honestly and with integrity in providing the document to the IPA. I made no attempt to disguise my actions. I have thro ughout my car e er been prepared to challenge union policies and tactics. This has been expected of me in a num ber of senior roles, includi ng as APS Commissio ner. It is importa nt that senior leaders embrace such responsibilit ies to ensure the APS Employment Principles and APS Values are upheld.

Senator KETTER:
  The committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or the persons referred to. Rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in Privilege Resolution 5. I commend the motion to the Senate.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:53):  John Lloyd, a man who has been a professional union buster, a man who has spent his life trying to stop workers getting decent wages and decent conditions, who was a hero of the coalition, who was a member of the HR Nicholls Society, who was an active participant and employee of the Institute of Public Affairs, has finally left public life and not before time. He has left public life in ignominy, in disgrace, doing what he always did—trying to undermine workers' wages and conditions and doing the bidding of this rabble of a coalition government. This is a man who has spent his life moving from state government to federal government, attacking workers' rights in this country. This is a man who ended up as the Public Service Commissioner. I've seen various figures of up to about $700,000 a year appointed by the coalition in reward for doing the bidding of the coalition, a reward for continuing to attack the trade union movement and workers in this country. Good riddance to John Lloyd.


This is typical of this coalition. They appoint their apparatchiks. They appoint their political mates. They appoint former advisers to what are supposedly independent, public organisations. They then use them to deliver their agenda within the statutory authorities that are supposedly independent. John Lloyd never had an independent bone in his body—never. It was simply the coalition's reward for services attacking working people. This is a guy who got an award from the HR Nicholls Society, the Charles Copeman Award. What did he get that award for? Basically, it was for screwing workers. That's the bottom line. This guy, a member of the HR Nicholls Society, never gave up his involvement with the HR Nicholls Society and never gave up his involvement with the Institute of Public Affairs.


Do you remember Charles Copeman? Charles Copeman, for those who haven't been around long enough, was the businessman who said, 'Workers should come to work scared every day.' That's what he said. So it wasn't unusual, I would think, for John Lloyd to be given that award, because that was his modus operandi: 'Workers should be scared when they come to work. Workers should kowtow to the boss. Workers should have no industrial rights. Workers should be in almost slave-like conditions for the boss, do everything the boss wants and have no capacity to act in their own interests.' That's what this guy was about, yet he was constantly given key positions by coalition governments, state and federal. He was a professional union attack dog; that's what this guy was. He ended up in disgrace.


When John Lloyd was appointed, I said at the time that he would set the scene for industrial confrontation that would reduce Public Service morale and productivity. I wasn't Nostradamus. You didn't need to be too smart to know that that's what this guy would do. I said, 'He's an IPA pin-up boy, an extreme ideologue.' There's no doubt that that's what he did. He went on to say that workers can't be guaranteed job security, but this guy was given job security and $700,000 pay cheques by the coalition. This is the modus operandi of this mob.


Remember, it's almost 12 months to the day since Senator Cash sat in Senate estimates and, on five occasions, misled the Senate. Since then, she's been hiding behind Federal Police investigations—probably the longest Federal Police investigation I can remember—into a serious breach of the law in the Public Service. It has been going for 12 months. If anyone from the Federal Police is listening in, where is this report?


Senator Cash, in her previous ministerial appointment, was up to her neck with John Lloyd before he got chucked out. Senator Abetz was the guy who appointed John Lloyd. And we know that John Lloyd was trouble for working people in this country. That's all he ever was: trouble for working people. On many occasions he emailed the IPA and provided commentary to the IPA. What he ended up doing was resigning in absolute disgrace. He had to resign in disgrace because he had not acted in the strong traditions of the Public Service. He never was going to do that.


Under this rabble of a coalition government, you have mates getting put into key positions in statutory, so-called independent bodies and doing the bidding of the coalition—the Registered Organisations Commission for one, the Fair Work Ombudsman for two, the ABCC for three, the Public Service Commission for four. This is what this lot are about. They misuse their power. They are no better than some of the worst governments in the world when it comes to this. They are just awful. John Lloyd gladly did their bidding and gladly defended them. At one stage, he was a mate of the commissioner for the ABCC, Nigel Hadgkiss. Remember him? He was another appointment by this coalition who, again, had to resign in disgrace, ignominiously, from his position. That's what happens when you appoint ideologues. That's what happens when you appoint your mates to statutory positions and then use them to attack working people in this country.


John Lloyd should have gone through a full process of investigation into what he did. But what did he do? He took the coward's way out and he resigned. He never had a backbone, this guy. He was always good at attacking working people, always good at telling workers that they should have no job security, when he got 700 grand a year from his mates in the coalition. I have been trying to hold these people to account—both Hadgkiss and Lloyd—for the 10 years I've been in the Senate. And I've got to tell you, it is really good that I've seen both of them off. I'm still here and they are gone.




Senator Sterle:
  And disgraced.




Senator CAMERON:
  And in disgrace. They have gone in disgrace, and so will this government. This government will end up being defeated. This government will be in disgrace. The government have got no moral compass. They are playing footsies with One Nation. Look at what they've done to try to gain a few votes in Wentworth. They are a terrible government. They are a rabble of a government. The sooner we see the back of them, the better. Goodbye, John Lloyd, and good riddance! I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:51):  On behalf of Senator Collins, I present the 171st report of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, entitled Person referred to in the Senate: Mr John Lloyd PSM.


Ordered that the report be adopted.




Senator KETTER:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This report is the 75th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to in the Senate, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified.


On 28 August 2018, the President received a submission from Mr John Lloyd PSM, relating to a report tabled in the Senate on 21 August 2018. The President referred the submission to the committee under Privilege Resolution 5. The committee considered the submission and recommends that the proposed response be incorporated in Hansard.




The document read as follows—



Appendix 1


Attachment


Statement pursuant to Section 5 - Protection of persons Referred to in the Senate Privilege Resolutions


By John Lloyd


1. The Merit Protection Commissioner (MPC) submitted a report to the Presiding Officers on 7 August 2018. The Report was titled:




Report of the Results of Inquiries by the Merit Protection Commissioner under Section 50(1
) (
b) of the Public Service Act 1999 to the Presiding Officers into Alleged Breaches of the Code of Conduct by the Australian Public Service Commissioner received on 11 January and 4 June 2018.



2. I resigned as Australian Public Service Commissioner on 8 August 2018.


3. I submit that I am named in the Report. I claim that I have been adversely affected in reputation by the references to me in the Report.


4. I set out in this paper a summary of the adverse references that adversely affected my reputation and my response to the references.


5. The impact of the adverse references was amplified by what I consider were most unsatisfactory processes adopted in the handling of the complaints leading to the Report. My rights to a fair hearing were not respected.


Findings of the Report


6. The Report finds that my decision to provide a document to the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) amounted to a failure to uphold the good reputation of the Australian Public Service (APS).


7. The rationale for this conclusion is flawed.


8. The first aspect of the complaint against me is that the document was created for the sole purpose of providing it to the IPA. This was not sustained. Ample evidence was produced to prove that the paper was created for another purpose. The MPC accepted this point and made a finding that this ground of the complaint was not sustained.


9. The second aspect of the complaint was that providing the document to the IPA was inappropriate.


10. It is asserted that I should have diverted the request for the document to a Media Team, another SES officer or I should have directed the IPA to submit a Freedom of Information request for the material.


11. The reasoning for this conclusion is unsound. The Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) receives numerous requests for information. It is a normal and embedded part of the business of the


APSC. Agencies like the APSC have a responsibility to share information with outside bodies and the public.


12. The APSC as a central government agency compiles extensive information that is of interest to others. The APSC shares an enormous amount of data and information with outside entities. The entities typically include think tanks like the IPA, academic researchers, unions, employer groups, international entities e.g. the OECD and other government bodies in Australia and overseas. The clear operating context is to provide the information if it is within our possession .


13. The document containing the information that the IPA requested was in our possession. It was therefore straightforward to provide the document to the IPA.


14. I submit it would be ludicrous to request the IPA to submit a FOI report. This would involve unnecessary delay and cost for both parties. I have never adopted such an approach in circumstances like this.


15. A decision to pass the request to another SES officer would have the appearance of a contrived arrangement. It would be seen as simply a device for me to avoid responsibility. The document was in existence, a number of officers had contributed to it. I informed others of the request that was made to me by the IPA. The straightforward, efficient and simple approach was to email the document to the Executive Director of the IPA.


16. The Report observes that a contributing factor to its finding was that by providing the report controversy arose for myself, the APSC and the public service . I assume this view is based on a reaction from those opposed to the Government's bargaining policy, particularly union officials.


17. Such an assertion displays a staggering ignorance and naivety of the way workplace bargaining is conducted.


18. The APSC was responsible for coordinating the implementation of the policy in a hard bargaining environment. The policy contained an explicit objective of removing restrictive content from enterprise agreements. The unions and the Opposition were very critical of the Government's policy. As APS Commissioner I was expected to take a leading role in implementing the policy.


19. The Report argues the provision of the paper to the IPA would be seen as ""building a coalition of support for his views."" This observation misconstrues the nature and fierceness of the workplace bargaining circumstances and my responsibilities as APS Commissioner. It is entirely reasonable and appropriate to build support for the Government's policy. The opponents employed a range of tactics with vigor to build support for their position. It is would be contrary to my obligation as APS Commissioner, responsible for the good reputation of the APS, not to build support for the policy position of the Government.


20. Most statements I or the APSC made were vigorously rebutted by strong language and attacks from union officials. Misrepresentation of APSC statements and advice by the unions occurred regularly. It is ridiculous in the extreme to assert that the action to build support and to use the term "" soft agreements"" in these circumstances was inappropriate e.


21. The MPC and the Report has consistently ignored the backdrop to this early period of my tenure as APS Commissioner. The unions and some ALP parliamentarians opposed my appointment to the posit ion from day one. They indulged in very personal attacks. Any position I advocated inevitably generated strong opposition and criticism. I am accustomed to this tone of response from such people. I have never chosen to succumb to personal abuse. The reasoning in the Report takes one down the path of yielding to such tactics. Such an approach would have been contrary to my responsibilities as APS Commissioner.


22. The Report observes that I did not act with dishonesty or a lack of integrity. However, curiously I did not act ethically. I find the reasoning hard to follow. It conveys the sense of a hard search to find something adverse.


23. All other elements of the two complaints were not sustained.


Conduct of the Inquiry


24. I wrote to the Presiding Officers on 6 August 2018 setting out my concerns about aspects of t he conduct of the Inquiry. I also wrote to the MPC on 2 August 2018 outlining the concerns in some detail. The letter to the MPC is attached to the Report.


25. I consider that the inquiry was conducted in such a deficient manner that it miscarried and that my right to a fair hearing were manifestly infringed.


26. I now summarise my concerns .


27. Conflict of Interest. Mr John McMillan was appointed by the Acting MPC on about 14 June 2018 to investigate the complaints. I discovered in late July 2018 that he had given a media interview in September 2015 strongly criticising an aspect of my performance as APS Commissioner. Mr McMillan was upset about views I had ventured about freedom of information He described my position as ""terrible."" Three media outlets carried the interview and associated commentary. My discovery occurred at a time when the investigation was near completion.


28. I then learnt from the Report on 7 August 2018 that the Acting MPC knew of this public criticism at the time Mr McMillan was appointed. Apparently, he and the MPC conclude d that this did not constitute a conflict of interest. It is reasoned that the comments concerned matters unrelated to this inquiry.


29. That position with respect does not stand scrutiny. The criticism are adverse comments about how I was discharging my responsibilities in the position of APS Commissioner. The position subject to the investigation Mr McMillan conducted. It is crucial that such inquiries are seen to be impartial in a manner that is beyond doubt. I deal with many code of conduct complaints. I treat conflict of interest considerations with the utmost care. I would decline to personally conduct an investigation in these circumstances.


30. Mr McMillan has, given his career experience, some expertise in the area of freedom of information. He was obviousl y aggrieved by my comments; to such an extent he felt compelled to call them out in a media interview about his career. Debate about FOi is ongoing and many people articulate views on the matter. It is clear however that Mr McMillan took note of my views to such an extent that he wanted to challenge and denigrate them publicly. This to me presents a real conflict situation.


31. The Acting MPC did not bother to alert me to this potential conflict. Neither did Mr McMillan. I was denied the opportunity to make a submission on the question of whether Mr McMillan should recuse himself. If I had been given the opportunity I would have sought that outcome.


32. The course of events gives rise to an alarming incongruity. I was being examined on the question of whether my actions constituted a conflict of interest. However, the inquiry itself is compromised by a potential conflict of interest that was concealed from me.


33. Terms Exceeded. The terms of the inquiry conducted by Mr McMillan were to investigate whether the document had been prepared for the sole purpose of providing it to the IPA. These terms are clear and are stated in letters that passed between the Acting MPC, Mr McMillan and myself.


34. Mr McMillan concluded that the document was not created for the sole purpose of providing it to the IPA. Howe ver, he proceeds to make a finding that the provision of the document resulted in a breach of the Code of Conduct. This mean t he made a finding that was beyond the terms of his investigation. I submit due process was ignored.


35. I was never informed that the investigation was going to travel beyond its terms. If I had been so informed my evidence and the documents I relied on would have been materially different. This is a crucial point. My interpretation of the limited scope of the inquiry was not challengednor explicitly repudiated in any form. The MPC case rests on me interpreting the subtleties in the scope of questioning during an interview of almos t 2 hours conducted by Mr McMillan. The M?C clearly fai led to clarify a changed or expanded scope of the inquiry on any occasion. No advice was provided such as - the terms of the inquiry advised to you by the Acting MPC and Mr McMillan are limited/repudiated and a broader scope of Inquiry is to be followed


36. In a conversation responding to Mr McMillan's draft report I raised this issue of going beyond the terms of the inquiry. Mr McMillan responded with words that troubled me. He said something like"" they (or there would be) disappointment if the broader issue was not addr essed ."" When I challenged him who they were he was evasive and did not answer.


37. Also, the Acting MPC decided in June 2018 that there was no case to answer regardin g the provision, rather than the creation, of the documen t to the IPA. It was a concluded decision. The decision was then reflect ed in the terms of Mr McM illan 's investigation. It is invalid for the MPC to subsequently reopen and reconsider the June 2018 decision. Even if the MPC believed this course was defensible, I should have been afforded an opportunity to respond to the broader consid erations. I was not given such an opportunity.


38. Transcript. Mr McMillan conducted a 1 hour 50 minute recorded int erview with me. I was promised a transcript of the interview. This would allow me to verify its accuracy and rely on the transcript to respond to any findings that emerged from the interview.


39. This arrangement failed to be upheld. I had to request the transcript to be provided to me. I received it only hours before I was required to reply to the draft findings of Mr McMillan. The reports that encompassed those findings were 21 and 12 pages in length respectively. The transcript was 102 pages in length.


40. Haste of Inquiry. The inquiry was delayed. Several months elapsed between the lodging of the first complaint and the commencement of the inquir y. I then ann ounced my retirement from the APS Commissioner position with effect from 8 August 2018. The announcement was made on 4 June 2018.


41. This has resulted in rushed processe s and unreasonable timelines compounded by a very formal and legal disposition to the conduct of the matter. The end result was unreasonable deadlines being


imposed on me and a firm resistance to any extensions of time.


42. Witnesses were not interviewed to my know ledge. I find it surprising that witnesses such as Mr Roskam of the IPA, senior APSC executives and former Minister Abetz were not apprcached to give evidence.


43. Leaks. I have been dismayed by at least two very damaging leaks to media outlets. One was the details of a complaint. The other was the leaking of large and important aspects of the Report almost two weeks before it was tabled in the Senate.


44. I complained on both occasions to the i\/lPC. I have not even had the courtesy of a response to my complaints. I have no evidence or assurance t herefore that the MPC t akes the leaking of material as a serious transgression.


45. The leaks of course were intended to damage my position and reput at ion. The result was more adverse publicity pre-judging the outcom e of proper process and an enlivening of abusive social media commentary.


46. Conclusio n. Many aspects of the inqu iry have been most unsatisfactory and prejudiced my right to a fair procedure. Also, the report's finding adversely affect ed my reputation.


47. I acted openly, honestly and with integrity in providing the document to the IPA. I made no attempt to disguise my actions. I have thro ughout my car e er been prepared to challenge union policies and tactics. This has been expected of me in a num ber of senior roles, includi ng as APS Commissio ner.

 (New South Wales) (17:53):  John Lloyd, a man who has been a professional union buster, a man who has spent his life trying to stop workers getting decent wages and decent conditions, who was a hero of the coalition, who was a member of the HR Nicholls Society, who was an active participant and employee of the Institute of Public Affairs, has finally left public life and not before time. He has left public life in ignominy, in disgrace, doing what he always did—trying to undermine workers' wages and conditions and doing the bidding of this rabble of a coalition government.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2018-10-16,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:08):  by leave—When this government announced its white paper on northern development three years ago, we mapped out a 20-year plan to develop the north, the first white paper by any Commonwealth government to develop Northern Australia. The government have made significant progress on implementing our plan, including the construction of roads, dams and other infrastructure, and three-quarters of the white paper's recommendations have been implemented.


During the past year, we have just gone past the 10 per cent time mark on our 20-year plan. While the progress we have made is substantial we must remember that true progress on northern development will take time. What is needed now is persistence to stick with the plan so that we can make a real difference.


This third annual statement tonight is noteworthy for the great momentum being built, the concrete results being delivered and the untapped potential being realised in a region that is already an economic powerhouse, for our nation yet has so much more to offer:


As I speak:


extensive road upgrades are connecting industry and producers to markets and making travel safer for northern communities,


industry-led research is generating productivity gains in industries that are critical to wealth creation,


water resource assessments are reducing the risks for investors to encourage financial commitment to major water storage infrastructure developments, and


each northern jurisdiction is benefiting from private sector investment thanks to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.


So far more than 74 per cent of the measures in the white paper have been implemented—that is, 38 of the 51 measures have been delivered. But our plan for the north was never intended to be a short-term agenda; we've continued to invest in it this year, the 2018-19 budget a clear indication of our commitment to its continuity.




Building world-class infrastructure



The northern agenda is a nation-building agenda, and it's rightly characterised as an infrastructure-driven agenda. Roads, railways, ports, airports, water and energy supply, telecommunications—they are all fundamental to the proper functioning of any modern economy. Making infrastructure development the linchpin of our plan for the north is therefore a necessary strategic objective.


It is gratifying to see that infrastructure development in the north, fostered by our agenda, is gathering pace. And all who live, work, do business and travel in the north stand to benefit. Nearly half of the 37 projects planned under the $700 million Northern Australia Roads Program and Northern Australian Beef Roads Program are either complete or underway. They are improving safety and access to services; more efficiently connecting communities and businesses to domestic and international markets; and allowing locals to earn money. These road upgrades are creating up to 2,400 direct jobs for the local communities involved, including significant business and employment opportunities for Indigenous people.


The impact of this investment is felt far beyond direct employment. Mayor Tom Gilmore of the Mareeba Shire Council in Far North Queensland says that on the Hann Highway the Northern Australia Roads Program is transforming vital infrastructure.


He says:


It will make an enormous difference to not only the lives of the people who live beside it, but also to the cattle, fruit and vegetable, agricultural and minerals industries.


It is heartening to hear that through these investments, we are driving economic growth in these industries.


In Western Australia works have commenced on the Cape Leveque Road, north of Broome on the Dampier Peninsula. The remaining 90 kilometres are being sealed, creating bigger opportunities for tourism and other industries. Twenty full-time positions on this project have been created for Aboriginal workers and 20 per cent of the subcontracted works are being delivered by Aboriginal businesses.


In the Northern Territory we are well underway with further upgrades to the Buntine Highway, one of the Northern Territory's high-priority cattle routes. This benefits the region's cattle industry with around 15 partial substations relying heavily on the Buntine Highway to get their cattle to markets. In our white paper, we identified the iconic Outback Way as a priority route right across the north.


The first of five new Queensland upgrades is now underway, with further upgrades planned for the Northern Territory and Western Australian roads that make up this inland route. This year we allocated a further $160 million towards the Outback Way, taking our overall commitment to $330 million for this nation-building project. We are on track to seal this third route, east-west, across our nation. These upgrades assist the communities and industries who rely on them for essential services and create potential for more employment and growth in the mining, agricultural and tourism sectors right across the north. We are building further on these roads initiatives.


This year's announcement of the Roads of Strategic Importance program, a decade-long commitment in this year's budget, invests an additional $1.5 billion directly in Northern Australia. The program will upgrade key agricultural and mining corridors to open up local supply chains and provide more reliable and safer transport links for freight, tourism and community road users. Access to domestic and export markets will be easier, enhanced through better connection to intermodal freight facilities. This investment will be a great boost to the northern economy and over the next decade will add to the jobs that have already been created.




Encouraging private investment



Since the last report, private sector engagement with our northern agenda has been steadily translated into actual investment with the help of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility—the NAIF. I have acknowledged that the NAIF's progress did not meet our initial expectations. The NAIF is an innovative way for governments to fund nation building infrastructure by partnering with private investors. It is understandable that it has taken some time and some refinements to make this new approach work.


Last year I commissioned a review by Tony Shepherd to investigate the NAIF's progress and suggest changes that could help unlock its funding. In response we have amended the NAIF's investment mandate to increase its flexibility and to improve its potential to support projects to deliver more jobs and economic opportunities across the north. These changes have expanded the types of infrastructure the NAIF can fund—from airports and energy networks to abattoirs—and increased the amount it can lend to some projects. It is my view that these changes have helped pick up the pace of NAIF funding.


The NAIF's total investment, including conditional approvals, is now nearly $1 billion, with a total new projects value of up to $2.3 billion. I want to thank Khory McCormick, the chair of the NAIF, Sharon Warburton, the previous chair, and their team for the dynamic way they have approached this task and turned things around. Their changed approach is helping to unlock new opportunities across Northern Australia.


Take, for example, the Pilbara, Western Australia's mining powerhouse. Earnings from that region alone, with a population of just 60,000 people, are larger than the individual economies of 119 countries. (i) Yet the Pilbara has more room to create additional wealth if the necessary infrastructure is in place. The NAIF is helping generate private investment for such infrastructure.


The government, through the NAIF, has provided a $19.5 million loan to a subsidiary of Pilbara Minerals Ltd to upgrade a 70-kilometre public road from its Pilgangoora mine, home to one of the world's largest known lithium ore deposits. The loan will help get lithium from the mine to the port more efficiently, boost exports of lithium from the Pilbara, and improve travel times and safety for a wide range of road users in the region. Lithium is, of course, used in batteries for a whole range of consumer products—from portable electric devices to electric vehicles. There is a huge growing demand for such batteries and the NAIF is making sure that Australia is best placed to capture a growing share of this global market.


Our first investment for the NAIF in Queensland will transform the James Cook University campus to be a university of the future. Their landmark Technology Innovation Complex will provide contemporary facilities for a new focus on engineering for the tropics. Public benefits will be around $700 million for the first 30 years.


The NAIF has also provided conditional approval for major upgrades to airport infrastructure in Darwin, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. This includes investments in cold storage, an export hub, upgrades and solar energy farms with an off-site multiuse battery. This project alone is likely to generate 1,000 jobs through the construction phase, support around 500 indirect jobs, and create 140 new ongoing positions. The projects set the airports up for greater tourist numbers and allow producers to export fresh agriculture and aquaculture products direct to market.


Through investments like these, the NAIF is fulfilling its aim of helping the private sector access the capital it needs to help drive infrastructure and economic development in the north. I am pleased that, following our changes, we are seeing more investment decisions from the NAIF, and it is making a substantial contribution to the development of the north's economy. 




Harnessing more of the north's water resources



We have made good progress in driving an agenda to develop new water infrastructure in Northern Australia too. The ability to capture and store more of the region's rainfall, which accounts for around 60 per cent of Australia's total rainfall, is critical to our agenda to develop the north. Currently, just two per cent of this rainfall is being used. (ii) The government's $580 million Northern Water Infrastructure Development Fund has committed $230 million to Northern Australian water projects. Nine of the 15 water infrastructure feasibility studies commissioned out of this funding have already been completed. We have committed just over $176 million to build the Rookwood Weir in cooperation with the Queensland government, $3 million to modernise the Nogoa Mackenzie Water Supply Scheme, and $11.6 million to modernise the Mareeba-Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme in North Queensland.


We now have more confidence in the north's potential for expanding agricultural production. Just recently the CSIRO completed scientific assessments that identified up to 387,000 hectares across key water catchments with the potential for agricultural crops such as sugar cane and cotton. These opportunities are in the Mitchell River catchment in Queensland, the Fitzroy River catchment in Western Australia, the Finniss River catchment in Adelaide, and the Mary River and Wildman River catchments around Darwin in the Northern Territory. The assessments have also identified 710,000 hectares of additional coastal land that could accommodate lined aquaculture ponds. The data from these assessments set a baseline for major advancement in irrigated agriculture, giving investors the information they need to reduce risks and make informed decisions to finance large-scale infrastructure in the north.




Fostering globally competitive industries



Another piece of encouraging progress over the past year is that more businesses and industries in northern Australia are getting support from Australia's world-class researchers to flourish and stay globally competitive. The government's investment in research and development in the north is fostering world-leading innovation such as smart supply chains and generating new ideas to capitalise on the region's strengths and address its challenges.


The work of the Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia is an excellent example of the positive difference our investment is making in the north. With funding of $75 million over 10 years, the CRC is supporting industry-led research collaborations in food and agriculture, health service delivery and traditional-owner-led business developments. Last October, I announced seven collaborative research projects in northern Australia totalling $13.9 million that leveraged partnering contributions of $37 million.


Since then, the CRC for Developing Northern Australia has announced funding of almost $3.6 million towards 12 new industry-led projects with a combined project value of over $12 million. Just last month, the CRC announced its latest funding—a $500,000 grant to trial new methods to double the north's mango production and increase business profit margins. The three-year project is a collaboration between two large commercial mango growers—Manbulloo Ltd and BJM Enterprises—and the Australian Mango Industry Association, and the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Grower Marie Piccone from Manbulloo, Australia's leading producer of Kensington Pride mangoes—they're coming back into season—says the CRC research and innovation has helped improve her company's performance. They're supplying Australian customers and exporting direct to the global industry. By streamlining the supply chain with automation in harvesting and packing, they're reducing their company's costs. 


Growing demand for high-quality produce like mangoes from the north has led to new export opportunities. This research collaboration will ensure more Australian mangoes reach growing overseas markets, helping the mango industry to grow and create more jobs. Northern Australia is already a region of excellence in research on tropical health, medicine and environments. The government's investment in the north's R&D through the northern agenda means the region's research base is growing from strength to strength.




Greater collaboration



A promising outcome of our efforts in the north is that we are seeing greater collaboration and engagement with the agenda at all levels—government, industry and local communities. Since the inaugural Ministerial Forum on Northern Development a year ago, Australian government ministers responsible for northern development and our counterparts from the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland have been working together to advance the agenda.


In April we met for the second forum in Kununurra, where we agreed to continue to fund vital roads and water infrastructure, promote investment opportunities and create new jobs. We also agreed in principle to recommendations by the Indigenous Reference Group, comprising a group of leading Indigenous business representatives, and undertook to work closely to improve economic outcomes for Indigenous Australians in the north.


A stronger economy in the north cannot be achieved without the economic participation of Indigenous Australians. Indigenous Australians make up about 15 per cent of the population in northern Australia and in the Northern Territory this figure is even higher, at over 25 per cent. I am pleased to be working with Indigenous business leaders on strategies to help get more people into jobs, get the right support for Indigenous entrepreneurs and help our traditional owners realise the economic potential of their land, sea and cultural assets. I thank Indigenous Affairs Minister Senator Nigel Scullion and the Indigenous Reference Group for their work in progressing this essential aspect of developing the north.




Conclusion



The review of the first three years of the government's northern Australia agenda shows progress being made but there is a lot more work to do. These annual statements to parliament themselves create pressure and energy to help maintain the momentum on the northern. We must maintain this pressure to ensure that the next 17 years of our northern Australia agenda continues to make progress. That is a task for all Australians that support the development of our country. Tonight 160-odd guests will join me here in parliament to continue to sell the message about the enormous opportunities that exist in northern Australia. Our plan is a plan for all of these Australians—indeed, all Australians—and we need to work together to see this plan to its conclusion.

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Northern Australia</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,37,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2018-10-16,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:24):  I thank the minister for making the annual statement to the Senate on the government's progress on implementing the Northern Australia white paper. Our shadow minister, Jason Clare, in the other place, will be joining the minister at tonight's function, and there will be the opportunity—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, are you moving to take note?




Senator MOORE:
  I am moving to take note. I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


I've already started to take note, Madam Deputy President, and now I'll continue. In terms of the process, our shadow minister, Jason Clare, will be joining the minister this evening at the function, where he will have a chance also to continue discussion about a really important element of future policy. I take the point the minister raised in his conclusion about the importance of having this engagement with our parliament. He said that these reports offered the opportunity to provide 'pressure and energy' to ensure that this 20-year plan will continue and engage with people across the community. Also in that space is the absolutely strong importance of collaboration across governments and the fact that that must be an integral part of the future, and also the acknowledgement of the extraordinarily important element of work with Indigenous communities across northern Australia. We know that one of the elements to make this program operate is to identify where the needs are greatest and also to look at who lives in northern Australia. It is a growing, wonderful part of the world but we do acknowledge that a very large number of Indigenous people live in northern Australia and they must be part of any plan into the future.


One of the things we do know is that these annual reports are important to the parliament. When we had a look at Hansard, we couldn't find a report that was handed down last year. Certainly there was the report the first time, but this is only the second time that a report has actually been made, from looking through Hansard.




Senator Canavan:
  It was tabled.




Senator MOORE:
  It was tabled but there was no discussion in terms of the process and the way we operate.




Senator Canavan:
  I was in the High Court.




Senator MOORE:
  I take your point, Minister: you were not minister at the time. But I just think it is very important that we ensure that the interaction actually happens. Also one of the elements that needs to be looked at is that we do share a parliament in this place. You are the minister at the moment in this place, but this report should be tabled and discussed in the other place as well. And it is not only in this report; it happens a lot. I think there needs to be the opportunity and the knowledge that, when you have a report of this nature, it doesn't matter where the minister is located; it needs to have that option for debate. We can work better on doing that in future, because I think that is something we do lack. So I get the opportunity now to make some comments about it, even though I am only looking at doing a covering job for the shadow minister, who happens to be in the House of Representatives. There must be a way, not only in public functions but also in the parliament, to have that process. We know that Mr Pyne, then the Minister for Defence Industry, tabled a statement in the other place, but there was not the same opportunity to get the chance to get up and talk about why the program is important and what its focus is. And it was at that time last year when there were acknowledgements that there needed to be some changes. In fact, that was when the review of what was going on was announced. It was an important time and I hope that that will be done better into the future.


As we know, when this government launched the white paper, there was a great deal of fanfare. I will quote some of the things that were said at the time. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that the white paper was designed to create an 'economic powerhouse'. Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Barnaby Joyce, said:


We are a nation smart enough and brave enough to take the next step and now we have the government motivated enough to do just that.


They promised thousands and thousands of jobs—and what have we seen since then?


The minister rolled off some figures in his report. But when you look at exactly what has happened in northern Australia, you see that it is not a great picture around employment. Since the white paper was released, unemployment in places like Townsville has got considerably worse, not better. From Gladstone to Darwin there are now more than 33,000 people looking for work. And for many of those who do have jobs, wages have gone down and not up. More than 40,000 people in northern Australia have had their penalty rates cut. And that's not all. When you look at the incredibly important and valuable aspects of education in the north, you see that local schools have lost the funding that they were supposed to get—$70 million from schools in the Northern Territory and $100 million from schools in Central and North Queensland. Universities have been cut too—$15 million from Charles Darwin University in the NT, $36 million from James Cook University in North Queensland and $38 million from Central Queensland University, which now has a range of campuses across the north. There are over 9,100 fewer apprentices across Australia. On that basis, things have got worse for the north, not better. We are worried that there is a lot of talk and not enough action.


Around the NAIF, the minister identified in his comments that this particular program had not been proceeding in the way that he had hoped. There is, in fact, a review called to see what was going on in the first two years of the program. There's no bigger example of areas where there's been talk and media but not as much action as was promised and is obviously needed. The NAIF, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, was the centrepiece of the government's promise to the north. When the NAIF Act passed parliament in this place, Senator Canavan said:


The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility continues the legacy of other great nation building initiatives that Australian governments had taken in the past, like the Snowy Mountains scheme and interstate railways.


That may have been a slight exaggeration, but we all need a goal, because, after more than 3½ years, it has only announced one project in Queensland, which the minister identified in his contribution.


The NAIF also has been promoted. While it's been building and building and being reviewed, the NAIF has caused considerable media coverage. The NAIF did media during Beef Week in Rockhampton, talking about potential investments. There was lots of talk about all the possibilities. There are still lots of possibilities and potential, but unfortunately, from where the community stands, there hasn't been significant action. Particularly now, when we have drought-stricken farmers in Central Queensland and, in fact, across the community, at Beef Week there was quite a deal of expectation that something was going to translate for this incredibly important industry in our community.


We believe that NAIF has not lived up to its promises. It's no longer the centrepiece of the government's promises; it's now a symbol of things that must be done better. Certainly we acknowledge that recently there has been some movement from the NAIF in Western Australia and the Top End. That is positive. Labor welcomed those announcements. But after three years, given the importance with which this element was promoted, it's just not good enough—not when 33,000 people are looking for work.


When Labor were in government, one in every $7 invested in infrastructure was spent in the North. We committed more than $5 billion, and we didn't leave it just sitting there with promises attached. We need to get the NAIF money, which has been identified and promised, out. Every minute you delay has an impact. For example, in Darwin, the construction on the Inpex project is wrapping up. In this place, we've had a number of contributions over the past years about what that impact was, how many people are involved and how this has a real impact not just in the immediate area of Darwin but across the whole north. Last year, there were around 9,000 people working there, more than 1,100 of whom were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which was a really positive element of that project. There are now around 3,700. These people are finishing their jobs in Darwin and they are leaving town. That has been identified both within Darwin and across the Territory. If the government had had its act together, it would have announced enough projects in the Top End to keep those workers there months ago so that, instead of people being faced with the decision to leave the area to get work, they could have continued to plan and live in the Territory with the confidence that there were jobs that they could take. That would maintain the expenditure and the community aspects that are so important in any area but, I think, particularly in the North, where, again, there had been so much hope and expectation.


The government isn't delivering what it promised. The people of northern Australia have been asked to trust into the future, and that is important. In fact, they've always been asked to trust into the future, and they're not getting their trust responded to. People in the north should be able to trust their government to deliver the things that are important to them. That's why we've told them that a Shorten plan would do things at the next election. These are not election promises; they are clear plans into the future for how we would look at a plan for northern Australia. We'd put back the money that we've identified as being cut from schools, because we understand that the only way to an effective future is to have a strong education base. Again, that builds families and communities. Just last week, we announced that we'd deliver a record $14 billion investment into public schools. We have also planned to put $700 million cut from hospitals back into the system. Importantly, as I said earlier, we would look at genuine wages and we would return penalty rates.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Moore. Your time has expired.




Senator Moore:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (19:21):  Earlier today the Senate passed a resolution calling on the government to formally respond to the report of the Senate Select Committee into Funding for Research into Cancers with Low Survival Rates. Last month I wrote to the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt, to remind him that the government's response is well overdue and to ask when it will be forthcoming. The government is required to respond to committee reports within three months. However, this report was tabled almost a year ago, and we're still waiting for the government's response. It's simply not good enough. Each month that goes by without a response to the report sees hundreds of Australians die from cancers with low survival rates. It's a slap in the face to the researchers, the medical practitioners and the advocacy groups who have shared their insight, knowledge and experience. It's a slap in the face to the members of the committee—including government, opposition and crossbench senators—and to the secretariat, who all listened astutely to the tragic stories, processed large volumes of highly technical information and worked incredibly hard to come up with an excellent and unanimous report.


Most disturbingly, though, it's a slap in the face to the many cancer patients and their families, who bravely came and gave evidence. They told their very personal stories to the committee. Many of these witnesses fought back tears—in fact, some shed tears at the public hearings, and, I have to say, so did members of the committee and those watching on. They knew that giving their testimony would be difficult and painful, but they did so in the hope that cancers with low survival rates would finally be given the attention they deserve. Patients of stomach, brain, oesophageal, lung, pancreatic liver and gallbladder cancer, to name just a few, deserve some hope that the incredible advances we've seen in the survival rates of other forms of cancer, such as breast cancer or leukaemia, can be replicated in cancers with low survival rates.


I do acknowledge that the government have put up some important initiatives, but I also want to point out that the only action the government appear to have taken as a direct response to the inquiry is establishing the Low Survival Cancers and Diseases Grant Opportunity. If the government has responded in other ways to the report's 25 recommendations then the onus is on them to explain what they've done and how it addresses the recommendations, because there are many, many recommendations that the government has not yet addressed. Of particular importance was the recommendation that low-survival-rate cancers be identified as one of the National Health and Medical Research Council's national health priorities. To date, it hasn't. The committee also recommended an Australia-wide strategy to increase the survival rate for these cancers to 50 per cent by 2027. The government has not announced such a strategy or made any steps towards developing it. I've still yet to see any action from the government on improving access to clinical trials, including further streamlining ethics and government approval processes, making information on clinical trials more user friendly, facilitating innovative and flexible clinical trial design, and allowing trial participants to access patient travel subsidy schemes. All these things would make a huge difference to the lives of these people suffering low-survival-rate cancers. Granted, some of these actions require work by state and territory governments, but the Australian government needs to lead that process.


In that inquiry, we received over 300 submissions and we had 117 witnesses appear at the public hearings. For every patient with a low-survival cancer or every family member of a patient who participated in the inquiry, there are hundreds, if not thousands, more who could potentially benefit from the outcomes of this inquiry. They want not only to hear that these recommendations are being taken seriously by the government but to know that they've been acted upon. Patients of cancers with low survival rates are looking for hope. By failing to respond to this report, this government is denying them the hope that they so desperately seek and deserve. As I said, the government should have responded in three months. It's been another eight months. That makes 11 months—nearly a year. The government needs to do— (Time expired)
