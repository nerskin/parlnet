"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-02-07,"—Mr President, welcome back for the new year. It will be an interesting one, I am sure. I want to address the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 [2006], which makes disparate amendments to four maritime acts. I want to highlight some of the amendments and comment on how this bill addresses, or more accurately fails to address, deficiencies in the Howard government’s stewardship of Australian maritime policy.
Firstly, the bill amends the Lighthouses Act 1911 to provide for maintenance of maritime navigational aids and higher penalties for damaging aids or failing to report such damage. Labor generally welcomes these amendments.
The bill makes a significant number of amendments to the Navigation Act 1912, which is the principal Commonwealth act relating to the safety of ships. Among other matters, these amendments revise pilotage provisions to provide for compulsory pilotage in areas specified by regulation, revise provisions relating to the reporting of ship movements, revise provisions relating to alcohol and other drugs and allowing for the taking of mouth swabs to test for alcohol and other drugs, provide immunity from civil claims for pilots and pilotage providers, remove the requirement for six months notice before the minister can cancel a continuing voyage permit and increase penalties for major offences that pose a threat to life or the environment.
The bill also amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. This act implements the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL. The bill amends the act to require Australian chemical tankers to prepare and carry a noxious liquid substances plan, to provide that security paid by the owner or master in the event of a pollution breach must cover the maximum amount of penalties that may be payable by all members of the crew, and to clarify that documents that may be served on a ship’s agent include documents that may be served on the owner, the master or any member of the crew.
The Shipping Registration Act facilitates the registration of ships in Australia, grants ships Australian nationality and provides for the registration of mortgages over ships. The bill amends the act to provide that mortgages can be removed from the register at the request of the mortgagee, to allow the minister to delegate his or her powers under the act to a staff member of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and to provide for access to the Australian Register of Ships by electronic means.
Section 286 of the Navigation Act provides that the minister for transport may issue a single voyage permit or a continuing voyage permit to an unlicensed ship to engage in trade between Australian ports. A permit may only be issued if there is no licensed ship available or the service provided by the licensed ships is inadequate and the minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. As already noted, the bill amends the act to remove the requirement for the minister to give six months notice of the intention to cancel a continuing voyage permit.
On 18 July last year, the Australian newspaper revealed details of an internal audit of the Howard government’s administration of coastal shipping under the Navigation Act. The audit of the administration was obtained under freedom of information laws by the newspaper’s freedom of information editor, Mr Michael McKinnon. The report is one of many documents obtained by the Australian despite fierce resistance from the Howard government. I have had some experience with the Howard government’s approach to freedom of information. Let me tell the Senate that, as far as the government is concerned, all the public are entitled to expect is freedom from information, and even then they should think themselves lucky. It is little surprise that the government resisted the release of this particular audit report.
This compliance review of coastal shipping permits was conducted by KPMG for the Department of Transport and Regional Services. It was completed in October 2004. It delivered a damning assessment of the government’s performance, finding that the administration of coastal shipping licences and permits for foreign vessels is a shambles. The audit revealed that one in six coastal shipping permits is granted without a signed application form, which according to KPMG means:
... the department risks granting a permit based on a bogus or unauthorised application.
The audit revealed: that inadequate financial controls mean that the government may be unaware of fraud, errors or other irregularities related to the licence and permit applications; that poor record keeping means data relating to more than one in five approved licence and permit applications is ‘absent or incorrect’; and that existing regulations are, in KPMG’s words, ‘out of date’ and ‘do not reflect current operating procedures’.
As if that was not enough, the report also found that the Department of Transport and Regional Services has breached the Navigation (Coasting Trade) Regulations 1937 and ministerial guidelines on the regulation of coastal shipping by failing to establish if a licensed ship is available before issuing a permit. Single and continuous voyage permits are only supposed to be issued when a licensed ship is unavailable and the minister for transport is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. Unlicensed foreign ships granted single or continuous voyage permits are not required to pay their crew Australian wages when trading on the Australian coast—that is, foreign ships, many of them flag of convenience vessels, can undercut Australian wages and conditions when plying their trade on the Australian coast. And the Howard government has presided over the near destruction of the Australian coastal trading fleet while giving a leg-up to foreign shipping that uses substandard vessels and engages cheap foreign labour.
According to documents attributed to a spokesperson for the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Truss, the government has addressed the deficiencies identified in the audit report. It took the release of the report under freedom of information for Mr Truss to publicly acknowledge the shambolic state of coastal shipping administration. The department expanded on Mr Truss’s concession in the form of an answer to a question on notice from the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee was told:
The recommendations have been addressed through changes in procedures for processing permits and licences, changes in records management practices and as part of a broader rewrite of the Coasting Trade Regulations. These amendments are close to finalisation.
We have not seen those rewritten regulations yet. But Mr Truss’s comments at the AusIntermodal 2005 conference in Sydney last year foreshadow a rewrite that has little relationship with the recommendations of the KPMG audit. You will not find Mr Truss’s remarks on his ministerial website, I might say, but a Lloyd’s List report published on 25 July reveals that Mr Truss believes that too much regulation exists in relation to coastal shipping. On the face of it, Mr Truss’s solution to his department’s administrative failings is the abolition of the few rules that regulate coastal trading activity—that is, Mr Truss cannot be sure he has got the capacity to enforce the rules, including his own ministerial guidelines, so he is thinking about getting rid of them altogether.
It is important to understand why the government’s failure to properly administer the cabotage system matters. First, it is clear from the findings of the audit that the lax administration of foreign ships on the Australian coastal trade places Australia at a heightened risk of maritime terrorists. The Department of Transport and Regional Services has been issuing permits in response to unsigned applications which, in the restrained words of the audit report, means it has risked granting a permit based on a ‘bogus or unauthorised application’.
It is no secret that the international shipping industry has a dark side. During the course of its inquiry into the introduction of maritime security identification cards, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee received this evidence:
International Maritime Security agencies accept that Osama Bin Laden owns a fleet of cargo ships all flagged under the ‘Flag of Convenience’ system. This system evades taxes, and most other regulated costs but more importantly provides the beneficial owner with the most effective veil of anonymity available in international trade.
There is no more effective veil of anonymity than a blank application form. In fact, I can hardly think of a way to make Australia more vulnerable to terrorist attack than by permitting foreign ships to sail from port to port without the inconvenience of lodging a signed permit form. It may come as a surprise to the minister for transport that foreign ships authorised by his government to trade on our coast carry things more explosive than navy beans; they carry things such as oil, chemicals, LPG and other goods, including ammonium nitrate.
The latest Australian maritime transport compendium commissioned by the Australian Shipowners Association contains a telling statistical tale about the growing use of foreign ships to transport goods around Australian ports. It reveals that since 1991-92 the number of permits issued to foreign ships has grown by over 325 per cent. In 2003-04, the last full year subject to the report, foreign vessels were permitted to carry 27.5 per cent of the Australian interstate and intrastate sea freight trade—up from eight per cent when Labor last held office. Foreign seafarers are not subject to the same rules that apply to Australian seafarers serving on Australian ships. Not only are foreign seafarers denied Australian pay and working conditions; they are not subject to the same security regime as Australian seafarers.
The soon to be implemented maritime security identification card regime does not impose additional requirements on foreign seafarers. Under the delayed maritime security identification card regime, truck drivers delivering goods to our ports will be subject to much more stringent background and identity checking than foreign seafarers.
Labor says the carriage of high-consequence dangerous goods like ammonium nitrate by foreign ships must stop now if Australia is serious about minimising the threat of terrorism. It should be clear to everyone that the safest way to transport high-consequence dangerous goods around Australia is on Australian ships crewed by Australian men and women subject to appropriate security screening. Secure ships and secure seafarers mean better protection for the Australian community. It is bad enough that the Howard government has facilitated an explosion in the number of continuous voyage permits issued for foreign ships. It is worse that the government is leaving Australia vulnerable because it will not or cannot regulate coastal trade according to the rules.
It is not just a matter of supporting Australian shippers and Australian maritime workers and it is not just a matter of keeping dangerous substances like ammonium nitrate out of the hands of terrorists; the increasing carriage of sea freight around our coast by foreign ships, many of them flag of convenience vessels subject to minimal regulation, puts our natural environment at risk. It is a matter of good luck, not good governance, that Australia has not seen a major environmental disaster associated with the carriage of chemical or petroleum products by one of the ships of shame. The Howard government’s neglect of shipping policy threatens our economy, it threatens our national security and it threatens our natural environment. It is time the Howard government ceased abusing the cabotage system. It should be enforcing the rules, not talking about walking away from them altogether.
There are other things the government should do to secure our maritime borders. The first concerns the enforcement of crew and manifest advance reporting. The government has a 48-hour rule in place—meaning that the manifest and the crew should be notified 48 hours before the vessel docks in Australian ports—but it does not adequately enforce that rule. Ships are turning up alongside wharves that have not lodged their crew and manifest details—in other words, no part of the 48-hour rule is being enforced. It is past time that this rule was enforced.
Labor calls on Mr Truss to do more than his predecessor, Mr Anderson, and fix the known deficiencies in maritime security. He could do worse than start by reading the report of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute entitled Future unknown: the terrorist threat to Australian maritime security. This report was arrogantly dismissed by Mr Anderson, but Mr Truss has an opportunity to do better. He needs to do better because, as noted by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute:
A terrorist attack on Australia’s maritime interests is a credible scenario. We have high dependence on shipping and seaborne trade, and are adjacent to a region where terrorist groups have maritime capabilities.
In light of this, it is a shame that an attack on cabotage was among Mr Truss’s first comments on the transport portfolio. It was not a good start by Mr Truss and, unfortunately, his performance has not improved.
I conclude by starting the debate for this year by moving a second reading amendment standing in my name. I urge the Senate to give it support. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate condemns the Government for:
              (a)    failing to uphold Australia’s national interest by adopting anti-Australian shipping policies that favour foreign vessels and crew despite the risk to national security, Australian jobs and the natural environment;
              (b)    failing to ensure adequate security in relation to the shipping of dangerous goods and hazardous material, including explosives precursors such as ammonium nitrate; and
              (c)    failing to ensure ships comply with the requirement to provide details of crew and cargo 48 hours before arrival”.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-02-07,"—I rise to speak in support of the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 [2006]. Normally, this would involve a fairly unnotable series of processes that every good government would move to enact. We have consulted widely through a whole range of processes with the national bodies: AMSA, the AMSA Advisory Board, the National Maritime Safety Council and a whole range of other bodies. As a result of that, we have moved amendments, as the member opposite identified, to the Lighthouses Act 1911 and the Navigation Act 1912. These acts are regularly revised—certainly, by this government—and they have been looked at before. It is interesting to note that on previous occasions those opposite have taken the opportunity to attempt to debunk issues that are associated only in the vaguest possible way with what I think are some very credible pieces of legislation.
We are making changes in, I think, some pretty significant areas. Obviously, the Navigation Act of 1912, which is a principal Commonwealth act, provides very sensible exemptions to operations like the military. We would have seen in recent events, both in our humanitarian aid and in providing transportation for troops, that the military have to not only own but lease vessels and ensure that those vessels have an exemption. The special survey requirements and standards—very rigorous standards, I might add—provided by military organisations should stand. It is a very sensible amendment to the Navigation Act.
We also have to amend the act in a way that ensures that the survey reports issued by classification societies are now authorised by AMSA. This reflects the greater movement in shipping around the world and the great work that this government has done in ensuring that Australia is exposed as a tourist destination. I have to commend the leader of the National Party, Senator Boswell, for the wonderful work he has done in your home state of Queensland, Senator O’Brien, with regard to superyachts. They operate under a class system which ensures that, once again, the government allows the seamless transfers of men and shipping around the country, because we are about looking after the economy.
I note, Senator O’Brien, that you seemed fairly fixated on single voyage permits.
—Continuously.
—Indeed. If you are into this particular area, you would be well aware that it is under constant review. You are probably not aware, Senator, but effectively those opposite in this place have prevented the implementation of what is widely known in the industry as the 500-tonne rule. If those opposite decided to play the game on single voyage permits, particularly for domestic operators who were forced by your reluctance to accept some principal changes to this act like the 500-tonne rule, we would all be a lot better off.
You said the single voyage permit is somehow used to take jobs away from Australian workers. I have listened to a lot of rhetoric from the MUA over the years. You paint a picture of these ships that come over here as being substandard. Let me tell you: first of all, they come here on a SOLAS voyage. They have to meet MARPOL regulations. They are inspected by AMSA. It is easy to paint a picture of the rust bucket, things falling apart.
Let me tell you, Senator O’Brien, it is misleading to stand in this place and say, ‘We’re allowing these flag of convenience vessels. They’re going to sink here. They’re a risk to shipping.’ You need to be very careful about saying that because we are supposed to be educating the public about what we are doing in this place. You have to be very careful about those sorts of things, remembering that these are not flag of convenience vessels; these are vessels that are unlicensed in Australia. The implications that they are unregulated and unsafe are unsustainable.
Why do we use these vessels? We use these vessels principally, as you pointed out, Senator O’Brien, when a licensed Australian vessel is unavailable for that voyage. You will say, ‘Oh no, they’re available.’ But there is an implication regarding time. And what you did not say about the audit—and I understand that the audit was done at a time when there was a transfer to the transport office—is that the recommendations were acted on very quickly. And that is why we do audits. This government says, ‘We need to be transparent.’ It says, ‘We will not just say that we know what we are doing. We will give it to another organisation, we will take some recommendations and we will act on them.’ We acted on them quickly, because that is what this government is about—providing good government and ensuring that essential transportation processes are covered effectively by regulation to ensure that continued free trade, which is an essential part of keeping the economy going, is maintained.
It is not maintained in the way that Senator O’Brien has suggested—that we just let this sort of stuff fly through and that we have boats all over the place. Senator O’Brien, I suspect I have spent an awful lot more time at sea than you. I pass these vessels with quite some degree of safety and I can assure you that I am not concerned about things like being bumped by a ship in the middle of the night. If we look at history over the last 10 years—that is right, Senator, over the time this government has been in power—we find that one of the most notable events was that of the Sea Star. Whilst it is not covered in the amendments in the legislation being debated, immediately after that happened we went out and fixed it. And we continue to do that.
The whole presentation you made here today, Senator, on what I think is pretty uncontroversial legislation was pretty tragic. It is tragic because it misleads people. We are talking about maritime security; suddenly we are talking about terrorist threats and this country not taking them seriously. It is a pathetic misrepresentation of the facts. This country continues to assess terrorist threats. We are talking about precursors to explosives. In another life I was an explosives expert and I can tell you now, Senator, that ammonium nitrate in bulk is not used for explosives. It is actually used to grow things. I would have thought that you might have learnt about that in your previous shadow portfolio. People in Australia depend on ammonium nitrate to arrive in a timely fashion. If there is a gap in the transportation system and it cannot arrive, jobs and industry are not created and agriculture does not continue. In that event we need to act quickly, which we have done. We need to provide to the minister some flexibility to ensure that the minister can continue to provide some sort of licensing regime that comes under the scrutiny of AMSA.
AMSA is seen by the International Maritime Organisation to have the leading role regarding such legislation, particularly regarding the flexibility of the legislation, in that it continues to allow trade and ensures that the country, which I am very proud to say is Australia, is completely free of terrorist threats. On any complete assessment we are leading the world, Senator, in ensuring that we have maritime border security. If anybody questions that, perhaps they should saunter down to a wharf, because any movement around the seafront today would indicate immediately that there has been substantial change. Wherever you go on the waterfront now—thanks to this government’s hard work, continuous review and continuous introspection about getting it right—you will find substantive changes made over the last two years. They have accelerated and, now, if you are around the wharf, as you have indicated you have been, Senator O’Brien, you will see there are processes in place to identify exactly who you are and what you are doing. The implication that we allow ships in with people on them who we do not know, that we just let them in on boats that we have absolutely no control over, is an absolute furphy and is misleading.
In summing up, the senator opposite said that this is an issue of national security. As I have indicated, the amendments to both the Lighthouses Act and the Navigation Act are quite simple. They are not difficult concepts to grasp. It seems that those opposite have started off the year with a bit of a roar. This is the big issue: we have amendments to the Lighthouses Act which are ensuring that the penalties go up for stealing food out of the tin at the bottom of a lighthouse, so that when someone goes there who is in trouble, they can have a drink and a bit to eat while they wait to be rescued. That is serious stuff. But no—it is terrorism! It is not in the national interest to ensure we provide flexibility and a legislative framework so that essential items for our farmers and our industry right across this country are provided in a timely fashion.
With our wonderful economy, I know why you look sad, Senator O’Brien. It is because with such an economy and with a government that has its finger on the pulse, it must be pretty tragic sitting over there. But I think it is pretty sad when you come into this place and show your frustration in this manner. This is a place in which there are people listening. They want to be educated. They want a few facts on the plate. He says, ‘Jobs are at risk.’ Without these legislative changes, of course they will be at risk because they would be under the original system in which agricultural industries in this country were at the mercy of the MUA and other unions. Now we have a process whereby they have woken up to themselves around the waterfront. We have had waterfront reforms and now we are doing well and the economy is booming. So do not talk to me, Senator O’Brien, about this being about jobs.
The last thing I would like to ask is: did you hear Senator O’Brien talking about the environment? We have substantive legislative changes that involve the identification of a threat at sea. It is not only about a damaged ship; it may be a ship, for example, that has come from a port that we suspect has black-striped mussels. The changes now give us the capacity to act in our national interests to ensure that we can detain that ship, to ensure that it leaves and to ensure that it does not leave some little present behind that we do not want. This is significant. It is sad that you did not bring that up and share it with the parliament today, Senator O’Brien.
This is not a particularly controversial piece of legislation. We are not proposing any particularly radical changes. We are just tightening up shipping safety and pollution prevention regimes. I would hope that those on the other side who have seen this as an opportunity to effectively mislead Australia about what we are really doing would see fit to support this legislation. It is really important legislation in a whole range of ways. But most substantially, it allows for continued transportation in a system that effectively continues the mantra of the Australian government—seamless transfers of ships and men around Australia. It allows us to have a transportation system that ensures that those people who rely on it can get up every day and not have to worry about the ship not being there to transport their agricultural product or whatever other products they might be carrying. At the end of the day, those on the other side should support this legislation. I hope they do. I certainly hope that their performance in regard to non-controversial legislation in this place improves.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2005 [2006]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-02-07,"—Senator Scullion, listening to your speech my first thought was, ‘What a courageous senator Senator O’Brien is to come into the chamber and debate someone like you, who clearly has such an in-depth knowledge of the bill and such life experience.’ As you mentioned, probably no-one on this side of the parliament has been to sea more than you. We learnt about your views on explosives, with which you mentioned some experience. As your excellent speech went on—Senator O’Brien, I did not think I would ever have to say this in the chamber—I thought, ‘Senator O’Brien has shown some courage in standing up and trying to debate Senator Scullion on these issues.’ It was more than a TKO, in a metaphorical sense. I think that all of us have learnt a lot from Senator Scullion, and the Senate is indebted to him for the excellent contribution that he has made.
I will make a few brief comments. My understanding is that the Labor Party will be supporting the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 [2006]. Some people may not have appreciated that from listening to the debate, but my understanding is that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill as it stands. In recent years, industry and other stakeholders have pressed for changes in a number of areas of shipping regulation to address what they see as outdated safety and environmental protection legislation. I think it is true to say that this bill addresses those concerns. In amending four acts, the bill will strengthen the legislative regime surrounding shipping safety and maritime environment protection and will modernise and enhance penalties for safety and environmental offences.
A number of amendments were specifically referred to in the second reading speech and during the debate on the bill. The only amendments which I will mention now are the new subsections 386A(2) and (3) to be inserted into the Navigation Act. These subsections set out offences analogous to dangerous driving offences. There will be an offence under the new subsections only under exceptional circumstances. Such an offence will occur if a seafarer is under the influence of alcohol or another drug, is in breach of his or her duty or operates a ship in a dangerous manner and as a result there is actual or likely death or injury to a person or damage to a ship. There are graduated maximum offences depending on the consequences of the action, with the highest offence applying where a person dies.
In proposing these amendments the government wishes to reassure all concerned that there is no intention that there be criminalisation of seafarers’ actions such as has happened in some other countries where, I am advised, on a number of occasions crew members have been arrested and held in prison following incidents which have resulted in accidental pollution. In the government’s view it is not appropriate that seafarers be held in prison in such circumstances, and this government does not support actions where seafarers are treated unfairly. The bill continues this government’s efforts to update the legislation which governs shipping. I commend the bill to the Senate and hope that it can have a speedy passage, because my understanding is that it has very widespread support.
Question put:

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-02-07,"—I rise to speak on the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005.

Senator Kemp interjecting—

—Senator Scullion was not here for the third reading of the previous piece of legislation; I thought he supported it but I did not actually see him in the chamber and putting his hand up to support it. As Labor supported the last piece of legislation we will be supporting this bill. Mr Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, is Labor’s resources spokesman and has carriage of this legislation in the House of Representatives.
The bill establishes the mandatory energy efficiency opportunities assessments announced in the government’s energy white paper entitled Securing Australia’s energy future, which I think was launched in June 2004. Labor supports the passage of this bill, but I will move a second reading amendment highlighting the government’s failure to address the urgent need for greater energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy, not just business. There is a pressing need for Australia to generate greater efficiency in our transport fuel use, and this means having a national focus on the long neglected policy area of public transport. Congestion in our cities means hundreds of thousands of Australians waste time—and fuel—just getting to work each day.
Electricity system meltdown due to the escalating use of household airconditioning is now a predictable element of an Australian summer. We cannot pretend any longer that non-business energy use does not matter, nor can we pretend that our energy supplies are infinite or that greenhouse implications can be ignored. We have to become smarter about our domestic and transport energy consumption. These important policy challenges are not addressed in this bill.
The bill also fails to take up the challenge of diversifying our energy supplies. This government is still not doing enough to clean up coal and fast-track the development and uptake of alternative fuels and renewable energy technologies. The government has also missed an opportunity to take up the bipartisan recommendations of the House of Representatives environment committee report on sustainable cities, many of which deal with energy efficiency initiatives that would make our cities more liveable.
Labor welcome the government’s initiatives to address energy efficiency opportunities in the business sector. However, we say they do not go far enough. The bill requires large energy-using businesses to register with the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources; it requires these businesses to undertake an assessment of energy efficiency opportunities; and it requires them to report publicly on the outcomes of the assessments.
The bill is targeted at large energy users to address a perceived energy efficiency gap. In Australia, the level of energy efficiency—and the rate of improvement over the past three decades—is lower than in major industrialised countries. While the relatively lower price of energy in Australia may explain some of the difference, Australia has a lower rate of energy efficiency improvement than countries with similar energy prices, such as Canada and the United States.
Of course, some technically feasible energy efficiency improvements are not yet economically viable, but there is evidence that many businesses do not take up energy efficiency opportunities that are cost-effective. This is known as the energy efficiency gap. The decision to introduce a mandatory assessment measure is aimed at addressing this gap and responds to the fact that previous government programs have shown that a significant number of privately cost-effective energy efficiency improvements have been overlooked by the participating firms.
Based on data from the ABS, around 250 companies are likely to be covered by this measure in a range of sectors, including mining, petroleum and general services. While business use accounts for over 80 per cent of Australia’s primary energy consumption, a relatively small number of businesses are responsible for the majority of this energy use. ABS data suggests that the 250 largest business energy users account for around 60 per cent of all energy used by business. While satisfied with the bill’s initial proposed business coverage, Labor urges this government to consider extending the program, in the longer term, to cover a larger proportion of emitters.
With rapidly rising energy costs, increasing concern about the implications of climate change and the extraordinary expansion of economic activity in China and India, it has never been more important for us to conserve our energy resources. The best way we can do this is by getting the most out of our of existing resources, and that means using better technology and developing cleaner energy sources. Total energy consumption for Australia is about 3,000 petajoules per annum which costs about $A40 billion. Industrial energy consumption is about 40 per cent, representing an energy bill of about $A16 billion a year. While some Australian businesses have embraced efficient energy use and are reaping the benefits, much more can be achieved.
In relation to business energy use, experience in Australia and overseas suggests that energy bill savings in the order of 10 to 15 per cent can be achieved over five years. Savings of up to $2 billion annually could be achieved, with obvious benefits for business and our national economy. There are economic and environmental imperatives driving the push for more efficient energy use by business. Labor support that push, but we do lament the failure of the government to address greater efficiency in relation to other sectors of the economy.
I conclude by moving the second reading amendment standing in my name and commending it to the Senate:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate:
              (a)    calls on the Government to introduce energy efficiency to all sectors of the community, including transport and housing, as well as business;
              (b)    condemns the Government for failing to support the alternative fuel and renewable energy industries; and
              (c)    condemns the Government for not adopting the bipartisan recommendations put forward by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage in its report on Sustainable Cities”.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-07,"—I rise today to support the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 but, as Senator O’Brien has just indicated, the bill does not go nearly far enough.
It is quite clear that around the world, for the last 20 years, the growth in energy demand has been escalating way beyond the rate of capacity to produce energy to meet that demand. So the debate seems to have always centred on, ‘How do we provide more energy? How do we build more power stations?’ Hence, we have had the debate about extending the life of Hazelwood, we have been talking about the nuclear debate and so on. The very poor cousin in all this debate has been demand-side management. I can remember in Tasmania, less than a decade ago, Hydro Tasmania was advertising extensively on television encouraging people to use more power.
It is very hard to imagine any energy utility doing that these days, because they are struggling to be able to produce the power that people need, and the more they produce the more people want to use energy. You only have to look at the number of appliances, particularly in the residential context, to see just how many more appliances people are using. The tragedy is that most people do not realise that energy efficiency is the cheapest and the quickest way of reducing energy use and therefore it also cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions—an imperative that is absolutely urgent for the world to respond to.
With regard to the average consumer’s understanding, most people do not know that when they use their electrical appliance in the course of the day it makes a difference to how much they are charged. If people understood that, they would consider putting on their washing machine at 10 o’clock or 11 o’clock at night and not during peak hour, for example. That is why the announcement in today’s media about the introduction of smart meters to cut power use is a good initiative. I support that and am delighted to see it. It was part of the Greens’ policy platform for the 2004 federal election that smart meters be rolled out across the country so that consumers can have a look and see how much power they are using at what cost and adjust their activities accordingly. Just the simple introduction of those meters will be hugely educational for people right across Australia. They will be able to see how much power they are using and how they can reduce their power bills, take away the stress on the existing energy grid and structure and, at the same time, delay the need for the introduction of new energy facilities.
The problem we currently have is that, with all the talk of the greenhouse gas abatement schemes, we still have state governments saying that they want to commit to a national emissions trading scheme and that they want the federal government to go further—and I applaud them for doing that—but at the same time approving brand new coal-fired power stations when we should absolutely not be approving any new coal-fired power stations in this country. In fact, we should be implementing energy efficiency to a degree that means that we can avoid and delay building new infrastructure until we can get to the new generation technology post coal-fired power stations. This is a critical debate for Australia—that is, that we get involved in a massive national effort on energy efficiency.
On the consumer side of things, again, I do not think that most people realise the extent of the active stand-by consumption of power. I do not think that most people realise, when they buy almost all appliances—whether it is heating, airconditioning, TVs, DVD players et cetera—that they are going on active stand-by consumption of power. People are absorbing all that power when they have their television turned off, and I do not think that they are aware of just how inefficient many of those appliances are in terms of energy use. If the government were serious, it would have a proactive strategy to reduce stand-by power consumption in the next few years. In fact, I think we need to establish a one-watt minimum stand-by standard and prohibit the production and import of products that exceed that limit because, unless we have such a standard, we are going to continue to have appliances being sold in Australia that have a high active stand-by consumption of power. I understand that some appliances can use up to 30 watts while they are on stand-by. This is just a ridiculous waste of power. If people knew how much power they were using when their appliances are effectively turned off with the remote, I think we would have a change in behaviour patterns. I am looking forward to the roll-out of smart meters, and I certainly hope that the Commonwealth is going to match the states or make them available so that they can be taken up across Australia. I think that the increased energy literacy that will result from it will be important.
To return to this particular bill, the problem I see with it is that, once again, it asks business to look at energy efficiency but then does not go any further. All that this bill requires is for big business—and we are talking about the huge energy users here; we are not talking about medium- or small-scale businesses—to conduct an audit of energy efficiency measures that might be taken and then publish the report. One of the first lost opportunities of this bill is that it simply goes for those industries that are using 0.5 petajoules, whereas, in my view, there should be a sliding scale over the next few years to bring that down to industries that use, say, 0.2 petajoules so that we incorporate more and more businesses across Australia into the scheme. As I said, all this bill does is ask business to conduct an audit of energy efficiency measures that might be taken and then publish the report. Then it stops. There is no requirement for those businesses to implement the findings of the report. In other words, we have yet another example of the government pandering to big business and saying, ‘Do your energy efficiency audit, publish it and then consider whether you might do something about it,’ whereas the best way to encourage innovation and competition and not hold back progressive businesses is to require that those audits be implemented, provided there is a reasonable payback period. If an industry gets a report to say it can make X amount of savings over four years, it is a no-brainer for it not to implement that. Because of short-termism and externality issues, companies will choose to go and spend money on other things and not necessarily implement the energy efficiency recommendations and reports. In my view, we need to ensure that this legislation not only requires a report but also requires that the findings of the energy efficiency audit be implemented over a period of time where there is a reasonable payback period to that business.
I also think there needs to be a national energy efficiency target. I know that the Productivity Commission has come out and rejected the target. Frankly, I think that is because it is taking the old economic view that anything beyond the production of energy, if you like, is free as an externality. For example, with regard to the use of fossil fuels, it does not take into account the greenhouse gas emission costs to society of producing all that power. It has a view that there is not an economic case to save energy. It should go and talk to all the state governments who are now challenged with having to either put in new supply or somehow achieve energy efficiency. I think the Productivity Commission needs to look at sustainable development, not just development at any cost. Ecologically sustainable development requires that the externalities of the production of energy, as in greenhouse gas emissions for a start, need to be internalised into the cost. I wonder if the Productivity Commission would draw the same conclusions—that it is not economical to save energy—if we had a price on carbon in this country, which is the next thing we should be doing in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
What I am suggesting is that we need a national energy efficiency target and then a strategy to achieve that target which not only goes across big business, as this bill does, but takes into account transport and residential sectors as well. We need to have a national plan. Interestingly, when the first task force for the National Framework for Energy Efficiency looked at this, they explored the idea of a target but they dropped it, and I would not mind betting that they dropped it because they were under some pressure in terms of government policy. But, if you look at what the Europeans are doing, you will find that in fact national efficiency targets are incorporated in greenhouse gas mitigation plans in most countries. The European Commission, for example, asked member states to save nine per cent of the energy supplied to end users in the nine years following the directive’s entry into force, and some of the states in Europe set themselves even higher targets. They are saying that the European target could save Europe 20 per cent in energy consumption by 2020 and slash its energy bill by €60 billion every year.
There are some pretty amazing figures also being talked about in Australia in terms of what could be achieved if we went for a serious energy efficiency policy with a national energy efficiency target. We know that Australia has a very poor record on energy efficiency. For example, energy efficiency improvements in Australia have occurred much more slowly than in other countries—just a three per cent improvement between 1973-74 and 2000-01. In other words, Australia’s energy efficiency has improved at less than half the rate of other countries. That is appalling when you consider what we could achieve: the National Framework for Energy Efficiency issues paper in 2003 said that an investment of $12.4 billion over four years would yield energy savings valued at $26.9 billion, create 9,000 jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nine per cent.
So why won’t the government engage energy efficiency and demand-side management just as readily as they seem to be embracing the coal industry’s pleas for ongoing support for the fossil fuel industry? It is an absolute no-brainer for Australia in a world which is saying, ‘We want to reduce greenhouse gases, we want to get away from fossil fuels, we want to move to a low-carbon economy.’ For Australia to be redirecting its major scientific effort at CSIRO away from renewable energy, away from next-generation energy, to one that is almost entirely focused on the coal industry is like saying, in a world that wants to give up smoking, that Australia is going to focus its competitive advantage on healthier cigarettes. It is complete nonsense.
What I am saying is that, whilst I support the government’s initiative in putting forward an Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill that brings in large energy users and requires them to do an audit, it lacks any accountability because it goes along with the government’s priorities—that is, it is all voluntary. It says to business, ‘We’d like you to do this, but we don’t expect you to have any accountability.’ When you ask the government, ‘Where is the accountability?’ the government’s response is, ‘Oh well, these reports will be made publicly available and there will be public pressure for these companies to act in the right way.’ Well, there has been public pressure on Australia businesses to act on greenhouse gas emissions and energy guzzling for the last 20 years and they have taken no notice whatsoever. Look at that appalling performance by Australia—half the rate of equivalent countries. We now have a situation where, over the last few years, even countries like the Philippines, Peru, Colombia and Brazil have all moved on energy efficiency laws which have some level of compulsory requirement, but Australia is still behind the eight ball.
Let us see this bill, which I am happy to support, as the beginning. But I would like to hear from the minister an explanation of why the government is so against requiring companies to implement the findings of these energy efficiency audits within a time frame that has a reasonable payback period for business. That is why I will be moving a number of amendments when we get to the committee stage. The first amendment would incorporate a national energy efficiency target and recommends setting up a task force to work out how that target would be implemented. Secondly, the target would work on a sliding scale to make sure that it captured not only big business but also businesses that produced 0.2 petajoules. My amendments also require the setting-up of an energy savings fund. The purposes of that fund are:
to encourage energy savings; …
to address peak demand for energy; …
to stimulate investment in innovative energy savings measures; …
to increase public awareness and acceptance of the importance of energy savings measures; …
to encourage cost effective energy savings measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions arising from the use of energy; and
to provide funding for contributions made by the Commonwealth for the purposes of national energy regulation.
So this fund is not about providing money for the development of renewable energy, although that is important and needs to be part of other government programs. This energy savings fund would provide the finance to allow the government to move forward on some of these energy efficiency measures—because what I think we will see with this bill is a degree of window-dressing and yet more corporate reports at the end of each financial year saying: ‘Aren’t we good? We’ve just done our energy efficiency audit. We’ve identified these possible cost savings, but in the scheme of things we are going to move on this expansion’—or that expansion, or whatever else—‘and not necessarily implement those.’
The government cannot say how it is measuring these energy efficiencies. What is the target? What does the government expect to achieve through this bill from big business—what level of savings over what period of time? That is where I think this bill totally fails, and that is why I will be putting before the Committee of the Whole a series of amendments which would put in place a national energy efficiency target, a mechanism for implementing that target, an energy savings fund and a requirement for business to implement the findings of any of their reports on energy efficiency.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-02-07,"—I would like to speak to the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005. This is a bill which introduces a program under which Australia’s largest industrial energy users will be required to assess their capacity to make improvements in energy efficiency. They will also be required to report publicly on the assessments that have been made. As the Senate has already heard, the opposition broadly supports the bill—as far as it goes. Labor have moved a second reading amendment to highlight our concerns about the inadequate response of the government in regard to these important policy questions.
Let me enlarge on our concerns and the reasons we have moved this second reading amendment. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee produced a bipartisan report on this piece of legislation. Both opposition and government senators have broadly supported the intentions that underlie this particular bill, which of course will oblige Australia’s largest energy users in industry to focus their minds on energy conservation. Senator O’Brien has already quoted the figures that business and industry use over 80 per cent of the energy consumed in Australia and that 250 of our largest industry users account for 60 per cent of the total business use, which is of course almost half of all primary energy use in the country. Anything that will require large energy users to look at ways to reduce consumption and improve efficiency is a laudable policy goal.
If companies act on the findings of their energy audits, this program will lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and in turn to a reduction in Australia’s contribution to global warming. The program, if successful, will contribute significantly to a change in the mind-sets of key industry decision makers. It will lift energy conservation up the priority list in regard to business investment and business planning. Where the program leads to efforts to reduce energy consumption, it will also benefit companies’ bottom line, adding to efficiency and, in my judgment, to profitability. These are of course outcomes which, in policy terms, are desirable.
What the Senate legislation committee also found, however, was that the bill had some very serious shortcomings. The overriding concern of Labor is simply the fact that this bill does not go anywhere near far enough. For a start, it does not require industry to do anything to actually cut its energy use. All that affected companies will have to do to comply with the new regime is to make periodic assessments of their potential to make reductions and improve efficiencies. They do not actually have to act on the information that they gather as a result of these assessments. Of course, we hope that sensible organisations would so act and obviously take benefit from the decisions that would flow. We hope that that is in fact what they would do. But they do not have to as a result of this legislation. This is in stark contrast to the regime in place in Victoria, for instance, where clear requirements for reduction in consumption are actually specified.
To put it simply, this bill lacks teeth. It does not go far enough in terms of its scope. The bill will do nothing to address the urgent need to cut energy consumption and, with it, greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the domestic sector. It does not address energy use in Australian homes. Nor does this bill deal with the carbon emissions caused by private cars—the greenhouse gases we belch out into the atmosphere as we drive to work, to school and to shopping centres.
The figures here are again very clear. More than half—almost 53 per cent—of carbon dioxide emissions in Australia are caused by the generation of electricity. These big power stations produce a lot of smoke. Almost 30 per cent of electricity generated by the power stations is actually for domestic use. Transport is another big emitter of carbon dioxide: some 24 per cent of the total. According to an ABS survey back in 2004, over 65 per cent of total kilometres travelled by Australian motor vehicles were by private motor vehicles—mostly by cars. How we use energy in our homes and how we use it in terms of transport, particularly in our cars, has a huge impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
As shadow minister for housing and urban development, these issues are obviously matters of deep concern to me and fall within my bailiwick. The discussion paper that the Labor Party issued last December, ‘Australia’s future cities’, was part of a process the Labor Party embarked on for a public debate about a range of policy options that are open to us as a nation in regard to urban development and housing. The aim of the paper was to stimulate debate and to invite contributions and comments from stakeholders in regard to cities policy.
Since most of us—around 80 per cent of us—live in our 40 largest cities, the stakeholders in this debate are in fact all Australians who participate in those cities. The stakeholders here are Australians as workers, as students, as retirees and as people engaged in recreational and cultural pursuits. They are all of us in our daily lives. For those who live in rural areas, there is plenty at stake as well. People from the bush visit the city or town. They benefit directly from the goods that cities produce. They also directly benefit from good cities policy by a national government. Poor policies on energy conservation in the city, for example, lead to climate change that may well affect country areas and country people even more starkly than those in towns. The cost of inefficient energy use is borne by everybody. In one way or another, we all contribute to the overall level of energy consumption in Australia.
All Australians have a big stake in getting these policies right. And the 80 per cent of us who live in urban areas can and should contribute to getting it right. Given the statistics I have quoted about domestic energy use, it matters how efficiently our homes use electricity, gas and water. Our everyday decisions about transport are equally important. What we have as alternatives to private cars—public transport, bike paths and safe and pleasant walking environments—are matters that contribute as well. They are therefore fundamental issues in regard to urban development.
Labor’s discussion paper looks at all of these things. It is about how we live in cities and ensure that they are pleasant, liveable places while also meeting our economic, environmental and social objectives. It is about urban development and renewal as potent symbols of commitment to social justice and to improving the nation’s economic and environmental health. Therefore, this is a policy that touches daily lives.
Because Labor are well aware of these facts and we have also been very aware that everyone has a keen interest in policies such as this, we do not set out to try to tell people where they should live or in what houses they should live; nor are we about lecturing people about cars versus public transport. We are about finding policy options that will encourage Australians to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. This means looking at policies that will improve housing affordability while at the same time giving priority to energy efficient design. It also means paying attention to the broader issues of urban development and renewal. We are talking about policies that will enable people to make the choice about walking, riding or catching a bus or train rather than driving their motor car. That means increasing flexibility of Commonwealth transport funding, including AusLink. The bottom line here is that Labor believe that the Commonwealth has a role in urban development. Under the Howard government we have seen nothing but 10 years of neglect in housing and urban policies.
Let me talk about this housing question particularly. Under the Howard government, housing costs have spiralled out of control. That is fine if you already own a house but it is bad news for young people and for families trying to enter the housing market. It is also bad news for those whose incomes do not allow them to aspire to owning their own homes at all and for people who rely upon the private rental market. A Labor government would want to ensure that the increased costs of housing are contained by seeking to enforce appropriate energy conservation measures in the building of houses and the use of energy by householders.
I recall that just last December the Australian Building Codes Board made a decision to enhance the existing provisions of the Building Code of Australia to include a nominal five-star energy performance level of housing, a decision which has led to some controversy. Some say that the requirement to meet the five-star standard will increase the cost of new houses by many thousands of dollars. Others say that the costs are, in fact, minimal. I support the decision for the inclusion of the five-star standard in the BCA as a sensible means of promoting national consistency in building regulations while recognising that it is not mandatory for states to adopt the performance level. Queensland has already indicated it will not do so. It is appropriate to understand that we require different housing conditions for different parts of Australia. It is no good trying to build a particular housing estate to meet the conditions of Melbourne or Hobart when we are talking about the tropics. Quite clearly, different standards are required. I believe that the buildings codes allow for that.  However, it is the situation that some states are now seeking to withdraw from that nationally consistent approach.
The Howard government’s response to the ABCB’s decision, by contrast, could only fairly be described as absolutely hysterical. Despite the fact that the Commonwealth government had representation at the meeting and, I understand, voted for the decisions to establish the five-star rating system, Ministers Macdonald, Campbell and Macfarlane issued a joint press statement predicting disaster for the timber industry and even the demise of the Queenslander house. Their hysteria flies sharply in the face of the facts. The standard, in fact, allows for a wide range of construction types. It is also already in place in four states and territories, including in my own state of Victoria, where it is seen as promoting sensible energy conservation. In so doing, the five-star performance levels add to the sustainability and liveability of our cities and towns.
At the same time, households benefit from savings on gas and electricity bills because passive heating and cooling reduce their energy costs. The fact is that electricity generation is responsible for more than half of all carbon emissions in Australia. As I have indicated, that fact alone ought to be something that the government is looking at. Our home airconditioning is a significant factor in domestic electricity use. If domestic electricity consumption falls, everyone stands to benefit. So the question of housing design and urban development becomes critical in these debates.
I turn now to transport, where we can see a similar argument applies. While road transport represents a lower level in terms of the total amount of energy consumed—I understand some 28 per cent of energy use—the majority of kilometres travelled on our roads each year—65 per cent, as I said—is accounted for by trips in private cars. Any sensible policy approach to urban planning and development must tackle this question by encouraging people to use alternative transport modes—not by forcing people out of their cars but by offering them real choices in their modes of transportation. A national government must take a lead on these questions. While several states and territories have made quite laudable gains in all of these areas in recent years, often assisted by local government initiatives, much needs to be done.
As highlighted by the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage titled Sustainable Cities, many new outer suburbs in our largest cities are almost entirely without public transport. The cost of public transport infrastructure is substantial. The bipartisan approach taken in that House of Representatives committee report concluded that a national government should be helping to meet the cost of that infrastructure. The committee recommended that the Commonwealth boost its funding for public transport, particularly light and heavy rail, in Australia’s major cities. It also recommended that the Commonwealth provide funding specifically for public transport infrastructure for new developments on the fringes of our cities.
Unlike the Howard government, Labor remains committed to this type of nation building activity—to building a better future for communities. This means not only public transport but also bike paths, safe and pleasant streets to walk along, and concerted efforts to renew and improve intermodal connections. It also means giving councils greater scope to use Commonwealth transport funding in ways that best suit their communities, rather than restricting the use of this funding to building and maintaining roads.
The Howard government has, in the 10 years of its regime in this country, had a consistent policy of neglect when it comes to the question of housing policy. It has no minister; it has no commitment to national urban development; it has failed to develop any kind of coordinated approach—which is so urgently needed—to the rejuvenation of our cities; and it has not sought to protect the environment but has in fact promoted a series of other policy goals which seem, to me, to actually undermine the policy objectives of environmental sustainability.
My argument is this: we need policies that will lead to cities and towns that are socially just, inclusive and liveable and that encourage and support participation in social, economic, educational and cultural activity. We also need policies that provide for economically efficient cities, which would benefit both businesses and citizens in a globally competitive national economy. Further, we need to ensure that there are policies which are designed to encourage diversity in terms of urban planning and architecture which would cater for the varying and changing needs of all citizens. We also need to be environmentally sustainable in the approach that we take on these questions.
As I said at the outset, this bill does not go anywhere near addressing those questions, and our second reading amendment highlights that fact. This bill concentrates on industrial energy use when a significant proportion of energy use and carbon gas emissions originate in the home and from the use of private transport. I acknowledge that industry and businesses are significant energy users and are, of course, very important with regard to carbon gas emissions. This bill is aimed very largely at those very big consumers of energy and, to that extent, it is a step in the right direction. But what we need is a more fundamental reorientation in the culture and the political priorities of this country and of those companies. If that were to occur, it would be highly desirable.
This is a small, totally inadequate step by a very tired and out-of-touch government. The aims of this bill should be supported, but the bill lacks teeth. This government has not done nearly enough to ensure the sustainability of these policy objectives. When it comes to big business, this government lacks the courage to stand up and insist that big business should come to the party, come to the table, and ensure that the whole community benefits from energy efficiency.
What we have here is like the government’s approach to bank charges. ATM fees are going through the roof, and yet the Treasurer, Mr Costello, refuses to move to regulate the banks in those sorts of areas. We have a Minister for Health and Ageing who, in the face of a crisis in childhood obesity, says no to regulation of children’s television advertisements for junk foods. He is not doing anything to encourage kids to improve their health, because he does not want to take on the vested interests—which would be required to do that.
The government will not ask the big companies the hard questions or move to ensure that they do more than assess their energy use. It will not make sure that they actually do make the changes that are required for them to improve this country. I understand that companies that are good corporate citizens will act, but I say that the government ought to provide much more regulation and incentive to ensure that that occurs.
The Labor Party want to do all in our power to ensure that our kids live in a world where they will be able to enjoy healthy, happy and prosperous lives. Labor are proud of our nation-building tradition; Australia desperately needs that nation building now. This bill is yet another example of how the Howard government has failed to look to the future.

",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-02-07,"—I rise to speak on the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 and to put on the record the Democrats’ great disappointment in this bill. We will support it, but we are distressed at the government’s complete lack of action in addressing global warming and greenhouse gas emissions. We welcome the program introduced in this bill, but we are dismayed that business will not be required to implement any measure that is identified in their assessment reports.
This is a lost opportunity, but it is more than that. It is also, I would argue, negligent on the part of the government with regard to climate change. Climate change is the most urgent problem faced by this country—or, in fact, the world. It is bigger than terrorism, it is bigger than Iran’s nuclear weapons program and it is bigger than solving world poverty. There is no more serious problem facing the world at the present time, and I do not think that is being sensationalist; I think that is the reality.
Climate change has been accepted as a reality by the world’s leading politicians and scientists. Just last week, a book entitled Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change was released. It argues that the consensus view among amongst scientists is that large-scale and irreversible disruption to the planet’s climate system will occur if temperatures rise by more than three degrees Celsius above the current level. By all accounts, we are heading well and truly in that direction. In the book’s foreword, the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, adds his voice to the warning. He states:
It is clear from the work presented that the risks of climate change may well be greater than we thought.
…            …            …
It is now plain that the emission of greenhouse gases, associated with industrialisation and economic growth from a world population that has increased six-fold in 200 years, is causing global warming at a rate that is unsustainable.
Given the hour of the day, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-02-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I take note of Senator Minchin’s failure to act as the newly appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate by his refusal to reprimand Senator Heffernan, who has yet again engaged in behaviour unbecoming of a senator and yet again publicly intimidated a colleague—yet again. It was only a fortnight ago that John Howard was at the Press Club bemoaning the decline of standards of personal behaviour in Australia. He complained that reality TV and vulgarisms were overtaking our television sets and that, as a result, and I quote, ‘We are not polite enough to each other.’ That was the Prime Minister. Well, how much Big Brother has Senator Heffernan been watching if he thinks that telling his colleague, and I quote, ‘Blow it out of your arse,’ is an appropriate way to speak in a public place? Telling a fellow senator to ‘blow it out of your arse’ with a raised voice, in public, is a new high-water mark—
—Senator Conroy, I think you should withdraw that reference. It is unparliamentary.
—It is a quote.
—It might be a quote, but it is unparliamentary.
—If that is your ruling, I withdraw.
—Withdraw!
—I just said I withdraw. So Senator Heffernan raising his voice in a public area is a new high-water mark for the Howard government’s arrogance and a new low for Australian politics. Speaking in this way is not ‘a robust early morning greeting’, as it was pathetically described by Senator Heffernan; it is appalling personal behaviour which demeans both Senator Heffernan and this chamber. De-Anne Kelly is right to label this type of behaviour as workplace harassment. This is especially so in light of the fact that this is just the latest in a series of incidents of intimidating behaviour on the part of Senator Heffernan. Before publicly abusing Senator Nash, he was stalking Senator Joyce through the corridors of parliament, gatecrashing his doorstop interviews and physically intimidating him on the floor of the Senate. Before that, he was accusing High Court judges of paedophilia. And John Howard is lecturing Australians—
—Senator Conroy—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. That was the second time we heard Senator Conroy refer to the Prime Minister as ‘John Howard’. It is either ‘Mr Howard’ or ‘the Prime Minister’.
—I was just about to say that. Thank you. Senator Conroy, it is ‘Mr Howard’ or ‘the Prime Minister’.
—And Prime Minister John Howard is lecturing Australians about standards of decency! Maybe he should have a good look in his own party room. It is no surprise that Senator Heffernan does not think the Australian Wheat Board has done anything wrong by greasing Saddam Hussein’s palm to the tune of $300 million. A blithe acceptance of obscene behaviour like this fits perfectly with Senator Heffernan’s and the Howard government’s complete rejection of the norms of civilised society.
No wonder Senator McGauran, with his filthy finger, wanted to sit closer to the marauding Senator Heffernan—they are a pair together. Senator Barnaby Joyce was right to say that Senator Heffernan should wake up to himself. But the Howard government and leaders within the government, like Senator Minchin, have the responsibility to drag him into line and make him, if he will not wake up to himself. It is appalling that John Howard and Nick Minchin—
—Senator Conroy!
—Prime Minister Howard and Senator Minchin—are allowing Senator Heffernan to career around Canberra, terrorising the place like a rogue elephant. If the Prime Minister has a problem with vulgarisms on our TV, he ought to have a problem with them coming out of the mouth of one of his lieutenants.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator opposite actually seems to be reading from a prepared text, which is against standing orders. I have never in my time in here since we have had the taking note debate ever seen someone taking note of an answer from a prepared text. They obviously prepared this in his office prior to the question being asked. The point of order is that he is breaking standing orders. He seems to be reading a speech—a speech on taking note. That is not only against standing orders; it shows a pathetic incapability of actually putting two thoughts together and trying to communicate them in the English language.
—I am reading quotes and from copious notes.
—Senator Conroy, you have 53 seconds left. There is no point of order.
—We have Senator Julian McGauran, who has grievously broken the trust of the Australian public by misleading Victorian voters about which party he intended to represent. He has stolen a Senate position. And does anyone in this chamber really believe he thought of it himself? Does anybody really believe he came up with this idea himself? There are a few guilty faces on the other side, looking down at their papers as we speak! How are you, Senator Ronaldson? Senator Kemp is not here at the moment. Does anybody really believe that Senator Julian McGauran really thought this little scheme up himself? Really! The Costello forces are so desperate for any votes to add to the phone box that they recruited the village idiot. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-02-07,"—Here we are back at the beginning of the year 2006 with all sorts of challenges facing Australia as a country—all sorts of major policy issues to ensure that Australia is kept economically secure, her borders are secure, the people have hope for the future, with a secure future, a good economy, a good health system and a good aged care system—and 38 minutes or thereabouts into question time, we get a question about a couple of senators and a conversation at an airport. It shows me, and I think it would show most people watching question time, a Labor Party that is so out of touch with the community and so devoid of any care about serious policy issues that 37 or 38 minutes into the first question time in a new year, in this new millennium, this is what they resort to.
Of course, who was the leading advocate of this tactic? It was one of the longest serving deputy leaders of a tired opposition, a tired Labor Party, Senator Conroy, who himself has an absolutely abysmal record of personal behaviour within the Australian Labor Party. In fact, I think there are reports of punch-ups in which Senator Conroy was involved on the floor of the Victorian state ALP conference last year. Of course, he is up to his neck in one of the biggest divisions within the Australian Labor Party in Victoria since the split. That is trying to see people like Mr Shorten unseat sitting members such as Mr Simon Crean, a long-serving member of the Australian Labor Party, a distinguished former Labor Party minister and in fact the former Leader of the Opposition. Of course, Senator Conroy is in it up to his neck.
The issues that confront Australia—the issues that the coalition are dealing with, that the Liberal Party are dealing with, that the National Party are dealing with and that Mr Howard, Mr Costello, the leadership team and Mr Howard’s ministers and all the party are dealing with—are: how do we ensure that the economy stays strong, how do we ensure that we build our exports, and how do we build our infrastructure through the AusLink project? We are focused on the main game.
Over summer, Labor were divided on issues like health care and climate change. You had Martin Ferguson out there talking about being sensible, about ensuring that the world has access to uranium and expanding nuclear power to ensure that we do not put emissions into the atmosphere. And you had Mr Beazley, only a few weeks later, saying, ‘No, we can’t have any nuclear power.’ You had Mr Ferguson out there saying, ‘Yes, it’s a good thing the coalition government are doing, pulling together half the world’s population in a historic meeting of nations to address climate change, to ensure that we have a strong economy, secure jobs in Australia, growing jobs in developing countries and yet lower carbon emissions.’ It is a historic agreement endorsed by one senior member of the Labor Party, who sits in the House of Representatives, Mr Ferguson, and of course slammed by other members, including the leader, Mr Beazley. Talk about reform fatigue when you are opposition leader! He has been opposition leader on and off for 10 years, with no new policies in key areas: no new policies in health, no new policies in aged care and no new policies in climate change. The best they can do after 38 minutes of coming into the premier legislative chamber in the Commonwealth of Australia is to start talking about conversations at airports.
This displays an opposition that has run out of puff. It has run out of enthusiasm. It has run out of ideas. All it can do is focus on things that are not relevant to the Australian people. The people of Australia do not want their government, their politicians, to focus on petty internal political issues or on personal issues; they want to ensure that their children have a good education, that they have access to a good health system and that elderly Australians have access to aged care. This is what the government is focusing on. On Friday the Prime Minister will lead the Council of Australian Governments meeting with the premiers and the territory leaders. They will be focusing, under his leadership, on improving Australia’s health care system and the aged care system and on coming up with a comprehensive Australian policy on climate change, with unprecedented cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth. These are the issues that matter to Australians. What matters to the Labor Party is petty politics. They should be condemned for that and, as Martin Ferguson says, get real!",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,4,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-02-07,"—The proposition that we hear from the government is that there are major issues confronting this country. I have to agree with that. But what is the government’s response? We see that within their own operations their preoccupation is the question of personal advancement. It really is all about who is going to be the next leader of the government. The unedifying spectacle yesterday was a dispute that arose as a result of the Costello forces in Victoria. We have a senator here who used to represent the seat of Ballarat clearly heavily involved in the poaching of Senator McGauran from the National Party to the Liberal Party. What reason was there? There has been none stated publicly, other than an attempt to shore up the Costello numbers within the Liberal Party itself.
Senator Nash responded by saying that never again would she put the interests of the government ahead of her party when voting in the Senate after the Liberal Party deliberately went out and purchased a vote within the Liberal Party room itself. We have a senator who was described by the former Premier of Victoria as the most useless senator for the state of Victoria. This is the man that they have purchased as a result of the intervention of the Costello forces within the Liberal Party to buy a vote. It boils down to a question of numbers. It is not a matter of deep principle.
Senator Heffernan, the Prime Minister’s attack dog, is let off the leash yet again and goes to the airport here in Canberra yesterday and tells Senator Nash that she may ‘blow it out her backside’—I use that word in deference to the ruling of the Deputy President on this matter. In this place today, we have seen Senator Minchin try to tell us there was nothing in it; it was only a question of the ABC blowing it up. What we have here is the coalition being blown up as a deliberate attempt has been made by one section of the Liberal Party to secure additional numbers in a forthcoming ballot for the leadership of the government. That is the fundamental question here—not the big issues facing this society but who is going to become the Prime Minister as a result of a forthcoming leadership ballot within the Liberal Party.
We have a senator who clearly is more interested in getting his tango lessons on the 21st floor in Collins Street than he is in representing the people of Victoria. We have got a senator here who has shown by his own personal demeanour and behaviour that he is not fit for service in this chamber. We have a senator here who should have resigned instead of taking the 30 pieces of silver from the Liberal Party for his transfer. What we have is new cannon fodder being provided by the Costello forces in this forthcoming battle. We have got the cannon fodder as we see that the National Party’s traditional role as the doormats to the Liberal Party is being fulfilled in its ultimate function.
We have Senator McGauran who says that the real truth of the matter is that the future is with the Liberal Party itself. Very rarely do I agree with Senator McGauran. I suppose you could say that a stopped clock is at least right twice a day. We have a circumstance here where Senator McGauran might have something; there might be something in it. The fact is the National Party is going from oblivion to oblivion as a result of the failure of its policy positions over many years. We have a situation where Senator Heffernan has been let loose to try to act as the attack dog for the Prime Minister to try to ensure the National Party fulfils its function as the doormats in this chamber.
We have seen in recent times that the National Party has failed to fulfil its obligations to its constituencies. As a consequence, it has lost seat after seat after seat in this parliament. Hume, gone! New England, gone! Farrer, gone! Kennedy, gone! Richmond, gone! Now a Victorian Senate spot, gone! The first seats were won in this place by the National Party in Tasmania. They have not had representation much ever since. We have seen that the National Party used to hold seats from the Gulf of Carpentaria right down to Bass Strait. Now look at the electoral map of this country. Because of the doormat policies of the National Party, Senator McGauran has led the way. He has shown what it really is to be in the Country Party, to always put pragmatism ahead of principle. He has been bought so incredibly cheaply. What has he got as a result of that? Disgrace for himself.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Carr has used the term ‘bought’ on a couple of occasions during this presentation. I would ask you to consider whether that is parliamentary or otherwise.
—Senator Carr, I do not think you should refer to a senator as being ‘bought’. I ask you to withdraw that.
—I will withdraw any unparliamentary language. What I say is simply this: Senator McGauran has changed his political allegiance in this chamber as a result of the direct intervention of the Liberal Party, the price for which, I say, is far too low. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-02-07,"—My children use the expression ‘gobsmacked’. It is an expression that I quite enjoy using myself. There would be a lot of people listening today—on their radios, driving the car, at home—on the first day that the Senate has sat this year who will be utterly gobsmacked by the total incompetence of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate. As one of my colleagues pointed out before, not only have the two senators had notes already prepared—this is a ‘take note of’; something that has come up during question time that the opposition wishes to take note of—but, as Senator Parry has said, they have got typed notes. So this was a deliberate strategy by the ALP prior to question time to make this their first take note.
If you go back through the newspapers over the last week and you listen to the Leader of the Opposition, you listen to the member for Griffith and you listen to Labor Party senators, they have been apparently talking about the Australian Wheat Board and other matters allegedly of importance to this country. Did we hear one word about that during the first opportunity the Australian Labor Party had to talk about matters of national interest when this Senate resumed sitting? No, we did not. We had the walking, talking doormat talking about the doormats allegedly in the National Party.
The reason why Senator Carr constantly grows his beard is so that we cannot see the scratch marks and the bite marks from Senator Conroy when he mauls him in the Victorian division of the Labor Party. For Senator Conroy to have the nerve to stand up here and talk about infighting and mauling quite frankly leaves me gobsmacked. If honourable senators look at today’s Age and look at the casualties of the infighting in the Labor Party and the mauling of the Left by the Right, and then look at that in the context of the rubbish we have heard today, they will see that that is a fairly clear indication that this Senate is going to have another 12 months of Labor Party incompetence.
There is one person in this chamber who does not need the help of Senator Conroy or Senator Carr, and that is Senator Nash. She is far smarter and far tougher than Senator Carr and Senator Conroy put together, and she does not need the Australian Labor Party to support her. I would think that if, at the end of this year, people were to look back at the start of this year and the discussions of the Labor Party, they would see that in some respects the white flag has been raised already. Look at Mr Beazley. Four days ago he was threatening to take out every single government minister, including the Prime Minister, in the first day of question time on the first day back. And last night he was saying that there would be no casualties.
Why is it that the Australian Labor Party is so totally incapable of giving its supporters any hope for the future? What will Labor Party members think about this pathetic attack today by the Labor Party on the first day of the Senate sitting? They will be as appalled as the people who are listening today. Again, the Labor Party branch membership has been let down by a totally incompetent opposition in the other place and a totally incompetent opposition in this place. Let us have some serious and genuine debate in this chamber. Let us actually meet some of the challenges that we were elected to confront rather than talking about a pathetic intervention by a pathetic opposition on a pathetic subject.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,4,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-02-07,"—I can draw Senator Ronaldson’s attention to the Age as well. Michelle Grattan’s column talks about an incident which occurred between Senators Heffernan and Nash as they prepared to board an early morning flight from Canberra to Sydney. The article purports to quote the nature of the exchange, and it purports to quote Senator Nash, who confirmed the exchange and described it as ‘Bill being Bill’. She said, ‘I certainly wouldn’t expect quite such ill manners at 6.30 in the morning.’ When this matter was raised in question time a number of government senators asked, ‘Were you there?’ as though, unless senators on this side of the chamber were personally present they could not rely on the report in the paper, which quotes a senator who was involved and assures us that what is purported to have taken place did take place.
That is pretty typical of this government. When they said, ‘We weren’t told about children overboard,’ that was their excuse. Now we are hearing in relation to the AWB, ‘No-one told us that AWB was giving money to Saddam Hussein’—a typical hollow defence. I heard the answer of the Prime Minister in question time today when he was asked whether he thought to investigate the claims that AWB were paying money to the Iraqis. He referred to a press release of mine and quoted selectively from the last paragraph, which says: ‘In the absence of evidence to support allegations, Australian wheat growers are entitled to dismiss the claims as an attempt to promote the sale of US subsidised wheat in the Iraq market,’ and he used that as a justification for saying, ‘Therefore I had no reason to investigate the claims that AWB were diverting money to Saddam Hussein.’
What the Prime Minister failed to do in question time today, and Minister Vaile has also failed to do this, was to deal with the other eight or so paragraphs of the press release and the heading, which says: ‘Iraq kickback claims must be investigated.’ That is the dishonesty of this government’s approach to questions being raised about their actions: they did not know, they had not heard, they were not there to hear the exchange—and then they misrepresent what the opposition said in 2003 in relation to this in order to justify the Prime Minister not investigating what was clearly known to the government at that time.
We heard Mr Vaile in question time today in relation to the same matter. He said that he asked AWB and they said that nothing was wrong, so he did not take it any further. That is the sort of approach this government takes, and it is the same approach that Senator Minchin now takes to the behaviour of Senator Heffernan—behaviour revealed on the radio and in the Age today and not contradicted by Senator Nash in the report in the Age today. But the government is prepared to say, ‘Well, it is one of ours. We can’t have a casualty. We can’t apply to our own the standards that we expect everyone else to maintain. So we are going to say, “You don’t know what happened because you weren’t there.”’ That was the despicable standard of senators opposite in question time today. It is despicable, because the government and the Prime Minister have asked Australians to adopt a higher standard in their behaviour towards others. But when it comes to members of the government, when it comes to them trying to intimidate members of the National Party—that poor, sliding-into-oblivion party—then there is a double standard.
I can understand the National Party being upset. The Labor Party has had people rat on it and vote against it in this chamber. When former Leader of the Democrats Cheryl Kernot left the Democrats, she resigned from the Senate and ultimately contested a House of Representatives seat, which she won, on behalf of the Labor Party. Do we see that integrity from Senator McGauran when he rats on his party, joins the Liberal Party and takes a National Party seat into another party room? No, we do not. That is why the National Party is so upset, and I can understand it, but that is a standard that this government is prepared to accept, just as all their other double standards are acceptable when they seek to impose other standards on the Australian people.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2006-02-07,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 2 February 2006, of the Hon. Sir Reginald William Colin Swartz, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Darling Downs, Queensland, from 1949 to 1972, and at various times a minister.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon. Sir Reginald William Colin Swartz KBE, ED</title>",Condolences,5,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2006-02-07,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate record its deep regret at the death, on 2 February 2006, of the Hon. Sir Reginald William Colin Swartz, KBE, ED, former federal minister, Leader of the House of Representatives and member for Darling Downs, Queensland, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Sir Reginald was widely respected for his service as a member of the Australian military, as a member of parliament and in his business career. Reg Swartz was born on 14 April 1911 in Brisbane, Queensland. He was educated at Toowoomba Grammar. At the age of 17, he joined the Citizens Military Forces and later enlisted in the 2nd AIF. He served with the 2/26 Infantry Battalion 8th Division in the Malayan campaign. After being captured by the Japanese, he was a prisoner of war for 3½ years, spending time in Changi and a period working on the Burma-Thailand railway. He returned to Australia in 1945. He re-enlisted in the CMF in 1947. He was Lieutenant Colonel and Assistant Quartermaster-General of Northern Command and he was made an honorary colonel of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in 1969.
Before entering parliament Sir Reginald had worked as an oil company executive. He was elected to federal parliament as the member for Darling Downs in 1949. He was the first member of the Liberal Party to hold that seat, winning it comfortably in the election which saw the coalition returned to office under Sir Robert Menzies. He held the seat for 23 years and served as a minister in a number of portfolios in the Menzies, Holt, McEwen and Gorton governments.
During his time in parliament he also led or participated in a number of overseas delegations and missions, including to India in 1957, the United Kingdom in 1965, South-East Asia in 1968 and New Zealand in 1971. Curly Swartz—which I gather was an acknowledgment of his baldness—was Leader of the House in his last two years in parliament. He was described by a journalist as the government’s ‘most unflappable character and its best diffuser of contentious issues’. Prime Minister McMahon described him as a master of tactics.
He was among 200 Australian former prisoners of war who accompanied Prime Minister Howard to Thailand in 1998 when he opened the Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum. The museum is a memorial to the 2,700 Australians who died building the Burma-Thailand railway in World War II.
Reg Swartz was created a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in June 1972 and had earlier been appointed Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1948 for distinguished service in the south-west Pacific. In retirement, Sir Reginald pursued his many and varied interests, living a full life until his passing last week at the remarkable age of 94.
On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Lady Muriel Swartz, and children, Barbara, Graham and Rodney, and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Hon.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-02-07,"—by leave—I join with Senator Minchin in supporting this motion and would like to speak on behalf of the Labor opposition. We offer our sincere sympathies to Sir Reginald’s family and friends at this time.
As Senator Minchin said, Sir Reginald entered the House of Representatives in 1949 as the Liberal member for Darling Downs, a seat he held for 23 years before retiring in 1972. He was re-elected to the seat on eight occasions, on two of which he was elected unopposed. Prior to entering parliament he had worked in the oil industry. Sir Reginald had quite a remarkable and lengthy ministerial career spanning the Menzies, Holt, McEwen and Gorton governments. In researching his career, it struck me that he had quite a remarkable career. Unfortunately, he is not a name known well to my generation. I guess he retired at about the time my political consciousness was developing. He obviously had a very senior and full career and led a very interesting life.
He was appointed Parliamentary Undersecretary for Commerce and Agriculture in 1952. He then served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade, Minister for Repatriation, Minister for Health, Minister for Social Services, Minister for Civil Aviation, Minister Assisting the Treasurer and Minister for National Development. There was not much he did not do. He was also Leader of the House of Representatives in 1971 and 1972. Clearly, he had a very distinguished and remarkable career. Before that time, he managed to fit in very good service for the Australian Imperial Force, and was unfortunately a prisoner of war for 3½ years. He was discharged from the military in 1946, re-enlisted in the Citizens Military Forces in 1947 and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
After retiring from parliament, he continued his career in business. He was chairman of the trustees of the Australian Army Aviation Corps. For his military service, he was made a Member of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire in 1948 and was awarded the Efficiency Decoration in 1950. He was knighted in 1972.
In 1936 he married Hilda Robinson, who unfortunately passed away in 1995. He is survived by his wife of his second marriage, Lady Muriel Swartz, his three children and their families. Sir Reginald, who lived in Buderim in Queensland, passed away on 2 February aged 94. On behalf of the Labor opposition, I extend our sincere condolences to Lady Swartz and all of Sir Reginald’s family and friends. He truly lived a full and active life and made an enormous contribution to Australian politics and government.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-02-07,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
That the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3) as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243 and made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988, be disallowed.
I remind the Senate that these regulations amend the principal regulations to introduce new provisions concerning pilot operating procedures on and in the vicinity of non-controlled aerodromes. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—

Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3) Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243

These Regulations amend the principal Regulations to introduce new provisions concerning pilot operating procedures on, and in the vicinity of, non-controlled aerodromes.
New paragraph 166(2)(c) requires that the pilot in command of an aircraft that is being operated in the vicinity of a non-controlled aerodrome must conform with, or avoid, the circuit pattern. New paragraph 166(2)(d) requires that when the pilot joins the circuit pattern this must be done in a certain direction. The latter requirement is subject to subregulations 166(3) and (4). The relationship between paragraphs 166(2)(c) and (d) is not clear.
Regulation 166 prescribes a number of strict liability offences. New regulation 166A also prescribes a strict liability offence, but subregulation 166A(4) provides a defence of reasonable excuse.
The Committee wrote to the Minister seeking advice on the operation of these provisions. The Minister has responded providing information on these matters. The Committee appreciates this advice which addresses most of its concerns. The Committee has decided to seek further advice on the circuit pattern provisions to allow it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations.

that the CSIRO has had to look offshore for investment funding to advance its work on the solar turbine technology; and

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-07,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the responses from the Premier of Queensland, the Premier of Victoria and the Northern Territory Minister for Family and Community Services regarding the Senate resolution calling on the state and territory governments to respond to the recommendations outlined in the Community Affairs References Committee’s reports Forgotten Australians and Protecting vulnerable children.
As the Deputy President will recall, those reports received a government response, and the government response indicated that many of the matters that the Senate committee had attended to were the province of the state governments. I am pleased to see that the state and territory governments have indicated that they regard these matters as very serious ones requiring further and detailed consideration, and that they intend to come back to the Senate with a much more detailed response.
The motivation behind the motion requesting this response from those governments was initiated by me, Senator Humphries and Senator McLucas, so it was a cross-party motion. The response we had as a group of people to the federal government’s response was one of disappointment. We were disappointed, and I am disappointed, that sufficient had not been done with respect to those reports. In my opinion, the federal government failed to take the lead and failed to avail itself of the opportunity to show leadership on the widespread problem of child abuse and its consequences.
We know that, constitutionally, child protection is a states and territories responsibility. Nonetheless, on a matter of such national importance to do with our nation’s most precious resource, its children, the coalition government let a golden opportunity pass by. I find it difficult, when faced with a government which is determined and quite forceful in implementing a national workplace relations system, to understand why it is timid and backward with respect to a national approach to child protection. That sort of attitude beats me. The only answer I can ever come up with is that the cabinet as a whole, unlike many members of the parties that represent the government, just do not get it. They do not get that if you hurt and break the spirit of a child, you will have decades of a harmed adult to deal with. By not getting it, by not doing the hard yards now, federal governments will continue to confront the long-term social and economic costs of child abuse, because an abused child results in decades of cost to the community.
I note that the government plans to discuss mental health at the next COAG meeting. This is important and very encouraging news, but it is far better to tackle the problem at its source. There is enough research available that tells us the mental health system is filled with survivors of prolonged, repeated childhood trauma. Judith Herman, in her book, Trauma and Recovery, wrote:
... abuse in childhood appears to be one of the main factors that lead a person to seek psychiatric help as an adult.
My fellow committee members—and I remind the Senate that those reports were unanimous—and all others involved in these inquiries know full well the tragic outcomes of abused childhoods. It is not an exaggeration to say that, of the hundreds of submissions received from those who had experienced out of home care as children, an overwhelming majority wrote of adulthoods plagued with mental health problems. Depression, post traumatic stress disorder and suicide attempts are common amongst those people.
Not surprisingly, such disorders have meant many ruined adulthoods and ruined relationships. Quite apart from mental health problems, there are a myriad of other associated problems which can follow on from abuse as a child, such as homelessness, welfare dependency, substance abuse, criminal behaviour and relationship problems. Even more tragic is the tendency for some of these people to produce yet another generation of victims. And I can assure the Senate that I have read submissions which indicate that such a generation will go back to great-grandmothers in some circumstances, so you have to break the cycle.
This leads me to another level of disappointment with the government’s response to, in particular, the recommendations of the Forgotten Australians report. Essentially, its general shrugging of the shoulders response means that the forgotten Australians feel that they are to remain just that—forgotten. There was the token acknowledgement that what occurred was tragic and that:
The suffering experienced by so many children placed in institutional care is a matter of shame for this country.
It is not just a matter of shame; it is one that needs to be remedied. It certainly warranted more concrete action by the federal government than the somewhat paltry response that they put up. Instead, time and again any responsibility was, on constitutional grounds again, handballed across to the states. The states have lots of areas of concern that the Commonwealth still takes leadership on, such as water, property rights, workplace relations and defamation law. There are numerous recent instances, and they should do the same on child protection.
Rather than taking up the recommendation to establish a national reparations fund, as exists in Canada, Ireland and even Tasmania, that measure was not considered necessary. How wrong the government has been on this issue. Having been denied justice for decades, such a fund would have meant so much to so many, and it would get us away from a litigious and open-pocket approach to one which is manageable and has a finite limit. But nowhere was the government willing to put its hand in its pocket. What a contrast when you consider the millions it splashes around on things that matter, like advertising IR! It has spent more on its advertising campaign on obesity alone than it has been willing to spend in this area. I look forward to hearing from the various states and the territories regarding this Senate resolution. I am glad of their interim response. I trust that the states and territories will end up showing a more dynamic, generous and perceptive response than in my view the federal government has. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-07,"—I move:
That Schedule 7 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 8), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 221 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.
This motion, for which notice was first given, I think, in late November last year, seeks to address one schedule amongst a range that were put forward in the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 8 ) from October last year. This schedule changes the criteria in regard to remaining relative visas. Currently, prior to these regulations coming through, an applicant could apply for a remaining relative visa if they, together with their spouse, did not have any overseas near relative residing in the same country as them, did not have more than three overseas near relatives and had not had contact with those relatives within a reasonable period before they applied for the visa. The effect of the schedule, which the Democrats seek to disallow, is to restrict eligibility for the remaining relative visa to people who have no other near relatives living outside Australia at all. It is said that this needs to occur to address so-called integrity issues associated with the visa category and ensure that only applicants left in genuinely isolated situations overseas will be eligible.
This is not an earth-shattering, world-changing regulation overall. It is not going to affect a massive number of people, but if we look at the total numbers of our migration intake with permanent visas—and indeed the even much larger number now coming in on temporary residents visas—we see more and more that a component of the intake is being tilted further towards business and skilled visas. The family component as a proportion of the total has certainly shrunk dramatically in recent years. As I said, this individual change in itself will not affect huge numbers of people, but it is a further tightening of family migration for people wanting to reunite with remaining relatives. I do not believe that is desirable in terms of the balance of the migration program nor from the point of view of multiculturalism.
I do not want to range too broadly in this contribution as I want to keep my contribution reasonably short, but the broader issues of multiculturalism and ensuring a harmonious, well-integrated society in Australia with migrants from a large and diverse number of backgrounds are not helped if we unnecessarily restrict family intake. Family migration, having relatives living together in Australia, is a significant glue that helps to maintain the fabric of multiculturalism and I believe that this change, while small, will be to the detriment of that. I do not wish to overstate the case and to say that it will have monumental impacts of a negative type, but I believe that we are unnecessarily restricting family intake when there are people wishing to migrate to Australia to join other near relatives—and near relatives are defined in the regulations—and that we should not be making that unnecessarily hard for people.
This restriction, which comes in through the schedule of this regulation, makes it unnecessarily hard for people to shift from having three near relatives in other countries who they have not had contact with for ages to having no other relatives overseas at all and those near relatives being normally resident in Australia. That makes it unnecessarily tight. It might address the so-called integrity issues but it does that by basically making the purpose of the visa unnecessarily restricted in the process. All of these things are a balance, and I believe we have things out of balance in regard to family intake in the migration area.
That is not to criticise skilled migration and it is certainly not to criticise migration in general. Some time many years ago, at least some in the Democrats had a very strong anti-migration viewpoint and sought to dramatically reduce the amount of people allowed into this country. That is not a view held by any Democrat senator now—indeed any Democrat senator who has been in this place for quite some time—and it is not a view reflected in our party’s policy. We need to have a migration intake that allows our population levels in Australia to be sustainable. I believe the current levels of migration combined with the current fertility rate enable us to establish a sustainable population level in Australia. But part of it is also about ensuring that the mix within that intake is a balanced one.
Whatever size you think our migration program should be, it is always going to need some limits put on it. We certainly cannot at this stage have an open-slather approach. We need to put criteria in place in regard to eligibility for migrating. But I believe it is undesirable to tilt that, as has happened, too far towards skilled and business visas. Further restricting the ability of family to reunite and for people to migrate and contribute to Australia in conjunction with relatives they already have here does not help our national self-interest. It will unnecessarily lead to more isolation with people spread out over different parts of the world when they do not want to be in that situation.
So the Democrats believe this change is not a desirable one. As I said, it is not a massive component of the entire migration program, but it reflects a wider trend that we have concerns about. We believe in this instance it is appropriate to disallow this change and allow the remaining relative visa to apply more widely than it will under the schedule contained in these regulations. I urge those senators who support the concept of a reasonably broad family intake in our migration programs to support the Democrats’ motion to disallow this unnecessarily restrictive change.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 8)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,21,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-02-07,"—I suspect this disallowance motion moved by Senator Bartlett will not be successful. I am unsure how those on the other side of this chamber are going to vote, but I have a feeling they are going to vote it down. Senator Bartlett has raised a number of points, but if you look at the overall effect of this regulation it seems to be a cut that is based on cost—in other words, the department has come to a view that these are costly issues and that, as a consequence, it wants to revamp the visa system. It is not appropriate criteria in all events to look only at cost and I think in this instance that has been the main driver behind some of these changes, particularly this one.
Senator Bartlett has made a couple of particularly interesting points which I think can be supported by the opposition. Those points really go to the fact that there has been a long history of support for family migration, particularly the type provided here, for a range of reasons. Those articulated by Senator Bartlett go to issues of multicultural policies, which Labor has supported and pursued vigorously and which I think this government has abandoned. But when you dissect this particular initiative of the government, you could then say that on balance it may be a constructive regulatory change. While it will restrict a percentage of people from being eligible to apply, the basis for the amendment is to address integrity issues around the visa, so it seems sensible on face value. The amendment to this regulation reduces the number of other remaining relatives an applicant may have from three to none. Prior to the amendment, an applicant could have three other remaining relatives and be eligible for the visa, as long as they were estranged and had not been in contact with them for a certain period of time.
In many cases the department of immigration was thus forced to prove a negative—that is, the department had to prove the relatives had not been in contact. Of course, that can be a costly and difficult exercise. For the special concession visa, it would appear to be an unnecessary and inappropriate use of departmental resources and time to prove that negative.
On that basis, at first glance the opposition considered that there might be merit in the amendment. When we looked at it in a little bit more detail we expected to find that the government had mounted the case. Labor understand that if people miss out on this concessional visa, due to this new regulation, they do not necessarily miss out on being able to come to Australia. It is a special concessional visa targeted at a specific group of people with special circumstances. But, when we lifted the skin from the custard, when we looked a bit more deeply, it was obvious that the minister has not made an argument to say that the regulation is better policy than that which is currently in existence. The minister at no stage in the argument being used to defend the regulation has argued that there will be fairer outcomes or more just outcomes. In fact, there is a policy vacuum in terms of what would be a better or more just outcome.
The argument about the difficulties in verifying the rules that applied before this regulation was introduced is not an argument about the policy or the reasons for the concessional visa. It is an argument about cost. These are costs associated with having to check that a number of relatives have had no contact with each other. But we are dealing with what is very much a concessional visa. It is not unreasonable for the minister to want to take those issues into account—that is, the reasons why the concessional visa should or should not be granted—and not balance those simply by saying that the costs far outweigh the position. Of course there will always have to be a balance. We are not saying that there should be no consideration of compliance costs with this sort of concessional application. But we would expect the government to argue its case more fulsomely. I suspect we would not be debating this now if the government had been able to make the case as to why, in terms of both the policy and the compliance costs, this concessional visa should be removed and dealt with in another way.
Labor, of course, does not object at all to compliance costs—they are a necessary part of the department—and the integrity of the system being matters taken into account in relation to visas. It is reasonable, in fact, to undertake due diligence and due examination to make sure that people are obeying the rules. But it seems that the balance here has tipped to the other side. In other words, the evaluation of how this concessional visa has worked has not taken into consideration (a) the number of people who would be affected and (b) how you will then deal with those people in a much fairer or more just system. They are simply saying that compliance costs seem to be prohibitive and as a consequence we can remove this type of concessional visa.
When we look at it, there are cases where we have some sympathy for wanting to reduce the compliance burden on the department. But we also have some sympathy for the point of view that was articulated by Senator Bartlett. There has to be, as I have said, that balance struck. If you have other relatives out there somewhere in the world but you are genuinely isolated and have had no contact with them for a substantial period of time, then the reasons for having this concessional visa do apply to you.
If we are going to knock out the people in this situation because of the administrative burden, we need to know how many people are going to be affected. We need to ask for the information and the department needs to provide it. Information from this department to enable us to make those assessments as to whether there are alternative ways to deal with this has been scant. We can only reach the conclusion that the department does not examine these issues in great detail but makes administrative decisions based on costs rather than on the actual issues themselves.
The balance that we as legislators have to make is between, in this instance, the compliance costs that they say are burdensome—as I understand their argument—and need to be reduced, and the number of people who will be affected and who may have to find some other mechanism and could genuinely use this concessional visa. It is impossible, in some parts, to make that assessment, when much of the information to base the argument on should come from the government and they are not providing it in a way that provides a sound reason why this regulation should be removed. Until such time as they can produce that evidence—produce the reasons, produce the costs and tell us how many of these people there are and that they will be dealt with in a more humane or different way—then Labor is not in a position to support this regulation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 8)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,21,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2006-02-07,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a few remarks on this motion of Senator Bartlett’s in relation to schedule 7 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 8)—Remaining relative visas. I note the remarks of both Senator Bartlett and Senator Ludwig and perhaps, in some small way, can add to the discussion, particularly to expand on the observation Senator Ludwig made in relation to this step being based primarily on cost. It is important to place on the record that there are broader reasons in relation to this matter than just cost, and the department has explored those. I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss them this afternoon.
The changes that have been made to this remaining relative visa subclass, which has previously had the intention of enabling Australian citizens and permanent residents to bring to Australia a remaining relative who would otherwise be left in an isolated situation overseas, are addressing some broad concerns around the use of that visa class. The origins of the remaining relative category go back to those times when the ease of international travel and communication facilities, such as telephone and internet, were not as readily available as they are today, so communications and contact were far less easily facilitated than they are in many instances today. Also, as Senator Ludwig acknowledged, this is in fact a concessionary category of visa subclass. It has no skills or age criteria either.
Before 1 November 2005, the then extant regulations allowed an applicant and their spouse, if they had one, together to bring to Australia up to three overseas near relatives who did not reside in the same country as the applicant and spouse, provided there had been no contact with those overseas near relatives within a reasonable period prior to the application. One of the problems with the visa subclass was that the provisions which allowed an applicant to bring up to three overseas near relatives were in fact, as far as the department was concerned and as far as their examination of several key cases showed, resulting in fraudulent claims. I know that, notwithstanding the observations of Senator Ludwig and Senator Bartlett in relation to the importance of the family migration category, no-one in this chamber supports the existence of a regulatory environment which gives some succour, if you like, to the making of fraudulent claims. This would be one example of that.
As I understand it, the three principal areas of fraudulent claims were the concealment of the existence of overseas near relatives, the misrepresentation of the usual country of residence of the overseas near relatives, and the concealment or misrepresentation of the nature of contact with overseas near relatives. These areas of fraud were borne out by a refusal rate on this subclass which averaged approximately 50 per cent, so not an insubstantial amount. In addressing these integrity issues, the category was reviewed and, in the contemporary environment to which I alluded earlier—particularly in relation to communications and travel—it was decided that having up to three overseas near relatives in the subclass category was no longer appropriate. The new regulations now require an applicant and their spouse, if they have one, together to have no near relatives other than those near relatives who are both usually resident in Australia and are Australian citizens, permanent residents or eligible New Zealander citizens. I understand that no other country has a category of ‘remaining relative’ within their migration system, but Australia retains this category. We did wish to retain this category for those relatives who are genuinely left in an isolated situation overseas. It has been suggested that the regulations should allow one overseas near relative in a third country—and that would take up some of the points made by Senator Bartlett in his earlier remarks—but there is a concern that this would still give rise to the integrity issues that I have outlined in my comments.
I want to stress to the chamber this afternoon that these changes are really about addressing integrity issues and not about reducing the family stream of the migration program. While I think the department probably expects a reduction in applications that have fraudulent claims, there is not any expectation of a significant reduction in the actual number of persons qualifying. Importantly—and I think it is important to note this, because there was an emphasis from Senator Bartlett on the importance of the family migration stream—if there is a general reduction in the family stream, additional places will be provided for other uncapped categories within that stream. I hope that that will go some distance towards addressing those concerns.
As far as the numbers are concerned, in 2004-05 the department received 2,461 applications for remaining relative visas. The major source countries for those visa applications in that calendar period were the PRC, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Cambodia and Pakistan. In that same period, 1,154 of those visas were granted and 1,122 applications were refused. That gives rise to the refusal rate I indicated earlier of close to an average of 50 per cent. It is worth noting that, in the two months prior to the changes, there was an increase in the number of applications for remaining relative visas, followed by a comparable reduction in applications during the next two months. With regard to the numbers—and this is a matter that Senator Ludwig raised—the long-term effect on application numbers and refusal rates will not be evident for some time. I think the changes to the remaining relative visa subclass in this regulation go to issues of greater significance than perhaps Senator Ludwig gave the government credit for. I think it is important to have placed those on the record this afternoon.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 8)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,21,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-02-07,"—I move:
That item 2 [Division 1.4E—Sponsorship: trade skills training (incorporating Subdivisions 1.4E.1 to 1.4E.4)] of Schedule 7 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 9), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 240 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.
Schedule 7 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 9) is the government’s new trade skills training visa—at least, it was in November. However, I did note from today’s Australian that Senator Vanstone intends to cut back skilled visas—so there is obviously a new one, but it may be overtaken shortly by another plan that Senator Vanstone is hatching in the skills area. I think it only indicates that skills training in Australia is being planned by Senator Vanstone. Senator Vanstone is the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, not the minister for training or for trade skills—or for education, for that matter. I might allude to this later in this contribution.
The trade skills training visa will, according to the government, allow noncitizens ‘to undertake apprenticeships in regional areas of Australia in trade occupations experiencing skills shortages where no Australian has been found to fill the position’. In reality, however, this regulation is another attempt by the Howard government to apply yet another bandaid to Australia’s skills shortage—a skills shortage all of the government’s own making. The Howard government has failed to adequately train Australians and instead has continued to turn to the option of importing skills. We all know we have a skills shortage in Australia and in some areas it is, indeed, at crisis point. However, it is not a recent phenomenon. It did not happen last year or this year; you can at least trace its early signs, I think, back to when this government got into office in 1996 and started slashing spending on training and education—particularly vocational education and training.
Skills shortages in the medium to long term are best addressed through education and training initiatives. Since 1996, however, TAFE, other vocational education and training, and university funding have declined while skilled migration has increased. During a skills shortage—this is a little bit staggering, really—under this federal government, education and training have declined and skilled migration has increased. It has been a long-term failure by this government is to invest in our own people. This is not a policy that will take Australia into the future. It is not about building Australia for the future. This government is looking for a short-term political fix. This government has been critical of Labor for expressing so much alarm at the cuts to Commonwealth funding of universities. It has even claimed that the Labor Party, which established TAFE, has no interest in apprenticeships. I can say that I do have a vital interest in apprenticeships. I was up in Toowoomba on Friday supporting Kim Beazley’s plan for no TAFE fees for apprentices. It is a good initiative; it is a pity the government has not got an initiative equal to it.
When you look at the government’s policies on universities, however, turning thousands of qualified students away from universities does not miraculously increase the numbers of those seeking to learn a trade. The government does not seem to understand that there are different markets—particularly if you have cut funding to TAFE at the same time. Quite simply, this government has failed, for quite a long time now, to turn its mind to training Australians in TAFE courses and trade courses and to encouraging them to go to university—in other words, this is right across the board. This government’s reliance on skilled migration to address the skills shortage has itself failed. This government is now importing unskilled workers and getting Australian businesses to train them. This government does not understand the problem.
There are two basic impacts of a skills shortage. One seems blatantly obvious to me—I think the government should see it as well, but they have certainly demonstrated no inclination to understand it: that business cannot get the people they need. That is one; it is quite simple. The second is that there is the potential for wages growth in those certain occupations where there is a shortage, without there being any increase in productivity. The net effect is that it costs business more; it can lead to increased costs to business. It costs consumers more because businesses will endeavour to pass those costs on, and it can have an inflationary impact. These are the downsides; if you have a skills shortage and you do not look at the long-term needs, then you can quickly get yourself into a position where those issues start to hurt small and medium sized business.
But let us not downplay skilled migration. Skilled migration is a valuable component of Australia’s cultural and economic development, but it should not be a primary means of addressing our skills shortage. It should not be the only policy left. Senator Vanstone is starting to look more like the minister for vocational education and training than like the immigration minister, but that is not the main way you are going to address and deliver adequately skilled labour to this country. It is clear that there is a skills shortage, but it is not an immigration issue. This government is using immigration, but it can only be a bandaid. The government is treating the skills shortage as an immigration problem, as I said. It is moving the debate over there. This government is good at that—at shifting the debate away from where it really is. The debate is about skills shortage in this country, not about using migration to fill that void. The skills shortage is not an immigration problem; it is actually an education priority. That is where this government’s mind and work should be.
So we can ask whether Senator Vanstone is the only one in charge of fixing the problem. She is not here in the chamber, but I am sure the news will be passed on to her that it seems that she is the only one seeking to fix the problem of skills shortages in Australia. That is in itself the real question: why is the immigration minister leading the government’s campaign to address the skills crisis in Australia? We know that the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, is pleased with this approach. Training is long term; it takes time, resources, commitment and money. Those words—time, commitment and money—do not sit well with the Treasurer. Without significant investment in education and training, however, the skills shortage will become a permanent feature of our economy. Many of the occupations on the in-demand list for skilled migration have been on the list for almost a decade. If you want to see how bad this government’s neglect has been, have a look at the migration occupations in demand list for professions and trades from 1999 to 2005. In 1999 there were five trades and vocational occupations on the list. In 2002 there were three. And in 2005 there were 27 trades on the migration occupations in demand list. That trend looks like continuing through 2006.
Now the Howard government wants to import unskilled labour under a skilled migration program—has it really got that bad? Clearly, investment in domestic training has been woefully inadequate. The Liberal Party and National Party—I will keep referring to those separately because the coalition is starting to fray and they might want me to use the two different names—have been hoarding taxpayers’ money and refusing to invest in skills, and they need to start to address this with policy initiatives. We know that employers prefer to train people from their regional area in order to help the community build and grow. Those people stay as tradespeople in the community and commit to long-term investment in the area. That is how rural communities have lived and supported themselves over many years. This government, of course, is abandoning rural voters. It is abandoning rural areas and saying, ‘There is a skills shortage in rural communities and we are going to fix that by skilled migration,’ rather than investing in those communities with training and education opportunities for the young people in those areas—and not only the young people but also the 18- to 35-year-olds, the people who can be retrained and helped back into the labour market.
Instead, in 2004, the number of apprentices and trainees enrolling took a four per cent hit and the number of students enrolled in VET took a seven per cent hit. So what is the government doing to address that? Very little. The result is, firstly, that we are now turning to overseas fee-paying students to meet the government’s skilled migration program and, secondly, we are getting a new visa class to support the use of unskilled apprentices—unskilled, untrained labour—under a skilled migration program. The bulk of the government’s skilled migration program includes overseas fee-paying students and unskilled, untrained foreign nationals. That seems to be the policy initiative that this government is pursuing. It should turn itself to how it can effectively help regional and rural Australia rather than pursue the course it has set.
There are two significant problems with this visa. The first relates to the fact that the apprenticeship is less likely to contribute to Australia’s skilled workforce in the long term than if you trained people from a rural and regional area. A person who completes their apprenticeship under the trade skills training visa is more likely to take that skill away from that regional and rural community to a capital city or offshore. The skill would then be an export from Australia rather than an import to it. The second problem is that the trade skills training visa is simply another avenue for those seeking to immigrate to Australia to obtain a visa. That is not a bad thing. This is a great country and we always encourage people to come to Australia. But the argument is about committing and investing in regional and rural Australia to ensure that people in those regions get the opportunity to train and work in those communities—because that is what they want to do. Neither of these two problems are part of that, and nor is the government investing in them. In each case, it is going to make it in any instance harder for people to obtain apprenticeships and remain in rural areas. This visa will drag people from overseas into regional and rural apprenticeships, which could be at the sake of young and not so young people in the community having that opportunity themselves.
The government claims that its trade skills training visa requires a potential employer to demonstrate that there are no local people prepared to take the job. I have to say, that is hard to accept when nowhere among the 50 questions on the employers’ application form does it require them to have even advertised the job. It is pretty basic that you might want to require them to advertise it to make sure that, in the first place, it is well known that there is in fact a job there. You have not exhausted all avenues when you have not even taken the time to advertise in a local newspaper that you have vacancies for apprenticeships. In the meantime, businesses are being forced to fill the skills gap with short-term measures.
As a nation, we must look beyond short-term fixes like skilled migration. They are part of but not the solution. They cannot replace the competitive advantage of training our own young people from rural and regional areas to work in those areas. Labor’s concern is simple: under this federal government we are importing our present and future requirements rather than training our own. The government’s answer of importing unskilled labour under a skilled migration program is not sound skills planning. It is not sound immigration planning and it is not sound population planning either. Unfortunately, with its new trade skills training visa, the government is undermining the competitive advantage we really have. This government needs to understand that sound policy is much more than an announcement.
Going back to Senator Vanstone, she is floating her new ideas again. The plan seems to be to cut back skills visas, which goes to considering measures to cut the number of less-skilled technology workers entering Australia. That is based not on work by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations but, it appears, because the minister disagreed with them, on data generated from within her own department, which she commissioned. It seems that sometimes you might commission a report because you disagree with the area that might be actually trying to help with and work through the issue. One can see provided in that a worrisome example of short-term fixes for what are really long-term problems that need to be addressed. And the best time to start addressing those is now.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 9)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,22,1
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-02-07,"—I rise to speak on the disallowance of item 2, schedule 7 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 9). I would like to commend, as I usually do, Senator Ludwig, my colleague from the other side, for an excellent contribution—though it is unfortunate that the issues that were left out of his contribution were more significant than the issues covered in it. He made reference to the Treasurer and said that the Treasurer is somehow to blame for this situation, and I have to say that our Treasurer would probably agree with him. An interesting consequence of having a good economy and good growth is that it causes low unemployment—fewer available people to turn up for jobs. That is a consequence of having a good, strong economy, an economy that is sustainable in terms of growth. Of course, the senator opposite is right: that has been happening since 1996—and the government takes full blame for having a strong and growing economy. But, of course, there are consequences. As the senator opposite has pointed out, there is now a skills shortage. We can call it a skills shortage or a jobs dearth. There are different ways that you can look at it.
The comments the senator opposite made with regard to regional and rural Australia were interesting. I represent, as does the senator opposite, plenty of places in regional and rural Australia. I think regional and rural Australia has every right to share in this growth and this opportunity. This particular aspect of the migration program, the trade skills training visa, is targeted particularly at regional Australia, because those issues are particularly acute there. The senator opposite would recognise that regional and rural Australia do have the right—as do other Australians—to share in the growth in our economy and the benefits that spring from that.
It is interesting that Senator Ludwig indicated that Amanda Vanstone is now the minister for vocational education and training. I can assure Senator Ludwig that this area is not unlike any of the other issues in this government, and we have to deal with a suite of complex issues: the answer is never in a single bolt of lightning. These are very serious issues, and the government takes them very seriously in ensuring that there is equitable growth in each of the portfolios to ensure that all of Australia shares in the growth. Obviously, it is not only about vocational educational and training, investments we have made in universities or the recent investment we made in the TAFE colleges in Australia; clearly, there is a need right now for this growth to be sustainable—and it is; people have confidence in that. Particularly in regional areas, if there is not an answer found to this in the short term, there simply will not be that sustained growth and, frankly, regional Australia will miss out—and I do not think that is good enough.
Interestingly, the Australian of 15 April last year quoted ACTU President Sharan Burrow as saying:
She did not oppose fee-paying overseas students taking up apprentices in regional Australia “as long as it was not at the expense of local students getting their opportunities”.
So, in a lot of ways, she has reflected the view of the senator opposite, Senator Ludwig, in saying, quite sensibly, that there are some concerns; that we do not mind the benefits of such a sensible policy but we need to ensure that there is a policy framework behind that to ensure that there are no unintended consequences and that local people do not miss out on opportunities. I would like to assure this chamber that this is a government that thinks through in a very comprehensive sense every possible scenario with respect to these issues—and we spend a lot of time doing so.
I can assure this place that our policy framework ensures that no suitable Australian will miss out on an apprenticeship position because of an overseas apprentice. That is not just a statement: before an overseas apprentice can fill a vacancy, an approved regional certifying body, an RCB, must certify that no Australian apprentice can be found to fill that vacancy. That is a fact. From recollection, I think there are nine current applications, one of which has been approved and one which was seen to be invalid. It is not appropriate that I talk about the details of those applications, but one would assume that the validity or otherwise of that was simply that they found an apprentice for that particular task. It has to be demonstrated that there is no-one there who can fill that role as an apprentice.
I can assure this place—and I am quite sure that I do not have to give too many assurances to those senators who get around in regional and rural Australia—that this is a real issue in a number of places in Central Queensland and in the places I visited during the break. There is a mine near Borroloola which has spent quite a lot of money recruiting bodies and putting advertisements in the Australian. When they need tradespeople, there is a huge competition for them and it is very difficult to get them.
The approved regional certifying bodies have to certify that no Australian apprentice can be found to fill the vacancy. I know from personal experience that that is the case in many areas of regional and rural Australia. In Roma in Queensland, in Senator Bartlett’s area, Golden West Employment Solutions had a sponsorship application that was approved in December last year. I understand that they employ 413 people. That is not an insignificant number; it is a very serious number. Unfortunately, they have 188 vacancies. That is in Central Australia—in regional Australia. They have 188 vacant positions. Senator Ludwig, I accept some of your criticisms—and it would be great to have more apprentices. We have incentives to provide for that, but it is about the speed at which these things can happen so that places like Roma and Central Queensland and other areas can get the benefits of our growing economy—and filling 188 vacant positions is not going to just happen overnight. This need we have to meet is not on an exponential growth curve, but it is very steep.
The government’s analysis is that we need to provide extra people in these positions through a migration program. I would remind Senator Ludwig that this is not a one-off line; this is part of a comprehensive approach to our migration program. In the 2005-06 budget there was an increase of some 20,000 skilled places. So we have already recognised that there are quite a lot of areas where we cannot meet the demand of the workplace. We have seasonal harvest workers, who basically increase the flexibility of holidaymakers; we have the trade skills training visa, which we are discussing here today; we have the industry outpost positions; and we have the two-staged skilled designated area sponsored visa. It is quite a comprehensive part of the migration program.
I have to say that we have developed this visa very carefully. I think there have been some concerns that, if you have overseas apprentices, there is some possibility that they can be exploited. I can give you the assurance that the overseas apprentices will have exactly the same protections as the local apprentices. They will work under the existing award conditions or under the same conditions, in accordance with our apprenticeship scheme. Obviously, we all need to be concerned about that, Senator Ludwig, and I am glad you are concerned. I hope I have addressed some of your concerns because this is very important. This is about sustainability. It is not about using people. We are about ensuring that everybody gets the benefit of our economy, particularly in regional and rural Australia. That has to be done in a sustainable sense.
We have to monitor the activities that are going to be undertaken. We have to do that in cooperation, of course, with those people closest to that. The Commonwealth does not want to try to manage Roma. In relationships with state governments—in the case of Roma, with the Queensland government—we ensure that they are responsible for the apprenticeship training. That is going to ensure that both the employers and the sponsors are abiding by their obligations. That is a very important aspect of this. They have to abide by their obligations and that includes Australian awards and conditions.
Here we have a need. We know that need cannot be provided for under the current arrangements or in the foreseeable future. We can talk about the history of all of that sort of stuff, but, as a pragmatist, Senator Bartlett, I know that regional Queensland and other areas like that have a need right at the moment. We need to ensure that, in fulfilling that need, we are not excluding other Australians from opportunities. We have a board that gets up every day to ensure that we are not excluding Australians. That is very important. We have someone who gets up every day to ensure that does not happen.
As I said, we have received nine sponsorship applications so far. Only one has been approved. This is not going to be a huge rush. This is part of a suite of programs to ensure that every single Australian can get a benefit from what I think is our excellent management of our economy. For that to continue to be sustainable, and particularly to equitably and in a very just sense ensure that every single Australian can enjoy the benefits of this government’s good work, these sorts of visas are needed. I entreat senators opposite not to support this disallowance motion because it certainly is not in the interests of Australians or of regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 9)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,22,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-07,"—There have been some useful points made by both speakers in this disallowance debate thus far. Certainly the Democrats concur with a lot of what the Labor Party said in relation to criticisms of the government’s record on investing in training. The number of apprentices and trainees has declined. The number of students enrolled in vocational education and training in 2004 declined. We have had a reduced overall public investment in universities and TAFEs as a proportion of GDP. That is a poor record. The Democrats have been critical on many occasions of the government’s failure to adequately invest in skills training, whether it is in universities, TAFE or other vocational education.
But, as Senator Scullion said—and I think he even faintly perhaps acknowledged that there is some substance to that concern—we are dealing with what the reality is now. Complaining about what the current circumstance is does not help to solve the problem. There is no doubt that there is a shortage and an inability to fill some of the places that are around. Simply complaining about the government’s failure to adequately invest in this area does not actually fix the problem, related though it may be, of inability to actually fill some of the places.
The point could be made—and, in fact, I think the point has been made by the government—that we have a lot of people coming here on student visas and doing studies at university, so having them come in on another visa to do skills training is somewhat comparable. The Democrats do not oppose student visas at universities. We do have concerns—and, again, I think they are very valid concerns—that the lack of adequate government investment in universities has made those universities too dependent on the income from overseas students. I think that is undesirable. But that is not a criticism of overseas student visas themselves; it is a criticism of the inadequacy of the public funding contribution from the government. I think it is important not to get those things mixed up.
The example that Senator Scullion gave—and it was very kind of him and useful to use examples from my own state of Queensland—was a valid one. Of course, even when there are places available and there are Australians available to take some apprenticeships up, it is more difficult in regional areas. Indeed, it depends on what you call regional. During the last election campaign, actually, I visited a machinery workshop in Maroochydore or Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast just north of Brisbane. It is not normally thought of, certainly, as the outback. It is sometimes called regional, depending on where you draw the line. They were having great difficulty in getting apprentices for some of their places there. I and the Democrats do not have a problem with using our migration system to assist in getting some of those places filled. It will assist in generating wider flow-on jobs. It will assist regional communities in particular through generating wider economic and social benefits for those communities. I think that is an important point to make.
As I said in my contribution to the previous disallowance debate—on the disallowance motion that I moved—the Democrats do have strong support for a healthy migration intake. Whilst there are certainly issues that have to be addressed in managing the environmental impacts of population growth, nonetheless we as a country can do an enormous amount better at being more efficient in how we use resources in order to counterbalance the fairly mild increase in population that is coming as a result of our migration program.
The overall number that we are bringing in at the moment, which is quite high even by historic standards in Australia, should be emphasised because it still needs to be made part of the migration debate. The fertility rate, if it continues to decline in the sort of trend that it has over the last 10 to 15 years, will lead to us having a stabilised population by the middle of this century. I think that is an appropriate thing to aim for in terms of environmental sustainability and to ensure that the economic and social benefits that come from a well-managed migration program and a sizeable migration program continue to occur.
I believe it is important to make some of those wider comments about the migration program during debates like this. In recent times there has been debate, certainly following the disturbances in the Cronulla shire prior to Christmas and, indeed, in the last few days following some of the absurd overreaction overseas to the publication of some cartoons in newspapers, originally in Denmark and then elsewhere. Those sorts of incidents always spark up debate again about multiculturalism: who we should bring into this country, how many people, where from, what the mix of them should be and, for some people, whether we should have people coming at all, certainly with regard to the sorts of numbers that we have coming at the moment or from particular regions.
There is an understandable sensitivity about engaging with some of those topics, but I believe that we—certainly people like me—need to engage with them. For a number of years, the position of the Democrats—the party as a whole—has been to support a sizeable migration intake and that we should be more strongly promoting the benefits of it. We should not be shy about that. We need to actually confront head-on some of the apprehension in the community, because it is quite understandable.
The concerns raised in the context of just this visa include whether or not apprenticeships that Australians could have will go to people coming from overseas. The government speaker, Senator Scullion, I think adequately addressed that concern, but it is understandable that people would have it. We need to confront that and reassure people about that. Of course, people would feel resentful if they thought, ‘My kids can’t get a job and they can’t get an apprenticeship, and we’re bringing in people from overseas to take the jobs.’ That is not the case and we need to make it clear that that is not what is happening and that is not what this visa is about. We need to confront that directly and acknowledge that that is a legitimate concern, not just dismiss it as coming from people who are anti-migrant. I do not think there is enough of that in the migration debate. I appreciate that this disallowance motion is about a specific visa. I am certainly not accusing the movers of it in the Labor Party of having that motivation. To some extent, we confine our comments in this debate to the nature of the specific visa, as we did with the last disallowance.
I think we cannot compartmentalise these issues too much, because there does need to be a greater engagement with the community concerns about our migration program as a whole and about the size of the intake, particularly when you consider the very large intake of people on temporary residency visas. If I remember correctly, that is a point that Professor Hugo from South Australia has made. For all the focus on how many people come here as migrants—and, as I said, the number is quite large currently, even by historical standards; it is around 140,000 in this financial year—the number of temporary residents coming in is, I think, likely to be 450,000 in this financial year. So they are quite large numbers.
I believe the evidence is very clear that Australia has benefited enormously—socially, economically and culturally—from the sizeable migration intake over the last 50 to 60 years, but it is also clear that there is still sizeable community concern about aspects of it and that aspects of it need to be engaged with fully. We cannot just have large numbers of people coming here and not accept that there are management issues to deal with about that. There are certainly environmental issues to deal with that we do not manage adequately. We do not manage adequately environmental and resource management for the people who are here, let alone the ones who are coming next.
A related issue is the failure of governments at state and federal level to adequately invest in infrastructure in general—not just education and training but wider community infrastructure. Bringing in more people at a time when we are failing to adequately put public investment in that infrastructure is a problem, but it is a problem with the failure of the policy of the government. I believe it should not be reversed around to say: ‘We can’t take migrants in because we don’t have enough of this or enough of that.’ Those aspects need to be acknowledged.
Another aspect also needs to be addressed. It is a concern that I have with this visa. It is not a sufficiently big enough concern for me to support the disallowance, but it is a concern that still needs to be raised, and that is the overall amount of settlement assistance that people get. If we want to get maximum benefit for our country, our communities, our regions, our economy, our society and the multicultural nature of Australia, we need to assist people in every possible way when they first come to the country. Whilst we have done well in various areas with settlement programs, we have not done perfectly. We are getting some more gaps and some more failures in that area. That applies to the humanitarian intake. I will not divert by repeating the concerns that I have raised many times about the absurd refusal to adequately help refugees on temporary protection visas, but I think we are also not doing as well as we need to with our other humanitarian intake.
We are also not doing as well as we need to with people in the skilled area coming in. The fact is that people coming in on this visa have to have the financial capacity to meet not just their course fees but also their living expenses, travel and other costs for themselves, their spouses and dependent children, and adequate health insurance. They are people who have a bit of money to back themselves up. They have to have the educational qualifications and skills background.
The fact that people might have a bit of money and education and are not a refugee from a camp in the middle of Africa does not mean that they do not need settlement assistance. We need to do better with that. It is an investment from the public and government side of things. Early on it is of course a cost, but it is a cost that should be seen as an investment that will pay off much more significantly in the long term. I believe with regard to this visa—and I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong—that people getting it will not have access to government settlement services. We are talking about people coming in to get trained in skills. They will still be basically unskilled immigrants, under the age of 35, I believe, moving to a different country and into regional areas—hopefully into areas quite remote from the capital cities—with no broader settlement support services other than what the employer might provide. That is not ideal, and that is an aspect that needs to be looked at, both with this visa and others more widely. Nonetheless, people getting this visa are required to have vocational English. As I said, I understand that they need to be less than 35 years of age and already be sponsored by an Australian employer or organisation which has to have approval as a trade skills training visa sponsor.
There are clearly benefits to areas that come from these visas being filled. People regularly comment—partly in response to environmental concerns and other issues to do with adequate distribution and viability of services—that we need to be trying to get a higher proportion of our migration intake into regional areas. That is easy to say; it is not so easy to do. But one piece of moderate credit I have to give the government is that they have made some advances in recent years in finding formulas—to some extent in cooperation with the states—that have meant that more migrants are going to regional areas, to states other than New South Wales and to places other than Sydney, reducing some of the pressures there, and are assisting in improving the economic and social viability of other communities. That is a positive aspect that I think still has a lot of room for further gains, but wherever there is an opportunity for that to be done, whether it is through this visa or others, it is one we need to seek to undertake.
In some ways it is fair enough to call this visa a bandaid to meet some of the skills shortages, but a bandaid is still better than no bandaid, and it does goes some way to addressing the problem. The problem is, in significant part, of the government’s making. Senator Scullion said that it is ‘of the government’s making’ in generating a good economy. He forgot, I am sure inadvertently, to mention the Democrats’ contribution to having that good economy through our cooperative approach over the last nine years in the Senate, enabling most legislation to go through and, indeed, improving some of the government’s legislation, not least their workplace relations legislation that enabled a more harmonious and effective employment market. Unfortunately, I think we will soon see the consequences of us not being able to do that with the most recent workplace changes. However, apart from the cause of the overall operation of the economy generating this, there is no doubt that inadequate investment by the government in some of these areas of skills development is also part of the reason. But that does not mean that we should not try and address the situation that confronts us at the moment.
So whilst the Labor Party raised some valid concerns, I do not believe they are sufficient for us to support removing this visa altogether. The clarification Senator Scullion gave did address some of those concerns, although not all. Some of the other concerns that Labor expressed are totally valid, but they are still nonetheless separate from the specifics of the visa itself. I nonetheless reinforce my concern about the need, wherever possible, to provide broader settlement assistance to people. We need to be looking at that—even with people coming in on temporary visas—and perhaps call it something other than settlement assistance. It is in our interests as a country to make sure that people do have as much support as possible in those early stages when they move here from overseas, particularly if they are going to regional areas and particularly if they are younger. That will help them, but I think it helps us as well—and that is a concern that I have. It is one that I think will help alleviate not all but more of the community unease about aspects of migration. You will never address all of those concerns, and you would not want to with some of them, because they are concerns that I believe are inappropriate. But there are some valid aspects to community concerns about aspects of the migration program. We need to more positively promote and sell the gains to the entire community from large components of our migration program. I do not believe we do that enough, and we need to look at ways to do it more and more.
That does not mean that any sized migration program is desirable. The calls from some in the business community to massively ramp up our migration intake are simply unrealistic and absurd. Suggestions of doubling our migration intake, of aiming for a 40 million population or things like that, are unsustainable in all sorts of ways. But a good healthy intake is a positive for the country and is clearly workable, and the benefits that it has produced are there for all to see. However, that does not mean that we should turn a blind eye to some of the potential negatives that need management, and I think we can do a better job there.
I have raised a few side issues in addressing this disallowance motion, but I believe from what has been put on the record that, on balance, this visa is worth supporting. That is not to say that other problems do not need addressing, but I think the visa itself is worth supporting and I think it will be a net positive to many communities and to Australia—like, I might say, so much else of our migration program.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2005 (NO. 9)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,22,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-07,"—I rise today to wholeheartedly support this reference to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee of a full and thorough investigation of the research priorities of the CSIRO, how it is organised, how it is managed and what its management culture is. I have to say that there are many Australians who I am sure feel exactly as the Greens do. The CSIRO used to have a fantastic reputation around the world as a leading research institution, and as one that was independent. When the CSIRO worked on an issue, people felt quite proud of the work that was done. They felt that it was authentic and legitimate and that it was not driven by government policy and not biased in its outcomes.
Progressively, that has changed over the last 15 years as the government has cut back funding to this very important flagship research organisation, to the point where it now has to kowtow to government policy in relation to its response to climate change. We have seen the appalling announcement in the last week or so that the CSIRO is now virtually abandoning its work in renewable energy and cutting-edge technology and is going to focus on the government’s priorities—which are, of course, coal, coal, coal and coal. It is about the export of as much coal as possible to China, India and anywhere else. As long as it can pour fossil fuels into a global energy market, this government is determined to do that and to drive the CSIRO into being complicit in that arrangement.
They have actually put themselves in the position of saying that Australia’s contribution to attending to global warming will be to put as much government money as possible—which is effectively corporate welfare—into the coal industry to see if it can develop carbon capture and storage, otherwise known as geosequestration. It is completely unproven technology. What happens if it does not work? In 20 years time, we will be left with a far worse situation on greenhouse gases and more immediate outcomes in terms of climate change and less capacity to deal with them.
The world wants to get beyond a carbon economy. The world wants to get beyond fossil fuels. Australia had the capacity to do that. We have cutting-edge researchers in this country, particularly in solar energy and photovoltaics. We now have good research and good outcomes on the ground in terms of wind energy. We have seen the renewable sector in Australia start to blossom because of some incentives due to the mandatory renewable energy target, and now that has been left floundering at just two per cent. The investment in the renewable sector is drying up, and everyone in that sector acknowledges that it is because of the government abandoning an increase in the mandatory renewable energy target. That means that we are not attracting the money we need to invest into those technologies.
In the same week as the CSIRO announced that it is warming to coal research, its chief executive said:
... industry and consumers depended heavily on coal to fire electricity and that was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
CSIRO’s deputy chief executive, Ron Sandland, said that we can have more impact by focusing more of our energies on clean coal. What a load of rubbish! They must have felt like washing their mouths out after they had said that because they know as well as I do that the future lies in cutting-edge renewable energy technology.
At the very same time, we have CSIRO scientists, having developed solar technology that they believe could replace coal fired power stations in 20 years, being forced to go overseas to tout for business. There was a UNEP conference in Dubai. They have just been there to tout for business and to seek partnerships with anyone they can get from overseas in order to commercialise the technology and to leapfrog coal. The biggest contribution Australia could make to the world would be to use our scientific expertise to leapfrog coal. That is what China needs, that is what India needs and that is what the whole world needs in order to deal with climate change. Whoever develops that technology will write its own cheques in terms of employment, investment in research, capability and so on. You only have to look at what has happened in Germany. Germany decided to get out of nuclear power. They had a proactive government policy and went straight into solar technology. In the last five years, Germany have had a huge expansion in solar. They are now a world leader in solar technology. They have eclipsed Australia in terms of research in solar and have created 25,000 jobs in solar alone. More jobs have been created in the solar industry in Germany in five years than are in the whole coal industry in Australia. And Japan is following suit.
Here are we, with some of the best research in the world, such as that which happens at the University of New South Wales, but also here at the CSIRO—
—Don’t forget the University of Adelaide.
—And Adelaide. All round the country there is excellent work being done in solar. As I said, the CSIRO developed the solar turbine technology at the Queensland Centre for Advanced Technology and we are now not going to be able to spend the money in Australia that we need to make sure that we get that technology right and get it commercialised and on the market.
It is about time that the Australian people had an opportunity, through a Senate inquiry, to have a really good look at what is happening with the CSIRO and to see how it has moved from being an organisation for all Australians that was recognised for doing public interest research—and public interest research is the key thing—to being virtually the puppet of government policy, begging industry for partnership money to try and get some of its project work up. As a result, almost all of this work is not in pure research but is designed for industry outcomes, not necessarily for public interest outcomes. That is what Australians will lament.
Look at the response from the agricultural community seeing the cutbacks in research to the agricultural sector. That, of course, was part of it. The CSIRO chiefs are trying to defend it by saying that they had consultation with industry groups when in fact the NFF and others are saying that they had virtually no consultation in relation to the strategic decisions about research in agriculture. So I think this is an extremely timely opportunity for this Senate committee to have a really good look at what is happening with the CSIRO. I certainly welcome that and I think people around Australia would certainly welcome that. It must be so demoralising for the scientists working in the CSIRO when they recognise that suddenly there are going to be substantial job losses from the current workforce and that the shift in research priorities is going to take us back and lock us into a future based on coal and not on innovation.
The government’s absolute pact with the coal industry means that it is actually costing Australia jobs in the long term. Whether Australia likes it or not, staying out of the Kyoto protocol will not make an iota of difference to the rest of the world community. They will move on. Carbon will have a price and when it does have a price all the externalities from fossil fuel generated energy and fossil fuel mining will come home to roost and the competitiveness of modern technologies will outstrip coal. Meanwhile, Australia will have locked itself in and hitched its wagon to an industrial age instead of getting beyond that into the tertiary industries sector that can take us into the future. The CSIRO moved into the Newcastle area to start looking at transitions into a green energy future. It has all come to nought as there is this concession that the CSIRO has to go to partnerships, that it has to go to industry for its money because it lacks funding from government.
We have seen the demolition, if you like, of the reputation of the CSIRO. I think it is incumbent on this parliament to restore the image of the CSIRO, to inject back into it the support of the parliament for increased funding for its futuristic objectives in climate change research. There should be an injection of support for the notion that the CSIRO belongs to all Australians and that it should undertake public interest research funded through the Commonwealth. We must stop this huge concession in our universities and in the CSIRO where we are losing some of our brightest young people to overseas research institutions where they can do public interest research, where they can pursue pure research for the sake of it instead of having to be locked into the priorities that industry set, which may or may not be the priorities for the future, the priorities for the country or the priorities for public interest. I am very passionate about seeing this research organisation put back on its feet to achieve the objectives people in Australia expect of the CSIRO. I congratulate the committee on bringing forward this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,23,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-02-07,"—I rise to support this reference of a matter to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee proposed by Senator Marshall. I believe that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, is an important institution that has played a critical role in developing and maintaining a culture of excellence in research and technological development in Australia. It has been central to the advancement of Australian industry and plays a fundamental role in ensuring the innovation that is critical to developing a place for Australia in the emerging knowledge economy.
If we are concerned about the future of our nation, if we want to look at developing beyond our economic reliance on exploiting our infinite primary resources and develop a more sustainable and value added economy, and if we want to maintain an international competitiveness then we need to take the issue of science and technology policy seriously and ensure that we are investing in both research and innovation and also fostering a culture of private investment in its development and application. We need both—public and private. The degree of excellence and expertise contained within CSIRO in research leadership makes it an essential and cost-effective part of our efforts to invest in national R&D.
If we are concerned about the long-term sustainability of Australia we need to be investing more in R&D and education and encouraging the development of new industries that make the most of Australia’s unique resources, expertise and position in the world. If we are concerned about the long-term sustainability of our environment we need to continue to back CSIRO’s world-leading research in environmental, ecological and agricultural science. CSIRO as a research institution has punched, in the past, well beyond its weight on the international stage. It is ranked in the top one per cent of world scientific institutions in 12 of the 22 research fields. For example, it is ranked sixth worldwide in plant and animal science and in agricultural science. It is ranked eighth in environmental and ecological science. It is a partner in international research activities in more than 85 countries in over 740 ongoing international collaborative research projects. At present it is the largest employer of scientists in Australia and the role that it plays in supporting professional development is critical in maintaining our R&D capacity and in keeping our technological edge. Through a pivotal role CSIRO plays in industry partnerships such as the cooperative research programs, commonly known as CRCs, it plays a catalytic role in the development of new industries and technologies.
I am concerned that funding for Australian R&D in general, and for CSIRO in particular, is not keeping up with the needs for the development of our future economy. I am concerned that the need to balance restricted funding is forcing CSIRO to make bad decisions as it attempts to balance the need for ongoing R&D programs and areas of excellence with the need to develop into new areas of innovation. With limited resources and increasing demands, something has to give. The need to balance these tensions and the culture of research leadership was clearly demonstrated by the recent strategic planning process that CSIRO has undergone. This has led, on one hand, to the identification of six national research flagships and a four-stage plan to take CSIRO up to 2012. On the other hand, the need to develop new areas on limited and diminishing resources has meant some difficult decisions have had to be made, including the announcement of significant job cuts in some established areas.
The budgetary problems were highlighted during estimates, with indications that CSIRO has sought permission to run a $14.5 million budget deficit in 2005-06. Then we heard late last year the announcement of 200 jobs being cut in research support areas with the potential for up to 400 positions going. We have heard talk of a brain drain, with a number of brilliant researchers recently being made redundant on very short notice. These include international climate expert Dr Graeme Pearman, leading wildlife ecologist Dr Jeff Short and federal pest control expert Dr Roger Pech. All are leaders in their field, undertaking high-quality research of truly national significance.
Now we have just had the release of the research investment direction paper. We are hearing more signals of job losses and funding cuts to agriculture, manufacturing and renewable energy. There have been rumblings from a number of areas that increased emphasis on external earnings has meant that more time is being spent chasing money than undertaking research and there is a move from doing public good research to being a client-driven research consultancy. The research investment direction paper confirms the real impact that the need to chase external funding is having. Quite simply, the philosophy of ‘partner or perish’ means in practice going where the money is rather than pursuing Australian innovation.
CSIRO no longer has the luxury of being able to think strategically or to plan for the long term because of the imperative to chase external funding to make up for the shortfall in government appropriations. Despite the rhetoric about the Australian economy being in transition from extractive industries towards those based on knowledge, technology and innovation, the new focus in the new paper is on mining, mineral resource development and clean coal. We are going back to Australia as the international mine. At a time when we should be building our future and making the most of our diminishing technological edge, CSIRO is being forced by the short-sightedness of government priorities to hitch its wagon to the fate of 20th-century energy dinosaurs, abandoning its lead in renewable energy. Once again, as reported just recently in the Canberra Times, the developers of the next innovation in solar energy are having to go overseas for funding. How many times has Australia lost major innovations and the major leading edge in industry because we have not been able to find finance in this country?
Make no mistake: as we are all aware, our neighbours know that the future is in building technology and are investing heavily in building knowledge based industries. Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea and China are all focusing heavily on building their capacity and producing science and engineering graduates. Our government’s inability to provide a supportive and nurturing environment for science and scientists in our universities and premier research institutions paints an unenticing picture for our school leavers contemplating a career in science or in engineering. CSIRO’s latest transformation has all the hallmarks of an inability to listen to the scientific community and a failure to take a long-term visionary approach to Australia’s research and development strategies. It is based on a naive belief that a growing reliance on private sector funding will not have adverse impacts on our research capacities. At the very same time CSIRO’s value as rated by its external investors has decreased steadily over the past year. The very people it is chasing for more money are saying that they feel that they are getting fewer bangs for their buck.
Government expenditure levels on R&D are at their lowest levels for 25 years as a percentage of GDP. There is no sign of a nation that is powering forward. Not only are our government’s social policies taking us back to the 1950s; their science policies are heading back that way too. Science once had a world-class institution in climate change research. According to climate experts it is now falling so far behind that it is not even on the international radar. Management is so caught up with lapping up the propaganda of the coal industry about how good the new clean coal is going to be that it has all but abandoned its vision for a new national energy model based on distributed renewable energies and sources. Energy efficiency technologies and demand reduction strategies have dropped off the scope just like our climate change commitments. Rather than pursuing, as has been reported extensively in the past, big hairy audacious goals—as CSIRO’s then new chief executive urged a few years back—researchers are now being urged to follow the big hairy mining industry and coal executives to hit them up for a few extra bucks.
All these factors are raising very real concerns in the R&D sphere and in the public arena about management and culture within CSIRO. CSIRO is an important national institution which has played a critical role in developing and maintaining a culture of excellence in research and technology development within Australia. I believe that there are very good reasons for us as a Senate to look at the evolving role of CSIRO, its place in the wider issues of competition and collaboration in the research sector, the challenges of R&D commercialisation, the management and exploitation of intellectual property and the wider culture of research and development within Australia. If Australia is to maintain its leading edge in technological development and innovation, it is critical that we have a strong CSIRO. That is not the way, unfortunately, that our national research organisation is heading. It is a tragedy for this country, one that I believe needs to be averted and one that this Senate needs to take a careful and close look at so that we can reverse this unfortunate trend.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,23,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-02-07,"—This feels a bit like Groundhog Day, because I believe we were due to deal with the issue of referring the CSIRO’s role and responsibilities to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee last year. I preface my remarks with one of the concerns that I and others have raised in this place, and that is that there is a perception—and I think the numbers back it—of a diminishing number of references to committees. I guess it reflects a general concern that the committee system in the Senate has not been used in the way that was originally intended in this place. That is, proposals for committee references have been quashed. Certainly that was the case towards the end of last year. I hope the government is prepared to allow and support this committee reference, not only because it is a legitimate committee reference but because this is, I think, the bread-and-butter work of committees and the Senate. Indeed, this is an obvious reference for a committee such as the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee.
The Australian Democrats do support this reference. We believe there is a critical need for the role and the performance of the CSIRO to be referred to the committee for inquiry. As other speakers in this debate have mentioned, the CSIRO’s recently released research priorities for 2006-07 give some indication of the direction that the CSIRO appears to be taking. There are elements of that proposed direction that are cause for concern. I acknowledge that the CSIRO faces the challenge of balancing long-term research that is to the public benefit with the imperatives of commercialisation. The CSIRO’s internal mantra—that notion of ‘partner or perish’—provides us with a telling indication of the impetus for the CSIRO to pursue funding from private sources to augment the inadequate government funding it receives. A consequence of this need for CSIRO to engage with business is that many CSIRO scientists’ expertise is being used for private consultancies, to the detriment of their own research work.
The 2006-07 research priorities signal a change in research focus. The increased focus on advanced materials, including polymeric materials, has been welcomed by scientists. Another new research focus—the development of the water resources observation network, designed to give a national view of our current water situation and predictions for the future, along with ideas on maximising water use—has also been welcomed by scientists. We recognise that some of those research priorities have been warmly received.
Not so welcome, however, is the shift from renewable energy to clean coal technology, with CSIRO explaining, ‘We should reduce our effort in renewable energy restricting our activities to those in which we have a competitive advantage and can have significant impact.’ This dumping of critical research which would be of much public benefit is of great concern—and you have heard comments in this place today from a number of parties reflecting that concern—particularly, and obviously, at a time when we are experiencing the frightening impact of climate change thanks to excessive greenhouse gas emissions.
A recent report from the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Medical Association predicted 8,000 to 15,000 Australian deaths every year by the end of the century as a result of heat related illnesses if greenhouse gas emissions are not dramatically reduced. Australia once did have a competitive advantage in renewable energy back in the 1980s and 1990s. In fact, Australia’s research into renewable energy was on the international cutting edge—thanks in part, of course, to the CSIRO. I wonder why this critical area of research has been neglected or at least diminished when it is clearly needed now. And, given that Australia has the world’s highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita and that the threat of climate change is already impacting upon us, the CSIRO could have a huge impact in this area with its potentially groundbreaking research. Instead, the CSIRO appears to be bowing to the influence of coal powered energy. CSIRO’s chief executive has been reported as saying that, like it or not, industry and consumers remained heavily dependent on coal to fire electricity and that reality was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. So the CSIRO will shift its focus to low greenhouse emission so-called ‘clean’ coal.
Surely, as the nation’s peak science body, the CSIRO has an obligation to pursue scientific developments, such as renewable energy, that stand to benefit the public good. This has been one of the great factors of the CSIRO as an institution: its recognition that public good is integral to the work that it does. The CSIRO should be leading the way in conducting innovative research to develop renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While some of CSIRO’s research priorities for 2006-07 show innovation and indeed forward thinking and will help the agency to stay ahead of the times, emphasising our reliance on fossil fuels will not. If the CSIRO does not conduct this kind of critical research, we cannot rely on private companies to do it.
We should not be too surprised, however, at the CSIRO’s change in research direction. It is clearly responding to the demands of industry as opposed to research in the interest of the public good. The CSIRO has diminished government investment. For some years, government funds for the CSIRO have been waning in real terms. The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies reported that, over the past six years, the CSIRO’s share of Commonwealth investment in research and development declined from 12.4 per cent to 10.7 per cent. Indeed, government spending on research and development is at its lowest level for 25 years as a percentage of GDP.
This need to scramble for funding has resulted in the flagging of job losses to conserve money. This is a likely outcome of the 2006-07 priorities. I acknowledge that Senator Siewert made reference to job losses or impending job losses, including specific people who have gone from the agency. In the past few years, there has been a dramatic loss from the CSIRO of many highly regarded scientists. These include climate change expert Dr Graeme Pearman, wildlife ecologist Dr Jeff Short and ecologist and feral pest control researcher Dr Roger Pech, who have been made redundant. This loss of experience and knowledge can only further erode the CSIRO’s reputation as a research body, and I think the reasons CSIRO saw fit to make these three redundant warrant investigation.
Meanwhile, the CSIRO strategic plan, including the six research ‘flagships’ launched three years ago, has not been the economic boon that was expected. In fact, the CSIRO had a $9.2 million deficit in its most recent annual report and has a projected deficit of $14.5 million for the 2005-06 financial year. Given that the flagship program attracted a large injection of federal funding and the research priorities for 2006-07 include an increase of funding for the flagship program of 24 per cent from 2005-06, its role in the CSIRO’s budget deficit must be placed under rigorous scrutiny. A Senate inquiry is an opportunity to do that.
CSIRO research is in danger of being compromised by the need for it to ‘partner or perish’—this mantra. The drive to secure external funding to supplement its government funding is threatening the reputation of the CSIRO’s research. Perhaps the same argument could be launched for a number of our key, innovative education institutions. That scramble for funding, that desperate need for funding, in order to make up for government shortfalls does have an impact on quality and on the way the institution is regarded.
The nature of the CSIRO’s role in Australia seems to have been lost in the scramble for funding, be it public or external. The science agency is stuck between a rock and a hard place, trying to maintain its reputation as a source of quality research for the public’s interest, while operating in many instances as a private consulting agency. Some of the CSIRO’s research priorities for 2006-07 add further impetus to the call for an inquiry to examine some of the concerns that have been outlined by people in the chamber today and some of the concerns that I have noted. An inquiry must be conducted before the situation at the CSIRO worsens and its reputation is potentially irreparably damaged. The amount of public investment in the CSIRO over the years and its groundbreaking work, its innovative work, must not be compromised. It must not be lost. This is an excellent opportunity for the Senate to play a role in ensuring that that is not the case—that is, to ensure that there is rigorous scrutiny of some of the decisions that have been made and to look at the funding imperatives for the CSIRO in the present and the future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,23,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-02-07,"—If no other senators are seeking the call, I will close the debate and make a few brief comments. I thank Senators Carr and Stephens for their contribution in supporting this reference last year. The debate has been interrupted by the Christmas break. I thank Senators Milne, Siewert and Stott Despoja for their contributions today in support of the reference. All the senators have made different contributions. Each one of them has in fact made the case for this reference, this inquiry into the CSIRO. Collectively the case has been well made and it is worthy of support.
Senator Troeth’s was the only opposing voice to this reference. I want to briefly respond to the reasons Senator Troeth gave on behalf of the government for not allowing this reference or for voting against it. The reference will clearly be blocked without government support, the government having the numbers in the Senate. I will quote from Hansard. Senator Troeth said:
The government, in relation to CSIRO’s performance, as Senator Marshall well knows, has absolutely nothing to hide. The government believes that anything that the opposition would want to know about the achievements and performance of CSIRO can be achieved through the estimates proceedings.
Senator Troeth then went on to talk about what an important institution CSIRO is to Australia. I generally agree with all those following comments that Senator Troeth made. But, clearly, Senator Troeth does not understand the scope of the proposed inquiry that the opposition have put before the Senate. I should go through that, just for the record. I will not go through all the arguments that I made in my previous contribution. I will not delay the Senate in that respect. But, to put it into some perspective, we seek to inquire into the following:
The role and performance of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in the light of current Government policy, and the organisation’s attempts at refocusing its research endeavours, taking into account the following:
the evolving role of CSIRO as a public research institution, and the ability of CSIRO to initiate and manage change;
the challenge of commercialisation, enhancement of the CSIRO ‘brand’, and the dilemma of choosing a national or global approach to research development;
intellectual property concerns, including the rewarding of researchers;
managing competition in the research sector, including competition between public research bodies, between the CSIRO and the private research sector, and the obligation of CSIRO to cover the research spectrum; and
management culture within the CSIRO, including its corporate profile, communication performance and community engagement, and its capacity to instil a modern research culture and to recruit and retain research personnel.
Those terms of reference cannot be adequately covered in any meaningful way through the estimates questioning process. We cannot get a proper inquiry and answers to all those questions or do any sort of serious inquiry when we are questioning the hand-picked executives and the minister before an estimates committee. We would not be able to hear from the end users of the CSIRO institution; nor would we hear from the people who participate in the development of those roles. As I have just outlined, the terms of reference go well beyond the scope of anything that we would be able to uncover in estimates.
In conclusion, I say that the case has been well made. I am surprised that the government will not seek to assist the Senate in doing the very job that the Senate should do, and that is to inquire on a regular basis into Australia’s very important scientific institution. My understanding is that there has not been such an inquiry in the past. There should be one. It should be held accountable to the parliament. Simply because the executive arm of the government does not want an inquiry into those matters that I previously raised is no good reason for the government to use its numbers to stop such an inquiry.
The opposition will pursue the issues before us in various forms. Given the contributions of the minor parties today, it is obvious that they hold the issues to be very important and will also pursue them. The issues will not go away. We hope the government has a change of heart. I will continue to negotiate with the deputy chair of the references committee, Senator Troeth, to see if there is some ability in the future to conduct an amended form of inquiry that might meet with the satisfaction of the government. We believe it is necessary and, as I said, it is something we will continue to pursue. I certainly urge the Senate at this late stage to support the reference.
Question put:
That the motion (That the motion () be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,23,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-02-07,"—I rise today to wholeheartedly support this reference to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee of a full and thorough investigation of the research priorities of the CSIRO, how it is organised, how it is managed and what its management culture is. I have to say that there are many Australians who I am sure feel exactly as the Greens do. The CSIRO used to have a fantastic reputation around the world as a leading research institution, and as one that was independent. When the CSIRO worked on an issue, people felt quite proud of the work that was done. They felt that it was authentic and legitimate and that it was not driven by government policy and not biased in its outcomes.
Progressively, that has changed over the last 15 years as the government has cut back funding to this very important flagship research organisation, to the point where it now has to kowtow to government policy in relation to its response to climate change. We have seen the appalling announcement in the last week or so that the CSIRO is now virtually abandoning its work in renewable energy and cutting-edge technology and is going to focus on the government’s priorities—which are, of course, coal, coal, coal and coal. It is about the export of as much coal as possible to China, India and anywhere else. As long as it can pour fossil fuels into a global energy market, this government is determined to do that and to drive the CSIRO into being complicit in that arrangement.
They have actually put themselves in the position of saying that Australia’s contribution to attending to global warming will be to put as much government money as possible—which is effectively corporate welfare—into the coal industry to see if it can develop carbon capture and storage, otherwise known as geosequestration. It is completely unproven technology. What happens if it does not work? In 20 years time, we will be left with a far worse situation on greenhouse gases and more immediate outcomes in terms of climate change and less capacity to deal with them.
The world wants to get beyond a carbon economy. The world wants to get beyond fossil fuels. Australia had the capacity to do that. We have cutting-edge researchers in this country, particularly in solar energy and photovoltaics. We now have good research and good outcomes on the ground in terms of wind energy. We have seen the renewable sector in Australia start to blossom because of some incentives due to the mandatory renewable energy target, and now that has been left floundering at just two per cent. The investment in the renewable sector is drying up, and everyone in that sector acknowledges that it is because of the government abandoning an increase in the mandatory renewable energy target. That means that we are not attracting the money we need to invest into those technologies.
In the same week as the CSIRO announced that it is warming to coal research, its chief executive said:
... industry and consumers depended heavily on coal to fire electricity and that was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.
CSIRO’s deputy chief executive, Ron Sandland, said that we can have more impact by focusing more of our energies on clean coal. What a load of rubbish! They must have felt like washing their mouths out after they had said that because they know as well as I do that the future lies in cutting-edge renewable energy technology.
At the very same time, we have CSIRO scientists, having developed solar technology that they believe could replace coal fired power stations in 20 years, being forced to go overseas to tout for business. There was a UNEP conference in Dubai. They have just been there to tout for business and to seek partnerships with anyone they can get from overseas in order to commercialise the technology and to leapfrog coal. The biggest contribution Australia could make to the world would be to use our scientific expertise to leapfrog coal. That is what China needs, that is what India needs and that is what the whole world needs in order to deal with climate change. Whoever develops that technology will write its own cheques in terms of employment, investment in research, capability and so on. You only have to look at what has happened in Germany. Germany decided to get out of nuclear power. They had a proactive government policy and went straight into solar technology. In the last five years, Germany have had a huge expansion in solar. They are now a world leader in solar technology. They have eclipsed Australia in terms of research in solar and have created 25,000 jobs in solar alone. More jobs have been created in the solar industry in Germany in five years than are in the whole coal industry in Australia. And Japan is following suit.
Here are we, with some of the best research in the world, such as that which happens at the University of New South Wales, but also here at the CSIRO—
—Don’t forget the University of Adelaide.
—And Adelaide. All round the country there is excellent work being done in solar. As I said, the CSIRO developed the solar turbine technology at the Queensland Centre for Advanced Technology and we are now not going to be able to spend the money in Australia that we need to make sure that we get that technology right and get it commercialised and on the market.
It is about time that the Australian people had an opportunity, through a Senate inquiry, to have a really good look at what is happening with the CSIRO and to see how it has moved from being an organisation for all Australians that was recognised for doing public interest research—and public interest research is the key thing—to being virtually the puppet of government policy, begging industry for partnership money to try and get some of its project work up. As a result, almost all of this work is not in pure research but is designed for industry outcomes, not necessarily for public interest outcomes. That is what Australians will lament.
Look at the response from the agricultural community seeing the cutbacks in research to the agricultural sector. That, of course, was part of it. The CSIRO chiefs are trying to defend it by saying that they had consultation with industry groups when in fact the NFF and others are saying that they had virtually no consultation in relation to the strategic decisions about research in agriculture. So I think this is an extremely timely opportunity for this Senate committee to have a really good look at what is happening with the CSIRO. I certainly welcome that and I think people around Australia would certainly welcome that. It must be so demoralising for the scientists working in the CSIRO when they recognise that suddenly there are going to be substantial job losses from the current workforce and that the shift in research priorities is going to take us back and lock us into a future based on coal and not on innovation.
The government’s absolute pact with the coal industry means that it is actually costing Australia jobs in the long term. Whether Australia likes it or not, staying out of the Kyoto protocol will not make an iota of difference to the rest of the world community. They will move on. Carbon will have a price and when it does have a price all the externalities from fossil fuel generated energy and fossil fuel mining will come home to roost and the competitiveness of modern technologies will outstrip coal. Meanwhile, Australia will have locked itself in and hitched its wagon to an industrial age instead of getting beyond that into the tertiary industries sector that can take us into the future. The CSIRO moved into the Newcastle area to start looking at transitions into a green energy future. It has all come to nought as there is this concession that the CSIRO has to go to partnerships, that it has to go to industry for its money because it lacks funding from government.
We have seen the demolition, if you like, of the reputation of the CSIRO. I think it is incumbent on this parliament to restore the image of the CSIRO, to inject back into it the support of the parliament for increased funding for its futuristic objectives in climate change research. There should be an injection of support for the notion that the CSIRO belongs to all Australians and that it should undertake public interest research funded through the Commonwealth. We must stop this huge concession in our universities and in the CSIRO where we are losing some of our brightest young people to overseas research institutions where they can do public interest research, where they can pursue pure research for the sake of it instead of having to be locked into the priorities that industry set, which may or may not be the priorities for the future, the priorities for the country or the priorities for public interest. I am very passionate about seeing this research organisation put back on its feet to achieve the objectives people in Australia expect of the CSIRO. I congratulate the committee on bringing forward this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,23,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-02-07,"—I rise to support this reference of a matter to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee proposed by Senator Marshall. I believe that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, is an important institution that has played a critical role in developing and maintaining a culture of excellence in research and technological development in Australia. It has been central to the advancement of Australian industry and plays a fundamental role in ensuring the innovation that is critical to developing a place for Australia in the emerging knowledge economy.
If we are concerned about the future of our nation, if we want to look at developing beyond our economic reliance on exploiting our infinite primary resources and develop a more sustainable and value added economy, and if we want to maintain an international competitiveness then we need to take the issue of science and technology policy seriously and ensure that we are investing in both research and innovation and also fostering a culture of private investment in its development and application. We need both—public and private. The degree of excellence and expertise contained within CSIRO in research leadership makes it an essential and cost-effective part of our efforts to invest in national R&D.
If we are concerned about the long-term sustainability of Australia we need to be investing more in R&D and education and encouraging the development of new industries that make the most of Australia’s unique resources, expertise and position in the world. If we are concerned about the long-term sustainability of our environment we need to continue to back CSIRO’s world-leading research in environmental, ecological and agricultural science. CSIRO as a research institution has punched, in the past, well beyond its weight on the international stage. It is ranked in the top one per cent of world scientific institutions in 12 of the 22 research fields. For example, it is ranked sixth worldwide in plant and animal science and in agricultural science. It is ranked eighth in environmental and ecological science. It is a partner in international research activities in more than 85 countries in over 740 ongoing international collaborative research projects. At present it is the largest employer of scientists in Australia and the role that it plays in supporting professional development is critical in maintaining our R&D capacity and in keeping our technological edge. Through a pivotal role CSIRO plays in industry partnerships such as the cooperative research programs, commonly known as CRCs, it plays a catalytic role in the development of new industries and technologies.
I am concerned that funding for Australian R&D in general, and for CSIRO in particular, is not keeping up with the needs for the development of our future economy. I am concerned that the need to balance restricted funding is forcing CSIRO to make bad decisions as it attempts to balance the need for ongoing R&D programs and areas of excellence with the need to develop into new areas of innovation. With limited resources and increasing demands, something has to give. The need to balance these tensions and the culture of research leadership was clearly demonstrated by the recent strategic planning process that CSIRO has undergone. This has led, on one hand, to the identification of six national research flagships and a four-stage plan to take CSIRO up to 2012. On the other hand, the need to develop new areas on limited and diminishing resources has meant some difficult decisions have had to be made, including the announcement of significant job cuts in some established areas.
The budgetary problems were highlighted during estimates, with indications that CSIRO has sought permission to run a $14.5 million budget deficit in 2005-06. Then we heard late last year the announcement of 200 jobs being cut in research support areas with the potential for up to 400 positions going. We have heard talk of a brain drain, with a number of brilliant researchers recently being made redundant on very short notice. These include international climate expert Dr Graeme Pearman, leading wildlife ecologist Dr Jeff Short and federal pest control expert Dr Roger Pech. All are leaders in their field, undertaking high-quality research of truly national significance.
Now we have just had the release of the research investment direction paper. We are hearing more signals of job losses and funding cuts to agriculture, manufacturing and renewable energy. There have been rumblings from a number of areas that increased emphasis on external earnings has meant that more time is being spent chasing money than undertaking research and there is a move from doing public good research to being a client-driven research consultancy. The research investment direction paper confirms the real impact that the need to chase external funding is having. Quite simply, the philosophy of ‘partner or perish’ means in practice going where the money is rather than pursuing Australian innovation.
CSIRO no longer has the luxury of being able to think strategically or to plan for the long term because of the imperative to chase external funding to make up for the shortfall in government appropriations. Despite the rhetoric about the Australian economy being in transition from extractive industries towards those based on knowledge, technology and innovation, the new focus in the new paper is on mining, mineral resource development and clean coal. We are going back to Australia as the international mine. At a time when we should be building our future and making the most of our diminishing technological edge, CSIRO is being forced by the short-sightedness of government priorities to hitch its wagon to the fate of 20th-century energy dinosaurs, abandoning its lead in renewable energy. Once again, as reported just recently in the Canberra Times, the developers of the next innovation in solar energy are having to go overseas for funding. How many times has Australia lost major innovations and the major leading edge in industry because we have not been able to find finance in this country?
Make no mistake: as we are all aware, our neighbours know that the future is in building technology and are investing heavily in building knowledge based industries. Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea and China are all focusing heavily on building their capacity and producing science and engineering graduates. Our government’s inability to provide a supportive and nurturing environment for science and scientists in our universities and premier research institutions paints an unenticing picture for our school leavers contemplating a career in science or in engineering. CSIRO’s latest transformation has all the hallmarks of an inability to listen to the scientific community and a failure to take a long-term visionary approach to Australia’s research and development strategies. It is based on a naive belief that a growing reliance on private sector funding will not have adverse impacts on our research capacities. At the very same time CSIRO’s value as rated by its external investors has decreased steadily over the past year. The very people it is chasing for more money are saying that they feel that they are getting fewer bangs for their buck.
Government expenditure levels on R&D are at their lowest levels for 25 years as a percentage of GDP. There is no sign of a nation that is powering forward. Not only are our government’s social policies taking us back to the 1950s; their science policies are heading back that way too. Science once had a world-class institution in climate change research. According to climate experts it is now falling so far behind that it is not even on the international radar. Management is so caught up with lapping up the propaganda of the coal industry about how good the new clean coal is going to be that it has all but abandoned its vision for a new national energy model based on distributed renewable energies and sources. Energy efficiency technologies and demand reduction strategies have dropped off the scope just like our climate change commitments. Rather than pursuing, as has been reported extensively in the past, big hairy audacious goals—as CSIRO’s then new chief executive urged a few years back—researchers are now being urged to follow the big hairy mining industry and coal executives to hit them up for a few extra bucks.
All these factors are raising very real concerns in the R&D sphere and in the public arena about management and culture within CSIRO. CSIRO is an important national institution which has played a critical role in developing and maintaining a culture of excellence in research and technology development within Australia. I believe that there are very good reasons for us as a Senate to look at the evolving role of CSIRO, its place in the wider issues of competition and collaboration in the research sector, the challenges of R&D commercialisation, the management and exploitation of intellectual property and the wider culture of research and development within Australia. If Australia is to maintain its leading edge in technological development and innovation, it is critical that we have a strong CSIRO. That is not the way, unfortunately, that our national research organisation is heading. It is a tragedy for this country, one that I believe needs to be averted and one that this Senate needs to take a careful and close look at so that we can reverse this unfortunate trend.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,23,2
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-02-07,"—This feels a bit like Groundhog Day, because I believe we were due to deal with the issue of referring the CSIRO’s role and responsibilities to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee last year. I preface my remarks with one of the concerns that I and others have raised in this place, and that is that there is a perception—and I think the numbers back it—of a diminishing number of references to committees. I guess it reflects a general concern that the committee system in the Senate has not been used in the way that was originally intended in this place. That is, proposals for committee references have been quashed. Certainly that was the case towards the end of last year. I hope the government is prepared to allow and support this committee reference, not only because it is a legitimate committee reference but because this is, I think, the bread-and-butter work of committees and the Senate. Indeed, this is an obvious reference for a committee such as the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee.
The Australian Democrats do support this reference. We believe there is a critical need for the role and the performance of the CSIRO to be referred to the committee for inquiry. As other speakers in this debate have mentioned, the CSIRO’s recently released research priorities for 2006-07 give some indication of the direction that the CSIRO appears to be taking. There are elements of that proposed direction that are cause for concern. I acknowledge that the CSIRO faces the challenge of balancing long-term research that is to the public benefit with the imperatives of commercialisation. The CSIRO’s internal mantra—that notion of ‘partner or perish’—provides us with a telling indication of the impetus for the CSIRO to pursue funding from private sources to augment the inadequate government funding it receives. A consequence of this need for CSIRO to engage with business is that many CSIRO scientists’ expertise is being used for private consultancies, to the detriment of their own research work.
The 2006-07 research priorities signal a change in research focus. The increased focus on advanced materials, including polymeric materials, has been welcomed by scientists. Another new research focus—the development of the water resources observation network, designed to give a national view of our current water situation and predictions for the future, along with ideas on maximising water use—has also been welcomed by scientists. We recognise that some of those research priorities have been warmly received.
Not so welcome, however, is the shift from renewable energy to clean coal technology, with CSIRO explaining, ‘We should reduce our effort in renewable energy restricting our activities to those in which we have a competitive advantage and can have significant impact.’ This dumping of critical research which would be of much public benefit is of great concern—and you have heard comments in this place today from a number of parties reflecting that concern—particularly, and obviously, at a time when we are experiencing the frightening impact of climate change thanks to excessive greenhouse gas emissions.
A recent report from the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Medical Association predicted 8,000 to 15,000 Australian deaths every year by the end of the century as a result of heat related illnesses if greenhouse gas emissions are not dramatically reduced. Australia once did have a competitive advantage in renewable energy back in the 1980s and 1990s. In fact, Australia’s research into renewable energy was on the international cutting edge—thanks in part, of course, to the CSIRO. I wonder why this critical area of research has been neglected or at least diminished when it is clearly needed now. And, given that Australia has the world’s highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita and that the threat of climate change is already impacting upon us, the CSIRO could have a huge impact in this area with its potentially groundbreaking research. Instead, the CSIRO appears to be bowing to the influence of coal powered energy. CSIRO’s chief executive has been reported as saying that, like it or not, industry and consumers remained heavily dependent on coal to fire electricity and that reality was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. So the CSIRO will shift its focus to low greenhouse emission so-called ‘clean’ coal.
Surely, as the nation’s peak science body, the CSIRO has an obligation to pursue scientific developments, such as renewable energy, that stand to benefit the public good. This has been one of the great factors of the CSIRO as an institution: its recognition that public good is integral to the work that it does. The CSIRO should be leading the way in conducting innovative research to develop renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While some of CSIRO’s research priorities for 2006-07 show innovation and indeed forward thinking and will help the agency to stay ahead of the times, emphasising our reliance on fossil fuels will not. If the CSIRO does not conduct this kind of critical research, we cannot rely on private companies to do it.
We should not be too surprised, however, at the CSIRO’s change in research direction. It is clearly responding to the demands of industry as opposed to research in the interest of the public good. The CSIRO has diminished government investment. For some years, government funds for the CSIRO have been waning in real terms. The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies reported that, over the past six years, the CSIRO’s share of Commonwealth investment in research and development declined from 12.4 per cent to 10.7 per cent. Indeed, government spending on research and development is at its lowest level for 25 years as a percentage of GDP.
This need to scramble for funding has resulted in the flagging of job losses to conserve money. This is a likely outcome of the 2006-07 priorities. I acknowledge that Senator Siewert made reference to job losses or impending job losses, including specific people who have gone from the agency. In the past few years, there has been a dramatic loss from the CSIRO of many highly regarded scientists. These include climate change expert Dr Graeme Pearman, wildlife ecologist Dr Jeff Short and ecologist and feral pest control researcher Dr Roger Pech, who have been made redundant. This loss of experience and knowledge can only further erode the CSIRO’s reputation as a research body, and I think the reasons CSIRO saw fit to make these three redundant warrant investigation.
Meanwhile, the CSIRO strategic plan, including the six research ‘flagships’ launched three years ago, has not been the economic boon that was expected. In fact, the CSIRO had a $9.2 million deficit in its most recent annual report and has a projected deficit of $14.5 million for the 2005-06 financial year. Given that the flagship program attracted a large injection of federal funding and the research priorities for 2006-07 include an increase of funding for the flagship program of 24 per cent from 2005-06, its role in the CSIRO’s budget deficit must be placed under rigorous scrutiny. A Senate inquiry is an opportunity to do that.
CSIRO research is in danger of being compromised by the need for it to ‘partner or perish’—this mantra. The drive to secure external funding to supplement its government funding is threatening the reputation of the CSIRO’s research. Perhaps the same argument could be launched for a number of our key, innovative education institutions. That scramble for funding, that desperate need for funding, in order to make up for government shortfalls does have an impact on quality and on the way the institution is regarded.
The nature of the CSIRO’s role in Australia seems to have been lost in the scramble for funding, be it public or external. The science agency is stuck between a rock and a hard place, trying to maintain its reputation as a source of quality research for the public’s interest, while operating in many instances as a private consulting agency. Some of the CSIRO’s research priorities for 2006-07 add further impetus to the call for an inquiry to examine some of the concerns that have been outlined by people in the chamber today and some of the concerns that I have noted. An inquiry must be conducted before the situation at the CSIRO worsens and its reputation is potentially irreparably damaged. The amount of public investment in the CSIRO over the years and its groundbreaking work, its innovative work, must not be compromised. It must not be lost. This is an excellent opportunity for the Senate to play a role in ensuring that that is not the case—that is, to ensure that there is rigorous scrutiny of some of the decisions that have been made and to look at the funding imperatives for the CSIRO in the present and the future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,23,2
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-02-07,"—If no other senators are seeking the call, I will close the debate and make a few brief comments. I thank Senators Carr and Stephens for their contribution in supporting this reference last year. The debate has been interrupted by the Christmas break. I thank Senators Milne, Siewert and Stott Despoja for their contributions today in support of the reference. All the senators have made different contributions. Each one of them has in fact made the case for this reference, this inquiry into the CSIRO. Collectively the case has been well made and it is worthy of support.
Senator Troeth’s was the only opposing voice to this reference. I want to briefly respond to the reasons Senator Troeth gave on behalf of the government for not allowing this reference or for voting against it. The reference will clearly be blocked without government support, the government having the numbers in the Senate. I will quote from Hansard. Senator Troeth said:
The government, in relation to CSIRO’s performance, as Senator Marshall well knows, has absolutely nothing to hide. The government believes that anything that the opposition would want to know about the achievements and performance of CSIRO can be achieved through the estimates proceedings.
Senator Troeth then went on to talk about what an important institution CSIRO is to Australia. I generally agree with all those following comments that Senator Troeth made. But, clearly, Senator Troeth does not understand the scope of the proposed inquiry that the opposition have put before the Senate. I should go through that, just for the record. I will not go through all the arguments that I made in my previous contribution. I will not delay the Senate in that respect. But, to put it into some perspective, we seek to inquire into the following:
The role and performance of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in the light of current Government policy, and the organisation’s attempts at refocusing its research endeavours, taking into account the following:
the evolving role of CSIRO as a public research institution, and the ability of CSIRO to initiate and manage change;
the challenge of commercialisation, enhancement of the CSIRO ‘brand’, and the dilemma of choosing a national or global approach to research development;
intellectual property concerns, including the rewarding of researchers;
managing competition in the research sector, including competition between public research bodies, between the CSIRO and the private research sector, and the obligation of CSIRO to cover the research spectrum; and
management culture within the CSIRO, including its corporate profile, communication performance and community engagement, and its capacity to instil a modern research culture and to recruit and retain research personnel.
Those terms of reference cannot be adequately covered in any meaningful way through the estimates questioning process. We cannot get a proper inquiry and answers to all those questions or do any sort of serious inquiry when we are questioning the hand-picked executives and the minister before an estimates committee. We would not be able to hear from the end users of the CSIRO institution; nor would we hear from the people who participate in the development of those roles. As I have just outlined, the terms of reference go well beyond the scope of anything that we would be able to uncover in estimates.
In conclusion, I say that the case has been well made. I am surprised that the government will not seek to assist the Senate in doing the very job that the Senate should do, and that is to inquire on a regular basis into Australia’s very important scientific institution. My understanding is that there has not been such an inquiry in the past. There should be one. It should be held accountable to the parliament. Simply because the executive arm of the government does not want an inquiry into those matters that I previously raised is no good reason for the government to use its numbers to stop such an inquiry.
The opposition will pursue the issues before us in various forms. Given the contributions of the minor parties today, it is obvious that they hold the issues to be very important and will also pursue them. The issues will not go away. We hope the government has a change of heart. I will continue to negotiate with the deputy chair of the references committee, Senator Troeth, to see if there is some ability in the future to conduct an amended form of inquiry that might meet with the satisfaction of the government. We believe it is necessary and, as I said, it is something we will continue to pursue. I certainly urge the Senate at this late stage to support the reference.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-02-07,"—I continue my remarks on the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 and point out that there has been a multitude of climate records broken in 2005 which starkly illustrate how global warming is already affecting many parts of the planet. Despite the fact that reducing wasteful energy is the cheapest and quickest way to address global warming and make Australia more competitive, unless companies are required to implement savings there is no incentive for them to change and the vast majority will continue to ignore efficiency in favour of quick bucks elsewhere.
The library’s Bills Digest notes that the Warren Centre study found that total energy consumption for Australia is 3,000 petajoules per annum and is estimated to cost $A40 billion annually. Industrial energy consumption is 40 per cent of that, giving an energy bill of $16 billion a year. Although many firms are achieving impressive economic returns by using energy more efficiently, numerous studies continue to point out that there is significant potential for doing better. In fact, experience in Australia and overseas has demonstrated that it is possible to save 10 to 15 per cent of this over a five-year program. Such savings would result in reduced costs of up to $2 billion a year, strengthening Australian industry and making it more competitive in world markets. But it requires investment in infrastructure to do so. Business needs to be actively encouraged to achieve these targets, or else there is no guarantee that Australia will achieve them.
The Democrats note that the Victorian government has conducted a program for greenhouse gas emission and energy efficiency in industry. Unlike the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program that we are discussing in this bill, the Victorian program requires certain operations that operate under the Victorian Environment Protection Agency statutory approvals to examine and implement measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse emissions. Victorian companies will achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions of approximately 1.15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.
So it seems odd that the government would require business to undergo a cost based exercise to identify potential measures to improve energy efficiency and then not have some expectation that businesses should implement them. Presumably the government is assuming here that business is just ignorant and that it has not thought about energy efficiency or the prospect of saving energy and that if it did think about it it would see the light. I think that is rather insulting and also a little naive. It is also quite unlikely. Even the Energy Users Association, who in its submission opposed legislative non-commercial obligations on large users, recognises that implementation is critical and suggested that an incentive should be provided to implement opportunities identified by the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program.
As noted in our minority report to this bill, a viable approach the government could take is to require business and the Australian Greenhouse Office to reach an agreement on individual binding targets as a way of ensuring that measures are introduced. Individual binding agreements would provide the flexibility to take into account business circumstances. The Democrats are disappointed that this program does not do this, and also that it only extends to roughly 250 companies. While ABS data suggest that the 250 large energy users account for 80 per cent of energy used by business in Australia, this is no reason—in our view—why we should not be targeting all of business; clearly the imperative is there to do so.
Before I turn to the ALP’s second reading amendment, I would like to briefly express concerns on behalf of the Democrats at the failure of the minister to take into account a number of the recommendations made by the majority government report to the Senate inquiry into this bill. The bill provides for the enactment of unspecified regulations and, potentially, for unspecified and unlimited additions to the regulations in the future. In our minority report, the Democrats urged the government to either delay the passage of the bill until regulations were drafted and appropriate consultation and scrutiny had occurred or, as the majority report recommended, include this information in the statute itself. We are disappointed that neither of those recommendations has been taken up. Also put aside were concerns about the lack of safeguards with respect to the exercise of power under part 8. Again, concerns were ignored. The failure of the government to implement recommendations made by its own members is concerning although perhaps consistent with a government that has the numbers.
Turning to the ALP’s second reading amendment, I would like to put on the record our support for that amendment. As Labor points out, more needs to be done to introduce energy efficiency in all sectors of the community and to encourage greater use of and access to alternatives fuels and renewable energies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has indicated that, to stabilise the earth’s climate, we need to cut emissions by between 50 per cent and 60 per cent from ‘business as usual’ by the end of the century. Australia’s chief scientist recommends that Australia cut its greenhouse emissions by 80 per cent by the end of the same period.
In May 2001, the Democrat-chaired inquiry report entitled The heat is on: Australia’s greenhouse future reported on the progress and adequacy of the Australian government’s policies to reduce global warming. The report was critical of the lack of action to date and made 106 recommendations in the areas of transport, emissions trading, carbon and the land, energy use and supply, climate change and Kyoto. Three years later, the government released its energy white paper, which set out the government’s strategy for Australia’s future energy development, or lack of it. As with white papers in general, it was a declaration of intent, or a blueprint, on how future energy goals will be met. However, it did not contain effective planning for the future needs of the Australian community in energy supply. It did not contain anything that will deal with greenhouse gas emission reductions, especially on the sort of scale required, or with alternative renewable energy development. Specifically, it argued that energy related emissions are increasing at an alarming rate, yet there are no express policies in the white paper that will address this issue and rein in emissions. The report made a small number of achievable recommendations none of which, again, have been implemented.
Four months later, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage tabled a bipartisan report on sustainable cities, outlining 32 recommendations covering such themes as transport, water, building design and management and energy research and development, but, again, the government has yet to adopt any of those measures. So, rather than heed the warnings, this government is embarking on a go-slow strategy with a ‘she’ll be right’ attitude, which is leaving many scientists and environmentalists perplexed. Let’s talk about what needs to be done and set about doing it.
The recent announcement by the CSIRO that it will have a greater focus on cleaner coal-friendly technologies at the expense of renewable energy research is alarming, as is the report I read this morning, Minister Campbell, about your delay in supporting a number of wind farms around the country—one is at Bald Hills in Victoria—under the EPBC. The government is not using the EPBC to protect the environment, except when it comes to renewable energy projects it seems. The so-called alternative to Kyoto is a farce. The six-country Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is focused on developing cleaner methods of power using the world’s existing coal resources. The only aim, as we all know, is to prop up the coal industry to protect our export dollars. But, at the end of the day, the world are not going to want our coal; they are not going to be able to use it if there are sensible measures in place to get massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Minister Nelson recently announced that he wants to see the government investigate nuclear power generation in Australia, knowing that nuclear power production results in very substantial greenhouse emissions—much more than with renewable energy. I think it is a great shame that this government has failed to urgently act in the face of overwhelming evidence, upon the presentation of achievable solutions that are very well thought through, and upon very carefully considered and articulated suggestions that have been made in at least three reports that I have mentioned, which have been ignored. It is time, we say, for the government to act to protect Australian citizens from economic and environmental disaster that we are facing as a result of climate change. We call on the government to make the 2006 budget about the future of Australians and Australia, and to invest in energy efficiency schemes, renewable energy, water and so many more areas in which energy efficiency can be found.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-02-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a review by the Legislation Review Committee of the Research Involving Human Embryos Act and the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act, often known colloquially as the stem cell legislation. That legislation passed through this chamber in 2002 by way of a conscience vote. I think it was the last chamber-wide conscience vote we had. This review was tabled back in December.
Firstly, I want to note the very tragic passing of the chair of that committee, Mr John Lockhart, who died not long after the report was presented. That is certainly a great loss and I acknowledge his contribution not just in this report, of course, which was probably the very last major piece of public work he performed, but also his significant contribution in many other areas.
It is a very comprehensive report. I cannot speak to it in detail in five minutes. It goes for 250 pages and it deals with some very complex and controversial issues. As we recall, the stem cell debate in this chamber those few years ago was controversial, and it shows the value of this process. I understand that the process itself is a requirement of the act and I am fairly sure it is a requirement that was placed in there as a result of an amendment moved by my Democrat colleague Senator Stott Despoja and Senator McLucas, who moved a number of joint amendments to improve that legislation.
There is a lot about this debate that is misunderstood, not surprisingly because the science is so detailed and complex. Certainly I do not profess to have a full understanding of it, but I recommend that people and senators that have an interest in this topic try to peruse this report. I think it is available online as well. The report does attempt to present the concepts and the issues in as accessible a way as possible given the complexity of some of the science. I note that despite some of the controversy in this area there was consensus in some aspects, and the committee heard strong agreement between all groups that human reproductive cloning should continue to be prohibited on ethical grounds. That was clearly strongly recommended by the committee. The committee also recommended that the use of embryos created by methods not involving fertilisation of eggs by sperm for reproductive purposes should remain prohibited. They also recommended continuing the prohibition of placing any human embryo into an animal or the body of a human apart from in a woman’s reproductive tract or placing a human embryo into the body of a human for any period of gestation.
It is important to emphasise the commonality of view in maintaining those prohibitions. Where there was some controversy was in the recommendations dealing with the approval of creating human embryos by methods of somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate embryonic stem cells not for the purposes of reproduction but for the purpose of generating stem cells. That is sometimes called therapeutic cloning and therefore people think we are allowing cloning and that is terrible. It is not reproductive cloning; there is a clear distinction. The report recommends that distinction and I think that debate should be had on face value and not confused. There is a clear prohibition on reproductive cloning and it is recommended that that continue, but the other method of creating embryos for the purpose of generating embryonic stem cells is a different issue.
I believe this is an important debate that needs to be advanced and considered in a measured away. I urge the government to respond to this report in that way and do so as promptly as possible. Given the complexity and importance of the issues we cannot expect an instant response but I do hope that they maintain the momentum on this. I know that there are a number within the government who are supportive of what the committee has put forward but there are some who are not. We need to keep the momentum going and get a strong response quickly and keep the necessary developments in this important area of research continuing.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-02-07,"—I acknowledge the contributions of my colleague Senator Andrew Bartlett on this particular report. It is a report that I have certainly commented on publicly on behalf of the Democrats but this is the first opportunity to comment on the finished reports in the parliamentary sphere. I also want to add my condolences to the family of the former Federal Court judge, the Hon. John Lockhart AO QC. Unfortunately, he died on Friday, 13 January this year, so soon after the completion of this committee’s reports and their recommendations. I want to pay a tribute to Mr Lockhart for his general contributions to Australian life and the legal world, but in particular for his work and contribution to what was quickly dubbed the Lockhart review.
The reports that this committee produced are a comprehensive and innovative review of our laws governing stem cell research and cloning. They contain insightful recommendations and have been welcomed by many—in particular, those in the scientific and research communities. I do note the respect and esteem in which Mr Lockhart was held by the review committee members and, indeed, the wider scientific committee. All members of the Lockhart legislative review committee deserve our thanks for their time and their commitment in conducting the review. We all wait for a response from the government and I hope that we do not have to wait too long for that.
Many people in their submissions revealed their frustration particularly those with diseases or disabilities who desperately hope that our laws will be relaxed to allow the exploration of stem cell technology including somatic cell nuclear transfer or SCNT. One of the committee’s 54 recommendations was that somatic cell nuclear transfer be allowed so that Australian scientists can explore the potential benefits of this technology in treating a number of conditions and diseases from Parkinson’s to spinal injuries. Indeed, one of the recommendations to which my colleague referred was in fact the establishment of a stem cell bank and, yes, it was an amendment moved jointly by Senator McLucas and me back in 2002 to that legislation that called for investigation into the applicability of the establishment of a national stem cell bank in this country. I am happy to see that the committee recognised the importance of this concept and recommended its establishment to give researchers access to stem cell lines as well as to expert advice.
The Lockhart panel also strongly recommended public education to improve the community’s understanding of research and stem cell work as well as ART research generally. While there is a degree of public knowledge and support out there, there is a lot more work that could be done. I strongly supported the 2002 legislation, in particular the research involving the embryos act which regulates the use of excess assisted reproductive technology embryos in research. As well, of course, I supported the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act 2002. I believed then as I do now that there are sound reasons to encourage research that may alleviate disease, and that there is an intrinsic value in understanding biological processes such as cell differentiation and regeneration independently of whether or not it yields direct medical applications, and also that a national sound, consistent regulatory framework is required to provide publicly accountable oversight of research on excess ART embryos that otherwise would be allowed to succumb.
Nonetheless, our current regulation is quite conservative in comparison to many other countries, particularly the UK, Israel, Singapore and certainly the US, if you look at private funding which allows so-called therapeutic cloning. I hope that the government will look realistically at these recommendations and I strongly urge them to consider not only responding positively but bringing in legislation to this parliament that will relax legislation to a degree so that we can keep up with the rest of the world in this extraordinary field of science and technology. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-02-07,"—I rise tonight to talk about the recent elections held in Canada. Canada as a nation has a lot in common with Australia. We are both Commonwealth countries, we are both physically large countries with relatively small populations and we are both nations comprised primarily of immigrants. However, one area where we have differed over the last decade is that Australia has been governed by a centre-right government whereas Canada has been governed by the centre-left Liberal Party.
The twenty-third of January 2006 saw Canadians elect a minority Conservative government for the first time in 13 years. This is especially remarkable when you consider that, in the 1993 elections, the Progressive Conservatives were reduced to two seats in a 295-seat legislature. One thing to note immediately here is the volatility displayed by the Canadian electorate. I believe this massive swing highlights one of the differences between the Australian and Canadian electorates. I do not believe Australia would ever dump a government quite so harshly, and likewise neither would a party recover so quickly from such a rejection. Electorate volatility is nevertheless still an issue for Australia and is certainly one of the lessons to be learned from Canada.
The leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and new Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, is an economist who has spent most of his life in politics. At 47, he will be one of the youngest Prime Ministers Canada has ever had. I would like to make some comments tonight about his political career and make a few observations about Canadian politics in general.
Stephen Harper was born in 1959 in Toronto. He moved to Alberta in Western Canada, and he received his BA in Economics from the University of Calgary in 1985. He then received his MA in 1991. Elected as the Member for Calgary West in 1993, Mr Harper has been involved with centre-right parties for his entire political career. He started his career as an MP with the Reform Party of Canada but left the party in 1997, when he declined to stand for re-election.
In 2002 he was elected as the Member for Calgary Southwest, as the leader of the Canadian Alliance Party. He oversaw the merger of the Canadian Alliance Party with the Progressive Conservatives in 2003 to form the Conservative Party of Canada. This merger ameliorated the vote-splitting effects of having two major centre-right parties. In the 2004 general election the Conservatives increased their percentage of the vote by nearly 10 per cent.
The year 2005 saw the Martin Liberal government finally undone by the Adscam corruption scandal. The Canadian federal government ran a ‘sponsorship program’ from 1996 to 2004 in the province of Quebec, ostensibly to promote Canadian patriotism to counter Quebecois separatism. Advertising companies that secured government contracts paid kickbacks to the Liberal Party in Canada. This disgrace that came to light in early 2004. The scandal, however, was not enough to convince voters to dump the Liberals in the 2004 general elections. In fact, the Liberals ran an effective scare campaign against the Conservatives’ so-called hidden agenda, insisting that Mr Harper would transform Canada into ‘North Texas’.
The 2004 election saw the Conservatives make some gains and cost the Liberals majority government. They were able to form minority government but continued to be dogged by the sponsorship scandal and internal unity issues. On 28 November 2005, the House of Commons passed a vote of no confidence in the Liberal government of Paul Martin. All three opposition parties—the Conservatives, the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party—voted for the motion.
Before I speak about the 2006 election, let me speak for a moment about Canada’s main political parties. The Conservatives and the Liberals make up the traditional centre-right/centre-left pairing common to most liberal democracies. The New Democratic Party, or NDP, holds a third-party role equivalent to somewhere between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens. They are certainly to the left of the Liberals, differing mainly on fiscal policy. The Bloc Quebecois’s main platform is the secession of Quebec from Canada. They are essentially a one-platform party, but formed Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition in the years after 1993 when the Conservatives held only a handful of seats. Generally centre-left on social and fiscal policy, they consistently gain just shy of 50 per cent of the vote in the province of Quebec.
As I mentioned earlier, the 2006 general election saw the Conservatives win minority government. Specifically, the Conservatives won 124 seats, with 36.3 per cent of the vote; the Liberals, 103 seats; the Bloc, 51; and the NDP, 29; with one independent rounding out the tally. This result, whilst giving the Conservatives government, puts Mr Harper in a tricky position. He has no natural allies in parliament, so any legislation that passes will have to be amended to meet with the approval of at least one of the opposition parties. Mr Harper has announced to parliament his intentions for the new government, which include combating the aforementioned government corruption, tax cuts, toughening up the criminal justice system and working more closely with the provinces.
What is perhaps most interesting for Australians about this election are the comparisons between Mr Harper and our own Prime Minister. Followers of Canadian politics are calling for Mr Harper to emulate John Howard—not Ronald Reagan, not Margaret Thatcher, not George W Bush and not David Cameron but John Howard. Howardism, they say, combines self-confidence and awareness with a keen understanding of the politically possible. It will be interesting to see how Mr Harper and the Conservatives do in government and how they tackle the many challenges ahead. I wish them well and look forward to following Canada’s progress.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Canada</title>,Adjournment,26,1
