Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (10:08):  I rise to speak on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 6) Bill 2015. Labor will be supporting this bill. This bill seeks to enact two tax changes announced by the former Labor government, and Labor, as we have said throughout this entire process and for the past few years, are always supportive of sensible measures which tighten the country's tax net without harming vulnerable Australians.


In government Labor pursued significant changes to Australia's tax laws to reduce regulatory burden, ensure the tax system is keeping pace with the increasingly global nature of business and ensure that everyone pays their fair share. First we had the Abbott government, and now the Turnbull government—there has been a lot of talk around tax reform, there has been a lot of debate, there has been a lot of discussion, but there have not been any real concrete proposals for us to be able to debate and for us to be able to explore. What we have actually had in the space of a proper tax debate in this country has been a lot of rhetoric. Most recently, we saw a situation where the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, had everything on the table, but now, increasingly, things are being taken off the table. Where there was a lot of discussion around whether or not there was going to be some kind of GST or some kind of major piece of tax reform, that appears to not be happening. There was talk about the tax white paper—a whole lot of effort, a whole lot of work, a whole lot of money went into the production of that, and that is now off the table. Instead, when we talk about tax reform in this country we have the legacy of these bills that are measures that were discussed and raised by the last Labor government first.


There are two parts to this bill, and I want to touch on them very briefly. Schedule 1 amends the treatment of earnout rights associated with the sale of a business to allow the holder to defer their capital gains tax liability until the accurate financial value of those rights are known. Again, this measure was announced in the 2010-11 budget. An earnout arrangement is a sale or purchase of an asset where the consideration includes a right to future financial benefits linked to the performance of the asset. For example, a standard earnout may involve an upfront payment for the sale, with the seller having a right to future payments that are contingent on the business's performance. Earnout arrangements are a legitimate and efficient way of structuring the sale of a business or business assets to deal with uncertainty about its value.


Under the ATO's current administration of the law, each earnout right is a separate and distinct asset from the underlying business and its market value must be estimated for CGT purposes. The complexity involved in this system affects the ability of businesses to efficiently price their business assets. This bill will result in any payments made under the earnout right being added to the capital proceeds, or the cost base of the original sale, through amendments to the taxpayer's tax return at that time.


Schedule 2 introduces a new withholding tax requirement for those purchasing Australian property from foreign residents. Purchasers will be required to withhold 10 per cent of the purchase price and pay this to the Commissioner of Taxation to assist in meeting the foreign resident's capital gains tax obligation. Foreign residents are liable to pay tax on capital gains when they dispose of certain Australian assets—broadly direct and indirect interests in real property. The ATO has indicated that voluntary compliance with Australia's foreign resident CGT regime is poor.


Under this measure, from 1 July 2016, where the seller of certain Australian assets is a foreign resident, the buyer will be required to withhold and pay to the ATO 10 per cent of the purchase price. The amount collected is an estimate of the vendor's final income tax liability. The vendor is still required to lodge an income tax return and pay any outstanding debt. They may claim a credit for the amount of tax withheld in the income tax return at this time. In this way, the withholding measure also encourages participation and engagement by foreign residents with the ATO. To ensure that this measure is appropriately targeted at those areas where revenue is at greatest risk, and minimises the impact on other property transactions, the measure does not apply to direct real property transactions below $2 million.


As I said earlier, this is a piece of legislation that Labor intends to support. It relates to measures and budget measures that were raised and introduced and discussed by the previous government. I think it is disappointing that when it comes to tax reform and tax debate in this country, into the third year of the Abbott-Turnbull government, we are still only dealing with a handful of legacy items and tax reform proposals that were presented by the former Labor government. That being said, on its merits, this is a bill that warrants our support and Labor will be supporting it.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-02-22,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:14):  When we debated the fifth tax bill of 2015 last December, I sang about the five tax bills of Christmas my Treasurer sent to me. If you recall, the five bills delivered more FBT, more CGT, seafarer's tax, slower deductions and a tax on the elderly. Well today we are debating the sixth tax bill of 2015, which suggests I should sing something that sounds like 'six geese a laying'. But I cannot, because with this bill the government is killing the golden goose.


Australia's prosperity is built on foreign investment, but with this bill the government makes it abundantly clear that foreign investment is no longer welcome in this country. The bill imposes a tax on Australians who purchase Australian land, plant and equipment from foreigners unless those foreigners have obtained a certificate from the tax office. It is like requiring a note from the headmaster. This will have the obvious effect of discouraging foreigners from purchasing Australian land, plant and equipment in the first place.


The government justifies its new tax by complaining that it is difficult to get foreigners to pay capital gains tax when they sell Australian land, plant and equipment. But foreigners are already exempt from capital gains tax when they sell other Australian assets, like shares. And such exemptions help Australians. If you tax the returns of foreign investors you simply drive up the returns that foreign investors demand when they invest in Australia. Australian businesses face a higher cost of capital as a result, and business expansion is stifled. It is for this reason that successive governments have reduced taxes on interest and dividend payments to foreign investors. But now we see a new tax on payments to foreign investors—a tax that pleases the xenophobes, but hurts Australians. And a tax that sets out to rake in the revenue when the Treasurer says he is focused on cutting spending.


The solution is the exact opposite of what this bill aims to achieve. The solution is to exempt foreigners from capital gains tax when they sell Australian land, plant and equipment. The art of taxation is said to consist of plucking the goose to obtain the maximum amount of feathers with the smallest amount of hissing. But we are not plucking the goose; we are strangling it because it flew in from overseas.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (10:17):  I thank colleagues for their contribution to the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2015 Measures No. 6) Bill debate. As has been canvassed, the bill does make two important changes to improve the operation of Australia's capital gains tax regime. Schedule 1 to the bill clarifies the treatment of earnout arrangements by making any payments under the arrangement part of the original value of the business or business asset for capital gains tax purposes in lieu of applying capital gains tax to the right itself—try saying that three times quickly, Mr President!


An earnout arrangement involves a sale or purchase of an asset with a right to future financial benefits linked to the performance of the asset. Earnout arrangements create flexibility for purchasers and sellers of business assets, especially where the value of the underlying asset is uncertain; however, the current system has significant complexities which affect the ability of businesses to efficiently price their business assets. This measure will result in any payments made under the earnout right being added to the capital proceeds or the cost base of the original sale through amendments to the taxpayers' tax return for that period.


Generally, taxpayers and the commissioner will not be liable for interest on, respectively, any shortfall and overpayment as a result of any amendment to a tax return made as a consequence of these earnout changes. This bill will not only help provide certainty for businesses entering into earnout arrangements but will also protect any entitlement they have to small business capital gains tax concessions. On 14 December 2013, the government announced that it would proceed with a measure to provide CGT look-through treatment to earnout arrangements, which have been announced but 'unenacted'by the previous government as part of their 2010-11 budget. This bill will apply to all earnout arrangements entered into after 23 April 2015. In addition, in some cases the bill also includes protections to preserve taxpayers' current tax outcomes without requiring amendments. These protections are available where taxpayers have reasonably and in good faith anticipated changes to the tax law in this area as a result of the May 2010 announcement by the previous government.


Schedule 2 to this bill amends the taxation laws to improve the integrity of Australia's foreign resident capital gains tax regime. In doing so, it is consistent with the government's broader efforts to ensure that foreign investors into Australian real property comply with their Australian legal obligations. Foreign residents are liable to pay tax on capital gains when they dispose of certain Australian assets; broadly, direct and indirect interests in real property. The ATO has indicated that voluntary compliance with Australia's foreign residents CGT regime is low. In addition, there are difficulties with the ATO undertaking effective compliance activity after a transaction takes place.


To address this, this bill introduces a withholding measure which will impose an obligation on a purchaser to withhold 10 per cent of the proceeds, and to pay that amount to the ATO at the time that they acquire certain taxable property from a foreign resident vendor. In doing so, the measure will improve compliance by foreign residents with Australia's CGT obligations, and with the tax system more broadly, by encouraging appropriate interaction with the ATO where necessary. The measure does not apply to direct real property transactions valued at under $2 million. This ensures that the measures are properly targeted at those areas where revenue is at greatest risk, and minimises the impact on other property transactions. The measure has undergone extensive consultation to ensure that it achieves a high level of integrity, whilst balancing administrative considerations including increased certainty around its application. On behalf of the Minister for Finance and on behalf of the Treasurer, I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:01):  I thank Senator Ketter for that question. Of course, if he had quoted my full quote, he would have seen that the comments made by the Treasurer and me were entirely consistent. What I said in the interview on Radio National was that bracket creep is a problem, it is a drag on growth, and that we would do as much is possible to address it and as much as we can sensibly afford, which I would have thought was an entirely reasonable boundary to set. Indeed, it is a very responsible boundary to set in relation to any policy proposals that will come forward down the track.


The second point I would make is that it is self-evident that the stronger the wages growth and the higher the wages growth across the community the faster people move through individual income tax brackets; and the lower the rate of inflation or the lower the rate of wages growth the more slowly people move through individual income tax brackets. 


So the key point is this, and the government are of course of one mind in relation to this: bracket creep is a problem, bracket creep is a drag on growth, bracket creep is something that the government are committed to addressing, and we will address it to the best of our ability. We will do the best possible job to address bracket creep by pursuing personal income tax cuts in a way that is sensibly affordable. 


Labor should have a close look at their policy, which is to spend more, borrow too much and then tax more. They are always chasing increased levels of expenditure with more new taxes. Our focus is on strengthening growth and creating more jobs, and part of that focus is to ensure that our tax system is as growth friendly as possible and as efficient as possible, and that we address bracket creep in the best way possible and in a way that is sensibly affordable.

That is why, since our election in 2013, we have focused on improving our international competitiveness, making our tax system more growth friendly and getting rid of Labor's disastrous carbon tax and their disastrous mining tax; that is why we delivered company tax cuts to small business in last year's budget; that is why we pursued an ambitious free-trade agenda; and that is why we pursued an ambitious infrastructure investment program—all focused on delivering stronger growth and more jobs.

The economic position today is better than it would have been if we had kept Labor's disastrous mining tax and Labor's disastrous carbon tax, if we had not pursued an ambitious free-trade agenda and if we had not pursued an ambitious infrastructure investment program. Our budget position now is on an improving trajectory—it is on an unbelievably improving trajectory—with the underlying cash balance improving year-on-year in both dollar terms and as a share of GDP.

 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (14:07):  I thank Senator Fawcett very much for his question and particularly acknowledge his longstanding interest in defence issues and, in this instance, particularly in our humanitarian assistance and disaster relief work.


Our thoughts are with the people of Fiji following the devastating impact of Tropical Cyclone Winston over the weekend, which has caused severe damage in the Pacific. This cyclone is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded to make landfall in Fiji, with reports of widespread destruction and devastation and, tragically, the death of 17 people. I want to acknowledge the government of Fiji for their work in putting in place a number of precautionary measures to protect their citizens and endeavour to limit the damage. Early assessments indicate that those measures have helped to reduce the loss of life.


I am pleased to say that Defence is working quickly with other Australian government agencies to ensure a coordinated response to this natural disaster. We are also working with our friends in New Zealand in the response process. I can confirm that Australia will provide MRH90 helicopters to assist Fiji to carry out assessments and provide relief to the outlying islands in particular affected by the cyclone.


The initial movement of advance elements departs today from RAAF Base Amberley and will provide the personnel necessary to assist the government of Fiji and the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. These initial elements will be deployed by C17A Globemaster and will arrive in Fiji this afternoon. Australia also has two AP3C Orion aircraft on standby in the region that can be activated at short notice, if that is requested by the government of Fiji, and they are able to assist with aerial surveillance of affected areas.

We have also engaged with other international partners, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, and are keeping them informed of our contributions to enable them to consider areas in which they may assist. Australia is also working in close cooperation with France through our France-Australia-New Zealand trilateral disaster relief arrangement here in the Pacific.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (14:10):  I thank Senator Fawcett. That is an important question, given that the full impact of the cyclone is not yet clear, because power and communications remain down right across the country, and that makes challenging the identification of particular areas of need. As the situation becomes clearer the ADF stands ready to provide further assistance to support Fiji's relief and recovery efforts, as they may request.


Australia does have some additional capabilities that may be of assistance. One of those in particular would be HMAS Canberra, one of the Navy's new LHD amphibious vessels. It is on standby should the Fiji government request it. HMAS Canberra has a very significant medical support capacity and can also transport heavy earthmoving equipment should that be needed by the Fiji government. We will continue to plan with the Fiji government and with New Zealand, in particular, to ensure that we are able to provide the quickest possible response to any further requests from Fiji.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Brown and Ketter today relating to tax policy.


I would like to start with the response that Senator Cormann gave to a question that I asked in question time today. In response to my quote from former Treasurer Joe Hockey, it does appear that Senator Cormann threw Mr Hockey under the bus again. He is leaving the chamber smiling, but he could not even bring himself to agree with his former friend, his former smoking partner, that negative gearing should be skewed towards new housing so that there is an incentive to add to the housing stock rather than an incentive to speculate on existing property. 


The responses by Senator Cormann were pathetic, to say the least. His response on behalf of the government basically had no relevance to the questions that I was asking. He also fell in line with Mr Turnbull in whipping up a scare campaign—something that Mr Turnbull said that he would not lower himself to do. They have failed to see what economists in Australia are saying about the Labor Party's policy on negative gearing.


We had in The Examiner today a column written by Saul Eslake, a nationally acclaimed economist who lives in Tasmania. He wrote: 


So let's not kid ourselves that negative gearing is something that is widely used by 'average Australians' to secure their retirement. It's something that is used by Australia's wealthiest households to reduce their tax debts.


There is no doubt that people up and down the income chain utilise negative gearing, but the simple fact is that surgeons get 100 times the tax benefit from negative gearing that cleaners do. They are the simple facts.


Saul Eslake's opinion piece in today's Examiner is based on fact; it is not based on the furphies that now seem to be part of the scare campaign that the government is running against negative gearing. Economist after economist, as well as the former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, is dismayed about the tack that this government is taking. The simple fact is that surgeons get 100 times the tax benefit from negative gearing that cleaners do.


Another question that was asked in question time today was about bracket creep, and, of course, we have differing views from Senator Cormann and Mr Morrison on it. What that demonstrates is that this government is all at sea on its plan for the economy and for tax reform. They have no plan. They have been in government for 2½ years and they have no plan. We have Mr Morrison so at sea that he had to blame Mr Abbott of doing nothing, but, of course, Mr Abbott had to give him a slap over that and deservedly so. They only started to look at their plan five months ago. 


Mr Morrison's inept performance at the Press Club was excruciating—I felt bad for him, but I can tell you that Senator Cormann was sitting in the audience and his face told the whole story. He was just appalled by the lack of substance in Mr Morrison's performance. Mr Morrison rightly got the rounds of the table when he went out to the media—and no-one backed him in—because Mr Morrison started talking about unicorns and pixies. It was very hard to follow what Mr Morrison was trying to convey to the community. What he managed to convey was that this government has no plan— (Time expired)

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:10):  I rise to take note of answers to questions raised by Senators Ketter and Brown to the Minister for Finance. It is like being hit by a heated lettuce leaf, isn't it?




Senator Brandis:
  Or savaged by a dead sheep.




Senator EDWARDS:
  This government is taking a very intellectual approach to a very difficult transitioning economy—an economy which is transitioning out of the mining boom with nearly 300,000 new jobs added in the new last 12 months. We are attempting to have a sensible conversation, and I am very pleased that Senator Ketter is joining me in the chamber to join in this. In our economics committee we are dealing with the issues of superannuation and fairness—whether it be the inequality of retirement incomes of men and women or corporate tax avoidance or the plethora of other issues we are dealing with. I can tell you that the opposition is playing catch up when it comes to these issues, because we already have introduced multinational corporate tax avoidance legislation into this place while the Labor Party and the Greens are still talking about it. We are the ones who are looking at superannuation. As I travel the length and breadth of this country, there are people with large superannuation funds who are saying, 'I think it is thoroughly acceptable that the government have a look at the way in which superannuation funds are taxed.' 


I think it is thoroughly appropriate that the Treasurer of this country has the conversation with people of Australia as he heads towards the budget in May. Even the workers in these multinational companies are now looking at higher wages, wage growth and bracket creep and the drag on the economy that bracket creep is. As people progress through the 30, 32, 37 cent bracket, it is a drag on growth in this country. 


All the Treasury modelling shows that high-taxing and high-spending governments are a recipe for disaster. The Australian people understand what $100 million a day of borrowings are—36,500 million is what we are faced with over the forward estimates. That is what we borrow—$100 million a day. The other side think it is sustainable to continue borrowing and spending. Every minister in this government is looking at ways in which they can create efficiencies, but that does not mean non-delivery of service. That is what prudent governments do; that is what we do—it is in the DNA of this side. That is what the commentators are seeing: a rational approach to the way in which this next budget is framed—one which transitions from the windfall benefits of a mining boom and one which transitions from a time where people expected governments to hand out money. We all know the days of pink batts and cash for clunkers have gone, but we are still paying for them and we cannot do it anymore. The revenues have gone. Every time iron ore drops a dollar, it is a $10 million hit on the economy. Anybody who thinks that we can keep the trajectory of spending going at those levels is not quoting from Saul Eslake. These people are lobbying the government. Big business will always want their bit, small business will want their bit, the unions will want their bit, and we will traverse a path methodically and intelligently through that.


If you look at negative gearing carefully, every Australian aspires, whether or not they own a home, to own an investment property—every Australian. I do not know why those on the other side play the politics of envy and why they deny people the same opportunity that they have had. I do not know why they are being mean. I do not think these things are lucrative; I do not think it is keeping anybody out of the Adelaide market and I do not think it is keeping anybody out of the Whyalla market— (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2016-02-22,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:15):  I rise to speak on the motion that the Senate take note of the answers Senator Cormann gave to the questions I asked him. On the general issue of the quality of the economic leadership of this government, I think any objective observer of material put before the parliament today and of the responses we received would form the view that, instead of the quality of economic leadership improving since Prime Minister Turnbull took the top office, it has deteriorated quite alarmingly, to the extent that we now have a shambolic approach in the very important area of tax reform. The first question I put to the Minister for Finance related to the disparity between his response on bracket creep and that of the Treasurer. The Treasurer identified bracket creep as a job killer and a growth killer, so one could be forgiven for forming the view that this was the government's top priority. But nobody sent the memo to the Minister for Finance, because his response on the issue of bracket creep was that it is not the problem it has been in the past, or words that effect. The minister's response to my question was to divert and say I was not quoting him completely, and he made the comment that there was a drag on growth with respect to bracket creep. The fact remains that we have a Minister for Finance and a Treasurer singing from two different hymn sheets, highlighting the fact that the economic leadership being provided is appalling. 


My first supplementary question went to the issue of whether or not it had been only since last September that they had started looking at issues like superannuation and the GST. We see a government and a Treasurer basically trying to indicate that nothing has been done for the past 2½ years on issues such as tax reform, but we know that in September of last year the most senior bureaucrats identified that one of Mr Turnbull's first acts after becoming Prime Minister was to halt the release of the green paper, which had been expected within the next six weeks, pending a full rethink of tax reform. They were told at that point to put everything on ice. A reset on tax reform was taking place, according to one senior executive. This is after the fact that we had a reform process in place. 


At least the former Treasurer put out a press release in March 2015 identifying what on the surface appeared to be an understandable process that would be followed, including a conversation with the nation on tax reform which would involve a green paper and a white paper following the discussion paper. We were all taken in by that because major corporations, industry bodies and interest groups then spent hundreds of millions of dollars getting taxation advice and legal advice to make submissions to Canberra for the white paper. The Business Council of Australia submission went to 75 pages, and the process cost Australian industry hundreds of millions of dollars, and there is speculation about how much mining companies and banks spent preparing their submissions. The Tax White Paper Taskforce had more than 700 public submissions uploaded to its website from companies such as ANZ, BHP Billiton and British American Tobacco. We were all involved in a journey only to find that, with the assent of the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to his new role, we had the pin being pulled on it and instead of the economic leadership that Mr Turnbull promised at the time, in September, we have an absolute descent into a shambolic situation.


Senator Cormann talked about the fact that the budget was on an improving trajectory, but we have a doubling of the deficit. So, we have a very poor quality of economic leadership on display here.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2016-02-22,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  I am pleased to be talking on the motion that the Senate take note of the answers given by coalition ministers to Senator Brown and Senator Ketter. If you had been paying attention to the national debate since Prime Minister Turnbull's ascension to the leadership of the Liberal Party, you would know that the coalition is interested in a better tax system, you would know that the coalition was not interested in a bigger tax burden on ordinary Australian families and businesses. It is revealing that in the contributions this afternoon a particular quotation has not been referred to, and that is a quotation of former Prime Minister—indeed, former Labor Treasurer of this nation—Paul Keating, who said just three weeks ago that what this country had was a spending problem and what it did not have was a revenue problem. I will come to that in a moment. 


The Labor Party has zero credibility on the issue of tax. We know that from the experience we had to endure with Labor's minerals resource rent tax; we know it from the misery that many Australian families and businesses had to endure as a result of the carbon tax. I will come back to the mining tax and carbon tax issues, but in the short time available to me I thought I might start by refuting some of the falsehoods that have been put out by Labor specifically in regard to negative gearing. 


I am going to refer specifically to comments made by the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, on the Sunrise program of 14 February; to comments made by the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, on Sky Newson 13 February this year; to Labor media releases; and of course to comments that Mr Bowen made in the Australian Financial Review on 14 February and in the Australian newspaper on 15 February.


Let me turn first to the shadow Treasurer's contribution to Sky News on 13 February, where he said that 50 per cent of house purchases at the moment are investments—false. In fact, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics housing finance data, the value of financial commitments by investors as a share of total financial commitments has never reached 50 per cent throughout the history of the series, which began in January 1985. Over the last three months of 2015, the share of investor housing finance commitments remains steady at 35 per cent.


Let us then turn to what Labor's media release says on the issue of Labor's negative gearing. It says that 93 per cent of new investment loans go to people purchasing existing housing stock—false; not true. In fact, according to the same ABS housing finance data, the average proportion for the past two years is around 93.4 per cent, with the proportion in December 2015 falling to 91.4 per cent.


Let us turn to the comments of Mr Bowen, the shadow Treasurer, made in the Australian newspaper of 15 February. He says that the top 20 per cent of income earners receive about half of all the benefits of negative gearing—not true; not accurate. He goes on to say, in Labor's media release again, that the top 10 per cent of earners capture nearly 70 per cent of the total subsidy of the CGT discount. That comment was also made in Labor's media release. It is not true. So we have a catalogue of comments and assertions being made by the Labor party in regard to negative gearing which are not true or cannot be substantiated. 


Let us turn briefly to the issue of the carbon tax and the minerals resource rent tax. We know from Labor's previous commitments, when they made calculations of the revenue this would draw into the Commonwealth's coffers, those revenue projections were wrong. In fact they were so inflated—

Senator SMITH:

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:25):  I also rise to take note of answers given by the Minister for Finance to questions asked by Senators Ketter and Brown. Just last September, Innes Willox, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group said:


So we would hope the Government will be able to put together a coherent narrative around the sort of principles that we talked about at the reform summit …


He must be very disappointed. Poor Mr Willox! He must be very disappointed with the last five months, because what we have seen instead is not a coherent narrative—not even a coherent set of proposals. In fact we have seen no coherence. We have seen no narrative. We have not even seen any principles by which the debate around tax ought to be conducted. And we certainly have not seen any ideas.


We are in the most strange position of having an opposition that, well before an election, has a fully costed set of policies on the table and a government with no policies at all. Most people who are watchers of Australian politics will understand that this is a most unusual situation. It is not ordinarily how Australian politics is conducted, but it seems that there is a very strange set of apparently deliberate decisions made by this government not to put anything on the table whatsoever. They are essentially an opposition in exile. Perhaps to misquote the Prime Minister, 'There has never been a more exciting time to be a small target government,' because this is a group of people who are completely unwilling to put anything on the table at all.




Senator Bilyk:
  No target.




Senator McALLISTER:
  Not only not a small target, as my colleague points out, but no target whatsoever.


It is not even clear anymore that we have a budget problem. People will recall the rather hysterical and urgent commentary about a budget emergency that greeted the commencement of the Abbott government. Spending now, in the words of the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, is over 26 per cent, which is where it was at the height of the GFC. He said:


This is not something that we believe is sustainable and there are plenty of people out there who want to raise taxes and have a new idea for a tax every single day of the week.


I would say to the Treasurer: 'I would be grateful for new ideas,' because this government would be very lucky to have even a single new idea, let alone a new idea every single day of the week. We are not seeing the kinds of economic leadership promised by the current Prime Minister when he removed the last Prime Minister, calling at that time for renewed purpose in our economic debate.


What is the debate that we are having at the moment? We started out by saying that the urgent debate under the new Prime Minister Turnbull would be a debate around tax, and we were going to have a mature conversation around tax at which all options would be on the table. What has become obvious is that there was only ever really one option on the table and that was the GST, but it was the option that dare not speak its name, because they did not have the courage to go out and prosecute the case themselves. They did not have the courage to name the option that was in fact their preferred option. They left it to a whole range of third parties to roll out the ideas, which is not the way you lead an economic debate. And of course all the while, they were busily beavering away on secret modelling that nobody was ever allowed to see because this national conversation was to take place in the complete absence of data or facts. Of course when they really looked at it, what was there in the modelling was the thing which the Labor Party, which the opposition had been pointing out all along—that a GST would be a killer on economic growth. Not only would it be an unfair and regressive tax but it would be a tax that would actually hurt the economy.


So now where are we? We are back to square 1 because we have got no ideas on the table for the national economic conversation that is supposed to be taking place with all ideas on the table. So we do not have any changes to superannuation on the table despite the fact that the Labor Party, for at least a year, has had a concrete costed proposal to address the most unfair elements of the superannuation system that deliver benefits to the very top income earners in our economy.


We have no plans to deal with negative gearing or with capital gains tax. In fact, all we see is an attempt to mislead the debate by introducing the idea that this is a benefit that helps ordinary people when in fact the modelling by NATSEM, which Senator Smith ought to be aware of, demonstrates that the benefits from both negative gearing and capital gains tax go to the very top cohort of income earners in this country.


I would say this to the government: if there was ever a time to get your ideas on the table, it would be now in the lead up to the budget and not wait until— (Time expired)

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:37):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 9 February 2016, of the Honourable Robert George (Bob) Halverson OBE, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and member for Casey, places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Mr President, like you, I acknowledge the presence in the gallery this afternoon of members of the late Mr Halverson's family: his daughter, Sharon Bawden; her husband, Grant Bawden; and Sharon and Grant's son, Bob's grandson, James Bawden.


Bob Halverson rose from a modest background to become the Speaker of the House of Representatives and then to represent Australia as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. Along the way he served his country with distinction for a quarter of a century in the Royal Australian Air Force and then for 14 years as a member of this parliament.


Bob Halverson was born in Springvale, Victoria, on 22 October 1937, the son of an electrician. He grew up in Footscray, studying at Footscray Technical School and later at Swinburne Technical College, joining the RAAF in 1956 and marrying Maggie in 1958. Bob's service in the RAAF included some years in Washington, DC, and in England, for which service he was awarded an OBE in 1978 and promoted to group captain in 1979.


After leaving the Air Force in 1981, Bob worked as a financial analyst and client adviser. Then, in 1984, he was elected as the Liberal member of the House of Representatives for the marginal Victorian seat of Casey, the first of five occasions on which he was elected as member for Casey. Gregarious, passionate, robust, unmistakably


decent and with—in his words—'a PhD in hard knocks', Bob Halverson worked diligently to represent the people of this electorate, which spanned outer urban, semirural and rural areas.


He also made an ever-increasing contribution to this parliament. As well as extensive committee work in Canberra, including, for example, public works as well as foreign affairs, defence and trade, he became an Opposition Whip in 1990 and served as Chief Opposition Whip from 1994 to 1996. Elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1996 parliament, Bob Halverson devoted himself to being a thoroughly independent occupant of that office, balancing tradition and reform in the work of the parliament. When he resigned as Speaker in March of 1998 and said that he would not seek re-election to parliament at the election that year, the opposition leader Kim Beazley said that he had 'graced the position' of Speaker, and 'attempted to deal with the opposition fairly and lift the standards of the place'. The Prime Minister Mr Howard said that he had 'served his country with loyalty and distinction', and expressed the hope that he would come to serve it in further ways.


Having travelled widely around the globe while serving in the RAAF, Bob, as a member of parliament, represented this parliament in delegations to many countries, including in 1998 serving as an observer at the Cambodian elections. A long-time campaigner for retaining our existing flag, he became in time an advocate of an Australian republic.


In 1999, Bob Halverson was appointed Australian Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, which roles he fulfilled with his usual gusto, quick to establish strong links at the highest level, such as with the President and Prime Minister of Ireland and with the Pope, while being a warm and inclusive host, including of many visiting Australians.


After retiring from these posts in 2002 to combat prostate cancer, Bob—with Maggie—fulfilled a long ambition to go onto the land, moving to a farm at Holbrook in New South Wales. Bob maintained warm links to this parliament, not least through his family connection with the member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone. Bob's son-in-law, Grant Bawden—who I acknowledge in the gallery this afternoon—is the brother of Dr Stone. Sharman Stone described Bob as her 'mentor, adviser and dearest friend'. It is noteworthy that Bob's seat of Casey is today once again held by the Speaker of the House of Representatives.


In his first speech in the House of Representatives in 1985, Bob Halverson said:


The men and women who seek to serve in this place may be motivated by many reasons. Mine were quite simple: I believe that our rights and freedoms must be protected, and I love my country.


He also spoke of the importance of 'sacrifice, courage, discipline, loyalty, devotion to duty and', once again, 'love of country'—the values by which he lived his life and served his country so passionately. In that same speech, Bob Halverson spoke with feeling of having 'the help, support and encouragement of a loved and loving wife'. Our hearts go out to Maggie, and to their four children and their families, in their deep loss, and we send to them our very deepest sympathy on this occasion, while acknowledging the service to this parliament and to this nation of a great Australian.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:43):  I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition on this motion of condolence on the passing of the Hon. Robert George Halverson. We join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate in conveying our thoughts to his wife and family at this time. Today we remember Bob Halverson, and we recognise and honour his service: his service to this nation, his service as a member of parliament from 1984 to 1998, his service as Speaker of the House of Representatives and, of course, his service as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See.


Prior to his election to the House of Representatives in 1984, Mr Halverson served with the Royal Australian Air Force. He enjoyed a distinguished career, enlisting as an officer cadet in 1956 and concluding in 1981 at the rank of group captain. For his service with the RAF during the Queen's silver jubilee, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. After leaving the Air Force—as Senator Brandis has said—he worked in the financial services sector for a brief period before being elected as the member for Casey in 1984.


In that election Bob Halverson defeated his Labor opponent after a redistribution turned a swing seat into one that held a little more advantage for the Liberals. However, in the end Mr Halverson, who had only joined the Liberal Party some two years prior to the election, won with a margin of 1,100 votes. Mr Halverson supported John Howard in opposition and served as Opposition Whip in the House of Representatives. As chief whip, he had a reputation for being an intimidating and effective operator.


Upon the election of the Howard government in 1996, Mr Halverson became the first Liberal Speaker of the House of Representatives since Sir Billy Snedden. I understand that the speakership did not come easily to him, with Mr Halverson receiving the endorsement of his colleagues after a party room meeting that involved some six ballots and lasted 90 minutes. I am sure there are stories associated with that! The Canberra Times heralded this with the headline '""Disciplinarian"" Halverson wins Speaker's post'.


Mr Halverson did not follow his Liberal predecessors in the practice of wearing a wig in the Speaker's chair. He also ensured that the original Gothic Speaker's chair remained at Old Parliament House, despite the desire of some of his colleagues to see it relocated to the current House of Representatives.


Recognising the importance of the independence of the Speaker, he did not attend party room meetings and also resigned from two party bodies to which he belonged in Victoria. The independence of the speakership had been an election commitment of Prime Minister Howard. I note that the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, observed:


It did not strike us as immediately likely, when the Prime Minister … announced an intention to support an independent Speaker, that we would in fact find the Chief Whip of the Coalition parties sitting in that place.


However, despite these doubts, it turned out that Mr Halverson did operate in a way that demonstrated his independence and at times raised the ire of some of his colleagues through his performance in the chair, particularly through his enforcement of rules relating to supplementary questions. In one article in 1997 the headline was 'Independent Speaker digs in, against his own side'. And I note—Senator Brandis has already quoted—the words of the then opposition leader, Mr Beazley, complimenting and acknowledging the service of Mr Halverson.


Mr Halverson resigned as Speaker in March 1998 and did not contest the election that was held in October that year. Prior to the election, he was appointed as ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, a post that brought considerable enjoyment after the rough and tumble of his parliamentary career. He was the first non-Catholic ambassador to Dublin and the Vatican. Sadly, it was whilst on this post that Mr Halverson discovered his illness.


Bob Halverson died last week at the age of 78 on his farm at Holbrook, in southern New South Wales. He spent a lifetime in the service of this country, in the Defence Force, in the parliament and as an ambassador. We recognise and honour his service, and I again express the condolences of the opposition and extend our thoughts to his wife, children and grandchildren.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:48):  I rise to associate the Nationals with this motion and offer my condolences to the family and friends of the late Robert 'Bob' George Halverson. Others have covered many of the public details of Bob's life before he entered parliament, so I will not go over those comments, but I do think it is important to repeat and recognise his commitment to the Royal Australian Air Force, which he joined in 1956. Throughout 25 years of service, Bob rose through the ranks to achieve the position of group captain, and it was in this role that he was recognised as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1978. This is an honour I know that his family would be very proud of.


Post service, Mr Halverson threw his hat in the political ring and contested the marginal seat of Casey, in Melbourne's outer east, in the 1984 federal election. In his first speech, Mr Halverson clearly articulated his primary priority in this place. It is one that we all can do with reminding of sometimes as we get caught up in the politics and distractions sometimes. Mr Halverson stated that his primary desire was:


… to pursue with dedication and commitment the best interests of my constituents … to be of service to my electorate and my country.


Mr Halverson's first parliamentary speech also unveiled for the public record his determined patriotism and nationalist pride in Australia. He was a champion for the local people that he represented, but he was also a staunch defender of the values of the nation.


In 1996, Mr Halverson became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives during the Howard government's term, probably his most significant appointment during his time in parliament. Mr Halverson took it upon himself to be as impartial and as independent as possible, adopting a Westminster-like approach in his role as Speaker of the House. Ditching the wig and donning a black coat, Mr Halverson unprecedentedly allowed supplementary questions by the opposition in the House. Whilst it might be the case that when we are in government we may not enjoy the additional scrutiny that can come from such an approach, I think that we should appreciate and acknowledge the standard that Mr Halverson set and his desire for greater accountability.


But, perhaps more interesting than talking about his actions in the chambers of parliament, I would like to reflect on Bob and the secret billiards competitions that he would organise across the party divide. I understand that the message would come from Bob that it was time for a special committee meeting, which meant that members of the group were to meet in the billiard room in the old house—and I can imagine that the discussion in that room was probably much more interesting than the games of billiards.


Following his retirement from parliament, Mr Halverson was a particularly effective ambassador. His personable nature enabled him to become very well connected and operate on a first-name basis with the Irish Prime Minister, the Irish President and many other Irish members of parliament of the day. It was Mr Halverson's notable close connections with the Vatican and Pope John Paul II that assisted in the release of the Australian aid workers held captive in Serbia during the Kosovo crisis.


Throughout his life, Mr Halverson was loved, supported and encouraged by his wife, Maggie, and their four children, a daughter and three sons—and I would like to also acknowledge the members of his family in the gallery today. Mr Halverson's family has since grown to include many grandchildren, who will forever be reminded of their grandfather's vigour and unfailing conviction to the best outcomes for his country. Many have talked about how Bob considered himself a man with 'clout' and 'a bit of a rebel', and I agree that Mr Halverson can be considered a true Aussie battler—a battler who was willing to jump in the ring and have a go. Mr Halverson will be remembered as one whose life was lived in the distinguished service of others—a man of integrity; a man of heart.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2016-02-22,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:28):  As we on this side know, this government is a shambles. Malcolm Turnbull rolled Prime Minister Abbott based on the false promise of a new economic leadership and, allegedly, to usher in new politics where slogans would give way to advocacy. This new economic leadership has failed to appear, and 162 days and 13 or 14 ministers later we are seeing an unravelling government that has no tax policy—indeed, no policies at all—to help everyday Australians. The best Malcolm Turnbull can offer is a weak, scare campaign—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Senator Bilyk, I am going to ask you to refer to the Prime Minister by his title or as Mr Turnbull.




Senator BILYK:
  The best Mr Turnbull can offer is a weak scare campaign slogan on opposition policy. Mr Turnbull decided that his government is so devoid of policies, so lacking in ideas, so lacking in vision and a Treasurer so hopelessly and obviously out of his depth they would launch an old style Mr Abbott scare campaign about negative gearing. It is utterly remarkable that just months out from a federal election the government has no plan at all on taxation. So we have had months of the government secretly dipping their toes into the water to test whether a GST change was palatable. 


Leaked COAG documents show that the government put a number of options relating to changes to the GST on the table. The first few options include lifting the GST to 15 per cent, lifting the GST to 12½ per cent and expanding the base to include all food and non-alcoholic drinks, and raising the GST to 15 per cent while expanding it to include food and non-alcoholic drinks, water and sewerage. They deviously did not articulate any of these options to the Australian people. Why? Because they know just how unfair they are. An increase in the GST will be an increased tax on everything—fresh food, health, education. As we know, a 15 per cent GST on everything will cost families an extra $7.4 billion in school fees and other educational expenses in the first year alone. Treasury figures show raising the GST to 15 per cent and extending it to fresh food would hit families for another $9.45 billion a year—an extraordinary impost that, as always with the GST, would fall hardest on those with the least to spare. We know that this is utterly heartless and cruel. These are the policies that we have not actually seen yet—but we hope that we eventually will, because there could be an election in a couple of months. We are still waiting on the government to articulate any policies—but we do know that being cruel and thoughtless is a common thread in this government. 


The Liberals are still in confusion about their position on the GST. Just recently, we had one minister, Senator Cash, in fact, say just last week that a 50 per cent rise in the GST was still on the table of tax proposals being considered. The employment minister told Sky News:


We haven't taken it off the table completely, not at all.


This contradicted Prime Minister Turnbull, who told reporters in Rockhampton on the very same day: 


I can assure you the government will not be taking a proposal to increase the GST to the election.


That leaves me with one or two thoughts: if they get re-elected then either they are going to do it anyway and just not bother being honest about it or they have realised their plan to increase the GST is unpopular because it is so unfair, and they would just like the issue to go away. The government has spent the last six months with the 'Will we? Won't we? Will we? Won't we?' conversation on the GST and, as we know, they are now left with no policies on taxation at all. They have wasted the first 2½ years of their three-year term failing to develop policies, and now they expect that whatever thought-bubbles they come up with in the next couple of months will be good enough. I can assure those opposite that the people of Australia do not think that that is good enough. 


Last week, the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, gave one of the worst speeches in living memory of a sitting Treasurer at the National Press Club. Worst speech in living memory of a sitting Treasurer: 46 minutes of waffle! Even people on this side felt embarrassed and sorry for him. This was his moment to shine. He was at the National Press Club. This was his moment to take economic leadership and define how he would make the taxation system fairer—and he failed. He failed big time. It is obvious that what he wanted to talk about was a GST—and that rug had been very nicely pulled out from underneath him. All that was left were platitudes and meaningless glib statements. 


I know that the great Australian dream for young people is to buy their own home. Labor has a plan to make the taxation system around housing fairer. The negative gearing and capital gains tax changes announced by Mr Shorten and Mr Bowen will deliver the most important structural budget reform in a decade. These changes will improve fairness and make a real contribution to tackling housing affordability. On negative gearing, Labor will modify the system so that investment losses can only be offset against wage income for new properties, new builds. This will help channel investment into new housing supply to improve affordability. 


A strong housing market is central to Australia's successful transition out of the mining boom, and directing investment towards new building starts will obviously also improve jobs, investment and growth. Despite Mr Morrison peddling propaganda, the current tax concessions on negatively geared property overwhelmingly go to those on the highest incomes. The government's own Re:think tax discussion paper tells us that fewer than one in seven Australians earning a middle income claim negative gearing deductions. So, even though those on the other side say, 'All the negative gearing is done by nurses and school teachers,' we know that that is not true. Almost a quarter of the people earning $250,000 claim for negative gearing. So the top 20 per cent of income earners receive about half of all the benefits of negative gearing. Importantly for existing properties and other asset classes, our changes will mean investment losses can still be offset against other investment income and the final capital gain, directly linking the deductions claimed to the specific class of earnings. This will align Australia's rules more closely with those already operating in other advanced economies. We will also halve the existing capital gains tax discount to 25 per cent. 


When the current discount was introduced in 1999, Australia was running a $12 billion surplus in the most favourable economic climate in a generation. Today, we are facing a $37 billion deficit as our economy switches gears and we continue the long climb back from the depths of the global financial crisis. While fairness is front and centre of our policy approach, these changes are also good economic policy. As observed by the recent Financial System Inquiry, reducing the capital gains tax discount and negative gearing concessions would lead to a more efficient allocation of funding in the economy. This would lead to more productivity-enhancing investment and more economic growth and jobs. Significantly, these changes would take effect from 1 July 2017, with all existing investments fully grandfathered—that is, anyone who has already made an investment in good faith before this date will be unaffected by the new arrangements.


In deciding to pursue these specific reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax, we in the Labor Party have been guided by our values. We believe that the tax load should be fairly shared and not get lighter the higher up the income scale you go. Labor know that there are 475 Australians with more than $10 million in their superannuation account and that they are living tax-free on the income from those superannuation accounts. We say that that is not fair and it is not sustainable. Labor have had our plans on the table since April of last year—the best part of a year—and we have had a fully costed plan for fairer super. 


In addition, Labor want to tackle the issues of the multinational tax avoidance. In 2012-13, companies shifted over $300 billion from their Australian arms to overseas parent or subsidiary companies. We want to close the loopholes that allow big multinationals to send their profits overseas. Unlike the government, who want to cut funding to schools and hospitals, we think that multinationals should pay their fair share of tax. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-02-22,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:39):  Senator Moore is a gift that just keeps giving when she comes up with these MPIs on activities of the Turnbull government. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you, in business, and all of us with families, know very well that unless you are earning more than you are spending on a week-to-week or fortnight-to-fortnight basis, you are going down the gurgler. And that is where the last Labor government sent this country, as you know. The young people in the gallery should be taking notes because one day they will be having to run household and business budgets and having to vote for governments of the day. I say again that the only way to balance a budget is to make sure that you have more coming in than you have going out. 


If we have a look at the situation in November 2007, this country had no net debt, it had no deficit and it had cash in the bank. Look where we are today? When this government came into power in September 2013, the deficit—the accumulation year to year—was already $123 billion! We were rushing to $660 billion of debt! The important point to be understood here is not the debt itself. Those of us with credit card accounts and those of us with mortgages know that it is not the actual amount on the credit card or the mortgage: it is what you are paying out each and every month in interest. What is of interest is that this country is borrowing offshore and paying $1.2 billion a month just to pay the interest on the debt. 


We heard Senator Bilyk talk for one moment about negative gearing. By the Leader of the Opposition's own statement, this transformational tax reform would raise less than $600 million in four years. Do you know what that equates to in the interest that we are paying offshore at the moment? Two weeks—two weeks of lousy interest on the debt would account for the Leader of the Opposition so-called transformational tax reform on negative gearing on housing. If the Labor Party is genuinely interested in actually having a look at negative gearing—as Senator Whish-Wilson should note from his economic past—they need only go back to the efforts of the Hawke-Keating government, who did try to remove negative gearing. We all know what the impact of that was.


Of all funds associated with negative gearing, 97 per cent is on existing housing. Two-thirds of all Australians who negatively gear have a taxable income of $80,000 a year or less, 70 per cent of them have only one rental property and it makes the masterful average loss of $10,000 a year. It is largely people who can gain no other advantage. So we need to have a look at what this government is doing. Its first principle has been, is now and will be to ensure that we get to a situation in which this country is earning more than it is spending. At the moment we are spending $100 million a day, seven days a week, in excess of what we actually have and what we earn. 


The comment was made by Senator Bilyk—and I am in complete agreement—that we have to make sure that all entities pay their tax. I was pleased that only this day Treasurer Morrison made the statement:


The Turnbull Government will apply new requirements on foreign investment applications to ensure multinational companies investing in Australia pay tax here on what they earn … The Government is committed to ensuring companies operating in Australia pay tax on their Australian earnings. Where companies fail to do so I will have powers to take action, including ordering divestment of Australian assets.


That is not a large area, but we all agree in this place that it is essential. It is essential that people pay their due taxation, whether they are Australian organisations, overseas organisations et cetera.


I go again to why we are where we are. The Labor Party proposed savings in government, and we know very well in the 2½ years that we have been in government that the Labor Party has opposed and blocked in this place savings measures it had itself proposed—well in excess of $3 billion. There have been further savings and revenue measures proposed by this government that the Labor opposition is blocking now—$5.5 billion. There is spending that Labor says we must restore from banked savings, this is loaned money—$30.2 billion. There are savings in this current 2015-16 budget that the opposition has said it will not support. The list goes on and on.


But I say this to the chamber: if you have a look at the situation occurring now in Europe, the United States of America, Eastern Europe and South America, the world in my view is headed for some very, very rocky times. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, as you know, I have had many years in the oil and gas industry. Look where oil and gas prices are today. I say to you: each time over history—going back to before the First World War—every time there has been a sustained drop in oil prices, the sequel has been recession and/or depression around the globe. Where are we today? Oil prices are down at the levels they are. When you have a look at what the major oil producing countries are, with the exception of the United States, they are countries that have difficulty with stability: Russia, Angola, Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, South American countries and some of the Middle Eastern countries.


This is not a time for cheap political point-scoring. This is not a time for this country to be spending well beyond its means. This is a time for us to be getting our debt under control. It is not a time for us to be losing $1.2 billion a month in interest alone on our debt. This is a time when this country needs to get back to a circumstance of strong economic stability: the sort of stability that we saw in 2007, which got this country through the global financial crisis when it eventually occurred, during the time of the Rudd government.


Just have a look at how different the circumstances are today to how they were then and whether this country is equipped to be able to sustain another global financial crisis: our terms of trade have declined; China, the great supplier of wealth to this country over the last few years, has slowed down economically; high commodity prices have now come off; and Australia has that debt of $400 to $600 billion and the monthly interest of $1.2 billion. Interest rates are at a historically low level. It is time that this country understood the challenge. (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2016-02-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:47):  Sometimes it is good to go third in these debates so that you can hear the views of the opposition and the views of government senators. I thank Senator Moore for bringing this motion forward for consideration today. When Prime Minister Turnbull had rolled Mr Abbott out of the Prime Minister's office, his pitch to his own party room and to the people of Australia was really twofold. It was, 'We're doing very badly in the polls, and I will improve your standing in the news polls. Prime Minister Abbott cannot sell the economic message and that is something I will do.'


It is interesting, only a few short months later, to see how that is working out. The polls are not looking all that great, but—of much greater consequence—the government's economic message is just incoherent. With greatest respect to Senator Back, who I quite like personally, he did not shed a great deal of light on the government's economic message just then. Senator Bilyk, in her own way, has just put a proposition. We do not believe that the opposition's proposals on negative gearing go anywhere near far enough. I will explain why in a moment.


But it is, nonetheless, a recognition of the revenue that is available. Having bailed out and gone a bit weak at the knees at the idea of taxing every Australian on every purchase of every item through the GST—you have gone a bit cold on that idea—there are revenue measures available through things like negative gearing and, particularly, capital gains tax exemptions. For Senator Back, it appeared to have just gone completely over his head that that is what is on the table.


It is very interesting because I can recall through six years of the Rudd-Gillard governments that we could not get a peep out of the Labor Party on negative gearing. We could not find a pulse. We went after the Treasury department: 'No, we've not been asked to model it.' It was this extraordinary tight-lipped exchange at the time, where negative gearing was considered too politically dangerous to handle. Labor will say one thing in opposition and in government another, but credit where it is due: it is out in the open now and the debate is joint. They at least—




Senator Cameron:
  You'll never be in government with that.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Do not be so sure of that, Senator Cameron, because that smug attitude is what is costing you votes. Now that it is at least out in the open, I do want to acknowledge that the Labor Party has at least bitten the bullet—there is a negative gearing policy out there; there is a capital gains tax policy out there—which is more than we can say for the government. They are screaming about the loss of revenue and yet they are not interested in actually taking it on where it is available.


In the middle of last year, we had the Parliamentary Budget Office model what negative gearing concessions to wealthy property investors actually cost the economy. It is—in combination with capital gains tax exemptions, which is the sixth largest tax expenditure in our economy—$22 billion over the forward estimates. That is an incredible transfer of wealth; that is a subsidy to property investors.


I have been kind of amused to see the Property Council, one of the few voices left in the debate still hanging on to the idea that this intervention in the housing market is in the public interest, saying, 'It's all people on $80,000 a year or less.' It is remarkable. Yes, you can do that. When you have negatively geared a whole heap of your income out of existence so that it is invisible to the Australian Tax Office, you can actually get your taxable income down below $80,000 a year—you can get it to zero.


The Property Council does not mention that in their press release: all these people who negatively gear rental properties who have no income at all. What a remarkable miracle! Are these homeless people who are negatively gearing? No, it is not. It is people who have managed to take their taxable income down below these thresholds, and then the Property Council can go on in their press release about how it is doctors, teachers, plumbers and presumably homeless people who are all negatively gearing their seven investment properties. That is how ridiculous the debate has gotten. It is costing the economy $22 billion over the forward estimates. The debate should have been over when Malcolm Turnbull stood up the other day—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Ludlam, it is 'Mr Turnbull' or 'the Prime Minister'.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Quite correct, Acting Deputy President. When Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, brazenly stood up the other day and said, 'It'll crash property prices if you take away these negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms.' I would have thought that, if you strip away the hysterical language, that should have been the end of the debate. When this so-called liberal said that this $22 billion intervention in the property market is there to help push prices up, he basically acknowledged that negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions increase property prices. What kind of intervention in the market is that supposed to be, where these incentives are being subsidised by low-income taxpayers? That should have been the end of the debate, but at least it has started. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2016-02-22,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:52):  Today I rise on the matter of the Turnbull government's spectacular failure on tax policy. It has become painfully clear the Turnbull government has no plan for the economic future of our country and no idea when it comes to taxation reform. Last year, Mr Turnbull told us he was stepping up to contest the prime ministership because of the dire lack of economic leadership in the federal Liberal government. He told us he would lead an intelligent conversation with the Australian people about the economic reforms that his government would undertake. He told us that things would change. He told us that he would be different. Many Australians took Mr Turnbull at his word. They trusted that he would deliver solutions that would create a fairer taxation system to drive a more productive economy, which would create more jobs in Australia, for Australians. They believed that they would be treated as rational, intelligent human beings and that the government would be clear, direct and honest with its plans. There was also genuine goodwill in the electorate that the government was doing the hard yards and a comprehensive taxation agenda would soon be unveiled.


It is now more than five months on and what have we seen—nothing—no policy, no direction, no solutions and no idea. We have seen the Liberal Party members continue to block greater fairness and transparency in our taxation system at every opportunity, while they continue unabated in their calls to cut the wages and conditions of hardworking Australians. We have seen a party divided, a party where the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance cannot agree on what problems are facing the country, let alone find any solutions.


The reality is that while the Liberal Party might have a new front man in his shiny leather jacket, they are still singing the tired old Liberal songs that have already been roundly rejected by the Australian people. Songs of young people forced into decades of debt with $100,000 degrees, and of Australian schools being tasked with educating the next generation with $30 billion less. Songs of hospitals that have to absorb more than $50 billion worth of cuts in the face of the increasing care needs of an ageing population. And songs of hardworking Australians who would have their wages and conditions viciously cut and penalty rates slashed if the Liberals got their way. Let me be clear, while Mr Turnbull might sing in more soothing tones than Mr Abbott, the words are exactly the same.


All of the toxic Abbott era policy remains and now we have the additional burden of a government that does not have a clue what to do on taxation reform. In fact, if anything, the Turnbull government actually went backwards when they junked their own tax white paper after billing it as 'the document' that would lay out a road map for the direction of tax policy. Those opposite spent millions of dollars in staffing and advertising the white paper process before junking it completely. What a shameful waste of time and money.


The truth is that Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison have completely dropped the ball on tax policy. They have been asleep at the wheel when it comes to the fundamental levers that will drive the direction of our national economy. The reality is that our taxation system is in dire need of reform. There are too many loopholes that allow the highest earning companies and individuals to avoid paying their fair share of tax. There are too many subsidies going to the well-off. There is too little to stimulate growth and create jobs, and despite being in power for more than two years the Liberal government has shown it has no idea how to do anything about it or is completely unwilling to do anything about it. This is a very serious matter.


The Liberal government is hopelessly divided, irretrievably ideological and utterly incompetent when it comes to economic reform. On if any given day, we see as many different policy positions as there are Liberals fronting the camera. We saw Treasurer Morrison try to convince us in his Press Club address that bracket creep is one of the greatest issues facing the country, only to be contradicted very soon after by the Minster for Finance, Senator Cormann, who has contended that it is really not so bad after all. We heard Senator Cash reiterate that a GST hike is definitely still on the cards, only days after the Prime Minister told us exactly the opposite. Clearly the Liberals are deeply divided. The only thing they could agree on was a regressive hike to the GST, and, clearly, Mr Morrison had nothing else to offer once Mr Turnbull scotched this plan in a transparent attempt to save his electoral fortunes.


This became abundantly clear last week at the Treasurer's awkward and highly embarrassing appearance at the National Press Club. After more than five months as Treasurer, all the Australian people got was 46 minutes of waffle, slogans and platitudes. It became painfully clear that the Treasurer had no framework, no vision and no policies. Even the most rusted-on Liberals would have been hard-pressed to find a single policy to celebrate from Mr Morrison's much anticipated speech. Two and a half years in power and this government cannot summon up a single idea—not one. Even their multinational taxation legislation has an asterisk where the revenue figures should have been.


The Labor Party understands that Australia's taxation system is in dire need of reform and we understand that we need a system that works for all Australians, not just the wealthy, who are able to benefit from generous taxation loopholes. In too many areas fairness has been mistaken for the interests of the rich and powerful—never more so than under this Abbott/Turnbull government. The harsh and punitive measures put forward by those opposite will not solve the problem of inequality, they will only serve to entrench it. Labor has presented a coherent and measured set of policies that would deliver more fairness to our taxation system and grow our economy without sacrificing vital investment in the health and education of our people. In the complete absence of leadership from the Turnbull government, Labor has proven we are ready and able to lead the tax debate. Labor has been very clear about our priorities and we have released a comprehensive suite of policies so that the Australian people know exactly what we stand for. In fact, we have released more policies than any other opposition in living memory—more than 50 so far. We have led the way on high-income superannuation, multinational tax, tobacco and housing subsidies.


More recently, we have offered a positive plan for negative gearing and capital gains changes which would remove distortions in the housing industry and put homeownership back in reach for prospective first home buyers. Australian taxpayers currently spend more than $10 billion each year on negative gearing and capital gains subsidies for housing investment. Despite what those opposite will tell you, the facts are indisputable. The vast majority of the financial benefit from these concessions goes to those on high incomes. Many argue that negative gearing and capital gains concessions encourage building activity. The reality is that 97 per cent of houses bought under this policy are existing properties, with few investors taking the opportunity to invest in new housing stock. If more houses is truly the goal then it is very difficult to argue that we should continue to spend billions of dollars each year with only a three per cent success rate.


But Labor's reform plan will succeed where the existing policy has failed because negative gearing subsidies will be restricted to new properties. It will invigorate the construction industry. It will increase housing supply and create jobs. It will also provide the financial means for greater investment in health and education. Labor have demonstrated that we are willing to address the difficult questions and do the hard work to find solutions that are fair, reasonable and productive.


In contrast, this Abbott-Turnbull government have been in power for more than two years and yet they clearly do not have a clue on tax policy. The reality is that those opposite either have no intention or no idea how to create a fairer tax system that will support a productive economy. And now they are trying to distract from their abject failure by waging a baseless, hysterical scare campaign against Labor's measured and sensible negative-gearing reform. Mr Turnbull promised an intelligent debate on tax to the Australian people. But now we see that he is trying to cover up the total policy void in his own government by waging a desperate misinformation campaign against Labor. Well, it is not good enough. Australians expect more from the government, and they deserve more. Those opposite need to stop sitting on their hands and start doing the work. Mr Morrison needs to stop blaming everyone for his failure and Mr Turnbull needs to front up to the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2016-02-22,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (17:02):  I have realised something that has been a crystal clear awakening for me, and that is that the term 'fairness' when used by those on the other side of the chamber is just another euphemism for socialism. Everything they have talked about to do with fairness in the tax debate has been about taking more money from taxpayers and giving that money to those who do not pay tax. Everything about their debate has been about increasing the revenue for government, not about cutting programs that are wasteful or ending the money shuffle. There has been no proposed radical reform of the tax system. It has simply been about getting more from fewer people. That is the Labor way; it is the socialist way—'We will continue to take and spend your money until there is none left.'


You do not make everyone wealthier and lift a tide that all boats can float on by penalising those who are producing in the economy. We need to provide assistance and incentives for people to get out there and work. We need to provide assistance and incentives for people to get out there and start businesses, to employ and to invest. You do not do that by taxing people more.


The gerrymandering that would go on according to the plan of those on the other side is designed to make it fair for them, who have all benefited from lucrative superannuation investment schemes and no thresholds and who have all benefited from negative gearing and the tax fairness that came in under a coalition government previously. But they are going to penalise future generations even more than they have. Let's remember this: there was no debt in this country seven years ago. The mob on the other side spent hundreds of billions of dollars that they did not have that our children—your children and my children—and successive generations of children are going to be forced to repay. They implemented policies that have wasted tens of billions of dollars that we are still living with the legacy of today.


But, having said that, I want to thank Senator Moore for introducing this motion. It is not because of the wording—I understand there are spurious political games being played there—but because it provides an opportunity for those on this side of the chamber to talk about this and to prove that we are the thinkers. We are the people who are contemplating sincere and serious reform of the tax act.


So for the benefit of those on the other side, rather than apportion any ideas to the government, I am going to outline briefly the Bernardi tax plan. This is an opportunity to provide incentives and true equity and fairness to the Australian people. Let's start with the inequality between single-income families and dual-income families. On a $100,000 income, there is about a $10,000 tax disparity. That means that if you are sole breadwinner in your family earning $100,000 you are going to pay $10,000 or so more tax than if two people are out there working. On top of that, if the two people who are out there working have children, they are going to be benefiting from the childcare rebate and a whole bunch of other rebates and assistance. The inequality continues to grow.


So why don't we do something different? Why don't we say a single-income family with a dependent spouse or dependent children can benefit from multiple tax-free thresholds—maybe one for their spouse and half a one each for their child? This is about ending the money shuffle. It is about shrinking the size of government and making it truly fairer for individuals and families to determine what they want to spend their money on and get government out of it, because everything government touches turns to custard. Demonstrations of that have abounded again and again.


If you want to get more radical—and the aristocratic socialists, the merchant bankers, would like this—you could look at something like having a massively high tax-free threshold.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  Of course, there would be no subsidies for vineyards or anything like that under that scheme, Senator Whish-Wilson. But, nonetheless, you could have a very high tax-free threshold so that anyone earning under, say, $50,000 a year did not pay any tax. Principally they do not now because of the money shuffle and rebates. On top of that, you could have a flat rate of tax for those earning between $50,000 and, say, $100,000 of 20c or 25c in the dollar and maybe a 30c threshold after that. You could lower the company tax rate to the flat rate of 25c in the dollar, and in compensation for these sorts of cuts you could abolish personal deductions, subsidies and rebates and all the things that increase the size of government and decrease the size of the private sector. As I said before, everything the government tries to subsidise or infiltrate or influence goes bad.


We need to confront the demons that are within the Australian economy at the moment. That is simply that government is too big. Australians do not need more taxes. They need tax cuts. If you want to grow your economy you have to provide the incentive, and the incentives come from rewarding people for their efforts, rewarding people for taking risks. If you had a flat rate of tax after $50,000 or something, as I have demonstrated, you would not need capital gains tax exemptions or concessions, because people would be paying 20c or 25c in the dollar for every dollar, whether it came from a capital gain, speculation or from income.


That sort of stuff, of course, is anathema to the socialists on the other side. It is anathema to them because it stops them having control over what people want to do for themselves. They love being able to pull the levers and strings and say, 'We will give you a bit of that, if you do this over there.' They are channelling their inner Bernie Sanders. Senator Dastyari gives me the thumbs up because I have no doubt that Senator Dastyari, in his heart, is a true socialist. He is cuddling up there to Senator Cameron, which is a creepy, creepy thing to do, but, nonetheless, they are two peas in a pod when it comes to socialism and taxes.




Senator Dastyari:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I believe Senator Bernardi was trying to insult me. I am not sure that he has succeeded in doing so, but I do feel—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  What is the point of order?




Senator Dastyari:
  I am seeking guidance on whether or not a senator is in a position to pass those kinds of aspersions on another senator regarding—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator BERNARDI:
  What I find interesting about that interjection is the fact that Senator Cameron has the dignity to accept that he is a true socialist and he is a Bernie Sanders, whereas Senator Dastyari on the one hand wants to embrace it, but is not prepared to. He is a bit of a chameleon; we understand that. We recognise the fact that he likes to be a bit of an actor. We have seen him perform on the ABC stage in the theatre there. His props are sometimes wrong and sometimes he does not know whether he is Arthur or Martha, whether he is coming or going, whether he is a socialist or a free marketeer, whether he is Labor right or Labor left. He is everywhere. I have seen him coming up to almost anyone in this chamber. It is spurious. I would say to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, in this place people will respect you if you are your true self and if you do not pretend to be something that you are not. I have lived by that all my life, as you would probably know, and if I could give any unsolicited advice to the socialists, the wannabe socialists or the denialist socialists on the other side, I would say, 'Be yourself.' If Senator Dastyari were asking me this, I would say, 'Just be yourself—people might not like you for it, but you will win their respect.'


Having said that, they have failed, clearly, to adopt the Bernardi taxation plan of simplifying things, because from their point of view it is about controlling and influencing people and trying to coerce their behaviour. As I mentioned earlier, every notional saving—if only Hansard could pick up that I am putting 'savings' in air quotes—savings, for those on the other side, are bigger taxes. They are expenses for other people. That is the duality and the great hypocrisy of modern politics: they talk about savings but they are actually expenses. This is why the budget is never going to balance under those on the other side. What they put forward is a fraud. We need to allow individuals to make determinations about what they want to spend their money on, free of the influence or corralling of government. Let them choose the best type of child care for themselves by cutting the taxes and not having to subsidise it. It means not taking a dollar from someone, clipping the ticket in government and giving them back 90c or 50c or 40c in rebates. That only increases the size of government, and this is what this country cannot afford. This is a very hard word for me to say, as a conservative, but it is time for a radical rethink of how taxes are implemented in this country. If we do not, we will travel the path of other countries—that is, the reward for effort is gone and government gets bigger and bigger until it is no longer sustainable. We have seen it in Greece, we have seen it in Italy, we have seen it right through the European Union. We are seeing that America is struggling with debt problems and the polarisation of the community there. We want to avoid those issues in this country. The only way to do it is to shrink the size of government, to live within our means and to allow people the opportunity to make determinations, good and bad, and to live with the consequences, good and bad, of making their own decisions. That needs a radical rethink from those on that side of the chamber. But it is clear that those on this side of the chamber are starting to think seriously about how we can reset the tax system for the benefit of all Australians.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-02-22,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:12):  It never ceases to amaze me that the ultraconservatives like Senator Bernardi are fairly happy to talk to us about the role of government. They do not see any role for government in our lives except when it comes to social issues that you rely on the government to step in and regulate, such as same-sex marriage and other issues.


Let us talk about Bernie Sanders. It is a really interesting point. Why has Bernie Sanders been so successful in the US in the primaries today? It is probably the same reason that Donald Trump has been so successful. This is an international hot topic. I heard a really good summary from none other than Mr Kim Beazley on TV the other night, on Lateline. He said that the reason that US politics seems to be going haywire is that white males of middle income brackets have had no change in real income in the US in the last 20 years, whereas Australian incomes have increased 3½-fold. In the US, trickle-down economics has failed. Trickle-down economics, small government and leave it to the market have failed the American people. That is why we are seeing such an interesting race in the US primaries.


Tax reform is partly about revenue raising; it is partly about balancing budgets; but mostly it is about having a fair and equitable society. It is using the levers that we have in tax reform to get outcomes that we want to have a more prosperous and sustainable society. My party, the Greens, have been very proud to have led on the biggest tax reform of our generation with a clean energy package, putting a price on carbon, trying to tax the superprofits of mining companies. 


This government ruthlessly and cynically campaigned at the last election to rip up $18 billion worth of good policy that raised significant revenue for our country. But what they failed to tell the Australian people was how they were going to replace that revenue. In their first budget, which we all remember very well, they were going to attack pensioners, students, single parents, the sick and the elderly—and it failed, because they had no plan. Since then we have gone through a green paper process and a white paper process, constantly ruling in and ruling out what we are going to look at in tax reform. In our party, the Greens, we just want to have a sensible debate. 


Talking about sensible, sadly we lost the clean energy package and now we are paying polluters billions of dollars. But we have done a good job of getting some outcomes on tax transparency. That still has a way to go, but we are convinced we are on the right track there. We have delivered a small business package, which has helped small business get up. They are the engine room of our national economy. We have delivered pension reform. That gives an increase in pensions to the least well-off this country, those who need it the most. We have constantly stood up against the GST, not just because it is a regressive tax but because it is lazy. It is lazy politics, when there are so many other things we could do. We have been out there suggesting these constructive alternatives for some time now. 


I am very proud to say that my partner in crime here, Senator Ludlam, has been campaigning on negative gearing for at least 18 months, if not longer. I sat in the Press Club nine months ago debating negative gearing and capital gains tax with Judith Sloan and the Grattan Institute. This is something we have been talking about for some time. We have constantly had policies on removing negative gearing, removing the capital gains tax concessions and having superannuation tax reform. We have been happy to put those costings out there. We have been happy to lead on this. I am proud to say that we now have the support of the Labor Party in a couple of these things and, in a constructive process, they have joined us to campaign on tax reform around these issues. Adam Bandt was on the front page of The Australian last week saying that he was holding out a fig leaf to the government: 'Come and talk to the Greens about super concessions, come and talk to us about capital gains tax and come and talk to us about negative gearing. Together we can secure $22 billion of revenue and make this country fairer.' It is no surprise to me that, three days later, Labor caucus finally approved their negative gearing plan, 12 months after Chris Bowen started talking about it. Thank you for the leadership from the Greens and thank you, Labor Party, for entering the fray.


We also have a vision for infrastructure spending around this country. We have a vision for getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies and other areas where we know we can get up to $80 billion worth of revenue in this country, which we can redirect into schools, into hospitals, into affordable housing, into where it is needed, and look after those who are least well-off in this society. That is the role of government—not what Senator Bernardi said. The role of government is, when markets fail, being there to protect those who are vulnerable.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2016-02-22,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (17:18):  This week marks just 12 sitting days before the budget is brought down—just 12 sitting days. The government is in a shambles over tax, and that was amply demonstrated last week in the embarrassing Press Club address by the Treasurer, Mr Morrison. To this end, I saw a news headline last week which said 'Malcolm in a muddle'. Is it any wonder? Last week there was a universally bagged speech by the Treasurer which, at best, went down as a backdown on his rhetoric about the generous tax cuts he wanted to deliver, which, according to the Treasurer, would have enabled Australians to get on. But, of course, that was just a furphy, as any gains would have been swallowed up by their big fat new tax: their proposal for a massive hike in the GST. 


And where is the government on GST? Who knows. On the day the Prime Minister ruled it out, Senator Cash ruled it in. Over the last couple of days we have had Mr Morrison ruling out changing super to enable low-income earners to opt out and, at the same time, the new Deputy Prime Minister ruling it in. One assumes the Deputy Prime Minister outranks the Treasurer. But wait—there's more. Two more government members have taken the proposal a step further by saying, 'Let's extend this exemption to include students.' That's right, students—and why? Well, they will need additional income to pay off their HECS debt, their $100,000 degrees, because that proposal is still on the table.


Back to Mr Morrison's National Press Club address: it should have been a bit of a hint and a promise of what was to be expected in the upcoming budget just 12 sitting days away, but instead it was once again a contradiction on the issue of bracket creep. We heard that Mr Morrison said that bracket creep was a job killer and a growth killer, and he confirmed that again at the National Press Club by saying it was something that should be a priority. However, his cigar-smoking mate, the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, contradicted him the very next day when he said that bracket creep is not there to the same extent as it might have been in the past. Let's not get to the real issues of the tax avoidance of some almost 600 companies in this country that those opposite have refused to do anything about. We saw their pathetic deal with the Greens last year, which did not go any way to looking at how we might really address companies paying their fair share of tax in this country. So the real issues are still there. The Turnbull government simply wants to attack those at the bottom end. It thinks Australians should pay more through a GST or through cutting back on pensions or through all the other sorts of measures we have seen in the two budgets which have failed it so far. 


What about when the PM said he wanted to have a conversation with the Australian people about tax? That is pretty much all he said from the day that he took over from the other failed Prime Minister, Mr Abbott. My advice to the Prime Minister is that he really needs to start that conversation with his own government in their caucus room, as we see senior members of government, cabinet ministers, on a daily basis contradicting one another and indeed contradicting the Prime Minister.


Goodness knows what is going to be in the budget. It would seem that Mr Morrison has had to rip it up and start again because he was getting contradictory messages from all sorts of people—not backbenchers, but senior members of the government who want to be out there contradicting one another. It is shambolic and it is a disgrace. I have not heard it, but we know there is an internal conversation going on, and it is one of dissent within the Turnbull government about where to go on tax. That is what we have seen: shambolic government and empty promises among other things. There are 12 sitting days until the budget and we have seen no real hint of what is going on, apart from there will be announcements at some point into the future. It is shambolic and the Australian voters know that—they know it well and truly—the gloss is off.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2016-02-22,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:23):  I am very pleased to contribute to this very important debate today. I want to focus on two or three areas of tax policy, and the first is the achievements of this coalition government. When it comes to tax, we got rid of the Labor Party's carbon tax. We got rid of that job-killing carbon tax for the good of households—so they had lower electricity bills, more money in their pockets and lower gas bills. We lowered the cost of doing business by lowering the cost of electricity; that was a great achievement and good for business. We got rid of the Labor Party's ill-thought mining tax, which was an attack on one of our most important industries. We came in promising to get rid of it and we got rid of it. We have focused on giving tax relief to small business—hard working men and women who employ millions of people and who go out and take risks. We said to them, 'We will give you a small business tax cut and a small business instant asset write-off.' 


Our runs are on the board when it comes to tax. They are in stark contrast to the attitude of the Labor Party, and not just the taxes they imposed on us when they were last in office. They did their best to take one of the best performing parts of our economy, the mining industry, and kill it and they did their best with the carbon tax to have an additional hit on families and on business. Unfortunately, we know that the Labor Party, if they came back into office, have a plan to tax Australians more. Having not learnt the lessons in their last failed experiment in government—which was all about taxing more and spending more—they have a plan, if they come back in at this year's election, to tax more and to spend more. Who would have thought? They have very clearly laid that out on the table. Their plan is to tax Australians more—not to try to get the budget under control or to have policies that stimulate and grow the economy and grow jobs. We have seen 300,000 jobs created in this country in the last 12 months; that does not come about by accident; it comes about through policies which encourage business, policies which encourage people to employ others and which encourage people back into work. That is what we have been focusing on.


The Labor Party's alternative is to tax more. We know they are going to whack people's retirement savings by hitting their nest eggs with additional taxes. I want to focus on one of those proposals, their plan to tax housing in Australia—this massive housing tax proposed by Bill Shorten and the Labor Party. If they seriously think that this will not have a significant negative impact on ordinary Australian homeowners and on the broader Australian economy, then they have to be kidding themselves. The idea that you can make such a dramatic change to a longstanding, bipartisan policy and that it will not have a significant impact on house values! As the Prime Minister has pointed out, if you take out 30 per cent of the buyers, what is going to happen? We know what will happen—people's homes will be worth less. 


If you vote for the Labor Party and you vote for this negative gearing policy, your home is going to be worth less. They can pretend that that is not the case, but we all know it to be true. We have heard from a range of voices in this debate, including from the Property Council and the Master Builders Association, which makes its living from building homes. You would think such a group would like a policy that is apparently about building more homes, but they see severe dangers to the property industry as a whole. But do not just take their word for it, what about the Grattan Institute? The Grattan Institute supports this policy; they are not critics of this policy and, along with Labor's McKell Institute, they helped to create this policy. Regardless of whether that is the case, they support the policy, but what do they say about housing values? According to the Grattan Institute, they will drop by up to 10 per cent. But that is the opinion of the group that supports the policy, and so it may well be more.


We talk about first home buyers and the reason that so many first homebuyers are locked out of the market is that state and territory governments, particularly of the Labor bent, have held back on land release and have unreasonable planning laws which restrict the amount of land coming on board. Is this going to magically change under Labor's policy? Of course, it will not. What about all those home buyers who purchased a house a year ago or two or three or four years ago and who took out large mortgages to make a major investment? The Labor Party is saying to them, 'We do not care about you. We are happy to see the value of your home drop.'


What is this going to mean for future borrowings, as banks consider whether houses remain a good risk? People might find they cannot get into the property market, even with those lower values, because it will be harder to access finance. What kind of flow-on impact will this have on the economy—when people lose significant amounts of their wealth, do not have any confidence, do not have the same disposable income, do not have the same ability to access funds necessary to make major purchases? What is that going to do for business and spending? This is the Labor Party's future. This is the future for Australia under the Labor Party—more taxing, more spending and, most importantly, when it comes to negative gearing changes in particular, a whack on the value of the family home and a whack on the value of all properties. This is what the Labor Party is advocating, and a coalition— (Time expired)

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:35):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


It has been six years since negotiations started on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement—six years of secret meetings behind closed doors, between negotiators and special interests; six years that the public have been kept in the dark about an agreement that is going to impact just about every aspect of our life, our society and our economy. We see in the documents tabled by the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources the actual text of the agreement—the thousands of pages of text that JSCOT will now have a look at in detail. We also see the national interest analysis—a total farce, having been written by the same people who negotiated the deal on behalf of the government. It was not independently assessed. Independent assessment has been a minimum requirement of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in its recommendations for future trade negotiations and trade deals.


The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement is a document that cannot be changed, cannot be altered. There are 31 chapters of this document—from labour standards through to environmental conditions, through to local procurement, through to monopoly rights and intellectual property, through the investment chapter—we cannot change a single thing in this agreement. It is signed and sealed. The process we go through now is a total joke, a farce. This goes to JSCOT, which is a government-dominated committee. They will go around the country and roll out all their stakeholders, the usual suspects—the National Farmers Federation and other groups will tell us how great this trade deal is going to be for their constituents. No matter what we discover and want changed—it is not possible.


In parliament in a democracy, when legislation comes to parliament, especially the Senate—a house of review—we get to debate that legislation. We get to amend it and put up amendments knowing that if we get support from other members of the chamber, we can change that legislation and the law. We can improve it, which is what a democracy is all about, bringing in all stakeholders in this country, not just big business, who helped negotiate this deal, but all stakeholders. But under the treaty process that we have now, we cannot change a thing. It is locked in, signed and sealed. Those of us who may very well look at this document and find things that we agree with, things that could be good for the economy, have to weigh it the entirety of its 31 chapters in deciding whether we do or don't vote for this enabling legislation.


There are so many things in this deal that could have been improved if we had had a transparent democratic process through the trade negotiations. This is something that Foreign Affairs and Defence committee have spent time on. They have come up with a process that allows for democratic input throughout the negotiation process, while still giving flexibility to the negotiators to get work done. They have allowed for their independent assessment before it is signed by ministers at their press conference, getting their headlines in the newspapers, so that we can actually see that it is in the national interest. There are some things that can be omitted, such as deregulation of labour markets and dangerous clauses which give special rights to corporations to sue us if they do not like what legislation or policy may do or the impact it might have on their future profits. They are just some examples.


So what we have here is a document for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, an agreement that in reality is a trojan horse for circumventing the democratic parliamentary process in this country, because the special interests that originated this deal, manufactured it and has driven it relentlessly for six years do not want this to come to the Australian people. They do not want it to be voted on by the parliament. This is a document whose 31 chapters cover every aspect of our life here in Australia and our economy. It is a line in the sand with the Trade in Services Agreement, an even bigger agreement under negotiation now; with the RCEP agreement, the Regional Corporation Economic Partnership agreement, which potentially involves China and dozens of other countries, and is also under agreement now behind closed doors, in secret; potentially a massive deal with the EU and India. When do we get a say in this? The executive in this country has the power to negotiate these treaties and it does not have to come to parliament. It can deliver them and sign them, and then they go for a rubber stamp process. What is ludicrous about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement is that it is unlikely the US congress itself will vote on the deal that it has primarily originated and pushed. This is a US hegemony contract that is pushing US interest in our region. There is no doubt that sometimes that it is in our interests, but even they will not be voting on this deal, so why are we rushing this process here in Australia? Why do we have to have this signed and sealed by June-July, when it is unlikely the US is going to see it till at least the end of the year. If the US does not sign this deal, if they do not agree to it—there is a lot of evidence out there at the moment through the US primaries that this is a politically toxic issue in the US for exactly the same reasons that it is here in Australia. Workers do not believe these deals have delivered for them in the past. Even some of the industries that trade do not believe these deals have delivered for them in the past. Dangerous new laws for corporations allowing them to sue governments have set up parallel legal processes in shady international arbitration tribunals that do not function as democratic courts. This is the world that we are facing. This is the road we are going down. We have a chance to stop that in the Senate, but I despair that that is going to be very unlikely. All we have asked for is some transparency and some democratic input into this deal since I have been in this role, for the last four years, because we know that there will be things that will involve political decisions that have been made by the executive because someone has been in their rear. 


Let me tell you about the Korean free trade deal. The beef producers in this country gave evidence to the Senate committee I was on that they lobbied Minister Robb to include investor state dispute settlement clauses in the Korean deal to get it done, because Labor to their credit, had not signed this deal while they were in government because the Koreans were insisting on ISDS clauses. That is one interest. We all know that Mr Andrew Robb used to be involved in the National Farmers Federation. People he knows well got in his ear and said, 'For God's sake, get on with it! Just include these wretched clauses in there,' and since then we have set a precedent. Now they are in all our deals. Now we face 12 countries in the TPP, including US corporations, who are the most litigious corporations on the face of this planet, along with European counterparts.


Statistics recently came out about ISDS. There has been massive proliferation of court cases against sovereign governments by corporations in the last 12 months. Looking back over the last five years, hundreds of new cases are coming forward, where sovereign governments, parliaments and the people are being second-guessed by corporations. Senator Wong at estimates, brought up a situation that we might be facing in Queensland around coal seam gas. We already have a robust legal system—Justice French has talked about this. We do not need to be giving these special rights to corporations that give them an advantage over domestic companies and the ability to erode our sovereignty and democracy. It is not something we as decision makers should be doing lightly.


This agreement that we have in front of us today that the minister tabled in his ministerial statement includes a national interest analysis, but you will not find a single negative word in there, even though there are of course always costs as well as benefits in trade deals. DFAT and Mr Andrew Robb have marked their own homework and give themselves top marks, although the World Bank and other independent economic forecasters have said there will be virtually no benefit to Australia and very little benefit to the US. Yet this is trumpeted as the best thing since sliced bread—rivers of gold for our country. What it actually does is enclose risks that we as parliamentarians are going to have to face and, if we do not fix it, that our children's generation, when they come to parliament, are going to have to face.

AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION AMENDMENT (NATIONAL POLICING INFORMATION) BILL 2015


CrimTrac and the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) are two of Australia's most important national law enforcement bodies, created to provide police with access to national policing information and intelligence. Both agencies are shared national assets that reflect the cooperative approach between jurisdictions that is central to Australia's response to crime. 


The Australian Crime Commission Amendment (National Policing Information) Bill – or the merger Bill – implements the historic decision of all of Australia's Attorneys-General, police and justice ministers to bring CrimTrac and the ACC together under one banner. 


This Bill forms a package with the Australian Crime Commission (National Policing Information Charges) Bill, which will allow the merged agency to continue the self‑funded model that has supported CrimTrac's services for over a decade at no cost to the Budget.


The merged agency would be supported by a new Intergovernmental Agreement to ensure that it maintains a focus on providing national information systems to police, as CrimTrac currently does. 


These systems and services are critical to supporting day‑to‑day policing and the investigation of all forms of crime, from terrorism to street crime to drug trafficking to domestic violence.


Australia has first-rate police and intelligence agencies that are highly capable, professional and committed to protecting the community. 


We need to make sure that these agencies continue to have access to the tools and information they need to do their job. 


Merging CrimTrac with the ACC continues this Government's commitment to ensuring Australian law enforcement agencies are in the best possible position to protect us from criminal and national security threats. 


A merger will enrich the ACC's critical intelligence function with direct access to CrimTrac's national police information holdings and sophisticated information technology capabilities. 


This will improve the quality, access and timeliness of the intelligence that the merged agency provides to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. 


Improved intelligence will better equip these agencies to detect and disrupt significant threats, such as terrorism, international drug trafficking and cybercrime. 




Key measures 



The Merger Bill contains a number of amendments to give effect to the proposed arrangements for the merged agency.


Primarily, the Merger Bill amends the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (ACC Act)to enable the merged agency to carry out all of CrimTrac's functions. These functions will be referred to as 'national policing information' functions under the merged agency structure. This includes making national information sharing systems available to police and providing nationally coordinated criminal history checks.


The Merger Bill will also change some of the merged agency's governance arrangements. Currently, the ACC and CrimTrac are both governed by Boards. Following a merger, there would be a single Board overseeing the merged agency. 


The amendments enable the Board to set high‑level priorities for the merged agency's new national policing information functions. They also provide the Board with additional, specific functions currently exercised by the CrimTrac Board. 


Amongst other things, this includes making recommendations to the relevant Commonwealth Minister about expenditure from the National Policing Information Systems and Services Special Account. 


The Special Account was established under the Howard Government to support Crimtrac to develop and maintain new and existing information sharing systems for Australia's police forces. 


These amendments will ensure that state and territory Police Commissioners will continue to play a key role in decisions that directly affect their agencies.


The Merger Bill will also make changes to the merged agency's information disclosure regime. These ensure that the merged agency can continue to share national policing information, in the same way as CrimTrac currently does, and provide nationally coordinated criminal history checks to a range of stakeholders.




Continuing the CrimTrac funding model



CrimTrac is entirely self-funded through revenue generated primarily from criminal history checks. This has allowed CrimTrac to provide services to police and the community at no cost to the Budget. 


The measures in these Bills will ensure the continued financial security of policing information services. 


The Charges Bill will allow the merged agency to impose charges for certain services, in order to fund or subsidise the provision of other services to police and the community. 


The Merger Bill will provide a mechanism for the Board, which comprises representatives from each jurisdiction, to make recommendations to the Commonwealth Minister regarding these charges. This reflects the national nature of the merged agency and its national information holdings. 


The Merger Bill will also allow the merged agency to charge fees on a cost recovery basis for discrete services, separate to the revenue mechanism in the Charges Bill. 


The revenue that CrimTrac currently generates accrues into the National Policing Information Systems and Services Special Account. 


This allows revenue generated by CrimTrac to be kept separate from other Commonwealth funds and readily invested in national policing information services. 


The Merger Bill will continue the Special Account, set out the funds that must be credited to the Account, and the purposes for which the Account may be debited.


These provisions ensure that the Special Account will continue to support the provision of information sharing systems and services to police. 


Consistent with this, the merged agency will only be able to use the Special Account for CrimTrac-type, national policing information purposes.




Conclusion



These Bills implement an important merger of Australia's two key law enforcement information and intelligence agencies. The merged agency will be better able to fulfil its role as Australia's national criminal intelligence agency, supporting and informing the efforts of law enforcement agencies around Australia. 


At the same time, the merged agency will continue to provide nationally coordinated, high quality information technology systems and services to Australian police, which are critical to supporting day-to-day operations.


AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION (NATIONAL POLICING INFORMATION CHARGES) BILL 2015


This Bill forms a package with the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (National Policing Information) Bill – or the merger Bill, which implements the historic decision of all of Australia's Attorneys-General, police and justice ministers to bring CrimTrac and the ACC together under one banner. 


CrimTrac's success as a cooperative federal scheme supporting the information needs of police has been built on its self-funded business model.


This Bill will allow the merged agency to impose charges for certain services, in order to fund or subsidise the provision of other services to police and the community. 


This reflects CrimTrac's current arrangements, where criminal history checking provides most of the funding for other services. However, the Bill will also enable the merged agency to charge for new services in the future, should this be desirable. This will ensure that the business model can adapt to meet emerging police and government needs. 


The Bill will create a mechanism to allow the Minister to specify in a legislative instrument the services that the merged agency will charge for, who has to pay the charges, and the amount of each charge. 


This provides the merged agency with the flexibility to impose different charges for different classes of persons, such as reduced charges for volunteers seeking criminal history checks. 




Conclusion



This Bill is a key ingredient in the merger of CrimTrac and the ACC. 


CrimTrac's nationally coordinated, high quality information technology systems and services are critical to supporting day-to-day policing operations. The importance of these services will only grow, as crime and criminal methodology change. 


This Bill will allow the merged agency to continue to provide these services to Australian police in an adaptable and fiscally sustainable way.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (21:00):  When this debate was interrupted by question time some hours ago I was talking about the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looking into the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Proceeds of Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2015. We had reached a stage where I was indicating the committee's view on new proposed section 319. Senator McKim, who is a member of the committee and who discussed this in his contribution, indicated that the Greens had some difficulty with this and would be moving amendments. I might say that these were amendments and issues that were not raised with the committee when it tabled what I assumed was a unanimous report but which has turned out, from what the Greens have told us, not to be so. I was indicating that the new proposed section 319 said that a court may under the Proceeds of Crime Act delay any proceedings if the court considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so. But then proposed section 319(2) said that a court may not stay any proceedings on any of the grounds listed, and Senator McKim has gone through those.


I will just reiterate what I was saying when the debate was interrupted, and that is that these grounds set out in proposed subsection (2) are designed to prevent a respondent from claiming merely a generalised risk of prejudice to support a stay of proceedings which would have flow-on effects for the availability of evidence, would impede the operation of the non-conviction based scheme and would frustrate the objects of the Proceeds of Crime Act. I was indicating that this is all about serious criminal activity by organised criminal gangs and by terrorists, and the government is introducing this amending bill as part of its overall fight against crime, particularly organised crime, and crime that supports terrorism around the world.


I do not want to keep the Senate too long but I can refer senators interested in this particular piece of legislation to the report of the committee, which has been tabled in the parliament. There were a number of interesting matters raised by the committee. I refer senators to the amended definition of 'manufacture' in proposed section 305.1(1) which specifies that it includes any process other than cultivation of a plant by which a substance is produced, extracted, refined or transformed into a different substance or converted from one form to another. That amendment responds to a 2013 case in the Victorian Court of Appeal where it interpreted the definition of 'manufacture' to require that the process produce a new substance, not merely convert a substance from one form into another. It is these sorts of legal technicalities that some of this bill is introduced to address.


This bill was looked at by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee—and that has been referred to by previous speakers—a well as the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The committee has gone into the bill in some detail. I will mention just some parts of the committee's investigation in relation to the civil forfeiture scheme. The committee took seriously the concerns raised in submissions regarding the fundamental rights and constitutional principles that may be impacted on by these proposed amendments, but at the same time the committee was cognisant of the importance of an effective proceeds of crime regime in combating serious crime and those who benefit from crime, as emphasised by the department and supported by a number of other submitters.


The committee acknowledged the department's advice that these amendments were developed in consultation with key stakeholders, with a view to striking the appropriate balance between effectively combating crime on the one hand and on the other hand respecting the fundamental rights and principles underlying the Australian criminal justice system. The committee noted that the amended legislation will, if necessary, be tested in the courts, which the committee believes will be well placed to determine the questions of constitutionality and fundamental rights that have been raised in this inquiry.


I draw the Senate's attention to the section of the bill relating to intention and recklessness. The committee joins submitters from both within and outside government in welcoming these proposed new offences which will not only support Australia's compliance with its international obligations but go further in helping combat a range of financial crimes. The committee regarded the breadth of the proposed offences and the potentially serious penalties for those who commit them as appropriate in the circumstances.


The committee looked at the possibility of retrospectivity in relation to schedules 4 and 5. The Law Council had raised a concern about the potential with retrospective operation of both those schedules to permit the use and disclosure of personal information collected prior to the passage of the bill. The department, when questioned about this, did not agree with the Law Council's concern that the provisions may have retrospective effect, stating that the proposed amendment does not seek to retrospectively alter legal rights or obligations; it simply seeks to provide legislative certainty regarding the scope of existing powers under the money laundering act. The department advised that AUSTRAC already provided information about access to and disclosure of information on its website.


I might say that the committee always looks closely at possible retrospective impacts—they are something that I personally believe are anathema to any parliament. In this instance the committee was satisfied by the department's explanation that the legislative certainty and clarity for information sharing by AUSTRAC and AusCheck with other agencies would be achieved by schedules 4 and 5. The department emphasised the importance of the interagency information sharing for the work of the Australian Border Force, including in light of its counterterrorism role and the detection of increasing attempts to take undeclared currency out of Australia.


In all, the committee was of the view that the bill, because it seeks to combat a number of serious and complex criminal activities within Commonwealth jurisdiction, including organised crime, bribery and duplicitous financial conduct, trade in illicit drugs, money laundering and financing of terrorism, deserved the support of the parliament. 


In concluding I emphasise that this is all part of the government's ongoing campaign against serious organised crime and the financing of terrorism. The committee did have some queries, which we raised in writing with the department, but with the assistance of the information and clarifications provided by the department and others on these questions the committee is satisfied that the bill strikes the appropriate balance within each of its legislative schemes, bearing in mind the important matters of criminal justice and national security that are at stake. For those reasons the committee recommended that the bill be passed. I urge upon the Senate a consideration and acceptance of the committee's recommendations.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (21:10):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill, which will make significant improvements to the Commonwealth criminal justice arrangements. Serious and organised crime poses a significant threat to Australian communities. The government is committed to ensuring our nation is safe and secure and to taking tough steps to strike at the heart of organised crime. 


The Commonwealth proceeds of crime scheme is an effective weapon in the fight against serious and organised crime. This scheme allows law enforcement agencies to confiscate illicit proceeds from a person to prevent them reinvesting these funds in further in illegal activities. Confiscation proceedings often take place at the same time that criminal charges against a person are being pursued. In response to recent court decisions, this bill clarifies that authorities may proceed with confiscation action under the Proceeds of Crime Act where there are related criminal matters on foot. The amendment seeks to ensure that confiscation proceedings are only stayed where absolutely necessary, as staying proceedings until after a criminal trial is complete would create a significant delay and would undermine the intention of a non-conviction-based forfeiture scheme under the act. This measure is supplemented by additional protections that aim to reduce the risk of prejudice to an accused in relation to criminal proceedings. The bill also makes a technical amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act that will clarify that matters relating to restraint of assets should be heard and finalised before forfeiture applications are heard. 


A robust proceedings of crime scheme is vital in the fight against crime. This bill takes a balanced approach to maintaining the resilience of the Commonwealth proceeds of crime laws, whilst ensuring that a respondent's rights are appropriately protected. 


The bill will also introduce two new offences of false dealing with accounting documents. These measures reflect the government's zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption in all its forms. The new offences will implement Australia's obligations under the OECD antibribery convention. In particular, they will implement a recommendation of the OECD Working Group on Bribery that Australia should increase the maximum sanctions available against legal persons for false accounting under Commonwealth legislation. By creating these two new offences the government is demonstrating its commitment to stamping out white-collar crime.


The bill also makes new amendments to improve the clarity and efficacy of the serious drug offences. They will ensure that these offences apply to all substances that are structurally similar to listed illicit drugs and to all manufacturing processes, irrespective of whether they create a new substance or convert a substance from one form to another. These amendments will make the legislative framework for serious drug offences stronger, clearer and more effective. They will assist our law enforcement agencies in their important work to stop the supply of illicit drugs and bring traffickers and manufacturers to justice, forming another part of the government's continuing work to tackle serious and organised crime, including serious drug offending.


The bill also contains a number of amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to remove operational constraints identified by law enforcement agencies, facilitate access to financial intelligence information and improve information sharing. The financial intelligence information obtained by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre plays a central role in identifying and preventing terrorist and criminal activity. Recent terror events across the world have highlighted that very little is required to conduct an attack and that the time frame between planning an execution and execution is shrinking. In this environment, the ability to share information quickly between those who need it is critical to preventing the loss of innocent lives. By enabling information to be shared faster and more easily, including with key agencies such as Interpol and Europol, this bill will maximise intelligence value and assist regional and international partner agencies in the early identification, targeting and disruption of terrorism and transnational crimes, where time is often of the essence. By providing the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption of South Australia with access to AUSTRAC's financial intelligence data holdings, this bill will also considerably enhance the commissioner's ability to investigate serious and systemic corruption and misconduct in public administration.


The amendments made by schedule 5 of this bill will ensure that AusCheck's information-sharing provisions are better suited to the current law enforcement and national security environment. It is important that AusCheck can share information with relevant and accredited Commonwealth, state and territory agencies for law enforcement and national security purposes. Information shared by AusCheck is already protected by strong and appropriate safeguards. These safeguards will continue to apply to information shared under the revised provisions.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2016-02-22,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (21:15):  I mentioned in my second reading contribution that the Australian Greens have significant concerns about the proposed new section 319. I want to going to a bit more detail about those concerns now. The government is effectively proposing to trade away people's rights to a fair trial in order to expedite proceeds of crime proceedings.  This concern is held not just by the Australian Greens but by many organisations, including, as I said in my speech on the second reading, the Victorian Bar and Criminal Bar Association, the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Human Rights Commission. 


I would like to place a few detailed matters on the record from some of those organisations. The Australian Human Rights Commission, in its submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on 6 January this year, said:


The second issue of concern for the Commission is that some of the grounds which the proposed new s 319 would require a court to ignore are highly likely to result in prejudice to an accused person and increase the risk that their trial would not be fair.


The Law Council of Australia's submission makes their view very clear, stating:


A relevant question that may be required to be answered is whether limiting the discretion of a court as to when it may order a stay of proceedings in the manner proposed by the Bill is accompanied by adequate safeguards to ensure the:


• Constitutionally protected fair trial of an accused will not be prejudiced; and


• The court retains power over its processes thereby preserving the separation of powers as required by the Constitution.


The Victorian Bar and Criminal Bar Association submission is critical of the explanatory memorandum circulated by the government in support of this legislation. Paragraph 34 of their submission states:


Paragraph 49 of the Explanatory Memorandum states:


""The amendments clarify that proceedings under the Act may only be stayed where the granting of a stay is the only means of addressing the circumstances (i.e. the prejudice that may result to a concurrent or subsequent criminal trial).""


Paragraph 35 states:


It is submitted the proposed amendments do not achieve that purpose. To the contrary, the proposed amendments proscribe the Court's inherent power to order a stay where there is a risk the concurrent POC proceedings would prejudice a pending criminal trial.


Paragraph 36 then states:


It is submitted the proposed amendments amount to a grave infringement of the rights of an accused to a fair criminal trial. The proposed amendments will compel a person charged with a criminal office, who wishes to defend POC proceedings, to give evidence in the POC proceedings in advance of his or her criminal trial about matters to which the criminal trial relates.


When you have a good look at proposed new section 319, you see that it does give rise to significant questions for the government. During the committee stage of this bill, I would appreciate a response to these questions from the minister if possible.


We need to place on record that we understand that the first part of proposed new section 319 provides that a court may stay proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act that are not criminal proceedings if the court considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so. However, proposed new section 319 then goes on to provide a list of  grounds on which a court must not stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings. This is the first question I have for the minister: is it the government's intent that, even though a court may decide that it has grounds to stay proceedings because it is, in the court's view, in the interests of justice to do so, it is prevented from staying proceedings on the grounds listed in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of proposed new section 319? If it is the case that the court cannot stay proceedings on grounds that are listed in (2)(a), (2)(b), (2)(c)(i) and (2)(d), even if the court believes that it is in the interests of justice that the proceedings be stayed, I think the government has a constitutional issue on its hands, and that is the constitutional protections around the right to a fair trial in this country. That is the first question: is it the government's intent that the grounds laid out in section 319(2) would prevent a court from staying proceedings, even if the court formed a view that those grounds constituted reasons to stay the proceedings in the interests of justice?


The other question I would like to ask while I am on my feet is: can the minister provide any advice to the Senate on the grounds it might be open to the court to stay proceedings in the interests of justice? To describe the provisions of the proposed new section 319(2) as broad does them a disservice. They are massively wide grounds that the government is seeking courts from using to stay proceeds of crime proceedings. In the new section 319(2) (c)(ii), it becomes clear from reading that subsection that the court must not stay proceeds of crime proceedings on the ground that 'evidence is, or may be, relevant to a matter that is, or may be, at issue in criminal proceedings that have been, are proposed to be or may be instituted or commenced'. Basically, the court is going to have to form a view of the likelihood of criminal proceedings which may or may not be commenced at some time in the future before it can to decide whether that subsection becomes a trigger for the substantive provision in subsection (2), which is that the court must not stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings on those grounds.


To describe them as broad, as I have said, is doing them a disservice; they are incredibly broad provisions. They are so broad that I am forced to ask the minister: can he possibly come up with a reason that a court may reasonably consider it in the interests of justice to stay proceedings that is not covered by the proposed new section 319(2)? Can we collectively in this place conceive of a reason that proceedings can be stayed by a court because the court considers that it is in the interests of justice to stay proceedings that are not caught by subsection (2)? I am personally struggling to come up with a reason that a court might reasonably use that it is in the interests of justice that proceeds of crime proceedings be stayed that has not been ruled out by the proposed section 319(2). That is how broad that subsection is.


I would also like an answer, Minister, if possible—I am not asking for the Solicitor-General's advice to be tabled—to the question: was the constitutionality or otherwise tested through the Solicitor-General prior to this legislation being introduced? If so, what matters were raised? It was the view of some submitters to the committee process that this legislation could lead to circumstances where a right to a fair trial, which is a fundamental right in this country, would be prejudiced. That is something we ought to avoid at all costs in this place. I heard earlier today from the minister who has carriage of this bill reference to the fact that stays of Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings can frustrate the intent of the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, but, surely, it is more important that someone get a fair trial in this country than that those proceedings be handled expeditiously so that the Commonwealth can get its hands on any assets which may be delivered to the Commonwealth off the back of proceeds of crime act proceedings.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (21:28):  I thank the senator for the questions—they were comprehensive—but in my answer, being a bloke, I might not have picked up on all of them. So if you can ask the question again for anything I have not covered, I would appreciate that. You start of making the assertion that we seek to remove the rights to a fair trial. I hope that was just a glib throw-in there, because that is not what we are motivated by. We are actually motivated to ensure that if there is a particular mischief where someone can continually delay proceedings and, whilst those proceedings are being delayed, they are separated by some sort of lean being placed over disposal of assets or spending of assets and that has seen to be done, then we need to ensure that the court has some guidelines around the nature of the circumstances where a stay in proceedings may take place.


I note that Senator McKim has quoted from the Victorian Bar Association, and I note, without giving him too hard a time on it, he is in fact a member of the committee. I looked carefully at the committee report and I note there is no dissenting report from the Greens. That is okay, we are all busy in this place, so I am not giving you too tough a time. I understand this amendment arrived just before question time, and sometimes it is difficult to deal with these things. This is quite a simple amendment to speak to, but given the amount that the committee put into this, it has not been done in a way that has been glib or flippant. A lot of people have put a lot of time into this. Two committees, both the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Senate Selection of Bills Committee, reported on the bills. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee provided further information that has now been included as an addendum to an explanatory memorandum to explain those matters. We have comprehensively looked into this.


The challenge is, fundamentally, that if we accepted the amendments the Greens are putting forward it would protect the mischief that this legislation seeks to remove, which is why we would not support them. But we should look to the answers to Senator McKim's specific questions so that we can make that case. He asks if the court could use its discretion on all matters not described. The most important point is that the proposed subsections 319 (2), (3), (4) and (5), which are all the matters he was talking about, are in fact matters that would limit but not remove the overarching discretion of the court under proposed subsection 319(1) to stay proceedings. So it only limits it. The proposed changes would not remove the discretion to grant a stay, but they have the effect of ensuring that a person who is seeking a stay of proceedings has to explain to the court the risk of prejudice in the circumstances, rather than simply stating that they or another person may face charges or may have to give evidence in relation to a criminal matter at a future date. So they cannot just assert that—they have to require a person seeking that to explain it to the court. It is quite clear that it does not remove the overarching discretion of a court under proposed subsection 319(1).


Senator McKim also mentioned that the court may reasonably have a view not to stay proceedings and what were the circumstances under which that would happen. As I have said, they are not prescribed. Outside of the matters in section 319, which describes what a person is required to provide, the legislation is silent on the remainder. The court would have complete purview over the remainder to make a decision on those matters. Constitutionality has been tested, and I am advised it has been tested with the Solicitor-General. The government takes comfort from that advice.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (21:33):  I thank the minister sincerely for his responses, particularly his willingness to make it clear to the Senate that there was advice sought from the Solicitor-General and that the government has taken comfort from the advice. I will place a couple of matters on the record in response to the minister and then perhaps ask a couple of follow-up questions. Firstly, I make it very clear that I may be a relatively new member of this place but I am well aware that there is nothing that would prevent me from moving amendments to a piece of legislation even if, as is the case in this circumstance, I was the member of a committee that had reported on a piece of legislation without a dissenting report. Parliamentary committees are here to advise the parliament, not to dictate to us what we should do.


I have to take slight issue with the minister's language. These are not guidelines—and that is in fact the problem here. These are not guidelines for courts; this is not a list of things that a court must consider before determining whether or not Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings should be stayed. They are not at all a list of matters a court must consider—these are a list of grounds on which a court must not stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings. That is very different from guidelines. What the Greens are asking the Senate to do here tonight is agree to include in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 a list of grounds on which a court must not stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings. 


Some might think that we are having a semantic debate here, but I do not think we are having just a semantic debate. I want to gently remind you, Minister, of one of the questions you may not have retained—because you are a bloke!—which was that I asked for clarification on the legislation on this hypothetical ground: if a court formed a view that in the interests of justice it should stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings on one of the grounds contained in subsection (2), is it able to act in what it considers to be the interests of justice or not?


I think you will find the answer to that is 'no'. If that is the case, we need to be very clear about what we are doing here. We are preventing a court in Australia from acting in what it believes is the interests of justice. That is almost Monty Pythonesque in its absurdity. You are basically saying to a court: 'You, Justice, can form a reasonable view that in the interests of justice certain proceedings should be stayed, but we are actually going to prevent you from doing that by inserting a list of grounds on which you cannot stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings even if you think such a stay is in the interests of justice.' And that is the matter I am trying to explore here, because that is a very serious matter that you are asking the Senate to consider here. Effectively, you are asking us to agree with your proposal that a court be prevented from staying proceeds of crime proceedings even if that court has reasonably arrived a view that it is in the interests of justice to stay the proceedings. I can see you have a response, Minister, so I will sit down and hand over to you.

In error, I indicated that the advice had in fact come from the Solicitor-General. What I should have told you was that it was the Australian government solicitor. My apologies. In your hypothetical, you are suggesting that a court may in some circumstances be compelled to do a particular thing. It is a balancing act, but I think without a doubt proposed section 319(1) is the overarching discretion of the court to make a decision on the stayed proceedings. It still will lie with the court. And please accept my apologies and retraction for the information I provided in error.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (21:40):  Thank you for the clarification, Minister. That is appreciated. You have bounced us back to the proposed section 319(1), which I accept gives power to the courts to stay proceedings that are not criminal proceedings if the court considers that it is in the interests of justice to do. It is worth reflecting on previous High Court decisions, one in particular that has actually supported that power of certain courts in Australia. Even though we welcome it being explicit in this legislation, we would argue that in jurisprudence that power already has been confirmed by the High Court. But I am specifically asking about a court which reasonably forms a view that it is in the interests of justice to stay a Proceeds of Crime Act proceeding on one of the grounds contained in proposed subsection (2). At the moment, given your responses, I think we have some drafting ambiguity here—in fact that term was used in at least one of the submissions to one of the committee inquiries in relation to this legislation. Again, Minister, I draw your attention to the hypothetical circumstance where a court forms a view that it is in the interests of justice to stay a Proceeds of Crime Act proceeding on one of the grounds in proposed subsection (2). Can the court stay the proceeding or not? That is the question.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (21:42):  As I have already indicated, the amendments in proposed subsections (2) to (5) are basically saying what is not sufficient. The case is quite explicit. It is not for a person to simply state if this is the case. All they are asking to do is rather than just simply saying, 'There is another person that may face charges or might have to give evidence in relation to a criminal trial at a future date,' these amendments have the effect of requiring a person seeking that stay to actually explain to the court the risk of the prejudice in the circumstances. But again, we have comfort from proposed section 319(1) that the final overarching discretion of the court is we rely on proposed section 319(1) to stay proceedings. As I indicated and you would know from the report, this area was covered significantly in evidence and in the report. I will not assert something I do not know, because I am not sure about the Australian Government Solicitor's report. I am not familiar with the legal advice, but I think it is a reasonable assumption that these would be matters that they would all have focused upon, and given the comfort that I am advised the government has from the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor, I would think that the advice I am provided with, the proposed subsections (2) to (5) limit but certainly do not remove the overarching discretion of the court under the proposal section 319(1) to stay proceedings. I hope that is clear.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (21:43):  That is clear as far as it goes. The proposed new section 319(2) certainly does limit the capacity of courts to stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings. I have heard a few times that one of the government's intents here is to ensure that someone just cannot claim a general need to stay proceedings; they need to be more precise about arguing their reasons. I accept that to a degree, but I have to point out that a person could argue detail on one of the grounds contained in the proposed new section 319(2) till the cows come home and the courts still would not be able to stay the proceedings, no matter how much detail was provided. That section is explicit. If that is not the case, Minister, please stand up and say so, so that we can move on to other matters in this legislation. But we have not yet had an answer to the very simple question: if a court formed a reasonable view that in the interests of justice it should stay Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings on one of the grounds in proposed subsection (2), could it stay the proceedings or not? It is actually a 'yes' or 'no' question.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (21:45):  Again, I will in a more general sense say that the overarching discretion of the court under proposed section 319(1) preserves the court's rights of overarching discretion and that is in a very lay sense—even I can understand that. I think that deals with this. The amendments clarify that proceedings under the act may only be stayed where the granting of a stay is the only means of addressing the circumstances—that is, potentially the prejudice that may result from a concurrent or subsequent criminal trial.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (21:46):  I am genuinely not trying to be difficult here. A couple of times now in response to that question, you have referred me back to the proposed new section 319(1), which you described as—I do not think I am misquoting you—an overarching discretion of the court. It might be worth referring you to the Australian Human Rights Commission's submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee section 5.1, which starts at paragraph 33. It is actually headed: Ambiguity in drafting. This is the point I am trying to make. What I am trying to do here is place on the record the government's intent because that may become a question in subsequent High Court proceedings. So is it the government's intent that a court that is hearing a Proceeds of Crime Act matter can in fact stay proceedings on grounds contained in the proposed new section 319 subsection 2? Does that overarching discretion of the court retained even on grounds that are listed in proposed subsection 2—in other words, does proposed 319(1) override proposed 319(2) or does proposed 319(2) override proposed 319(1)?


My reading of this is pretty clear, as someone who has sat for through an awful lot of similar debates in the Tasmanian parliament for well over a decade as the Greens justice spokesperson. My reading of this legislation is that the court retains an overarching discretion to stay proceedings but not on any of the grounds contained in the proposed new section 319(2). That would be my reading of this legislation. I am simply trying to distil the government's intent here. Is it the government's intent that a court cannot stay proceedings on grounds listed in proposed section 319(2) even if it believes that it is the interests of justice to stay those proceedings?

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (21:48):  The court is not able to stay proceedings merely on the grounds on proposed section 319(2). The court will need to consider, as it does in almost every case, individual circumstances of the case. To determine whether there are reasons on that ground, such as the risk of prejudice, which is what it is about, to determine a stay is necessary in the interests of justice.


Whilst I am on my feet, we thought it was important in the context of the amendments that you have moved, you have effectively removed subsections 319 (2) and (5), and I understand why that is the case. The challenge is that that would not then be able to prevent a respondent from obtaining a stay and delaying the determinations of a proceeds-of-crime proceeding simply put simply by claiming there was a risk of prejudice in a related or concurrent or subsequent criminal proceedings. As I started off in response to you, I will describe what I thought was— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-02-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (21:00):  When this debate was interrupted by question time some hours ago I was talking about the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looking into the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Proceeds of Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2015. We had reached a stage where I was indicating the committee's view on new proposed section 319. Senator McKim, who is a member of the committee and who discussed this in his contribution, indicated that the Greens had some difficulty with this and would be moving amendments. I might say that these were amendments and issues that were not raised with the committee when it tabled what I assumed was a unanimous report but which has turned out, from what the Greens have told us, not to be so. I was indicating that the new proposed section 319 said that a court may under the Proceeds of Crime Act delay any proceedings if the court considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so. But then proposed section 319(2) said that a court may not stay any proceedings on any of the grounds listed, and Senator McKim has gone through those.


I will just reiterate what I was saying when the debate was interrupted, and that is that these grounds set out in proposed subsection (2) are designed to prevent a respondent from claiming merely a generalised risk of prejudice to support a stay of proceedings which would have flow-on effects for the availability of evidence, would impede the operation of the non-conviction based scheme and would frustrate the objects of the Proceeds of Crime Act. I was indicating that this is all about serious criminal activity by organised criminal gangs and by terrorists, and the government is introducing this amending bill as part of its overall fight against crime, particularly organised crime, and crime that supports terrorism around the world.


I do not want to keep the Senate too long but I can refer senators interested in this particular piece of legislation to the report of the committee, which has been tabled in the parliament. There were a number of interesting matters raised by the committee. I refer senators to the amended definition of 'manufacture' in proposed section 305.1(1) which specifies that it includes any process other than cultivation of a plant by which a substance is produced, extracted, refined or transformed into a different substance or converted from one form to another. That amendment responds to a 2013 case in the Victorian Court of Appeal where it interpreted the definition of 'manufacture' to require that the process produce a new substance, not merely convert a substance from one form into another. It is these sorts of legal technicalities that some of this bill is introduced to address.


This bill was looked at by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee—and that has been referred to by previous speakers—a well as the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The committee has gone into the bill in some detail. I will mention just some parts of the committee's investigation in relation to the civil forfeiture scheme. The committee took seriously the concerns raised in submissions regarding the fundamental rights and constitutional principles that may be impacted on by these proposed amendments, but at the same time the committee was cognisant of the importance of an effective proceeds of crime regime in combating serious crime and those who benefit from crime, as emphasised by the department and supported by a number of other submitters.


The committee acknowledged the department's advice that these amendments were developed in consultation with key stakeholders, with a view to striking the appropriate balance between effectively combating crime on the one hand and on the other hand respecting the fundamental rights and principles underlying the Australian criminal justice system. The committee noted that the amended legislation will, if necessary, be tested in the courts, which the committee believes will be well placed to determine the questions of constitutionality and fundamental rights that have been raised in this inquiry.


I draw the Senate's attention to the section of the bill relating to intention and recklessness. The committee joins submitters from both within and outside government in welcoming these proposed new offences which will not only support Australia's compliance with its international obligations but go further in helping combat a range of financial crimes. The committee regarded the breadth of the proposed offences and the potentially serious penalties for those who commit them as appropriate in the circumstances.


The committee looked at the possibility of retrospectivity in relation to schedules 4 and 5. The Law Council had raised a concern about the potential with retrospective operation of both those schedules to permit the use and disclosure of personal information collected prior to the passage of the bill. The department, when questioned about this, did not agree with the Law Council's concern that the provisions may have retrospective effect, stating that the proposed amendment does not seek to retrospectively alter legal rights or obligations; it simply seeks to provide legislative certainty regarding the scope of existing powers under the money laundering act. The department advised that AUSTRAC already provided information about access to and disclosure of information on its website.


I might say that the committee always looks closely at possible retrospective impacts—they are something that I personally believe are anathema to any parliament. In this instance the committee was satisfied by the department's explanation that the legislative certainty and clarity for information sharing by AUSTRAC and AusCheck with other agencies would be achieved by schedules 4 and 5. The department emphasised the importance of the interagency information sharing for the work of the Australian Border Force, including in light of its counterterrorism role and the detection of increasing attempts to take undeclared currency out of Australia.


In all, the committee was of the view that the bill, because it seeks to combat a number of serious and complex criminal activities within Commonwealth jurisdiction, including organised crime, bribery and duplicitous financial conduct, trade in illicit drugs, money laundering and financing of terrorism, deserved the support of the parliament. 


In concluding I emphasise that this is all part of the government's ongoing campaign against serious organised crime and the financing of terrorism. The committee did have some queries, which we raised in writing with the department, but with the assistance of the information and clarifications provided by the department and others on these questions the committee is satisfied that the bill strikes the appropriate balance within each of its legislative schemes, bearing in mind the important matters of criminal justice and national security that are at stake. For those reasons the committee recommended that the bill be passed. I urge upon the Senate a consideration and acceptance of the committee's recommendations.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (21:10):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill, which will make significant improvements to the Commonwealth criminal justice arrangements. Serious and organised crime poses a significant threat to Australian communities. The government is committed to ensuring our nation is safe and secure and to taking tough steps to strike at the heart of organised crime. 


The Commonwealth proceeds of crime scheme is an effective weapon in the fight against serious and organised crime. This scheme allows law enforcement agencies to confiscate illicit proceeds from a person to prevent them reinvesting these funds in further in illegal activities. Confiscation proceedings often take place at the same time that criminal charges against a person are being pursued. In response to recent court decisions, this bill clarifies that authorities may proceed with confiscation action under the Proceeds of Crime Act where there are related criminal matters on foot. The amendment seeks to ensure that confiscation proceedings are only stayed where absolutely necessary, as staying proceedings until after a criminal trial is complete would create a significant delay and would undermine the intention of a non-conviction-based forfeiture scheme under the act. This measure is supplemented by additional protections that aim to reduce the risk of prejudice to an accused in relation to criminal proceedings. The bill also makes a technical amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act that will clarify that matters relating to restraint of assets should be heard and finalised before forfeiture applications are heard. 


A robust proceedings of crime scheme is vital in the fight against crime. This bill takes a balanced approach to maintaining the resilience of the Commonwealth proceeds of crime laws, whilst ensuring that a respondent's rights are appropriately protected. 


The bill will also introduce two new offences of false dealing with accounting documents. These measures reflect the government's zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption in all its forms. The new offences will implement Australia's obligations under the OECD antibribery convention. In particular, they will implement a recommendation of the OECD Working Group on Bribery that Australia should increase the maximum sanctions available against legal persons for false accounting under Commonwealth legislation. By creating these two new offences the government is demonstrating its commitment to stamping out white-collar crime.


The bill also makes new amendments to improve the clarity and efficacy of the serious drug offences. They will ensure that these offences apply to all substances that are structurally similar to listed illicit drugs and to all manufacturing processes, irrespective of whether they create a new substance or convert a substance from one form to another. These amendments will make the legislative framework for serious drug offences stronger, clearer and more effective. They will assist our law enforcement agencies in their important work to stop the supply of illicit drugs and bring traffickers and manufacturers to justice, forming another part of the government's continuing work to tackle serious and organised crime, including serious drug offending.


The bill also contains a number of amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to remove operational constraints identified by law enforcement agencies, facilitate access to financial intelligence information and improve information sharing. The financial intelligence information obtained by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre plays a central role in identifying and preventing terrorist and criminal activity. Recent terror events across the world have highlighted that very little is required to conduct an attack and that the time frame between planning an execution and execution is shrinking. In this environment, the ability to share information quickly between those who need it is critical to preventing the loss of innocent lives. By enabling information to be shared faster and more easily, including with key agencies such as Interpol and Europol, this bill will maximise intelligence value and assist regional and international partner agencies in the early identification, targeting and disruption of terrorism and transnational crimes, where time is often of the essence. By providing the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption of South Australia with access to AUSTRAC's financial intelligence data holdings, this bill will also considerably enhance the commissioner's ability to investigate serious and systemic corruption and misconduct in public administration.


The amendments made by schedule 5 of this bill will ensure that AusCheck's information-sharing provisions are better suited to the current law enforcement and national security environment. It is important that AusCheck can share information with relevant and accredited Commonwealth, state and territory agencies for law enforcement and national security purposes. Information shared by AusCheck is already protected by strong and appropriate safeguards. These safeguards will continue to apply to information shared under the revised provisions.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (21:50):  Tomorrow morning I will be presenting a petition to the Senate which calls on the government and the education minister to remove all federal funding from the Safe Schools Coalition program because it goes beyond education and compels students into advocacy of a social engineering agenda. In less than a week, 9,499 concerned Australians signed the petition demonstrating that there are many that are worried about this propaganda in our schools.


Let us have a look at some of the examples that the All Of Us teaching resource, which is aimed at children as young as 11 years old, contains. It invites these 11-year-olds to imagine themselves in the role of a young person who is 16 years or older and going out with someone that they are really into. It tells students on one side of the room that their character is going out with someone of the same sex while the characters of those on the other side of the room are going out with someone of the opposite sex—these are 11-year-old children. It tells these children they have got to respond to 10 questions which they need to answer. If they do not answer in the affirmative, they are left standing humiliated in front of the class. Let us remember this program is designed to stamp out bullying, yet it bullies and intimidates children into giving the answers demanded by the authors.


They ask children to imagine that they have no genitals when they are talking about their gender. It says that most students will mention their genitals when identifying themselves as male or female and it extends this discussion by asking students what it would mean in terms of their gender if they were to lose that part of themselves. It beggars belief that we are asking 11-year-olds to identify themselves or imagine themselves as having no genitals. There are so many alarming aspects to these teachings, because it isolates children in front of their class. It bullies them and intimidates them if they do not comply with what is a very clear LGBTI agenda. It is a form of bullying. It is intimidation of students. It is pushing them to conform to a certain world view. It asks children as young as 11 to imagine themselves in a sexualised, or hypersexualised, environment.


One psychologist, Dr Nick Kowalenko, the head of child psychiatry at the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists said that it might be helpful for children experiencing identity issues, 'but if you're talking about every kid in the community, it might not be appropriate at 11'. I am going to back him up and say it is not appropriate at 11 for any child.


Equally alarming is the fact that the federal government is contributing $8 million to this propaganda, thanks initially to the Labor government in 2013 but continued under the current government. Quite frankly, our schools are in crisis. There is no doubt about that. The level of numeracy and literacy is declining and that is what schools are meant to be teaching: reading, writing and arithmetic. Schools should be places of learning not of propaganda. Children should be children. They should not be enlisted as political activists.


One extreme example of the political agenda that Safe Schools embodies is this concept of 'heteronormativity.' It is yet another concept created by the LGBTI advocates to denigrate the majority view. The Safe Schools teaching resources argue that even asking new parents whether their baby is a boy or a girl reinforces a 'heteronormative' worldview. Imagine that! Asking whether your newborn child is a boy or a girl is somehow some crime against progressive politics. These advocates say that reducing heteronormativity in schools can have good outcomes for everyone. I say that is bollocks.


We should, of course, remind children that just because someone is different from the majority it does not make them any less than anyone else, it does not make them inferior; it just makes them different. Regarding the majority view—the status quo, if you will, that has permeated centuries of human life—as some sort of evil concept that must be quashed by social engineering in the extreme has no place in our schools. It reflects a much broader social engineering agenda of the political left. It is an agenda that seeks to radically change Australian society.


Ms Roz Ward, one of the authors of the All Of Us teaching resources and coordinator of the Safe Schools Coalition in Victoria, spoke at last year's Marxism conference about what she regards as the cultural and social norms that capitalists have imposed on society, thereby stifling sexual freedoms. She said:


To smooth the operation of capitalism the ruling class has benefited, and continues to benefit, from oppressing our bodies, relationships, sexuality and gender identities alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia; both serve to break the spirits of ordinary people, to consume our thoughts, to make us accept the status quo and for us to keep living or aspiring to live, or feel like we should live, in small social units and families where we must reproduce and take responsibility for those people in those units.


Imagine that! Most people would not regard the most basic and fundamental principle of our society as a construct to be toppled, but one of the leaders of the Safe Schools Coalition does. This is a political agenda they are seeking to drag into our schools—and drag our children into too. They want to make schools a part of an ideological revolution to free us from the horrors of capitalism and the constraints of family life.


As one commentator put it, 'Will parents of Australian children in schools really give their approval to a program that, on the pretext of preventing bullying, is really about deconstructing the moral and social fabric of our society, including the family?' 


At this point I would like to mention a quote regarding schools and agendas. Here it is:


… it is completely inappropriate to enlist young people as the couriers of its prejudice.


…   …   …


Any principal or teacher who exposes vulnerable children to such damaging messages not only violates their duty of care, but is a danger to students …


Some may think that is a quote from me, but it is not—far from it. These words were said by Mr Rodney Croome, one of the key drivers for homosexual marriage in Australia. He was criticising the Catholic Church who dared to stand up for their own beliefs amongst their own flock. A comment like this illustrates the double standards that are absolutely rife in this debate. On the one hand, Mr Croome is upset about the Catholic Church teaching Catholic views to students in Catholic schools. A transgender activist is even taking the Catholic Church through the courts in Tasmania because they were offended by the material. Yet, on the other hand, they expect schools to support the extreme LGBTI agenda of the Safe Schools Coalition.


As a side note, I wonder what this activist thinks of the teachings in this area by other schools such as Islamic schools. Unfortunately, they are all silent in that space. The political left's version of tolerance only extends to those who agree with them. It is almost a foreign concept to them that there are people out there who may have different views.


Here are a few more quotes. You might like to hear this Senator Simms—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  Through the chair, Senator Bernardi.




Senator BERNARDI:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. 'Children should never be subjected to any form of pressure or indoctrination while they were in a government school.' 'Children are being forced into classes that do not reflect the values of their parents.' 'We want to make public schools safe places for parents who don't want their children indoctrinated.' 'The wishes of parents should not be compromised.' Guess where those quotes came from? Who would have thought? That is the New South Wales Greens quoting about indoctrination in schools. But judging by these comments, the Greens are against any form of pressure or indoctrination unless it is what they endorse. They want religion removed from schools unless it is their type of religious proselytising. They are against any pressure when it is an issue that they do not agree with, but they seem to have no problem with the pressure being applied to our children through the Safe Schools Coalition. Such hypocrisy is mind-boggling, but not unknown, from the political left.


Some will argue none of this really matters because the Safe Schools materials are voluntary. But by 2019 government schools in Victoria will be forced to join this program, and the pressure on other schools is increasing.


How long before independent and religious schools are forced to adopt the teachings that have already permeated our public school system? It is a valid question. We are seeing Catholic bishops being taken to the anti-discrimination commission for promoting Catholic thought and teaching. We are seeing concerted efforts to stop religious schools hiring teachers who do not share the same faith. So it is reasonable to ask: what attack is next for these schools? The Safe Schools Coalition goes beyond simply seeking to make schools safer places. It promotes a radical political and social agenda and seeks to indoctrinate students to make them its advocates.
