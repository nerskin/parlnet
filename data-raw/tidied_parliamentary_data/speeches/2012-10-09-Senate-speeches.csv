The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death last month at the age of 97 of Charles Comans, QC, former First Parliamentary Counsel. It was after his retirement as First Parliamentary Counsel that Charles Comans became the Senate's first consultant legislative drafter in the early 1980s, drafting amendments and private senators' bills, mostly for non-government senators, in what became the Procedure Office of the Department of the Senate. He also helped to draft the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which began as the first private senator's bill introduced by a President of the Senate.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (12:33):  The coalition will be supporting the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012, as it is a continuation of Welfare to Work reforms that were initiated by us in government in 2006. I go first of all to the intent of the bill, which is to amend the Social Security Act to remove the grandfathering provisions for parenting payment recipients from 1 January 2013. This will affect those parenting payment recipients who have been continuously receiving parenting payments since before 1 July 2006. Under the previous legislation introduced by the Howard government, recipients of a parenting payment could be grandfathered—or, as we sometimes say these days, grandparented—on this payment until their youngest child turned 16 years old, provided that the child was in their care before 1 July 2011. In addition to removing the grandfathering clause for parents, this bill seeks to double the permissible liquid assets, raising the maximum limit from $2,500 to $5,000 for singles and from $5,000 to $10,000 for those with dependants. It also seeks to define which payments should be categorised as termination payments to ensure that there is consistency across the board when considering the income maintenance period. This will bring the definition of termination payments into line with the policy intent of the Guide to Social Security Law, ensuring that termination payments such as for untaken long service leave, untaken maternity or paternity leave, early termination payments and other such payments are included in the income maintenance period.


However, while the coalition's Welfare to Work reforms were aimed at assisting Australians off welfare and into work, the main aim of this bill is to realise much-needed savings for the government, with expected savings from this bill of around $691.9 million over four years. That is a fair whack of money, and that is why the government has had this damascene conversion to Welfare to Work after years of opposing and indeed demonising the very measures that we are talking about here today.


For many years there has been a view within the OECD that we should increasingly move from passive income support to active income support—in other words, we find ways in which to use the public dollar, if you like, to encourage and support people in making a transition to work. This the Howard government did in 2006, when it invested $3.6 billion into Welfare to Work. It is good to see that Senator Bilyk is listening so intently! There were four under-represented groups of people who were targeted for assistance from Welfare to Work under this initiative, with parents being one of those groups. The 2005-06 budget saw an investment of $389.7 million over four years to specifically assist parents into work. The Welfare to Work reforms of 2006 built on our Australians Working Together initiative from 2003, when parents with children aged between 13 and 15 were required to undertake one or more activities such as job search, education, training or community work to assist them in preparing for a return to work.


From 1 July 2006 new applicants were eligible for parenting payment single when their youngest child was aged less than eight, and they moved to Newstart or another payment when their youngest child turned eight. Single principal carer parents in receipt of the Newstart allowance were also given access to the pensioner card, the pharmaceutical allowance and the telephone allowance. New partnered applicants would receive a parenting payment when their youngest child was six, and they would move to Newstart when their child turned six.


Both parenting payment single and parenting payment partnered recipients had a requirement to look for 15 hours or more of work a week. Parents who were on parenting payment single or partnered as at 30 June 2006 were grandfathered, enabling them to stay on that payment under the current eligibility provisions until their youngest child turned 16. However, job search requirements would apply from the later of 1 July 2007 or when their youngest child turned seven.


Where there were extenuating circumstances, such as a child with a disability or another reason why a parent may have full-time caring requirements, the Welfare to Work legislation permitted temporary exemptions. It was a very deliberate decision on the part of the government to grandfather people who were on these payments at a certain date. The reason for that was actually to make it easier for the public to accept the reform by making it clear that it was not having a retrospective impact but rather that it was focused on new recipients. This has been an important principle in a lot of social security legislation and, indeed, tax legislation over the years. Its purpose was to make it easier for the community to accept the reform.


In addition to access to concessions for single parenting payment recipients, the Howard government ensured that additional out-of-school-hours care was available for parents. However, recent childcare reforms are seeing out-of-school-hours care at great risk, with many centres to close as a result of the national reforms. A new employment participation service was offered to parents with school-aged children, ensuring that they had the skills needed to gain a job.


As part of the coalition policy, parents could refuse a job—and this is quite important—if they were not more than $50 a fortnight better off once we took into account the costs of employment, such as child care, or if they had to travel more than 60 minutes each way to work. Currently, parenting payment recipients are subject to different rules depending on when they first claim payment; so this legislation will bring all parenting payment recipients onto the same standard.


The research undertaken by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on the Welfare to Work reforms demonstrates clearly that there was a 23 per cent increase in the number of single principal carer parents leaving income support after six months in comparison to the previous three years, with 38 per cent moving off payment during 2006-07. The report also showed that over 70 per cent of principal carer parents left income support for employment. In other words, they did not drop out of the workforce: they actually got a job. Similarly for partnered principal carer parents on Newstart allowance, 45 per cent were no longer in receipt of income support payments after six months compared to 32 per cent in 2005-06.


At the time of the Welfare to Work reforms the Howard government introduced a range of complementary services to assist parents in their transition to employment once the youngest child had reached school age. These were all designed to boost workforce engagement and to reduce the dependency on welfare. Regrettably, under the current employment services model many of these forms of assistance are no longer available and the government has not proposed any alternatives.


We recognise that the best way to help parents and their children is to help them get a job. Tony Blair used to speak about fairness in the workplace starting with the opportunity of getting a job. The coalition understands that those children who grow up in a jobless household often face greater disadvantage in their community and an increased likelihood of being welfare dependent themselves. We have seen over generations the intergenerational transmission of poverty, where people grew up in households where neither their grandparents nor their parents ever had a job and going down to the Centrelink office was seen as the way that you picked up your pay.


Intergenerational unemployment is a growing concern in this country, and the longer people remain on welfare then the more difficult the transition to paid employment becomes. That is why these measures are sometimes seen as tough love; in the short term they are seen particularly as applying the stick, subject to certain carrots. It is for the good of the welfare recipient in the long run, so they get back their capacity to participate fully and actively in the job market. With that goes their self-esteem—that goes up—their confidence goes up and their capacity to contribute to the community more generally goes up.


We do have concerns with this bill, even though we support it. Unlike the Welfare to Work agenda introduced by the coalition in 2006, there is no additional funding to support parents into work. This legislation is sending a very negative message: all stick and no carrot. If the government was truly committed to assisting parents back to work it would provide additional assistance. It would do it as part of a coherent, comprehensive, credible strategy around the return to work, or getting people into work. Instead, this government has slashed $162.2 million from Job Services Australia assistance for jobseekers and it has cut a further $44.3 million from outcome payments for Job Services Australia providers.


Parents who are working could be worse off financially as their participation requirements may force them into accepting a job where they are worse off financially. This is in contrast to the Howard government reforms, where parents were promised that they could refuse a suitable job offer if they were not better off by at least $25 a week. In the 2005-06 budget an underlying cash surplus of $8.9 billion was predicted, demonstrating strong economic growth. Unemployment was at its lowest level—5.1 per cent—since 1976, and forecast to trend down further. This is in contrast to Labor's most recent budget, which continued their unmitigated trend of running a deficit, and that is the context in which this legislation has come forward. That is why, as I said before, it is a grab for cash. It is a dash for cash, precisely because the government are running out of other options in order to try and get their budget into a wafer-thin surplus of $1.5 billion in 2012-13.


This means that the government has had to eat humble pie. Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor! Labor voted against the Welfare to Work reforms of the Howard government in 2005, even though those reforms included extensive assistance to help get people back into work—unlike this particular package. Just a few short months ago Labor moved to decrease the parenting payment cut-off age of the youngest child from 16 to 12. Making this further decrease now shows that this is more about achieving a budgetary saving than about a policy that is genuinely committed to assisting people from welfare to work, particularly given the tough economic times that are facing Australian families today.


As I said before, Labor have been hypocrites. On 15 September 2005, ACOSS Advocacy Day—ACOSS being the Australian Council of Social Service—describing the Howard package, Penny Wong said:


This package has nothing to do with moving people from welfare to work and everything to do with extreme cuts to the household budgets of Australian families who can least afford it.


This is even though the legislation at the time provided that you could refuse a job if you were not at least $25 a week better off. Under the government's package, some people will be forced to take a job even if they are worse off. You can have a no-disadvantage test in the labour market under this government because the unions will demand that, but if you are a welfare recipient you cannot get a no-disadvantage test under this government. We were trying to encourage people to go into the workforce and make it a positive experience. All stick, no carrot!


Kelly Hoare, a former member of the other place, said on 1 December 2005:


Labor is opposed to the changes in this bill and it opposes them on the basis that these changes simply dump people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment and push the most vulnerable Australians over the edge by making extreme cuts to their household budgets.


The reality, as I indicated earlier, based on research commissioned by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations was that a significant number of people got into paid employment and were better off as a result.


Dr Carmen Lawrence, a member of the other place, said on 1 December 2005:


… the vulnerable people at whom this legislation is targeted are the ones not able to get the ear of the government. They are not able to walk these corridors with expensive, paid consultants to influence the government's policy, and the government refuses to listen to their advocates.


We did listen to the people who said that if you want to get people into work you have got to make it a positive experience and you have got to give them the assistance to do it. When I worked in the former Howard government, I was one of the people who advocated in 2005-2006 that we grandfather existing recipients, because it was important to get public acceptance of the reform. Labor has now gone further but has provided only stick and no carrot. Dr Carmen Lawrence, if she were here today, would be saying that the people who are not being listened to down the corridors and in the ministerial wing are the most vulnerable in our community.


We will support this legislation. There is no doubt in my mind that it is important we continue the journey of welfare to work. It is also important to recognise that the government have come to this damascene conversion, if I could call it that, on welfare to work simply by the exigencies of their own budgetary situation. It is a pity that, because of that budgetary situation, they cannot see their way clear to actually provide assistance which will facilitate and make the transition to employment a positive experience for parenting payment recipients and their families.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-10-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:47):  Schedule 1 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012 will drive already vulnerable single parents, the majority of whom are single mothers, further into poverty. What this bill does is drop single parents who are currently on parenting payment single down to a payment which is nearly $140 less than what they are on at the moment. We know that Newstart is now around $132 to $140 below the poverty line. In other words, we are dropping single parents onto the poverty line. Aren't single parents still parents? It is not only the mothers and fathers that we are dropping there, but their children as well. That is what you are about to pass in this place. The Greens will be opposing schedule 1 which is the schedule that drops those vulnerable parents onto Newstart. We will be opposing that particular piece of this bill, make no mistake. 


The government is bringing this bill to this chamber despite the recommendations of two of the committee that it controls. The Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee recommended that this bill not proceed until the inquiry into Newstart concluded. Then the newly established Joint Committee on Human Rights, in their first major recommendation, recommended that this bill does not proceed until the Newstart inquiry has finished. Further, on the very last day of the last sitting—around six o'clock, if I recall, when they tabled their report—they said in essence: 



If Newstart combined with other benefits is not sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living for affected individuals, the measures risk being a violation of human rights under article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee was not yet convinced that the affected single parents would 
be able to maintain access to appropriate levels of social security support if placed onto Newstart. As a result, it would be premature for the government to introduce these measures prior to the completion of the Newstart Inquiry. 


But the government is proceeding with this anyway. One of the few things that I agree with that Senator Sinodinos just said is that this is purely a savings measure on the back of some of the most vulnerable people in our community and on the backs of future generations. So if we are talking about entrenching poverty, that is exactly what this measure does: it helps entrench poverty. It helps condemn those children that we as a caring society are supposed to be nurturing and supporting. It helps condemn them to the poverty cycle.


How can we claim that we have a surplus if we have just thrust over 100,000 single-parent families and their children into poverty? How can we then claim that there is a surplus when it is on the backs of the most vulnerable in our community? Make no mistake, this measure reduces the income of single parents and their families, and as I said, over 85 per cent of those are women.


This schedule, if passed, takes away the grandfathered protections that were put in place when the Welfare to Work measures were first moved in this place in 2006. Recipients' parenting payments will cease when their children turn six if they are partnered parents and eight if they are single parents. That means they will end up on Newstart and that will mean a difference of around $140 because, if you remember from our discussion here last sitting, the indexation rates for Newstart and the parenting payment are different.


This measure will affect over 100,000 single parents. This group is the most vulnerable in Australia. Recent data from the OECD shows that around two-thirds of the children of single parents who rely on income support are living below the poverty line and 90 per cent of that particular group are women. Sole parent families on income support already struggle to meet essential living costs and 85 per cent of parenting payment recipients experience multiple deprivation. Multiple deprivation is when you lack three items that are vital for an adequate standard of living—for example, medical treatment, warm clothes, a decent and secure home, schoolbooks for children. Those are things that we consider essential items. I reiterate: over half of the parenting payment recipients are already living in what we would term serious poverty. Now we are talking about cutting their payments further.


The Salvation Army recently released a survey of people accessing its emergency relief centres. Of the 1,731 individuals surveyed, 81 per cent were on income support and 36 per cent of those were single parents with dependent children. The Foodbank report that was launched in this house recently reported that the three main groups being provided with food assistance were low-income families, unemployed people and single parent families. Are you getting the picture? These are families that are already under stress and already living in poverty or close to poverty. Of particular concern is the impact of this measure and of hardship on children. Over half of the respondents to the Salvation Army survey reported they were unable to afford to pay for out-of-school activities for their children and over one-third could not afford for their children to participate in school activities and outings. How is affecting the education of our next generation a sensible measure? And what does this mean for their mental health and their ability to interact and connect with their peers?


It is not surprising that a recent report from the National Association of Community Legal Centres found that the majority of the local government areas with high rates of sole parent households were also some of the most disadvantaged in the country. The people who will be most affected by this bill live in the areas that have poorer infrastructure, supports and services. This measure will make it even harder for them to find work. Get the picture about the multiple deprivation and the multiple barriers to finding work and supporting your family?


Sole parents are more likely than any other group of people to experience financial stress. According to the ABS, 70 per cent of sole parents are in the poorest 20 per cent of the population. How do we expect single parents to be able to survive when we take away more of their income? It is very clear that this group of Australians is very vulnerable and likely to be more marginalised by this measure. I have been quite amazed that the government thinks that, by stripping away further assistance and support for these people, it is actually helping them: 'Let's take more money and pretend we're helping people and pretend this isn't a savings measure.' What this is about is a savings measure dressed up as trying to be helpful. Well, please stop helping, because it is not.


I would like to articulate a few quotes from submissions received by the Senate inquiry. One woman said:


I have gained casual employment with the Salvos' retail, maybe two days per week, which is usually Saturday or Sunday, and occasionally one day during the week. It has taken me two years to find this job as employers don't seem to offer parent friendly hours for people who have limited child care. My elderly parents are two hours away and come when they can to look after her. We are just managing but won't on Newstart. I won't be able to keep what I have earned. 


Another woman said:


Ever since the announcement I have been looking for a second job so that we can afford to live for next year. Who even knows how I'll juggle the child care. I can't get there, I'm just terrified. I've had one interview since May—


this was in July because the hearing was in July—


so where are these jobs they're talking about? I'm educated and already employed yet I am still finding it difficult. I can only imagine how desperate someone suffering after a difficult divorce with a very few children, no recent work history and little education must be feeling. It is hopeless, and hopelessness does not help people work and raise their children.


These two women, unfortunately, are not alone. Tens of thousands of women are going through similar crises. I have a very long list of similar emails and submissions from people. We do not support the government and the opposition pushing these women and their children further into poverty. There are countless examples of people who will be plunged into financial hardship with this measure.


I would like to tackle the view that this is about encouraging single parents into work. Nearly 50 per cent of single parents are, in fact, already working. They are juggling looking after their family, trying to find child care, finding work that has family friendly hours and supporting the children who are our future generation. Pushing families onto Newstart decreases their payments by about $60 to $100, depending on how many children they have and what their circumstances are. It subjects working parents to a much harsher income-free area, of $31 per week, than if they are on parenting payment single. There is also the removal of the additional child income-free area of $12.30 a week and the ending of eligibility for the pension education supplement of up to $31.20 per week. In other words, this is having multiple impacts on single parents. Sole parent who drop from parenting payment single to Newstart and have no current income will lose around $55 per week. The government tried to pretend it was softening this by saying. 'It's okay, we'll give you $210 a year supplementary allowance.' Great: four bucks a week! That is not even the price of a cup of coffee these days—not that you can afford a cup of coffee when you are on Newstart.


Are you getting the picture? People are going to be living on less money. These are people who are already struggling, who are in work part time or struggling to find work.


If you are living in a rural area, for example, child care only works generally in normal working hours, not shiftworking hours. So for a start that blocks you out of any type of shiftwork because you simply cannot get child care. For those that are already working, the income-free area means they get to take home less, so it is having a double effect. Parents out there are not only going to be dropped on Newstart, they are also going to have less money to take in their pockets when they are working. How does it work that we are encouraging people into work and then we are going to drop them onto a payment that has a lower income-free area? How is that encouraging, how is that an incentive? Again, this is not about incentives; this is about the government saving money on the backs of the most vulnerable.


If this payment passes in addition to the payment cuts outlined, parenting payment recipients who move onto Newstart will not be eligible for the $32.64 per week pensioner education supplement. The National Welfare Rights Network estimates that there are over 25,000 parenting payment single recipients who are receiving that supplement. They will be able to continue to receive it but new people will not be able to. This is discouraging and counterproductive for people trying to improve their qualifications and skills. 


We cannot believe that this legislation will in fact help parents into work or encourage parents into work; it will make it harder. Once you are in poverty, that is yet another barrier to finding work. Senator Evans when he was the shadow minister for social security agreed with that. He said: 


Simply cutting payments for people on welfare does nothing to help them get paid work, which is the best way out of poverty. By cutting payments to vulnerable Australians who are already financially disadvantaged, the Howard Government's budget will increase income inequality rather than reduce it.


Well said, Senator Evans, and we agree. There is no difference here between the Welfare to Work measures implemented under the Howard government and this. What they are doing is going after another group of vulnerable Australians.


It is also important to note that parenting payment single recipients are already subject to activity requirements. In other words, they are already supposed to be looking for work and undertaking these activities. This is supposedly to ensure that parents engage in the workforce. The majority of people are already on these sorts of requirements, so these measures will not lead to further activity requirements. The Greens, as I have said on many occasions, are already cautious about activity requirements and question their effectiveness when compared to more positive, less punitive measures. But it is still curious to see that these reforms, which are apparently about activating parents, provide no change in their requirements for this engagement. It makes you wonder whether the government admit that their measures are not being effective in encouraging people to find work.


People that are on parenting payments and trying to find work face multiple barriers. These multiple barriers are the issues that we need to be addressing. It is not easy when you are raising children to be also juggling work in quite child-unfriendly environments. You are more often than not in temporary employment, in casual employment, where you do not know what your regular hours are. I was at the gathering outside Parliament House this morning talking to a group of single parents about this legislation. They were urging this place not to support this particular part of the legislation. In particular I was talking to a single mother who has repeatedly been trying to find work and has been in and out of work—and then, when she is in and out of work due to no fault of her own, she is having problems with Centrelink because it is casual and temporary work. So the system does not help people either. The government would be better off investing in how to address those barriers rather than putting in place more and more punitive approaches to people who are trying to raise their families.


The other issue that has also been raised, and I will be moving an amendment on this if I fail to convince the chamber to oppose this legislation, is the timing of this. This is coming in on 1 January, when every family in this country has trouble paying their bills; they are in debt because of Christmas. 'Here is your great Christmas present. Now you are going to be dropped onto Newstart and get $130 a week less. Then you have got to prepare your kids for school and buy their school uniforms. Sorry about that, sorry that you have got less money. We do actually want your kids to get a better education but we will just make it harder for you to send your kids to school.' We will be moving an amendment to at least move the start of this revolting piece of legislation to 1 July.


I want in the last couple of minutes to address the liquid assets waiting period. The Greens welcome finally seeing this particular piece of legislation, which is schedule 2 of the bill, which reduces the length of the liquid assets waiting period by doubling the maximum reserve threshold for liquid assets. This is a positive measure and one that should have been continued after the GFC package ran out. As people will recall, this was actually part of the GFC package and the Greens strongly advocated that it be retained. In fact, it was our lobbying that got it into the package in the first place. We think it is a positive measure that will help the recently unemployed being faced with very stressful prospects of emptying their bank accounts before they can access income support. So it is a measure that we will be supporting, which is why we are not opposing the bill outright but will be voting separately on both of the schedules of this bill. However, I will be moving a second reading amendment because, as per usual, the government has not dealt with the issue of appropriate indexation. So I will be moving a second reading amendment that the Senate calls on the government to bring forward additional legislation to provide appropriate indexation of the liquid assets maximum reserve threshold.


As I said earlier, the Greens will be opposing schedule 1. If we go down on that and on the arguments of all those single parents who are going to be negatively impacted by this legislation and not manage to sway senators—even those senators who, with their hands on their hearts, have said that they are concerned about those single parents but are still going to vote with the government—I will be moving an amendment, as I indicated, that this legislation commences on 1 July 2013 rather than the Christmas-New Year present that the government proposes for single parents on 1 January. We will not be supporting this legislation, and we urge all senators in this chamber to reconsider their vote and to consider the impact that this legislation will have on single parents and their children. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron

Senator SIEWERT:
  Yes, I do. I move the second reading amendment on sheet No. 7272. 


At the end of the motion, add: ""but the Senate calls on the Government to bring forward additional legislation to provide appropriate indexation of the liquid asset maximum reserve threshold"".

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-10-09,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:06):  I compliment both Senator Sinodinos and Senator Siewert for their contributions to this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012. I think the comments that both of them have made are very telling and should be taken on board. There are two elements to this bill for which I have concern. The first is that it fails to promote greater workplace participation, workforce participation, for those people who will be affected by it. The second is that, obviously, this is an attempt by the government to try to balance the budget—a fact which, of course, will never happen under this government—and to do so at the expense of and on the back of the most vulnerable—in this case, low-income earners, carers, single parents and inevitably, as Senator Siewert has eloquently indicated, their children. Those are concerns that I will return to during this presentation. 


We also have real concerns about the primary objectives of the legislation, and that is its failure to promote greater workforce and workplace participation as well as its failure to provide appropriate incentives to encourage those who are out of the workforce to find, to maintain or to re-enter useful employment. They are areas that are obviously of concern. 


In the inquiry that we held into this matter, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations cited evidence which indicates that children who grow up in jobless families are themselves much more likely to experience unemployment as adults. Following on from Senator Siewert, I want to focus on the impact of this legislation on children. If I may quote from the submission by the department to the inquiry: 


Children who grow up in jobless families are far more likely to be out of work as adults compared to those who had a working parent—


or parents. 


It is therefore vital that the income support system seeks to incentivise work in order to break the dependency cycle. The system must provide the right balance of support and incentive to work to ensure that parents are in a position to benefit from the opportunities the economy has to offer, particularly as their children get older and the parent's capacity for work increases, and provide their families with positive role models and greater financial security. 


I will repeat those—as I am sure they go to the heart of what we all would agree in this place—and they are: positive role models by parents or their carers for their children and greater financial security being stability. 


It was at the same inquiry that Ms Netty Horton, the Territorial Social Program Director of the Salvation Army—and I must say that she was not supportive of the legislation—explained to the committee:


We would like to be very clear in that we are fully supportive of moving as many people as possible—single parents or unemployed people in general—towards being able to work, and some of the focus of our submission has been around our experiences in working with the most disadvantaged group of those people in the community and recognising that they need additional support and incentives to move them into the paid workforce. 


She went on to conclude: 


We recognise that that is the best way out of poverty and the best way to ensure participation both for them and for their children in the community. 


Those are very telling comments. 


The regrettable aspect of the matter that we are discussing today has, of course, been the inability of this government to carry on the work commenced by the Howard government under the Welfare to Work reforms of 2006. At the time, those reforms were predicated on the basis of some $8.9 billion in cash surplus that had been generated following the repayment of the debt of the then Keating government. It was because of that surplus that the Howard government was able to implement its Welfare to Work reforms. It invested some $3.6 billion in 2006, with $400 million over four years of that specifically directed to assist parents into work—the very people we are speaking about. The Labor government today have made some effort to try and continue those initiatives, but because they have now got themselves into the circumstance of such deep indebtedness and deficit, we see them taking these sorts of actions in an attempt to try and save some $789 million over four years at the expense of who, I would say, are the most vulnerable in the community. 


The Howard government initiatives, amongst others, had a requirement that single and parenting payment partnered recipients seek at least 15 hours of work each week and to start that process themselves, psychologically as well as physically, to return to the workplace. In addition to that, there was access to concessions for single parenting payment recipients. Here the Howard government ensured additional out-of-school-hours care to be available for parents. But we know that only recently under a different guise childcare reforms are seeing this out-of-school-hours care being placed at risk in 2012, with many of the centres being forced to close as a result of the so-called national reforms. So we are going to see a double whammy here, and that is an inability for people to ensure their children are cared for whilst they either seek employment or, indeed, undertake those works. 


As part of that coalition policy at that time parents could refuse a job if they would not be more than $50 a fortnight better off once the costs of employment were factored in—including, of course, child care—or if they had to travel for more than 60 minutes each way to work. Very sensible initiatives, but of course they have also unfortunately gone by the wayside.


I heard my colleague Senator Sinodinos quote from the then department of education and workplace's Welfare to Work reforms that showed there were significant increases, 23 per cent I believe, in the number of single principal carer parents leaving income support after six months in comparison to the three previous years as a result of those initiatives, and 38 per cent moving off the payment during 2006-07. That was for single principal carers, and the report showed that more than 70 per cent of principal carer parents left income support for employment. For partnered principal carer parents on the Newstart allowance, 45 per cent were no longer in receipt of income support payments after six months, compared to 32 per cent the previous year—an increase of some 13 per cent. So we could see evidence of improvements being undertaken and at the same time systems were in place to ensure that there was child care for children, and there was the capacity for an orderly transfer to work.


These measures were designed to boost workforce engagement, reduce dependency on welfare and, returning to the comments made earlier, to try to break that cycle of long-term intergenerational unemployment, which of itself unfortunately generally leads to a circumstance in which the growing child comes to expect a life themselves of unemployment, and that is unacceptable. I referred to that in my first speech in the Senate on 17 March 2009; I reflected that in a country like this we should surely never see a circumstance in which we look to a situation in which young people particularly would not find useful, gainful and obviously lucrative employment.


There are benefits to this bill. We do recognise that the best way to help parents and their children is to help the parents find a job. We do understand, as I have just indicated, that children growing up in a jobless household will be much more likely themselves to face long-term unemployment, underemployment or the third of that trifecta—that is, unfulfilling employment. It is not just the fact of getting a job or keeping a job; it is the fact of aspiring to a job that of itself will be of interest and of itself will help the person grow over time. All of us in this place have seen the experience that is denied young people when they themselves have not had that opportunity.


Intergenerational unemployment is a growing concern in Australia and the longer people remain on welfare the more difficult it becomes. I agree with Senator Siewert; indeed, the coalition shares its support for the increase in the level or limit of the liquid assets waiting period. In fact I have some difficulties even with the level or the limit to which it is being placed. I would like to see over time that figure potentially being increased because, as we all know, there are unforeseen problems that occur in families, be they emergencies or whatever, and it is unreasonable that we should not penalise somebody having some sort of a cash reserve, either as a single or as combined parents, to be able to overcome those emergency periods.


We do have concerns with the bill. I have tried to outline some of them. There is no additional funding to support parents into work, and I cannot emphasise that enough. I think that is one of its great deficiencies, in contrast to the Howard initiatives of 2006. I believe it is incumbent on the government to go back and re-examine these figures and see whether or not they cannot return to providing that additional assistance. It is the case that the government have slashed some $160 million from Job Services Australia assistance for job seekers. That is a very, very significant sum, and the impact of it will be adverse on those seeking employment and ultimately on their families. A further $44 million has been cut from the outcome payments for Job Services Australia providers. All of these are directed at the ultimate failure of the legislation that is before us.


The deep concern I have and to which I referred at the beginning, and which so many people are acutely conscious of—whether or not government senators do come out and say so publicly remains to be seen—is the effort of this government to try to hive off some $700 million over four years from the most vulnerable and those least able to afford it. Why is that? Why was it that in 2006 the Howard government was able to inject some $3.8 billion into the Welfare to Work initiative, some $400 million specifically to assist parents into work? It was because the economy was in surplus and because there was a surplus budget. That is what we were able to do.


We see a circumstance now where I believe these figures really are terribly telling. I want to focus on this circumstance. In 2007 this government inherited $70 billion of surplus. In this year's budget, it was estimated that the debt would blow out to $147 billion from a $70 billion surplus. But of course that is now not the case. We learnt only today—I believe Senator Williams said it, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that we are now looking at a national debt of some $250 billion. Not the 147—




Senator Williams:
  252!




Senator BACK:
  I am sorry, it is $252 billion—that last $2 billion would certainly have gone to paying this, Senator Williams. So from a $70 billion surplus in 2007 we now have an estimated $147 billion debt this year—in fact, it is already $252 billion.


Let me put that into perspective for you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if I may. The annual interest bill alone is $6.6 billion—that is, $6,600 million each year. Just the $600 million would account for the $700-odd million that the government is trying to save in this exercise. When the Howard government came into office following the Keating period, Peter Costello was able to pay back $96 billion of debt and, in so doing, saved some $5 billion over the remaining period of that government. We are not talking $5 billion over the remaining period of a government; we are talking about $6.6 billion of debt every year at our current debt levels. Here we are arguing—and we listened to what I would certainly agree was an eloquent representation by Senator Siewert—about the impacts on the most vulnerable people in the community in this move to try to save $700 million over four years when we seem to be accepting $6.6 billion worth of interest payments alone on a debt of $252 billion. This is all in the name of trying to protect a budget surplus. 


The budget deficit, the annual difference between revenue and expenditure, was estimated by Treasurer Swan to be $22 billion in 2011-12. It doubled and it blew out to $43.7 billion. Since Labor came to government the deficit, the difference each year between revenue and expenditure, when put together over the life of this government has become $170 billion. They are telephone book figures. So any capacity by this government to actually balance a budget when it has a track record to date of accumulating a $173 billion deficit is a nonsense. It has no capacity to do so. There are many other areas in which the government should be looking for savings so as not to put the yoke upon the shoulders of these most vulnerable people and their children. But, of course, that is the circumstance the government finds itself in because of its profligate spending and because of its waste. The burden is now being carried particularly by those who are most vulnerable.


I will finish my contribution on this with the lamentable observation that not only do we have currently $252 billion of debt and $6.6 billion of annual interest payments on that debt but also, to date, we have seen unfunded commitments of some $120 billion further by the government leading into the next election, whenever that is held. The emphasis must be on two areas. Firstly, there must be sufficient funding so that people do not live in that level of poverty to which others have referred, as I have. Secondly, there must be adequate funding to make sure that those who become eligible to return to the workforce have the financial wherewithal to seek employment, to get to interviews, to complete a task and to have their children minded as needed. Just having clothing and being able to present yourself in a physical and psychological way so that you are attractive to an employer or to those who are interviewing you for employment, as indeed those of us who are participating in these inquiries can, are of themselves critically important. I simply urge that before this bill is given its final concurrence, which, as Senator Sinodinos said, the coalition will not be opposing, we re-examine the circumstances of adequacy and those other incentives, and return the incentives that the Howard government had in place that marked the success of this program so that we can give some dignity to those people.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-10-09,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:27):  I have some significant concerns in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012. At the outset, it is important to note that the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee report on this bill raised a number of key issues, and let us put them into perspective. I read from the committee's report, which says:


Schedule 1 of the bill seeks to remove 'grandfathering' provisions established on 1 July 2006 and would supersede transitional amendments passed in 2011 and earlier this year. If the bill is passed, from 1 January 2013—


less than three months away—


eligibility for parenting payment for partnered recipients would cease when the youngest child under their care turns 6 years old, or when the youngest child of a single parent turns 8 years old.


all grandfathered recipients would have participation requirements when their youngest child turns 6 (currently this is not until that child turns 7).


So this is a further tightening up. This is further penalising of those recipients. I note your contribution in the media, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, which I thought expressed in a very measured way concerns about these measures. I thought they were wise comments about proceeding in such haste. I think your comments, Mr Acting Deputy President, reflected widespread community concerns.


The recommendations of the report of the committee were that this bill should not be debated until the Joint Committee on Human Rights had concluded its inquiry and until the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee had completed its references inquiry into the adequacy of the Newstart Allowance and other payments. The Joint Committee on Human Rights also recommended that the bill not be debated until the inquiry into Newstart is complete. That makes a lot of sense. Why are we rushing this? I do not believe it is appropriate to go against the recommendations of these two inquiries to debate and vote on this bill now. It is hasty. It is unwise.


If the government are serious about the intention of this bill, which they have stated is to encourage people to join the workforce, then surely it is worth the time to make sure there will not be any unintended consequences and, furthermore, that these measures will actually work. This bill will have a significant effect on the people it is targeting. This is the second time this group will have an end date put on their parenting payments, and I find it very concerning that this date is continually being brought forward. These kinds of decisions make it hard for people to plan for the future, and the financial uncertainty this has caused for them is nothing short of unfair.


We must also keep in mind that this group represents something like one-third of parenting payment recipients. The other two-thirds of recipients are already living under the harsh conditions this bill seeks to enforce. There are two facets to this problem. Firstly, there is the issue of Newstart. It is a woefully low allowance, and it is very easy to see how it could hinder, rather than help, job seekers. It grinds people into the ground. If it demoralises them, if it dispirits them, if it means that they are just living from hand to mouth on a week by week basis, I cannot see how that empowers people to look for work, to be job ready. In my view, it is vital that this bill be delayed until the inquiry into this allowance is complete and any recommendations it makes are implemented. Things are bad enough already for the people on this allowance. We do not need to add to their number at this stage.


Secondly, there is the issue of reducing allowances to encourage people into employment. I agree with the government that it is important for people to have a job, and not just for the fiscal argument—being gainfully employed, in whatever field, whether full or part time, plays a vital part in a person's self-esteem. It helps to keep us connected, to know that we and our contributions are valued. I do not see how this bill will encourage people to work. Punitive measures are not the solution. If the government genuinely wants to help people, particularly single parents, transition back into the workforce, then they need to work towards that aim. Everyone here knows it is not as simple as, 'Do it or else!' If higher employment in these areas is genuinely the goal then we need to look at targeted measures to support and encourage people. We need to have a bit of carrot rather than just all stick.


These kinds of programs are not cheap, but just throwing cash at the problem will not solve it either. In fact, if the government were serious about their stated aim, they would not be looking at it as a saving—anything but. Instead they would be setting money aside and working out where to spend it for the best impact. They would be consulting with experts, community groups and people working at the coalface on these issues. But it appears that none of this has happened. Instead, they are insisting on punitive measures, which we know just will not work.


There is another argument here: that all parenting payment recipients should be on an equal footing. I agree with that, but, instead of reducing the allowance to meet the lowest common denominator of Newstart, what if we raised it? What if we just take into account the special circumstances that sole parents are in in so many cases? What if we raised Newstart too? And what if we looked at getting people into work as more than a 'follow the rules and tick the boxes' process? Then maybe we would see the outcomes the government is predicting.


Ultimately, I cannot support this bill. I do not support its intentions in the sense that they appear to be primarily punitive. Of course we want to encourage greater participation in the workforce. Of course we all want people to have meaningful work. But I do not support this bill being rushed through, debated in this place and being voted on against the recommendations of two committees—two committees that have carefully considered the implications of this bill. It is time for the government to take a step back and to take the time to look at the whole issue and how it can be appropriately addressed. This bill is not the solution. It is not even part of the answer. I cannot support this bill.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-10-09,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:33):  I rise today to indicate that the Australian Greens, of course, will not be supporting schedule 1 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012 that is before us, as my colleague senator Rachel Siewert has indicated earlier in her contribution. This route goes to the heart of what sort of country we want to live in in Australia. It literally goes to the heart of what the purpose of a budget is. A budget and an economy are nothing of themselves. Budgets and economic tools are only there to deliver for the community at large. There are only two real things in the world: people and nature. We developed economic tools to govern that relationship so that it would be a sustainable one in the longer term and to govern the relationship between people. At the heart of the relationship between people needs to be equity—equal opportunity for all. Surely that goes to the heart of what is the point of an economic system and its economic set of tools. What we have here is economic tools delivering appalling outcomes for the community. If that is the case then the tools need to be changed. We need to be looking at what the indicators are of what we want to be measuring in Australia to determine whether we are successfully having tools that deliver in the broadest sense—so that we have ecological sustainability and a healthy and happy community into the longer term.


The bill before us impacts 100,000 single parents, 85 per cent of whom are women, who are dropping from the payment they have to a Newstart allowance payment, which puts them at the poverty line. They are going to lose between $60 and $100 a week when you take into account not only the loss in payment but also the tax thresholds. You have a point where you are saying that in order to reach a budget surplus, which is a political surplus, you are prepared to put 100,000 people into poverty. I ask you, Acting Deputy President Cameron: how is that justified on what we hear time and time again from the Prime Minister about Labor values and working families? How is putting people into poverty a Labor value? How is people putting into poverty a Labor value when at the same time you see the ongoing areas where we could be raising money, like getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies for a start; like blocking the loophole in the MRRT—any number of ways we could be raising money. But, no, in order to reach this surplus, the government is prepared to put 100,000 single parents into poverty.


Now let us go to this issue that somehow that will help people get jobs. We know that driving people into poverty will preclude them from employment. It actually costs money to become job ready. In fact, the only increase in employment support that ACOSS have been able to identify in the budget is $3 million to extend a telephone career counselling service. They go on to say that they understand that the increased allocation for JET childcare assistance reflects higher demand for an existing childcare subsidy, not an extension of access to that program. The fact is if you are unemployed and you are going to have even less money to be able to be job ready then you will be less likely to be able to achieve employment.


Let us go back and talk about what will happen to the children who will be affected when the single parents, 85 per cent of whom I have said a moment ago are women, are in these circumstances. I would like the Prime Minister to tell Australians how the children of single parents who are now being forced into poverty are going to have equal opportunity with other children in Australian society. The reality is they will not—and equality of opportunity is not only important in terms of a value. Let me put a monetary figure on it. We know that in countries where the gap between the rich and the poor gets wider and wider there are many increased costs in terms of the level of public safety, for example, and we also know about the health care and other associated costs that go into the mix as a consequence of where you have gated communities of the wealthy and other communities of the very poor. That is where this is headed in Australia and that is what I find so offensive about what the government is doing. It cannot be justified. I understand that there was a vigorous debate in the Labor Party on this particular issue and I understand that the views were reasonably evenly divided in relation to the matter.


Nevertheless, the test of this will be to see who actually crosses the floor on it. We heard from Senator Back a little while ago about how appalling it is to drive people into poverty—and he was absolutely correct that it is—but, Senator Back, will you vote against schedule 1? That is the point. It is all very well to rail against poverty but when push comes to shove and the vote is called on this, who is going to vote to prevent the 100,000 single parents losing this payment? Who is going to vote to prevent them being pushed into poverty? I think everybody concedes that Newstart is actually driving people into poverty to the point where you have parliamentary committees having met in this place and having said that this will drive people into poverty with, in fact, those committees saying the government should delay this legislation until the committee looking into Newstart, for example, actually reports.


Then you have got the humiliating scenario where the Australian Council of Social Service, the National Welfare Rights Centre, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children, Women Everywhere Advocating Violence Elimination, the Council for Single Mothers and their Children Victoria, Women's Legal Services New South Wales and the Human Rights Law Centre have become so desperate that they have all been getting together to send a letter to a United Nations special rapporteur over the federal government's decision to bring on this legislation against the advice of those parliamentary committees. In that letter it is pointed out, of course, that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights had already advised the government to delay the bill, citing major reservations. One of them was:


If Newstart combined with other benefits is not sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living for affected individuals, the measures risk being a violation of human rights under article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights.


How humiliating is it in a global sense for a rich country like Australia to be risking violation of article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights because we are driving people into poverty and the people being driven into poverty are not only single parents but also children? Where does that leave us in terms of global standing in the UN system? We have already embarrassed this nation with violation of human rights when it comes to the treatment of refugees. Now we are going to humiliate ourselves again by being in violation of human rights when it comes to economic, social and cultural rights.


The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights was also not convinced that the affected single parents would be able to maintain access to appropriate levels of social security support if placed on Newstart and, as a result, it argued it would be premature for the government to introduce these measures prior to the completion of the Newstart inquiry. This is really an extraordinary situation and I think it puts paid to any notion when the Labor Party stand up and say that they stand for Labor values and that the Labor values somehow go to equality of opportunity, a decent life for all, minimising the gap between the rich and the poor, and facilitating people getting into meaningful work, with the human dignity that is associated with that. They cannot claim to be promoting all of these things if they legislate to save $700 million off the backs of single parents and their children. It is disgraceful that this is being driven through this Senate at a time when parliamentary committees have said quite clearly this is premature and they need to look a bit more at what is going on with Newstart.


Actually, they really do not need to look any further into what is going on with Newstart. We have heard from practically all the social justice agencies in the country, who have submitted that Newstart is actually entrenching poverty and acting as a barrier to people looking for work. We have heard that from Dr Cassandra Goldie, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council of Social Services, we have heard it from the Salvation Army and we have heard it from many others. The Salvation Army submitted that:


Newstart allowance is inequitable and inadequate as it is lower than pensions for retirees, below the poverty line, and has a more restricted earning threshold compared to the Parenting Payment.


That is what this parliament is going to vote on, and I think it has come to the point where people need to put their vote where their values are.


It is no justification to say, 'I fought this in the caucus' or 'I fought that in the party room, but ultimately I am going to vote for what the party line is.' In the future when we see a single parent with their child and we see the poverty line consequences of actually taking this money from them, every single one of us who votes in support of this legislation has voted for that outcome. That is why the Greens will not be supporting this bill. We think that if the government is so committed to the surplus it should find money elsewhere—for example, by taking away the fossil fuel subsidies, by blocking that loophole in the MRRT. There are any number of ways by which we might raise money. But raising money on the back of single parents and their children is a disgraceful comment on the state of social justice, on the state of generosity and on the state of equity in this country.


I would defy any senator to take a child from your own family and go and live for a week on the amount of money that is going to be allocated, and see how you do trying to clothe and feed a child plus put a roof over their head in the current circumstances. We know that is poverty and we know exactly what we are doing—and there is no excuse for it. And there is no pretence about it either. Let us not have any suggestion that people here do not know what they are doing. Of course, everybody knows what they are doing. You only have to go to any one of those providers of support and welfare in the community who will tell you exactly what this parliament will be doing.


It will be a very sad day for Australia if this legislation gets through. It will also be a line in the sand in terms of the community and what they think political parties stand for. I can tell you that the Greens stand for equity. We want equal opportunity for people in Australia. We want to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in this country. And we want to make sure that the economic tools that we have actually measure the things that count—that is, the level of education, the level of homelessness, the level of health and happiness in the community and sustainability in terms of our engagement with the environment. They are the sorts of things that are basic to everybody—food, shelter, clothing and being able to live on a planet that is able to sustain us.


If our current economic tools do not deliver those outcomes, there is something wrong with the tools and we should change them. We should not drive people into poverty in order to meet the strictures of reaching a budget surplus simply because the government cannot withstand the attacks from the coalition by not meeting its political surplus, when every economist in the country would be saying: 'Look at the state of the economy. The Reserve Bank is cutting interest rates. Can't you see things are slowing?' It is inappropriate to continue with this obsession with the surplus and this refusal to raise money from people who can afford to pay and instead take it from children of single parents. It is disgraceful.


We will not be supporting this bill and nor will we be listening to the excuses of people who say, 'We voted for it because it was the party line.' This is actually a matter of true and core value. What do you value as a person? What sort of society do you want in this country? That is what this piece of legislation stands for. It goes to the heart of the matter. Stop people on a street corner anywhere in the country and ask, 'Do you think single parent payments should be reduced to the point of Newstart so that we drive people into poverty?' Do you think people on street corners would say that they thought that was a good idea—especially if you put to them that we could raise that $700 million by removing a fossil fuel subsidy or that we could get that $700 million by not repaying to the big miners the royalty increases that states might have made? Just about everybody on a street corner would go for the latter options and say, 'Raise the money elsewhere; don't take it from the backs of children.'


This is really a moral issue. It is a totally moral issue and it is a matter of choice about what sort of country we want to live in. The Greens are very clear about the direction we want to see the country go in—and this is totally the wrong direction.

"Carr, Sen Bob",ALP,2012-10-09,"



Senator BOB CARR
 (New South Wales—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (13:50):  The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill will give effect to further reforms to parenting payment and build upon the changes this parliament passed on 9 May 2012 to make the system more equitable for all recipients of parenting payment. The bill will also introduce two other amendments: one relating to the liquid assets waiting period, announced as part of the 2012-13 budget; and another change relating to the income maintenance period.


The reforms to parenting payment are an extension of the broader reforms already introduced as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package announced in 2011. These important changes to income support payments for parents continue this government's focus on providing greater incentives and opportunities, particularly for single parents, to re-engage in the workforce and share in the benefits that work brings. The removal of grandfathering arrangements will provide greater equity and consistency in the parenting payment eligibility rules by ensuring that all parents are assessed the same, regardless of when they first claimed income support. The changes to parenting payment will encourage parents with school-age children to re-enter the workforce sooner and ensure a fair and consistent set of parenting payment eligibility rules where all parents receiving parenting payment will be treated the same.


Under this government there have been better participation outcomes for individuals who have not been grandfathered under the Howard government's parenting payment policy of 2006. In practical terms the evidence has shown us that, while grandfathered parenting payment recipients do better than most job seekers, principal carer parents on Newstart allowance do even better. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012 was passed by parliament on 9 May and introduced changes to the existing transitional payments for parenting payment recipients. These changes reduced the age of eligibility of the youngest child from 16 years to 12 years. The current transitional arrangements are available to parenting payment recipients who have been continually receiving payments prior to 1 July 2006. Since 1 July 2011, children born to or coming into the care of parents who have been receiving parenting payments since before July 2006 have not extended these parents' eligibility for payment.


This bill will continue the reforms to parenting payment so that from 1 January 2013 transitional arrangements will be removed for these parents and they will in the future cease to qualify for parenting payment when their youngest eligible child turns six, for partnered parents, or turns eight, for single parents—the same as other parenting payment recipients. Under these amendments, all parents will have participation requirements when their youngest child turns six, completing the alignment of the parenting payment provisions. There are no other changes to participation requirements. This removes the inequity and inconsistency that currently exists for parenting payment recipients by ensuring that all parents are assessed the same. 


To ensure that individuals and families, particularly those affected by the parenting payment changes, are not disadvantaged when making the transition to new parenting payment arrangements, the government has already made amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to reform the income test. The introduction of a more generous income test, from 1 January 2013, allows these parents to earn over $400 more per fortnight before they lose eligibility for payment. This provides stronger incentives for parents to undertake paid work by allowing parents to retain more of their income support as their employment income rises. 


It is not easy for parents to take up or return to work, and the government considers that the range of training, employment services, child care and career advice assistance that we put in place will reduce those barriers and will greatly assist these parents to find and keep a job. In recognition that these parents are likely to have spent significant periods on income support and out of the workforce, the government is also providing additional support for these parents to ease their transition back into the workforce. As well as additional training places and community based support for single parents announced under the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, the government has provided additional funding in the 2012-13 budget for professional career advisory services.


Additionally, the government is providing additional funding to support increased demand and to better target the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance Program. The government also understands that parents need to balance their family and caring responsibilities with their participation obligations, and parents will continue to have access to the more flexible arrangements to balance part-time work, study or training. The government believes that, all together, these changes provide parents with the right balance of support and incentives. 


The bill amends the liquid assets waiting period to allow newly-unemployed Australians and new students to hold on to more of their savings and better adjust to their new circumstances. From 1 July 2013, the maximum reserve amount for a person who is single will be doubled. A previous temporary doubling of the liquid assets waiting period threshold ceased on 31 March 2011.


This bill also introduces a technical amendment to the definition of termination payment for the purpose of income maintenance period. To help with some of the cost of living pressures that are affecting low- and middle-income Australians and their families, the government is investing $1.1 billion to create a new income support bonus that will be paid to recipients of Newstart allowance and similar payments. The changes in this bill form an important part of the income support reforms announced in the budget. 


The government is now in a position where it can afford to reinstate those thresholds permanently. The amendments proposed by Senator Siewert in relation to the liquid assets waiting period would not affect the calculation of waiting periods and, on this basis, it is more appropriate and practical for the government to continue to periodically review the thresholds in line with the current economic situation.


The changes in this bill form an important part of the income support reforms announced in the 2012-13 budget. These reforms will support more Australians when they are going through tough times and encourage more Australians to participate in and share in the benefits of paid work. The changes will result in fairer and more consistent treatment of income support recipients. I thank senators for their contributions and I commend the bill to the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  The question now is that the bill be read a second time.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-10-09,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (12:33):  The coalition will be supporting the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012, as it is a continuation of Welfare to Work reforms that were initiated by us in government in 2006. I go first of all to the intent of the bill, which is to amend the Social Security Act to remove the grandfathering provisions for parenting payment recipients from 1 January 2013. This will affect those parenting payment recipients who have been continuously receiving parenting payments since before 1 July 2006. Under the previous legislation introduced by the Howard government, recipients of a parenting payment could be grandfathered—or, as we sometimes say these days, grandparented—on this payment until their youngest child turned 16 years old, provided that the child was in their care before 1 July 2011. In addition to removing the grandfathering clause for parents, this bill seeks to double the permissible liquid assets, raising the maximum limit from $2,500 to $5,000 for singles and from $5,000 to $10,000 for those with dependants. It also seeks to define which payments should be categorised as termination payments to ensure that there is consistency across the board when considering the income maintenance period. This will bring the definition of termination payments into line with the policy intent of the Guide to Social Security Law, ensuring that termination payments such as for untaken long service leave, untaken maternity or paternity leave, early termination payments and other such payments are included in the income maintenance period.


However, while the coalition's Welfare to Work reforms were aimed at assisting Australians off welfare and into work, the main aim of this bill is to realise much-needed savings for the government, with expected savings from this bill of around $691.9 million over four years. That is a fair whack of money, and that is why the government has had this damascene conversion to Welfare to Work after years of opposing and indeed demonising the very measures that we are talking about here today.


For many years there has been a view within the OECD that we should increasingly move from passive income support to active income support—in other words, we find ways in which to use the public dollar, if you like, to encourage and support people in making a transition to work. This the Howard government did in 2006, when it invested $3.6 billion into Welfare to Work. It is good to see that Senator Bilyk is listening so intently! There were four under-represented groups of people who were targeted for assistance from Welfare to Work under this initiative, with parents being one of those groups. The 2005-06 budget saw an investment of $389.7 million over four years to specifically assist parents into work. The Welfare to Work reforms of 2006 built on our Australians Working Together initiative from 2003, when parents with children aged between 13 and 15 were required to undertake one or more activities such as job search, education, training or community work to assist them in preparing for a return to work.


From 1 July 2006 new applicants were eligible for parenting payment single when their youngest child was aged less than eight, and they moved to Newstart or another payment when their youngest child turned eight. Single principal carer parents in receipt of the Newstart allowance were also given access to the pensioner card, the pharmaceutical allowance and the telephone allowance. New partnered applicants would receive a parenting payment when their youngest child was six, and they would move to Newstart when their child turned six.


Both parenting payment single and parenting payment partnered recipients had a requirement to look for 15 hours or more of work a week. Parents who were on parenting payment single or partnered as at 30 June 2006 were grandfathered, enabling them to stay on that payment under the current eligibility provisions until their youngest child turned 16. However, job search requirements would apply from the later of 1 July 2007 or when their youngest child turned seven.


Where there were extenuating circumstances, such as a child with a disability or another reason why a parent may have full-time caring requirements, the Welfare to Work legislation permitted temporary exemptions. It was a very deliberate decision on the part of the government to grandfather people who were on these payments at a certain date. The reason for that was actually to make it easier for the public to accept the reform by making it clear that it was not having a retrospective impact but rather that it was focused on new recipients. This has been an important principle in a lot of social security legislation and, indeed, tax legislation over the years. Its purpose was to make it easier for the community to accept the reform.


In addition to access to concessions for single parenting payment recipients, the Howard government ensured that additional out-of-school-hours care was available for parents. However, recent childcare reforms are seeing out-of-school-hours care at great risk, with many centres to close as a result of the national reforms. A new employment participation service was offered to parents with school-aged children, ensuring that they had the skills needed to gain a job.


As part of the coalition policy, parents could refuse a job—and this is quite important—if they were not more than $50 a fortnight better off once we took into account the costs of employment, such as child care, or if they had to travel more than 60 minutes each way to work. Currently, parenting payment recipients are subject to different rules depending on when they first claim payment; so this legislation will bring all parenting payment recipients onto the same standard.


The research undertaken by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on the Welfare to Work reforms demonstrates clearly that there was a 23 per cent increase in the number of single principal carer parents leaving income support after six months in comparison to the previous three years, with 38 per cent moving off payment during 2006-07. The report also showed that over 70 per cent of principal carer parents left income support for employment. In other words, they did not drop out of the workforce: they actually got a job. Similarly for partnered principal carer parents on Newstart allowance, 45 per cent were no longer in receipt of income support payments after six months compared to 32 per cent in 2005-06.


At the time of the Welfare to Work reforms the Howard government introduced a range of complementary services to assist parents in their transition to employment once the youngest child had reached school age. These were all designed to boost workforce engagement and to reduce the dependency on welfare. Regrettably, under the current employment services model many of these forms of assistance are no longer available and the government has not proposed any alternatives.


We recognise that the best way to help parents and their children is to help them get a job. Tony Blair used to speak about fairness in the workplace starting with the opportunity of getting a job. The coalition understands that those children who grow up in a jobless household often face greater disadvantage in their community and an increased likelihood of being welfare dependent themselves. We have seen over generations the intergenerational transmission of poverty, where people grew up in households where neither their grandparents nor their parents ever had a job and going down to the Centrelink office was seen as the way that you picked up your pay.


Intergenerational unemployment is a growing concern in this country, and the longer people remain on welfare then the more difficult the transition to paid employment becomes. That is why these measures are sometimes seen as tough love; in the short term they are seen particularly as applying the stick, subject to certain carrots. It is for the good of the welfare recipient in the long run, so they get back their capacity to participate fully and actively in the job market. With that goes their self-esteem—that goes up—their confidence goes up and their capacity to contribute to the community more generally goes up.


We do have concerns with this bill, even though we support it. Unlike the Welfare to Work agenda introduced by the coalition in 2006, there is no additional funding to support parents into work. This legislation is sending a very negative message: all stick and no carrot. If the government was truly committed to assisting parents back to work it would provide additional assistance. It would do it as part of a coherent, comprehensive, credible strategy around the return to work, or getting people into work. Instead, this government has slashed $162.2 million from Job Services Australia assistance for jobseekers and it has cut a further $44.3 million from outcome payments for Job Services Australia providers.


Parents who are working could be worse off financially as their participation requirements may force them into accepting a job where they are worse off financially. This is in contrast to the Howard government reforms, where parents were promised that they could refuse a suitable job offer if they were not better off by at least $25 a week. In the 2005-06 budget an underlying cash surplus of $8.9 billion was predicted, demonstrating strong economic growth. Unemployment was at its lowest level—5.1 per cent—since 1976, and forecast to trend down further. This is in contrast to Labor's most recent budget, which continued their unmitigated trend of running a deficit, and that is the context in which this legislation has come forward. That is why, as I said before, it is a grab for cash. It is a dash for cash, precisely because the government are running out of other options in order to try and get their budget into a wafer-thin surplus of $1.5 billion in 2012-13.


This means that the government has had to eat humble pie. Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor! Labor voted against the Welfare to Work reforms of the Howard government in 2005, even though those reforms included extensive assistance to help get people back into work—unlike this particular package. Just a few short months ago Labor moved to decrease the parenting payment cut-off age of the youngest child from 16 to 12. Making this further decrease now shows that this is more about achieving a budgetary saving than about a policy that is genuinely committed to assisting people from welfare to work, particularly given the tough economic times that are facing Australian families today.


As I said before, Labor have been hypocrites. On 15 September 2005, ACOSS Advocacy Day—ACOSS being the Australian Council of Social Service—describing the Howard package, Penny Wong said:


This package has nothing to do with moving people from welfare to work and everything to do with extreme cuts to the household budgets of Australian families who can least afford it.


This is even though the legislation at the time provided that you could refuse a job if you were not at least $25 a week better off. Under the government's package, some people will be forced to take a job even if they are worse off. You can have a no-disadvantage test in the labour market under this government because the unions will demand that, but if you are a welfare recipient you cannot get a no-disadvantage test under this government. We were trying to encourage people to go into the workforce and make it a positive experience. All stick, no carrot!


Kelly Hoare, a former member of the other place, said on 1 December 2005:


Labor is opposed to the changes in this bill and it opposes them on the basis that these changes simply dump people from one welfare payment onto a lower welfare payment and push the most vulnerable Australians over the edge by making extreme cuts to their household budgets.


The reality, as I indicated earlier, based on research commissioned by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations was that a significant number of people got into paid employment and were better off as a result.


Dr Carmen Lawrence, a member of the other place, said on 1 December 2005:


… the vulnerable people at whom this legislation is targeted are the ones not able to get the ear of the government. They are not able to walk these corridors with expensive, paid consultants to influence the government's policy, and the government refuses to listen to their advocates.


We did listen to the people who said that if you want to get people into work you have got to make it a positive experience and you have got to give them the assistance to do it. When I worked in the former Howard government, I was one of the people who advocated in 2005-2006 that we grandfather existing recipients, because it was important to get public acceptance of the reform. Labor has now gone further but has provided only stick and no carrot. Dr Carmen Lawrence, if she were here today, would be saying that the people who are not being listened to down the corridors and in the ministerial wing are the most vulnerable in our community.


We will support this legislation. There is no doubt in my mind that it is important we continue the journey of welfare to work. It is also important to recognise that the government have come to this damascene conversion, if I could call it that, on welfare to work simply by the exigencies of their own budgetary situation. It is a pity that, because of that budgetary situation, they cannot see their way clear to actually provide assistance which will facilitate and make the transition to employment a positive experience for parenting payment recipients and their families.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-10-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:47):  Schedule 1 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012 will drive already vulnerable single parents, the majority of whom are single mothers, further into poverty. What this bill does is drop single parents who are currently on parenting payment single down to a payment which is nearly $140 less than what they are on at the moment. We know that Newstart is now around $132 to $140 below the poverty line. In other words, we are dropping single parents onto the poverty line. Aren't single parents still parents? It is not only the mothers and fathers that we are dropping there, but their children as well. That is what you are about to pass in this place. The Greens will be opposing schedule 1 which is the schedule that drops those vulnerable parents onto Newstart. We will be opposing that particular piece of this bill, make no mistake. 


The government is bringing this bill to this chamber despite the recommendations of two of the committee that it controls. The Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee recommended that this bill not proceed until the inquiry into Newstart concluded. Then the newly established Joint Committee on Human Rights, in their first major recommendation, recommended that this bill does not proceed until the Newstart inquiry has finished. Further, on the very last day of the last sitting—around six o'clock, if I recall, when they tabled their report—they said in essence: 



If Newstart combined with other benefits is not sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living for affected individuals, the measures risk being a violation of human rights under article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee was not yet convinced that the affected single parents would 
be able to maintain access to appropriate levels of social security support if placed onto Newstart. As a result, it would be premature for the government to introduce these measures prior to the completion of the Newstart Inquiry. 


But the government is proceeding with this anyway. One of the few things that I agree with that Senator Sinodinos just said is that this is purely a savings measure on the back of some of the most vulnerable people in our community and on the backs of future generations. So if we are talking about entrenching poverty, that is exactly what this measure does: it helps entrench poverty. It helps condemn those children that we as a caring society are supposed to be nurturing and supporting. It helps condemn them to the poverty cycle.


How can we claim that we have a surplus if we have just thrust over 100,000 single-parent families and their children into poverty? How can we then claim that there is a surplus when it is on the backs of the most vulnerable in our community? Make no mistake, this measure reduces the income of single parents and their families, and as I said, over 85 per cent of those are women.


This schedule, if passed, takes away the grandfathered protections that were put in place when the Welfare to Work measures were first moved in this place in 2006. Recipients' parenting payments will cease when their children turn six if they are partnered parents and eight if they are single parents. That means they will end up on Newstart and that will mean a difference of around $140 because, if you remember from our discussion here last sitting, the indexation rates for Newstart and the parenting payment are different.


This measure will affect over 100,000 single parents. This group is the most vulnerable in Australia. Recent data from the OECD shows that around two-thirds of the children of single parents who rely on income support are living below the poverty line and 90 per cent of that particular group are women. Sole parent families on income support already struggle to meet essential living costs and 85 per cent of parenting payment recipients experience multiple deprivation. Multiple deprivation is when you lack three items that are vital for an adequate standard of living—for example, medical treatment, warm clothes, a decent and secure home, schoolbooks for children. Those are things that we consider essential items. I reiterate: over half of the parenting payment recipients are already living in what we would term serious poverty. Now we are talking about cutting their payments further.


The Salvation Army recently released a survey of people accessing its emergency relief centres. Of the 1,731 individuals surveyed, 81 per cent were on income support and 36 per cent of those were single parents with dependent children. The Foodbank report that was launched in this house recently reported that the three main groups being provided with food assistance were low-income families, unemployed people and single parent families. Are you getting the picture? These are families that are already under stress and already living in poverty or close to poverty. Of particular concern is the impact of this measure and of hardship on children. Over half of the respondents to the Salvation Army survey reported they were unable to afford to pay for out-of-school activities for their children and over one-third could not afford for their children to participate in school activities and outings. How is affecting the education of our next generation a sensible measure? And what does this mean for their mental health and their ability to interact and connect with their peers?


It is not surprising that a recent report from the National Association of Community Legal Centres found that the majority of the local government areas with high rates of sole parent households were also some of the most disadvantaged in the country. The people who will be most affected by this bill live in the areas that have poorer infrastructure, supports and services. This measure will make it even harder for them to find work. Get the picture about the multiple deprivation and the multiple barriers to finding work and supporting your family?


Sole parents are more likely than any other group of people to experience financial stress. According to the ABS, 70 per cent of sole parents are in the poorest 20 per cent of the population. How do we expect single parents to be able to survive when we take away more of their income? It is very clear that this group of Australians is very vulnerable and likely to be more marginalised by this measure. I have been quite amazed that the government thinks that, by stripping away further assistance and support for these people, it is actually helping them: 'Let's take more money and pretend we're helping people and pretend this isn't a savings measure.' What this is about is a savings measure dressed up as trying to be helpful. Well, please stop helping, because it is not.


I would like to articulate a few quotes from submissions received by the Senate inquiry. One woman said:


I have gained casual employment with the Salvos' retail, maybe two days per week, which is usually Saturday or Sunday, and occasionally one day during the week. It has taken me two years to find this job as employers don't seem to offer parent friendly hours for people who have limited child care. My elderly parents are two hours away and come when they can to look after her. We are just managing but won't on Newstart. I won't be able to keep what I have earned. 


Another woman said:


Ever since the announcement I have been looking for a second job so that we can afford to live for next year. Who even knows how I'll juggle the child care. I can't get there, I'm just terrified. I've had one interview since May—


this was in July because the hearing was in July—


so where are these jobs they're talking about? I'm educated and already employed yet I am still finding it difficult. I can only imagine how desperate someone suffering after a difficult divorce with a very few children, no recent work history and little education must be feeling. It is hopeless, and hopelessness does not help people work and raise their children.


These two women, unfortunately, are not alone. Tens of thousands of women are going through similar crises. I have a very long list of similar emails and submissions from people. We do not support the government and the opposition pushing these women and their children further into poverty. There are countless examples of people who will be plunged into financial hardship with this measure.


I would like to tackle the view that this is about encouraging single parents into work. Nearly 50 per cent of single parents are, in fact, already working. They are juggling looking after their family, trying to find child care, finding work that has family friendly hours and supporting the children who are our future generation. Pushing families onto Newstart decreases their payments by about $60 to $100, depending on how many children they have and what their circumstances are. It subjects working parents to a much harsher income-free area, of $31 per week, than if they are on parenting payment single. There is also the removal of the additional child income-free area of $12.30 a week and the ending of eligibility for the pension education supplement of up to $31.20 per week. In other words, this is having multiple impacts on single parents. Sole parent who drop from parenting payment single to Newstart and have no current income will lose around $55 per week. The government tried to pretend it was softening this by saying. 'It's okay, we'll give you $210 a year supplementary allowance.' Great: four bucks a week! That is not even the price of a cup of coffee these days—not that you can afford a cup of coffee when you are on Newstart.


Are you getting the picture? People are going to be living on less money. These are people who are already struggling, who are in work part time or struggling to find work.


If you are living in a rural area, for example, child care only works generally in normal working hours, not shiftworking hours. So for a start that blocks you out of any type of shiftwork because you simply cannot get child care. For those that are already working, the income-free area means they get to take home less, so it is having a double effect. Parents out there are not only going to be dropped on Newstart, they are also going to have less money to take in their pockets when they are working. How does it work that we are encouraging people into work and then we are going to drop them onto a payment that has a lower income-free area? How is that encouraging, how is that an incentive? Again, this is not about incentives; this is about the government saving money on the backs of the most vulnerable.


If this payment passes in addition to the payment cuts outlined, parenting payment recipients who move onto Newstart will not be eligible for the $32.64 per week pensioner education supplement. The National Welfare Rights Network estimates that there are over 25,000 parenting payment single recipients who are receiving that supplement. They will be able to continue to receive it but new people will not be able to. This is discouraging and counterproductive for people trying to improve their qualifications and skills. 


We cannot believe that this legislation will in fact help parents into work or encourage parents into work; it will make it harder. Once you are in poverty, that is yet another barrier to finding work. Senator Evans when he was the shadow minister for social security agreed with that. He said: 


Simply cutting payments for people on welfare does nothing to help them get paid work, which is the best way out of poverty. By cutting payments to vulnerable Australians who are already financially disadvantaged, the Howard Government's budget will increase income inequality rather than reduce it.


Well said, Senator Evans, and we agree. There is no difference here between the Welfare to Work measures implemented under the Howard government and this. What they are doing is going after another group of vulnerable Australians.


It is also important to note that parenting payment single recipients are already subject to activity requirements. In other words, they are already supposed to be looking for work and undertaking these activities. This is supposedly to ensure that parents engage in the workforce. The majority of people are already on these sorts of requirements, so these measures will not lead to further activity requirements. The Greens, as I have said on many occasions, are already cautious about activity requirements and question their effectiveness when compared to more positive, less punitive measures. But it is still curious to see that these reforms, which are apparently about activating parents, provide no change in their requirements for this engagement. It makes you wonder whether the government admit that their measures are not being effective in encouraging people to find work.


People that are on parenting payments and trying to find work face multiple barriers. These multiple barriers are the issues that we need to be addressing. It is not easy when you are raising children to be also juggling work in quite child-unfriendly environments. You are more often than not in temporary employment, in casual employment, where you do not know what your regular hours are. I was at the gathering outside Parliament House this morning talking to a group of single parents about this legislation. They were urging this place not to support this particular part of the legislation. In particular I was talking to a single mother who has repeatedly been trying to find work and has been in and out of work—and then, when she is in and out of work due to no fault of her own, she is having problems with Centrelink because it is casual and temporary work. So the system does not help people either. The government would be better off investing in how to address those barriers rather than putting in place more and more punitive approaches to people who are trying to raise their families.


The other issue that has also been raised, and I will be moving an amendment on this if I fail to convince the chamber to oppose this legislation, is the timing of this. This is coming in on 1 January, when every family in this country has trouble paying their bills; they are in debt because of Christmas. 'Here is your great Christmas present. Now you are going to be dropped onto Newstart and get $130 a week less. Then you have got to prepare your kids for school and buy their school uniforms. Sorry about that, sorry that you have got less money. We do actually want your kids to get a better education but we will just make it harder for you to send your kids to school.' We will be moving an amendment to at least move the start of this revolting piece of legislation to 1 July.


I want in the last couple of minutes to address the liquid assets waiting period. The Greens welcome finally seeing this particular piece of legislation, which is schedule 2 of the bill, which reduces the length of the liquid assets waiting period by doubling the maximum reserve threshold for liquid assets. This is a positive measure and one that should have been continued after the GFC package ran out. As people will recall, this was actually part of the GFC package and the Greens strongly advocated that it be retained. In fact, it was our lobbying that got it into the package in the first place. We think it is a positive measure that will help the recently unemployed being faced with very stressful prospects of emptying their bank accounts before they can access income support. So it is a measure that we will be supporting, which is why we are not opposing the bill outright but will be voting separately on both of the schedules of this bill. However, I will be moving a second reading amendment because, as per usual, the government has not dealt with the issue of appropriate indexation. So I will be moving a second reading amendment that the Senate calls on the government to bring forward additional legislation to provide appropriate indexation of the liquid assets maximum reserve threshold.


As I said earlier, the Greens will be opposing schedule 1. If we go down on that and on the arguments of all those single parents who are going to be negatively impacted by this legislation and not manage to sway senators—even those senators who, with their hands on their hearts, have said that they are concerned about those single parents but are still going to vote with the government—I will be moving an amendment, as I indicated, that this legislation commences on 1 July 2013 rather than the Christmas-New Year present that the government proposes for single parents on 1 January. We will not be supporting this legislation, and we urge all senators in this chamber to reconsider their vote and to consider the impact that this legislation will have on single parents and their children. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT

Senator SIEWERT:
  Yes, I do. I move the second reading amendment on sheet No. 7272.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-10-09,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:06):  I compliment both Senator Sinodinos and Senator Siewert for their contributions to this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012. I think the comments that both of them have made are very telling and should be taken on board. There are two elements to this bill for which I have concern. The first is that it fails to promote greater workplace participation, workforce participation, for those people who will be affected by it. The second is that, obviously, this is an attempt by the government to try to balance the budget—a fact which, of course, will never happen under this government—and to do so at the expense of and on the back of the most vulnerable—in this case, low-income earners, carers, single parents and inevitably, as Senator Siewert has eloquently indicated, their children. Those are concerns that I will return to during this presentation. 


We also have real concerns about the primary objectives of the legislation, and that is its failure to promote greater workforce and workplace participation as well as its failure to provide appropriate incentives to encourage those who are out of the workforce to find, to maintain or to re-enter useful employment. They are areas that are obviously of concern. 


In the inquiry that we held into this matter, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations cited evidence which indicates that children who grow up in jobless families are themselves much more likely to experience unemployment as adults. Following on from Senator Siewert, I want to focus on the impact of this legislation on children. If I may quote from the submission by the department to the inquiry: 


Children who grow up in jobless families are far more likely to be out of work as adults compared to those who had a working parent—


or parents. 


It is therefore vital that the income support system seeks to incentivise work in order to break the dependency cycle. The system must provide the right balance of support and incentive to work to ensure that parents are in a position to benefit from the opportunities the economy has to offer, particularly as their children get older and the parent's capacity for work increases, and provide their families with positive role models and greater financial security. 


I will repeat those—as I am sure they go to the heart of what we all would agree in this place—and they are: positive role models by parents or their carers for their children and greater financial security being stability. 


It was at the same inquiry that Ms Netty Horton, the Territorial Social Program Director of the Salvation Army—and I must say that she was not supportive of the legislation—explained to the committee:


We would like to be very clear in that we are fully supportive of moving as many people as possible—single parents or unemployed people in general—towards being able to work, and some of the focus of our submission has been around our experiences in working with the most disadvantaged group of those people in the community and recognising that they need additional support and incentives to move them into the paid workforce. 


She went on to conclude: 


We recognise that that is the best way out of poverty and the best way to ensure participation both for them and for their children in the community. 


Those are very telling comments. 


The regrettable aspect of the matter that we are discussing today has, of course, been the inability of this government to carry on the work commenced by the Howard government under the Welfare to Work reforms of 2006. At the time, those reforms were predicated on the basis of some $8.9 billion in cash surplus that had been generated following the repayment of the debt of the then Keating government. It was because of that surplus that the Howard government was able to implement its Welfare to Work reforms. It invested some $3.6 billion in 2006, with $400 million over four years of that specifically directed to assist parents into work—the very people we are speaking about. The Labor government today have made some effort to try and continue those initiatives, but because they have now got themselves into the circumstance of such deep indebtedness and deficit, we see them taking these sorts of actions in an attempt to try and save some $789 million over four years at the expense of who, I would say, are the most vulnerable in the community. 


The Howard government initiatives, amongst others, had a requirement that single and parenting payment partnered recipients seek at least 15 hours of work each week and to start that process themselves, psychologically as well as physically, to return to the workplace. In addition to that, there was access to concessions for single parenting payment recipients. Here the Howard government ensured additional out-of-school-hours care to be available for parents. But we know that only recently under a different guise childcare reforms are seeing this out-of-school-hours care being placed at risk in 2012, with many of the centres being forced to close as a result of the so-called national reforms. So we are going to see a double whammy here, and that is an inability for people to ensure their children are cared for whilst they either seek employment or, indeed, undertake those works. 


As part of that coalition policy at that time parents could refuse a job if they would not be more than $50 a fortnight better off once the costs of employment were factored in—including, of course, child care—or if they had to travel for more than 60 minutes each way to work. Very sensible initiatives, but of course they have also unfortunately gone by the wayside.


I heard my colleague Senator Sinodinos quote from the then department of education and workplace's Welfare to Work reforms that showed there were significant increases, 23 per cent I believe, in the number of single principal carer parents leaving income support after six months in comparison to the three previous years as a result of those initiatives, and 38 per cent moving off the payment during 2006-07. That was for single principal carers, and the report showed that more than 70 per cent of principal carer parents left income support for employment. For partnered principal carer parents on the Newstart allowance, 45 per cent were no longer in receipt of income support payments after six months, compared to 32 per cent the previous year—an increase of some 13 per cent. So we could see evidence of improvements being undertaken and at the same time systems were in place to ensure that there was child care for children, and there was the capacity for an orderly transfer to work.


These measures were designed to boost workforce engagement, reduce dependency on welfare and, returning to the comments made earlier, to try to break that cycle of long-term intergenerational unemployment, which of itself unfortunately generally leads to a circumstance in which the growing child comes to expect a life themselves of unemployment, and that is unacceptable. I referred to that in my first speech in the Senate on 17 March 2009; I reflected that in a country like this we should surely never see a circumstance in which we look to a situation in which young people particularly would not find useful, gainful and obviously lucrative employment.


There are benefits to this bill. We do recognise that the best way to help parents and their children is to help the parents find a job. We do understand, as I have just indicated, that children growing up in a jobless household will be much more likely themselves to face long-term unemployment, underemployment or the third of that trifecta—that is, unfulfilling employment. It is not just the fact of getting a job or keeping a job; it is the fact of aspiring to a job that of itself will be of interest and of itself will help the person grow over time. All of us in this place have seen the experience that is denied young people when they themselves have not had that opportunity.


Intergenerational unemployment is a growing concern in Australia and the longer people remain on welfare the more difficult it becomes. I agree with Senator Siewert; indeed, the coalition shares its support for the increase in the level or limit of the liquid assets waiting period. In fact I have some difficulties even with the level or the limit to which it is being placed. I would like to see over time that figure potentially being increased because, as we all know, there are unforeseen problems that occur in families, be they emergencies or whatever, and it is unreasonable that we should not penalise somebody having some sort of a cash reserve, either as a single or as combined parents, to be able to overcome those emergency periods.


We do have concerns with the bill. I have tried to outline some of them. There is no additional funding to support parents into work, and I cannot emphasise that enough. I think that is one of its great deficiencies, in contrast to the Howard initiatives of 2006. I believe it is incumbent on the government to go back and re-examine these figures and see whether or not they cannot return to providing that additional assistance. It is the case that the government have slashed some $160 million from Job Services Australia assistance for job seekers. That is a very, very significant sum, and the impact of it will be adverse on those seeking employment and ultimately on their families. A further $44 million has been cut from the outcome payments for Job Services Australia providers. All of these are directed at the ultimate failure of the legislation that is before us.


The deep concern I have and to which I referred at the beginning, and which so many people are acutely conscious of—whether or not government senators do come out and say so publicly remains to be seen—is the effort of this government to try to hive off some $700 million over four years from the most vulnerable and those least able to afford it. Why is that? Why was it that in 2006 the Howard government was able to inject some $3.8 billion into the Welfare to Work initiative, some $400 million specifically to assist parents into work? It was because the economy was in surplus and because there was a surplus budget. That is what we were able to do.


We see a circumstance now where I believe these figures really are terribly telling. I want to focus on this circumstance. In 2007 this government inherited $70 billion of surplus. In this year's budget, it was estimated that the debt would blow out to $147 billion from a $70 billion surplus. But of course that is now not the case. We learnt only today—I believe Senator Williams said it, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that we are now looking at a national debt of some $250 billion. Not the 147—




Senator Williams:
  252!




Senator BACK:
  I am sorry, it is $252 billion—that last $2 billion would certainly have gone to paying this, Senator Williams. So from a $70 billion surplus in 2007 we now have an estimated $147 billion debt this year—in fact, it is already $252 billion.


Let me put that into perspective for you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if I may. The annual interest bill alone is $6.6 billion—that is, $6,600 million each year. Just the $600 million would account for the $700-odd million that the government is trying to save in this exercise. When the Howard government came into office following the Keating period, Peter Costello was able to pay back $96 billion of debt and, in so doing, saved some $5 billion over the remaining period of that government. We are not talking $5 billion over the remaining period of a government; we are talking about $6.6 billion of debt every year at our current debt levels. Here we are arguing—and we listened to what I would certainly agree was an eloquent representation by Senator Siewert—about the impacts on the most vulnerable people in the community in this move to try to save $700 million over four years when we seem to be accepting $6.6 billion worth of interest payments alone on a debt of $252 billion. This is all in the name of trying to protect a budget surplus. 


The budget deficit, the annual difference between revenue and expenditure, was estimated by Treasurer Swan to be $22 billion in 2011-12. It doubled and it blew out to $43.7 billion. Since Labor came to government the deficit, the difference each year between revenue and expenditure, when put together over the life of this government has become $170 billion. They are telephone book figures. So any capacity by this government to actually balance a budget when it has a track record to date of accumulating a $173 billion deficit is a nonsense. It has no capacity to do so. There are many other areas in which the government should be looking for savings so as not to put the yoke upon the shoulders of these most vulnerable people and their children. But, of course, that is the circumstance the government finds itself in because of its profligate spending and because of its waste. The burden is now being carried particularly by those who are most vulnerable.


I will finish my contribution on this with the lamentable observation that not only do we have currently $252 billion of debt and $6.6 billion of annual interest payments on that debt but also, to date, we have seen unfunded commitments of some $120 billion further by the government leading into the next election, whenever that is held. The emphasis must be on two areas. Firstly, there must be sufficient funding so that people do not live in that level of poverty to which others have referred, as I have. Secondly, there must be adequate funding to make sure that those who become eligible to return to the workforce have the financial wherewithal to seek employment, to get to interviews, to complete a task and to have their children minded as needed. Just having clothing and being able to present yourself in a physical and psychological way so that you are attractive to an employer or to those who are interviewing you for employment, as indeed those of us who are participating in these inquiries can, are of themselves critically important. I simply urge that before this bill is given its final concurrence, which, as Senator Sinodinos said, the coalition will not be opposing, we re-examine the circumstances of adequacy and those other incentives, and return the incentives that the Howard government had in place that marked the success of this program so that we can give some dignity to those people.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-10-09,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:27):  I have some significant concerns in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012. At the outset, it is important to note that the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee report on this bill raised a number of key issues, and let us put them into perspective. I read from the committee's report, which says:


Schedule 1 of the bill seeks to remove 'grandfathering' provisions established on 1 July 2006 and would supersede transitional amendments passed in 2011 and earlier this year. If the bill is passed, from 1 January 2013—


less than three months away—


eligibility for parenting payment for partnered recipients would cease when the youngest child under their care turns 6 years old, or when the youngest child of a single parent turns 8 years old.


all grandfathered recipients would have participation requirements when their youngest child turns 6 (currently this is not until that child turns 7).


So this is a further tightening up. This is further penalising of those recipients. I note your contribution in the media, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, which I thought expressed in a very measured way concerns about these measures. I thought they were wise comments about proceeding in such haste. I think your comments, Mr Acting Deputy President, reflected widespread community concerns.


The recommendations of the report of the committee were that this bill should not be debated until the Joint Committee on Human Rights had concluded its inquiry and until the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee had completed its references inquiry into the adequacy of the Newstart Allowance and other payments. The Joint Committee on Human Rights also recommended that the bill not be debated until the inquiry into Newstart is complete. That makes a lot of sense. Why are we rushing this? I do not believe it is appropriate to go against the recommendations of these two inquiries to debate and vote on this bill now. It is hasty. It is unwise.


If the government are serious about the intention of this bill, which they have stated is to encourage people to join the workforce, then surely it is worth the time to make sure there will not be any unintended consequences and, furthermore, that these measures will actually work. This bill will have a significant effect on the people it is targeting. This is the second time this group will have an end date put on their parenting payments, and I find it very concerning that this date is continually being brought forward. These kinds of decisions make it hard for people to plan for the future, and the financial uncertainty this has caused for them is nothing short of unfair.


We must also keep in mind that this group represents something like one-third of parenting payment recipients. The other two-thirds of recipients are already living under the harsh conditions this bill seeks to enforce. There are two facets to this problem. Firstly, there is the issue of Newstart. It is a woefully low allowance, and it is very easy to see how it could hinder, rather than help, job seekers. It grinds people into the ground. If it demoralises them, if it dispirits them, if it means that they are just living from hand to mouth on a week by week basis, I cannot see how that empowers people to look for work, to be job ready. In my view, it is vital that this bill be delayed until the inquiry into this allowance is complete and any recommendations it makes are implemented. Things are bad enough already for the people on this allowance. We do not need to add to their number at this stage.


Secondly, there is the issue of reducing allowances to encourage people into employment. I agree with the government that it is important for people to have a job, and not just for the fiscal argument—being gainfully employed, in whatever field, whether full or part time, plays a vital part in a person's self-esteem. It helps to keep us connected, to know that we and our contributions are valued. I do not see how this bill will encourage people to work. Punitive measures are not the solution. If the government genuinely wants to help people, particularly single parents, transition back into the workforce, then they need to work towards that aim. Everyone here knows it is not as simple as, 'Do it or else!' If higher employment in these areas is genuinely the goal then we need to look at targeted measures to support and encourage people. We need to have a bit of carrot rather than just all stick.


These kinds of programs are not cheap, but just throwing cash at the problem will not solve it either. In fact, if the government were serious about their stated aim, they would not be looking at it as a saving—anything but. Instead they would be setting money aside and working out where to spend it for the best impact. They would be consulting with experts, community groups and people working at the coalface on these issues. But it appears that none of this has happened. Instead, they are insisting on punitive measures, which we know just will not work.


There is another argument here: that all parenting payment recipients should be on an equal footing. I agree with that, but, instead of reducing the allowance to meet the lowest common denominator of Newstart, what if we raised it? What if we just take into account the special circumstances that sole parents are in in so many cases? What if we raised Newstart too? And what if we looked at getting people into work as more than a 'follow the rules and tick the boxes' process? Then maybe we would see the outcomes the government is predicting.


Ultimately, I cannot support this bill. I do not support its intentions in the sense that they appear to be primarily punitive. Of course we want to encourage greater participation in the workforce. Of course we all want people to have meaningful work. But I do not support this bill being rushed through, debated in this place and being voted on against the recommendations of two committees—two committees that have carefully considered the implications of this bill. It is time for the government to take a step back and to take the time to look at the whole issue and how it can be appropriately addressed. This bill is not the solution. It is not even part of the answer. I cannot support this bill.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-10-09,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:33):  I rise today to indicate that the Australian Greens, of course, will not be supporting schedule 1 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012 that is before us, as my colleague senator Rachel Siewert has indicated earlier in her contribution. This route goes to the heart of what sort of country we want to live in in Australia. It literally goes to the heart of what the purpose of a budget is. A budget and an economy are nothing of themselves. Budgets and economic tools are only there to deliver for the community at large. There are only two real things in the world: people and nature. We developed economic tools to govern that relationship so that it would be a sustainable one in the longer term and to govern the relationship between people. At the heart of the relationship between people needs to be equity—equal opportunity for all. Surely that goes to the heart of what is the point of an economic system and its economic set of tools. What we have here is economic tools delivering appalling outcomes for the community. If that is the case then the tools need to be changed. We need to be looking at what the indicators are of what we want to be measuring in Australia to determine whether we are successfully having tools that deliver in the broadest sense—so that we have ecological sustainability and a healthy and happy community into the longer term.


The bill before us impacts 100,000 single parents, 85 per cent of whom are women, who are dropping from the payment they have to a Newstart allowance payment, which puts them at the poverty line. They are going to lose between $60 and $100 a week when you take into account not only the loss in payment but also the tax thresholds. You have a point where you are saying that in order to reach a budget surplus, which is a political surplus, you are prepared to put 100,000 people into poverty. I ask you, Acting Deputy President Cameron: how is that justified on what we hear time and time again from the Prime Minister about Labor values and working families? How is putting people into poverty a Labor value? How is people putting into poverty a Labor value when at the same time you see the ongoing areas where we could be raising money, like getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies for a start; like blocking the loophole in the MRRT—any number of ways we could be raising money. But, no, in order to reach this surplus, the government is prepared to put 100,000 single parents into poverty.


Now let us go to this issue that somehow that will help people get jobs. We know that driving people into poverty will preclude them from employment. It actually costs money to become job ready. In fact, the only increase in employment support that ACOSS have been able to identify in the budget is $3 million to extend a telephone career counselling service. They go on to say that they understand that the increased allocation for JET childcare assistance reflects higher demand for an existing childcare subsidy, not an extension of access to that program. The fact is if you are unemployed and you are going to have even less money to be able to be job ready then you will be less likely to be able to achieve employment.


Let us go back and talk about what will happen to the children who will be affected when the single parents, 85 per cent of whom I have said a moment ago are women, are in these circumstances. I would like the Prime Minister to tell Australians how the children of single parents who are now being forced into poverty are going to have equal opportunity with other children in Australian society. The reality is they will not—and equality of opportunity is not only important in terms of a value. Let me put a monetary figure on it. We know that in countries where the gap between the rich and the poor gets wider and wider there are many increased costs in terms of the level of public safety, for example, and we also know about the health care and other associated costs that go into the mix as a consequence of where you have gated communities of the wealthy and other communities of the very poor. That is where this is headed in Australia and that is what I find so offensive about what the government is doing. It cannot be justified. I understand that there was a vigorous debate in the Labor Party on this particular issue and I understand that the views were reasonably evenly divided in relation to the matter.


Nevertheless, the test of this will be to see who actually crosses the floor on it. We heard from Senator Back a little while ago about how appalling it is to drive people into poverty—and he was absolutely correct that it is—but, Senator Back, will you vote against schedule 1? That is the point. It is all very well to rail against poverty but when push comes to shove and the vote is called on this, who is going to vote to prevent the 100,000 single parents losing this payment? Who is going to vote to prevent them being pushed into poverty? I think everybody concedes that Newstart is actually driving people into poverty to the point where you have parliamentary committees having met in this place and having said that this will drive people into poverty with, in fact, those committees saying the government should delay this legislation until the committee looking into Newstart, for example, actually reports.


Then you have got the humiliating scenario where the Australian Council of Social Service, the National Welfare Rights Centre, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children, Women Everywhere Advocating Violence Elimination, the Council for Single Mothers and their Children Victoria, Women's Legal Services New South Wales and the Human Rights Law Centre have become so desperate that they have all been getting together to send a letter to a United Nations special rapporteur over the federal government's decision to bring on this legislation against the advice of those parliamentary committees. In that letter it is pointed out, of course, that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights had already advised the government to delay the bill, citing major reservations. One of them was:


If Newstart combined with other benefits is not sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living for affected individuals, the measures risk being a violation of human rights under article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights.


How humiliating is it in a global sense for a rich country like Australia to be risking violation of article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights because we are driving people into poverty and the people being driven into poverty are not only single parents but also children? Where does that leave us in terms of global standing in the UN system? We have already embarrassed this nation with violation of human rights when it comes to the treatment of refugees. Now we are going to humiliate ourselves again by being in violation of human rights when it comes to economic, social and cultural rights.


The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights was also not convinced that the affected single parents would be able to maintain access to appropriate levels of social security support if placed on Newstart and, as a result, it argued it would be premature for the government to introduce these measures prior to the completion of the Newstart inquiry. This is really an extraordinary situation and I think it puts paid to any notion when the Labor Party stand up and say that they stand for Labor values and that the Labor values somehow go to equality of opportunity, a decent life for all, minimising the gap between the rich and the poor, and facilitating people getting into meaningful work, with the human dignity that is associated with that. They cannot claim to be promoting all of these things if they legislate to save $700 million off the backs of single parents and their children. It is disgraceful that this is being driven through this Senate at a time when parliamentary committees have said quite clearly this is premature and they need to look a bit more at what is going on with Newstart.


Actually, they really do not need to look any further into what is going on with Newstart. We have heard from practically all the social justice agencies in the country, who have submitted that Newstart is actually entrenching poverty and acting as a barrier to people looking for work. We have heard that from Dr Cassandra Goldie, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Council of Social Services, we have heard it from the Salvation Army and we have heard it from many others. The Salvation Army submitted that:


Newstart allowance is inequitable and inadequate as it is lower than pensions for retirees, below the poverty line, and has a more restricted earning threshold compared to the Parenting Payment.


That is what this parliament is going to vote on, and I think it has come to the point where people need to put their vote where their values are.


It is no justification to say, 'I fought this in the caucus' or 'I fought that in the party room, but ultimately I am going to vote for what the party line is.' In the future when we see a single parent with their child and we see the poverty line consequences of actually taking this money from them, every single one of us who votes in support of this legislation has voted for that outcome. That is why the Greens will not be supporting this bill. We think that if the government is so committed to the surplus it should find money elsewhere—for example, by taking away the fossil fuel subsidies, by blocking that loophole in the MRRT. There are any number of ways by which we might raise money. But raising money on the back of single parents and their children is a disgraceful comment on the state of social justice, on the state of generosity and on the state of equity in this country.


I would defy any senator to take a child from your own family and go and live for a week on the amount of money that is going to be allocated, and see how you do trying to clothe and feed a child plus put a roof over their head in the current circumstances. We know that is poverty and we know exactly what we are doing—and there is no excuse for it. And there is no pretence about it either. Let us not have any suggestion that people here do not know what they are doing. Of course, everybody knows what they are doing. You only have to go to any one of those providers of support and welfare in the community who will tell you exactly what this parliament will be doing.


It will be a very sad day for Australia if this legislation gets through. It will also be a line in the sand in terms of the community and what they think political parties stand for. I can tell you that the Greens stand for equity. We want equal opportunity for people in Australia. We want to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor in this country. And we want to make sure that the economic tools that we have actually measure the things that count—that is, the level of education, the level of homelessness, the level of health and happiness in the community and sustainability in terms of our engagement with the environment. They are the sorts of things that are basic to everybody—food, shelter, clothing and being able to live on a planet that is able to sustain us.


If our current economic tools do not deliver those outcomes, there is something wrong with the tools and we should change them. We should not drive people into poverty in order to meet the strictures of reaching a budget surplus simply because the government cannot withstand the attacks from the coalition by not meeting its political surplus, when every economist in the country would be saying: 'Look at the state of the economy. The Reserve Bank is cutting interest rates. Can't you see things are slowing?' It is inappropriate to continue with this obsession with the surplus and this refusal to raise money from people who can afford to pay and instead take it from children of single parents. It is disgraceful.


We will not be supporting this bill and nor will we be listening to the excuses of people who say, 'We voted for it because it was the party line.' This is actually a matter of true and core value. What do you value as a person? What sort of society do you want in this country? That is what this piece of legislation stands for. It goes to the heart of the matter. Stop people on a street corner anywhere in the country and ask, 'Do you think single parent payments should be reduced to the point of Newstart so that we drive people into poverty?' Do you think people on street corners would say that they thought that was a good idea—especially if you put to them that we could raise that $700 million by removing a fossil fuel subsidy or that we could get that $700 million by not repaying to the big miners the royalty increases that states might have made? Just about everybody on a street corner would go for the latter options and say, 'Raise the money elsewhere; don't take it from the backs of children.'


This is really a moral issue. It is a totally moral issue and it is a matter of choice about what sort of country we want to live in. The Greens are very clear about the direction we want to see the country go in—and this is totally the wrong direction.

"Carr, Sen Bob",ALP,2012-10-09,"



Senator BOB CARR
 (New South Wales—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (13:50):  The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill will give effect to further reforms to parenting payment and build upon the changes this parliament passed on 9 May 2012 to make the system more equitable for all recipients of parenting payment. The bill will also introduce two other amendments: one relating to the liquid assets waiting period, announced as part of the 2012-13 budget; and another change relating to the income maintenance period.


The reforms to parenting payment are an extension of the broader reforms already introduced as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package announced in 2011. These important changes to income support payments for parents continue this government's focus on providing greater incentives and opportunities, particularly for single parents, to re-engage in the workforce and share in the benefits that work brings. The removal of grandfathering arrangements will provide greater equity and consistency in the parenting payment eligibility rules by ensuring that all parents are assessed the same, regardless of when they first claimed income support. The changes to parenting payment will encourage parents with school-age children to re-enter the workforce sooner and ensure a fair and consistent set of parenting payment eligibility rules where all parents receiving parenting payment will be treated the same.


Under this government there have been better participation outcomes for individuals who have not been grandfathered under the Howard government's parenting payment policy of 2006. In practical terms the evidence has shown us that, while grandfathered parenting payment recipients do better than most job seekers, principal carer parents on Newstart allowance do even better. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012 was passed by parliament on 9 May and introduced changes to the existing transitional payments for parenting payment recipients. These changes reduced the age of eligibility of the youngest child from 16 years to 12 years. The current transitional arrangements are available to parenting payment recipients who have been continually receiving payments prior to 1 July 2006. Since 1 July 2011, children born to or coming into the care of parents who have been receiving parenting payments since before July 2006 have not extended these parents' eligibility for payment.


This bill will continue the reforms to parenting payment so that from 1 January 2013 transitional arrangements will be removed for these parents and they will in the future cease to qualify for parenting payment when their youngest eligible child turns six, for partnered parents, or turns eight, for single parents—the same as other parenting payment recipients. Under these amendments, all parents will have participation requirements when their youngest child turns six, completing the alignment of the parenting payment provisions. There are no other changes to participation requirements. This removes the inequity and inconsistency that currently exists for parenting payment recipients by ensuring that all parents are assessed the same. 


To ensure that individuals and families, particularly those affected by the parenting payment changes, are not disadvantaged when making the transition to new parenting payment arrangements, the government has already made amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to reform the income test. The introduction of a more generous income test, from 1 January 2013, allows these parents to earn over $400 more per fortnight before they lose eligibility for payment. This provides stronger incentives for parents to undertake paid work by allowing parents to retain more of their income support as their employment income rises. 


It is not easy for parents to take up or return to work, and the government considers that the range of training, employment services, child care and career advice assistance that we put in place will reduce those barriers and will greatly assist these parents to find and keep a job. In recognition that these parents are likely to have spent significant periods on income support and out of the workforce, the government is also providing additional support for these parents to ease their transition back into the workforce. As well as additional training places and community based support for single parents announced under the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, the government has provided additional funding in the 2012-13 budget for professional career advisory services.


Additionally, the government is providing additional funding to support increased demand and to better target the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance Program. The government also understands that parents need to balance their family and caring responsibilities with their participation obligations, and parents will continue to have access to the more flexible arrangements to balance part-time work, study or training. The government believes that, all together, these changes provide parents with the right balance of support and incentives. 


The bill amends the liquid assets waiting period to allow newly-unemployed Australians and new students to hold on to more of their savings and better adjust to their new circumstances. From 1 July 2013, the maximum reserve amount for a person who is single will be doubled. A previous temporary doubling of the liquid assets waiting period threshold ceased on 31 March 2011.


This bill also introduces a technical amendment to the definition of termination payment for the purpose of income maintenance period. To help with some of the cost of living pressures that are affecting low- and middle-income Australians and their families, the government is investing $1.1 billion to create a new income support bonus that will be paid to recipients of Newstart allowance and similar payments. The changes in this bill form an important part of the income support reforms announced in the budget. 


The government is now in a position where it can afford to reinstate those thresholds permanently. The amendments proposed by Senator Siewert in relation to the liquid assets waiting period would not affect the calculation of waiting periods and, on this basis, it is more appropriate and practical for the government to continue to periodically review the thresholds in line with the current economic situation.


The changes in this bill form an important part of the income support reforms announced in the 2012-13 budget. These reforms will support more Australians when they are going through tough times and encourage more Australians to participate in and share in the benefits of paid work. The changes will result in fairer and more consistent treatment of income support recipients. I thank senators for their contributions and I commend the bill to the chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Siewert be agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  The question now is that the bill be read a second time.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (14:07):  My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. I refer the minister to his public comments regarding the James Ashby allegations against the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Peter Slipper. I remind the minister of his tweet of 5 May 2012 which said:


This Ashby seems more rehearsed than a kabuki actor.


I also refer the minister to the recent reports of appalling, derogatory and misogynistic text messages sent by Mr Slipper to Mr Ashby. Given that the Commonwealth has now settled with Mr Ashby for a sum of $50,000, does the minister stand by his previous public comments on this matter and does he believe that Mr Slipper is now an international embarrassment?

The PRESIDENT:  Order! No! You need to ask a question, Senator.




Senator KROGER:
  I refer the minister to the fact that Mr Slipper, with the Serbian ambassador, is tonight hosting an evening of traditional Serbian food, wine and dancing in the Speaker's courtyard. Is the foreign minister attending this function? And if not, why not? Does he believe that it is appropriate that Mr Slipper is hosting such events with the representatives of foreign countries while under such a cloud?

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (14:15):  I ask a further supplementary question, Mr President. I refer to the fact that since this scandal broke, Mr Slipper has officially visited Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Cyprus and, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, in the coming months he has booked trips to Italy, Morocco, Malta, Algeria, Tunisia, Qatar and Argentina. Given today's reports of Mr Slipper's disgraceful and misogynistic attitude to women, does the minister believe that Mr Slipper is an appropriate person to represent the Parliament of Australia?




The PRESIDENT:
  The minister can answer that question insomuch as it applies to the portfolio.

Senator BOB CARR
 (New South Wales—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:08):  The first point to make is that this matter is in the court, where it belongs.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator BOB CARR:
  It is in the court! The second point to make—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! When there is silence.




Senator BOB CARR:
  Therefore, I stand absolutely by my comments that this matter should have gone straight to court and not been filtered through the political process.


The second point I would make is this—and if the opposition regarded the comments that emerged in the court as repellent in their attitude towards women as we do on this side of the House, they would join me in giving an unqualified condemnation of those comments—that I am advised the government has entered into a deed with Mr Ashby which provides releases to the Commonwealth and gives effect to the settlement reached. The government takes sexual harassment in the workplace very seriously. That is the very reason that these matters belonged in the court from the first place, and did not belong—




Senator Cormann:
  Why did you comment on Ashby before?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You are going to have to ask Brandis why he commented on—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! When there is silence we will proceed.




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The minister was asked two specific questions: does he stand by his previous public comments in this matter, that he was more rehearsed than a kabuki actor—




Senator Bob Carr:
  Answered that—answered!




Senator Abetz:
  He stands by that—thank you very much. And whether Mr Slipper—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Just wait a minute: it is improper to debate the matter across the chamber. You are quite entitled to make a point of order, and if someone wishes to take another point of order based on the matter before the chair that is an entitlement that exists. So I discourage people from debating it across the chamber.




Senator ABETZ:
  If I may: given Senator Carr's interjection, I withdraw my first request because it is now on the record that Senator Carr acknowledges that he stands by his previous public comments.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is debating the issue!




Senator ABETZ:
  I therefore move to the second aspect of my point of order, which was whether or not the minister believes that Mr Slipper is now an international embarrassment.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Mr President, I would urge you to rule that there is no point of order. Despite the question probably being out of order in the sense that it did not refer to the minister's ministerial responsibilities, he has been giving a comprehensive and fulsome answer. There is no point of order.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. The minister has 31 seconds remaining.




Senator BOB CARR:
  I want to inform the Senate that mediation was held with all parties last week. I am advised that the government's hope with this was that this process would bring about settlement between all parties. Unfortunately, the mediation was unable to settle the matter between Mr Ashby and Mr Slipper. The terms of the settlement are public, and they include an express provision that the Commonwealth does not accept liability.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (15:10):  On 21 September 2012 I took a question on notice from Senator Xenophon regarding migration. I now seek leave to have the answer incorporated into Hansard. 


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



QUESTION TAKEN ON NOTICE


SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION TO SENATOR KATE LUNDY —FRIDAY 21 SEPTEMBER 2012


IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP PORTFOLIO 


On Friday 21 September Senator Xenophon asked:


Does the government consider it acceptable that an overseas based flight crew works on a domestic flight which is tagged as an international flight but where the overwhelming majority of passengers are; indeed; domestic passengers—that that could be seen as an abuse of either the 457 or the special purpose visa arrangements?


Answer:


If a valid subclass 457 Temporary Long Stay Business visa with appropriate sponsorship was held, international aircrew working on flights tagged international, but carrying domestic passengers, would not be considered an abuse of subclass 457 visa arrangements.


Special purpose visa provisions relating to airline crew were not designed for foreign airline crew to perform identifiably separate tasks from their international airline crew work in Australia.


Special purpose visas are not appropriate for use by international airline crew on domestic sectors that do not have a reasonable connection to an international service. Any work performed in relation to a domestic leg of an international flight should be incidental and in no way separate from the international sector.


A separate issue is the economic regulation of these flights. For example, to whom airlines may sell tickets, specifically in terms of whether they may be allowed to sell passengers domestic tickets. These are questions for the Infrastructure and Transport portfolios.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-10-09,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to questions without notice asked by Senators Birmingham and Sterle today relating to the carbon tax and to the wheat industry.




Senator Ludwig:
  'And others'—does that include us?




Senator JOYCE:
  Well, that's exactly right! It is amazing how one day those opposite cast aspersions that apparently the whole National Party is a doormat and then we get accused of running the show. I wish they would make up their mind. I do not know if it is a compliment or an insult, but what is always very interesting is the Labor Party's position on endeavouring to cool the planet, cooling the planet single-handedly from a room in Canberra. This is done by the same people who apparently believe that the way to negotiate on the NBN is to put red underpants on your head, a la Senator Conroy. We always know that if you are starting negotiations it is the first thing that comes into a Labor Party member's mind—where are my grundies, how do I get them on my head, what colour are they?—because unless you do that it just makes no sense at all. We also know that if you treat people vaguely like potato serfs from tsarist Russia you get a lot further! These are the people who are apparently going to cool the planet, so that is what we have had lately, apart from the dismal polls this morning and I wonder, pray tell, how that could have happened and what could be happening now that no-one realises.


Could it possibly be that people's power bills are turning up and they are starting to see them go up not in increments of $10 or $20 but of hundreds of dollars? I say 'hundreds of dollars' because these lunatics think that they can single-handedly cool the planet by making people poorer. This is their mechanism to bring about the refreezing of the northern polar ice caps. They are going to refreeze the northern polar ice caps through moving street by street through the suburbs of Ipswich, Blacktown and Penrith. This is how they are going to do it: make everybody poorer, put it on their bill and somehow the world will get colder.


We all recognise that this works so well! A broad based consumption tax has an immense climatic effect! We can all remember at the time that the GST came in that it got immensely colder overnight. I remember it! You couldn't help yourself noticing that the GST came in and the place got colder—and of course this is what is going to happen with the broad-based consumption tax, which is the carbon tax, that we will note a difference in the climate. And maybe it is working because it is a bit chilly today! It got remarkably chilly once the Newspoll came out. But what is the purpose of making people poorer? Why is that the fundamental core belief now of the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens and the Independents? Why is it that the core policy that they will take to the Australian people at the next election is that they were successful in making you poorer, they were successful in bringing home a tax that is actually going to do nothing to the climate but is going to do everything to that spare cash that is so fundamentally important? And these are the same people with the economic management who are apparently going to cool the planet and one of them is the same one who is currently in excess of a quarter of a trillion dollars in gross debt and has forced debt through the previous debt ceiling—and they are on their way to the $300 billion debt ceiling. So the prognostications that I made a couple of years ago about us getting ourselves into a world of trouble are now being echoed by people such as David Murray, the head of the Future Fund, who has been kept there by the Australian Labor Party so they must believe in his economic credentials.


Why would David Murray mention Australia and Greece in the same interview on The 7.30 Report? That is a peculiar outcome. Could it possibly be that he thinks that your debt is out of control? Could it possibly be that the debt is out of control? How, we wonder, are you going to finance this debt? Where will the money come from? Could it possibly be that a broad based consumption tax, under the guise of a carbon tax for the purpose of cooling of the planet, might be one of the mechanisms which they are desperately looking at now to try to prop up the parlous state of our nation's finances?


I will tell you one thing: making people poorer is not the way to get votes. Making people poorer by connecting them to the Australian Taxation Office through the power points in their houses with a broad based consumption tax that will be delivered through everything they do in their lives—from boiling the billy to making a cup of tea, to putting on the electric blanket, to putting on the welder, to putting on the television—is not going to win you votes. All that is going to do is annoy people, and you are annoying them intensely. You are annoying them intensely with your choice of Speaker in the lower house, you are annoying them intensely with the carbon tax, and you are annoying them intensely with the debt—and it is reflected in your polls.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:16):  I also rise to make my contribution. Before I go any further, Mr Deputy President, I have absolutely no idea what Senator Joyce spent the first three minutes babbling on about in relation to putting underpants on heads. I have to be really honest with you, Mr Deputy President: it is quite embarrassing.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  I see there is a bunch of schoolchildren up there. God bless you, but this really is appalling. This is the chamber of legislation but, sadly, over the last few years, Mr Deputy President, the way that the conversations have been conducted in this chamber is becoming very, very embarrassing. I am not the first one to have a good stoush across the chamber, and I welcome the opportunity to have a blue across the chamber. I should not use the word 'blue', sorry, because one of the MPs on the other side might run off to the papers and say that I am threatening someone. From a knockabout point of view, when I talk about a blue I mean an argument.


As to Senator Joyce's contribution on the questions that were asked of Minister Ludwig about effects on farmers and agriculture of the carbon tax, God help me. You might be able to direct me outside, Senator Joyce, as to what the heck you were talking about. Let us have a fair dinkum conversation. It would be nice to have a political conversation about the future of this great country, where the next generation of kids are going to wallow in the wealth that is being created and not about the nonsense—the one-liners, the ridiculous, childish carry-on that we have seen from leaders in the parliament. I go back to the last election, in 2010, and I think that if you were a visitor to this great country and you clicked on the radio or turned on the TV and heard or saw Mr Abbott and his cohorts from the other side running around, spending six months of an election campaign talking about what they were not going to do—they were not going to have a mining tax, they were not going to let asylum seekers, they were going to turn boats back even if it meant sinking them—it was just a disgraceful conversation.


On a brighter note, let us talk about the Nationals. If they really want to have some conversation about what is best for Australian farmers, why is that we have found ourselves in this situation in 2012 after having bipartisan agreement in 2008—well, not quite bipartisan; we had half of the opposition—where the Liberals were supporting the government's move to deregulate the export wheat market? We had the Greens, who at that time supported the deregulation of the wheat export market. We had the Nationals, and they have never hidden their hatred for Western Australian farmers being able to—




Senator Nash:
  Oh! Oh!



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  Mr Deputy President, I hear the collective sighs of, 'Oh!'—




Senator Nash:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would ask the senator to withdraw that remark. He is misleading the Senate.




Senator Sterle:
  I didn't even get it out!




Senator Nash:
  He did indeed! We have very, very close relationships with Western Australian farmers.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Nash, that is a debating point. There is no point of order. Senator Sterle, you have the call.




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. That gives me great heart, because I can now quote Senator Nash saying she has great respect for Western Australian farmers. I take it that the Nationals have now agreed to support the Labor government's motion to deregulate the wheat export market. I am sure the PGA in Western Australia, the Western Australian—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle, I draw your attention to the question before the chair.




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. As I go back, I would say quite clearly that this is a bad message being sent to Western Australian farmers. Let's get this out on the record; let's make this very clear: it is Western Australian farmers who export their wheat. I believe it is costing $6 million a year around the country to continue with the wheat export levy, knowing that about $3 million of that is paid by Western Australian farmers. I would really be lifted if I could, in this chamber, hear those on the other side actually support Western Australian rural communities, Western Australian farmers and Western Australian agricultural businesses, rather than have Mr Abbott, four years after Mr Nelson allowed the Liberals to vote with their hearts to deregulate the wheat market, being tweaked and pulled around the country by the nose by, what, six or seven Nationals, if there are that many. It has nothing to do with what is best for Western Australian farmers. It is all about saying—and they are my words, not Ms Bishop's: 'Shut your mouth. Just be quiet to the Western Australian senators over there. Be quiet to the Western Australian people. Shut up and do what the Nats tell you.' (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2012-10-09,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:21):  Mr Deputy President, following Senator Sterle, I am very pleased that you brought him back into line, because what he was talking about had very little resemblance to the response from the minister, which was about the carbon tax. The closest that Senator Sterle got to talking about the carbon tax and the relevance to the people of Australia was harking back to the last election in 2010, when he was condemning us for being opposed to new taxes. Yet his own Prime Minister, the leader of his government, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' It is known as the monumental lie of modern politics in this country.


It is extraordinary that there are defenders of this deception of the Australian people by this Prime Minister, whose credibility is absolutely at rock bottom. We know that over the course of time the government have tried to mask their deception of the Australian people and the hideous consequences which are impacting every family, such as the rising cost of living and increasing electricity prices. We have pensioners who are no longer turning on their heaters or their air conditioners because they cannot afford it. We have heard these stories, and anyone who goes out and talks to people in the community knows it. If they deliver Meals on Wheels they will see firsthand the impact that this government are having on the cost of living for people. It is a shame and it is an indictment of those on the other side that they are in denial about it. Whilst they do not want to talk about the hardship that Australian families are undergoing, they are coming up with diversion after diversion after diversion. They are trying to talk about Peter Slipper; they stand by Peter Slipper despite his misogynistic comments and his text messages that are absolutely appalling. They reel out the handbag hit squad, as it has been described in the press, to beat up on Mr Abbott—simply to mask the failures of this government. And the failures of this government are extensive.


Senator Sterle, in his contribution, went back to the last election. I think we should start there. We should talk about the people's assembly that was going to reach a consensus on climate change. There is no consensus on climate change, except from this government. And their only consensus is: they will not rein in their spending so they have got to find new taxes with which to burden the Australian people. Mark my words: there are more big taxes on the way. We have had the carbon tax, we have the mining tax, and the super tax is being mooted. The ACTU—the puppet masters of the modern Labor movement—are now saying that we need more super taxes on other profitable industries. Let me tell you, the most profitable industry in this country is being a union boss, because there is no tax payable by the unions. You can get your credit card and swipe it to your heart's content wherever you like. It is an absolute disgrace. The fact is that this government refuses to confront the demons that reside within their own DNA. It is an appalling indictment of their approach to the business of governing this country.


It has been 101 days since the carbon tax was inflicted upon the people of Australia. Right from the word go, we have said that this tax is going to impact our country for the negative. We are seeing it with job losses, we are seeing it with industries closing, we are seeing it with a mooted higher carbon tax price. If you want to identify the hypocrisy and the duplicity of this government, this week they are introducing a bill to link our carbon tax to the European carbon tax scheme. The European carbon tax scheme has not even been finalised and will not be finalised until 2013, and yet we are assured that it is going to result in a lower carbon tax price in this country. If it is going to be lower than what the Treasury has forecast, why is it that the carbon tax is expected to go up and up and up in the forward estimates? Why are the Greens saying it should be $50 by 2016? Why should it be up to $100, $200 or $300 by 2050? The lie is in the detail. The devil is always in the detail, and this is an ad hoc policy. It is a policy that was cobbled together in response to a need for money and some grand diversion. The government have cobbled it together, and they have made eight amendments to it already, which indicates that it simply could not pass muster and that it did not have the appropriate scrutiny that it needed.


The fact that there are defenders on the other side speaks volumes about how purchasable their support is for anything. They will buy and sell anything to the Australian people if they think they can get away with it and if they think it will help them cling to power. The Australian people deserve a better government. They deserve a more responsible government. They deserve a government that will act in their interests and in the national interest.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:26):  I rise in today's taking note of answers to refute the many wild claims those opposite continue to make about the government's carbon price. After listening to the last contribution, I must say: the more things change the more they seem to stay the same. Senator Bernardi continued with the massive scare campaign that the coalition have been waging across this country since the carbon price began—and indeed 18 months before that. 


What have we seen in the 101 days since the carbon tax was introduced? The sky has not fallen in, Senator Bernardi.




Senator Cormann:
  What a great benchmark for success! The sky hasn't fallen in! 




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Senator Cormann, it was the coalition's campaign—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Brown, ignore the interjections and address your remarks to the chair. 



Senator Cormann interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! Senator Brown, you have the call.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I am quite interested in Senator Cormann's interjection, because of course it was the coalition who were running around the countryside indicating that the sky was going to fall in, that there were going to be towns closing down and jobs lost—and it has not happened. The scare campaign has not worked. We are 101 days in and all we have is Senator Cormann interjecting with a lot of rot.


On 1 July the Labor government's Clean Energy Future package came into effect and I am proud of our achievements in taking action on climate change and introducing the carbon price through our Clean Energy Future package. A carbon price is the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A carbon price will also drive investment in clean technologies. Under our carbon pricing plan, Australia's biggest polluters will pay the carbon price. That is right: our plan has the big polluters paying the carbon price—not Australian households, as the coalition's plan would. 


Whilst those opposite have been conducting the mother of all fear campaigns against the carbon price, it is worth remembering that many of those opposite have indeed stated their belief in climate change and in the need for a carbon price. 


And, of course, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, stated on Lateline on 2 October 2009:


We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS …


I would like to see Mr Abbott take this very serious issue seriously, because at the moment all Mr Abbott and the coalition have been doing is conducting a fear campaign designed to be of a political advantage to them.


Then there is Mr Turnbull, who on Q&A in July 2010 said:


You will not find an economist anywhere who will tell you anything other than the most efficient and effective way to cut emissions is by putting a price on carbon.


There are many more Liberal senators in this place who believe in placing a price on carbon and believe an ETS is the most effective way to cut greenhouse gas emissions.


Whilst those opposite will continue to wage their scare campaign against the carbon price, the fact remains that Australia has joined more than three-quarters of the world's advanced economies in tackling climate change with emissions trading schemes. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has conducted an analysis showing that from 2013 there will be more than 50 national or subnational emissions trading schemes in place around the world. These schemes will cover a combined population of more than 850 million people and account for around 30 per cent of the global economy—or around 27 times the size of the Australian economy—in 2012. So we see that almost every advanced economy already has a carbon price or is putting one in place. From next year 850 million people will live in cities where polluters have to pay for their pollution.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:32):  What a sad day we have come to when the Labor government tries to suggest that plan No. 8—I think that is what we are currently on—which deals with how they are going to go about establishing a carbon price, is a structured and measured way of going about things. It is not. And of course we still have the new legislation to come that will tie us to the European economy.


It is something of a sleight of hand to talk about the fact that 30 other countries have emissions trading schemes, or, to use the figures that Senator Carol Brown just used, to suggest that a third of the world's economy is covered by emissions trading schemes of some kind. The clincher phrase there, of course, is 'of some kind'. No-one else has an economy-wide carbon taxing scheme. No-one else has looked at their strengths, which are their resources and manufacturing and export sectors, and said: 'How can we wreck those? All right, we will come up with a carbon price.'


Even the Reserve Bank has pointed out to the government that there will be more price rises coming through in the next few months. We have manufacturers telling us now that the increase in their energy costs is going to be the straw that broke the camels back. It is all very well for Glenn Stevens, the chairman of the Reserve Bank, to talk about a glass half full and suggest that we should not be worrying at all about the manufacturing sector of the economy because mining and manufacturing now have the same percentages of our GDP as they had in 1901. That is wonderful—it makes me feel so much better to know that manufacturing is in the same position in respect of mining, a highly undeveloped industry, in 1901! It is ridiculous for this government to be suggesting that there is anything like a glass half full. The glass is more than half empty for manufacturing in Australia, and for families that rely it, because of the incremental creep of this government's impost after impost in every sector, not just in terms of the price rises that have come through on power but in terms of the incremental increases in the areas of workplace health and safety, development of red tape, extra taxes and extra administrative burdens for companies to run the parental leave scheme for the government, in return for nothing. The list goes on and on.


Yet one of the most analysed statements in all of Australian history, and I am pleased to say that it has been very much analysed by the coalition, is that of the now Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard, who well over 101 days ago told us that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. Well, we have legislation for a carbon tax—or at least version No. 8 of a carbon tax—before us now. She has happily and treacherously introduced this onto the Australian economy and imposed it on manufacturing in Australia without any sense of how she might go about compensating organisations. Compensating just individuals was apparently going to be the answer. Well, the compensation is not enough and it does not apply across the industries that are hurting most from the imposition of this carbon tax.


I ask listeners and members of this House to consider: if this woman, the current Prime Minister, could say that she would not have a carbon tax under the government she led, what other taxes are we going to be looking at as we go towards the next election?


There are already very strong rumours—they would be more than rumours; they are suggestions—that the government will be looking at the superannuation bounty as a way of getting itself out of debt.

Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


The failure of the Attorney-General, the Honourable Nicola Roxon MP, to uphold the standards expected of the First Law Officer of the Commonwealth, by her undermining of public confidence in the courts and inappropriate interference in litigation.


Is the proposal supported?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-10-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:56):  I was not in question time today because I was at the High Court representing the Leader of the Opposition at the swearing in of the 49th justice of the High Court of Australia, Justice Gageler. The swearing in was attended by all of the members of the High Court, by three former chief justices and four other retired justices, and by the chief justices of almost every Australian jurisdiction.


Mr Gageler, or Justice Gageler, as he now is, had until his appointment to the High Court—an appointment, I interpolate to say, welcomed by the opposition—occupied the office of Commonwealth Solicitor-General, known colloquially as the second law officer of the Commonwealth. The welcoming speech for Mr Gageler was given by the Attorney-General, Ms Roxon, the first law officer of the Commonwealth. The majesty of that ceremony, when the second law officer of the Commonwealth was welcomed to the High Court by the first law officer of the Commonwealth, reminded me of just how important it is that those who occupy positions of custodianship of our legal system—the chief justices, the justices of our superior courts, the first law officer of the Commonwealth and the second law officer of the Commonwealth—discharge their duties so as to enhance the dignity of and protect the public respect for those institutions.


Of the various officers I have mentioned, the office of the Attorney-General is of course a little different, because under our Constitution it must be occupied by a member of parliament. It is in that limited sense a political office. But it is not an office like that of any other cabinet minister. Because, unlike any other cabinet minister, the Commonwealth Attorney-General shares with the Chief Justice and shares with the Solicitor-General—shares with those who are the pillars of our legal system—an obligation to protect the reputation of that legal system, to enhance public respect for it, and to defend it when it is attacked; to show by his or her conduct that he or she can be trusted in the discharge of that most important constitutional function.


That is a task which great Liberal attorneys-general—such as, for instance, Bob Ellicott, Tom Hughes, Sir Garfield Barwick, Daryl Williams, Philip Ruddock or Sir Nigel Bowen—have never failed to understand. But I am sorry to say that it is a task which the current occupant of that office entirely fails to grasp.


I like Nicola Roxon personally. I had a perfectly pleasant exchange with her in the High Court not an hour ago. But the fact is—I say this with regret—that, unlike her predecessor the Hon. Robert McClelland, who never embarrassed himself in the office, the behaviour of the current Attorney-General, in relation to proceedings brought by Mr James Ashby against the Commonwealth and against the Speaker of the House of Representatives, has fallen below the high standards demanded by that office.


And if you do not believe me, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, then believe the judge, Justice Rares, of the Federal Court of Australia, who has the conduct of those proceedings, who was moved to say last Thursday something that I am sure has never before been said by any judge against any Commonwealth Attorney-General. Referring to the fact that Ms Roxon had facilitated favourable treatment of Mr Slipper by protecting him from media attention upon his arrival at court last week Justice Rares said, 'This undermines public confidence in the courts.'


What a terrible, terrible indictment, for a Commonwealth Attorney-General to be reprimanded by a justice of the Federal Court that her conduct ran the risk of undermining public confidence in the courts. Throughout the history of the Ashby and Slipper litigation I am afraid to say that Ms Roxon has been guilty of a litany of improper conduct and errors of judgement which show that she just does not understand her constitutional obligation to be a custodian—a pillar, a safeguard—of the impartiality and integrity of the courts. 


First of all, when Mr Ashby commenced his proceedings, on 15 June Ms Roxon attacked him personally. She attacked his motives. She suggested that the litigation were Liberal and National Party shenanigans. Meanwhile, she stood idly by when her senior ministerial colleagues made claims as absurd as those of Senator Bob Carr, that Mr Ashby was more rehearsed than a kabuki actor, when Mr Craig Emerson attacked Mr Ashby and when Mr Anthony Albanese, never known for his common sense, said that this was the Australian Watergate. And what did the Commonwealth Attorney-General do? She fell silent while those attacks on a gay man claiming to have been sexually harassed, were allowed to be made.


She was asked about this by Barry Cassidy on Insiders on Sunday, by the way, now that the case has settled, and this was what she had to say:


… there is still a live matter before the court between Mr Slipper and Mr Ashby. So we do have to be careful in commentary that we want to provide about any detail of that case that’s still before the court.


It is all very well to have been alive to those principles on 7 October, but she was not alive to them on 15 June, when she had said the very things that, on Sunday morning, she said it was improper to say. 


Then the case against the Commonwealth was settled, and Ms Roxon issued a press release on 28 September. She said that it was settled because it would have been a lawyers' picnic and that one had to be mindful of the Commonwealth's obligations to taxpayers to achieve the most cost-effective outcomes for legal proceedings, heedless of the fact that the Commonwealth Legal Services' directions, which she administers, prescribe in unambiguous terms that merely to save costs is not, of itself, a proper reason for the Commonwealth to settle a case. So Ms Roxon either misapplied her own guidelines or she misrepresented the Commonwealth's motive in settling the case. 


She continued, by the way, to maintain that it was vexatious. And then, as I mentioned before, it was revealed, to give her credit where it is due, Ms Roxon apologised to the court—she was forced, I daresay to apologise to the court—for she facilitated preferential treatment to Mr Slipper so as to convey to public the idea that Mr Slipper was being looked after by the Commonwealth of Australia, given special, privileged access to the private entrance to the court when poor Mr Ashby, the individual litigant with the courage to take on the entire political establishment of the country, was left to fend for himself in a forest of journalists at the front door. What sort of message does that send to litigants who want to commence proceedings—particularly proceedings against powerful institutions like governments or big corporations—that if you have a big institution standing behind you on this Attorney-General's watch you will get favourable treatment? 


Finally, as is revealed by Dennis and Leo Shanahan in their stories in the Australian this morning, there remains an unresolved question about Ms Roxon's interference in the conduct of the case by the Commonwealth's counsel, Mr Julian Burnside QC. The opposition takes the unusual step of putting down an MPI notice like this for one simple reason: to make the point that whoever the occupant of the office of Commonwealth Attorney-General is must be impartial, must not undermine the courts. I am sad to say that the current occupant of that office does not conduct herself by those— (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-10-09,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:06):  It does appear as if the MPI has been put down by the opposition for one simple reason, as Senator Brandis said. It does appear that that simple reason is to give an opportunity for Senator Brandis to grandstand in the Senate for 10 minutes.


Senator Brandis has spoken in the debate. He has almost exploded with indignation, pomposity and outrage. But I think it might be helpful to have a close look at the facts and how the Attorney-General has dealt with the issues that have been raised this afternoon by Senator Brandis.


It is commonplace and entirely appropriate for the Attorney-General, as the first law officer of the Commonwealth, to be regularly briefed and consulted by Commonwealth legal teams on legal cases to which the Commonwealth is a party. There are any number of cases—as Senator Brandis would know—where this has occurred. In fact, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth chairs a significant legal issues meeting that is held quarterly which focuses on legal matters to which the Commonwealth is a party. I am sure even Senator Brandis, were he to become Attorney-General, would also engage in such processes. It makes sense, as happens in so many other matters, that in the Mr Ashby and Mr Slipper matter, for the Attorney-General to have discussions with the government's legal team. I would have thought that it would be more remarkable, frankly, if she did not.


You would appreciate, Madam Acting Deputy President, as I know Senator Brandis and members of the opposition do, that I am not a lawyer. But I am aware that the government has entered into a deed with Mr Ashby and has settled his case with the Commonwealth. There remains an outstanding legal proceeding between Mr Ashby and Mr Slipper. While mediation was held last week, that mediation was unable to settle the matter between those two parties. But as far as the matter between Mr Ashby and the Commonwealth is concerned, that matter was settled and the terms of the settlement are public. Those terms include: an express provision that the Commonwealth does not accept liability; a $50,000 payment to Mr Ashby; and an agreement to offer training and information to parliamentarians and parliamentarians' staff about sexual harassment and associated complaints. If I can find that information out, so can Senator Brandis. This settlement certainly appears to be consistent with all Commonwealth obligations, responsibilities and legal advice. And it is a fact that the settlement was made in accordance with legal advice from senior counsel. It is a fact that the settlement, as I understand it, was made on the basis of advice from the Australian Government Solicitor. Like Senator Brandis, I did read closely the Attorney-General's statement of 28 September. The Attorney-General said:


The Commonwealth has been mindful of its obligations to taxpayers to achieve the most cost-effective outcomes for legal proceedings amongst other considerations.


The Attorney-General also made it clear—and Senator Brandis quoted these words—that the case was 'a lawyer's picnic that could have extended well into the year' That does seem pretty accurate to me given again that it has been reported that the costs of the litigation to date are $730,000 with, as we are told, more bills to come. I think that in my time as a Senator I have tried to be quite meticulous and consistent about not raising matters that are before a court or are operational matters with the Australian Federal Police and it is not a practice—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Order! Senator Brandis, you were heard in silence.




Senator FAULKNER:
  that I intend to depart from in this debate. That does not mean that I do not have views on such matters, of course I do. But, as I said, in my time in the Senate I have tried to adopt a consistent approach on this and do not intend to change the habits of a lifetime today.


I do note, of course, that some have criticised the Attorney-General for public comments that she has made. We have heard that. But it seems to me that it would be more remarkable if the Attorney-General did not provide information about the approach that the Commonwealth has taken before the court. This is a matter where the Commonwealth was being sued by Mr Ashby and, in defending the complaint, the Commonwealth filed an application and made submissions that the proceedings were vexatious and an abuse of process. The Attorney-General explained the application that the Commonwealth made in the court. It is true that the matter was settled last week—both Mr Ashby's complaint against the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth's complaint against the process. But there is a remaining matter, as we all know. That is between Mr Ashby and Mr Slipper. As I have said before, it would be prudent and proper not to canvass that matter while it is before the court.


The Attorney-General has been, as you have heard in this debate, criticised in relation to access to the court by Mr Slipper's Comcar for which the Attorney-General's office made a request on one occasion. That is true. The Attorney-General's office was informed, as I understand it, by the building management that this should not have occurred, so the Attorney-General apologised to the building manager. So a mistake was made. In the scheme of things I think it was a comparatively minor mistake but, appropriately, an apology was made. Surely Senator Brandis knows that we all make mistakes. Even someone as eminent as Senator Brandis makes mistakes—one or two of them perhaps of a more serious nature than what car goes into what car park. Did, for example, Senator Brandis apologise when he made a phone call to the New South Wales Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Mr Gallacher, regarding investigations into the member for Dobell? It was reported at the time—I do not know whether it is accurate or not; it has never been corrected by Senator Brandis or anyone else—that, as a result of Senator Brandis's call, the New South Wales police minister relayed the matter onto the New South Wales Police Commissioner. I personally believe—




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: what was said at the time was by the New South Wales Police Commissioner. That statement that has just been made by Senator Faulkner was incorrect. Senator Faulkner should withdraw that false claim.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is not a point of order, Senator Brandis.




Senator FAULKNER:
  I believe that what Senator Brandis did in relation to that matter was a mistake. So did many other people. I thought personally that a shadow Attorney-General should know better. But I did not come into the Senate chamber, puff myself up with all the righteous indignation in the world and excoriate Senator Brandis—far from it. I did not open the door of my glass house and proceed to hurl stones at my opponents. I just say to Senator Brandis: you have to be careful about these things, because I think you have to be careful not to diminish yourself. I have said before that Senator Brandis likes Nicola Roxon. Well, I like Senator Brandis, and I also acknowledge and have acknowledged in the past that he is an able parliamentarian. But, just like attorneys-general, shadow attorneys-general need to adopt high standards.


As you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, there is also an ongoing court proceeding, and not only the one between Mr Ashby and Mr Slipper. The Australian Federal Police announced on 19 July—and I read from its press release—that it had received and accepted a referral to investigate allegations of fraud against Mr Slipper and that it had forwarded certain material to the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for consultation and possible further action. So there is more than one issue and more than one matter about which judgements will be made in the future, and that is as it should be.


Let me make one final point in the short amount of time I have available to me. Many years ago in this chamber I was one who used all the mechanisms that the Senate had available to me to hold a Senate Presiding Officer—the then Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Colston—to account. At no stage did I seek or receive the views of my colleagues in the House of Representatives about the Senator Colston matter. Mr Slipper is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. When I came down to the chamber to hear Senator Brandis's contribution on this debate, there was a debate taking place in the House of Representatives about whether Mr Slipper should remain as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. But Mr Slipper is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and his future is a matter for the House of Representatives. It is not a matter for the Senate.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-10-09,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (16:22):  The position of Attorney-General is as the first officer of the Commonwealth. It is effectively the highest law office in Australia. As quoted by Ross Ray QC, president of the Law Council of Australia, to the International Bar Association conference in 2008:


… the Attorney-General has traditionally been seen as having a special independent public interest responsibility within government; that is, as distinct from a responsibility to protect the Government's interests.


Tasked with these responsibilities, the person appointed by the government to this role must conduct themselves with the utmost decency and be beyond reproach.


Successive attorneys-general, regardless of their political affiliation, have recognised that although frequently involved in the rough and tumble of politics, the integrity of the role of Attorney-General should never be compromised. Why? Because they recognised that as the Attorney-General they were the chief defender of the integrity of the Australian court system.


Nicola Roxon is currently Australia's Attorney-General. Attorney-General Roxon's behaviour in relation to what has now become known as the Slipper case and, in particular, given her political interference in the case following the recent disclosure of the raft of crude and disgusting text messages sent by Mr Slipper, confirms for all Australians that Ms Roxon is fundamentally failing in the discharge of her role as the Commonwealth's No. 1 law officer.


Her behaviour also highlights the gross hypocrisy of the Labor Left when it comes to accusations of alleged misogynist behaviour. The position now conveniently taken by Attorney-General Roxon in relation to the Slipper case that she cannot comment on it because it is still before the courts—even though when it suited her political purpose she was more than happy to do that—highlights the sheer hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the double standards that it applies when measuring its own members' behaviour against alleged behaviour by members of the coalition and others.


But as Labor frontbencher, Jason Clare, has said:


Politicians are going to be judged on what they say and do …


And as Attorney-General Roxon has also confirmed, 'This judgement is merely part of politics'.


I say this to Ms Roxon, who is very good at handing out judgement when the political situation suits her: judge not lest ye be judged yourself. This is, of course, the woman who as far back as 2002 said in relation to the then Deputy Speaker, Ian Causley, after he made an allegedly offensive remark to her:


Women in many workplaces around Australia have to put up with this sort of behaviour, I'm in a position to do something about it by publicising it - I don't think it is right to just let it go all the time.


And yet when confronted in black and white, as she has been, with the crude and grotesque text messages sent by Mr Slipper to Mr Ashby commenting disparagingly on women, Attorney-General Roxon's silence is deafening.


This is despite saying at a press conference on 15 June 2012 that in relation to the Slipper case:


I think it's unrealistic given the public interest in this matter that there will not be commentary. And the art, if you like, from my perspective, is that we do that in an appropriate way.


Attorney-General Roxon set her own standard in relation to commenting on these matters:


Australians are now reading some of the most vulgar and demeaning utterances when it comes to women that I have ever seen. And again the silence from those on the Left of politics is utterly deafening, as is the silence now coming from Australia's Attorney-General. Attorney-General Roxon needs to understand that you cannot have it both ways: you are either appalled by this type of behaviour or you are not. As Attorney-General you do not get to pick the comments that you comment on when it suits you politically. As Attorney-General, Ms Roxon chose in the Ashby case to attack Mr Ashby when the matter was before the courts; and yet in relation to the revelation of the text messages sent by Mr Slipper, which are now on the public record, she now chooses in her role as Attorney-General to be silent. Australia's Attorney-General has no position.


As evidence of Attorney-General Roxon's failure to discharge properly the role of Commonwealth Attorney-General, she has now been forced to apologise to the Federal Court and to the Australian people for giving special treatment to Mr Slipper—treatment that no other Australian is afforded—by allowing him to enter the Federal Court through a back door to avoid media scrutiny. This was a move confirmed by Attorney-General Roxon's office and criticised by the Federal Court judge, Steven Rares, as undermining public confidence in the Australian court system. Justice Rares, according to a newspaper report, said that it was important that:


… justice should not only be done, but be seen to be done.


Attorney-General Roxon's decision to give preferential treatment to Mr Slipper shows a complete contempt for her role as the Commonwealth Attorney-General, and a failure to appreciate that the role has a special independent public interest responsibility within government—that is, as distinct from a responsibility to protect the government's interests.


What was Attorney-General Roxon's response to the criticism of Federal Court Judge Rares? The response was this: 'My decision was inadvertent'. How does the Commonwealth Attorney-General make a decision that is 'inadvertent'? The fact is that the Attorney-General does not. In this case the Attorney-General made a very deliberate decision, and it was made for nothing more and nothing less than political purposes. Clearly, Ms Roxon, despite her role as Attorney-General, is more interested in protecting the government's interests in this case than in discharging her independent public interest responsibility.


Perhaps, however, the most offensive part of what has occurred in relation to Ms Roxon's role in the Slipper case is what is set out in the Australian newspaper today:  that Attorney-General Nicola Roxon herself personally intervened in the sexual harassment case against Peter Slipper by briefing lawyers defending the Speaker whose misogynist and degrading attitudes to women have been exposed in the trove of sexually explicit texts. Based on these actions, whether Attorney-General Roxon understands the responsibilities of her role and is fit to hold the role of the first law officer of the Commonwealth must surely now come into question.


Ms Roxon has recently said in relation to opposition leader Mr Abbott:



It is fair game for me or any other minister … to hold him to account for his public behaviour and his public comments.


But despite these words, as a leading woman on the Labor Left side of politics, Ms Roxon fails to hold Mr Slipper to account. Again, we all know why: because of the double standards that those on the Left side of politics apply when it comes to judging their own. Mr Slipper, as we know, is a creature of the Labor Party. The Labor Party owns Mr Slipper. Attorney-General Roxon and the Prime Minister—who, I note in the motion before the other place, has again failed to condemn the actions of Mr Slipper—should now come out and admit that Mr Slipper's views on women make his position as Speaker untenable.


This is something that the coalition has done. We have unequivocally condemned Mr Slipper's views on women and it is time for both Attorney-General Roxon and Prime Minister Gillard, and all other Labor women, to condemn them as well. The Australian public has the right to ask from Labor consistency on issues of principle. You cannot be ambidextrous. You cannot on one hand allege misogynist behaviour based on the flimsiest and most cooked-up premise, whilst at the same time refuse to condemn the vile and wholly repulsive texts that have been sent by the Speaker. Labor is merely political point-scoring and Attorney-General Roxon is using her role as the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia to score political points when it suits her. She is an embarrassment to the role of Attorney-General.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2012-10-09,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (16:32):  I rise this afternoon to provide some input into this matter of public importance as well, and in my brief contribution just make two points here. Firstly, I think that the coalition wants to conveniently forget the facts surrounding Minister Roxon's involvement in the statements last week and the settlement with Mr Ashby. Senator Faulkner outlined a number of those but I think what we need to also add is that the Commonwealth in this matter was being sued and was in fact defending that complaint. It filed an application and had made submissions that the proceedings were vexatious and that there was an abuse of process. So the Commonwealth was actually involved in this matter.


It is not unusual that from time to time the Attorney-General would be seeking briefings about the Commonwealth's involvement in legal matters and cases. We have got the internationally famous tobacco litigation case and we have of course the chaplains case. There is also international whaling and the Malaysia agreement—the list goes on—where the Commonwealth is party to the action, and the Commonwealth and the minister involved, that is the Attorney-General, would receive briefings about that. That is her involvement. The Commonwealth was party to this matter before the court because they were being sued. The counterclaim was that we believed that it was an abuse of process.


There is one thing here that we sought to then do: to negotiate a settlement and resolve the area in which the Commonwealth was involved, and that is what was done. Already, as we know—and it is public knowledge—$750,000 in taxpayers' costs have been racked up in the pursuit of this matter and so at the end of the day and in the interests of a settlement, and the interests of the taxpayers' dollar, a settlement with Mr Ashby was made. That settlement, as agreed between the parties, was public. That settlement and the outcomes of the settlement have been made public and have been out there for the last week. 


There is still another aspect of the matter that is ensuing between Mr Slipper and Mr Ashby and, as Senator Carr said today in question time, it is not a matter for debate in this chamber. It has never been a matter of debate before the parties because it is a matter before the court and therefore no further comment should be made about it. 




Senator Brandis:
  It's only a matter of debate on Lateline!




Senator CROSSIN:
  If we want to go to the integrity of the position of the Attorney-General and if we want to go to the role that the Attorney-General plays when it comes to matters that may or may not potentially go before the courts, then what I need to say to the coalition is: you currently have a shadow minister in the role of the Attorney-General who also needs to look at his behaviour in the last 12 months. As Senator Faulkner said, if you want to sit inside your glasshouse and throw a stone, then you want to make sure it does not come back to hit you in the head. 


This is a shadow Attorney-General who on 25 August last year according to the Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian, picked up the phone to his mate in New South Wales and said that he was going to write a letter because he had some information that ought to be used in the case with the member for Dobell. So last year we had Senator Brandis seeking to influence independent investigations by the New South Wales Police, by the New South Wales DPP.




Senator Brandis:
  There are no proceedings underway!




Senator CROSSIN:
  He picked up the phone to his mate, the New South Wales Attorney-General, and said, 'I am going to write the New South Wales Police minister a letter. And not only that, I have actually got documents that you might be interested in. Not only am I not going to get involved in this, I am actually going to furnish evidence and you might want to have a look at it.' 


And so on one hand you cannot stand here and condemn Nicola Roxon for being involved in settling a case, which is the right and proper role to undertake when the Commonwealth is before the courts, while you, as a shadow Attorney-General with the potential to be an Attorney-General, hand over documents, encouraging your mates—




Senator Brandis:
  No, handing documents to the police.




Senator CROSSIN:
  your Liberal mates in New South Wales, to get involved in a case that was due to go before the courts. That is the peak of hypocrisy, Senator Brandis.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2012-10-09,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:37):  There has been considerable misunderstanding, even ignorance, of proper process exhibited by those who have contributed to this debate from that side of the chamber and I want to touch a number of those matters. First of all, it is important to remember that the Attorney-General, not just of the Commonwealth but of any jurisdiction, holds a particular place within the legal system. The Attorney-General holds a place which is not akin to any other role played by any other minister in a government. The Attorney-General is described as the first law officer of a jurisdiction and has special responsibilities, usually as an officer of the chief court of a jurisdiction, towards the good functioning of the court system of that particular jurisdiction.


No doubt Ms Roxon is a registered or enrolled legal practitioner of the High Court of Australia, as indeed many other legal practitioners in this chamber would be, notwithstanding that they are now politicians, and as such they have obligations towards the good functioning of the legal system. Particularly as Attorney-General, Ms Roxon has responsibilities towards the functioning of that system, but in what she had to say on litigation involving the Commonwealth she went far beyond and outside the role that she has as a protector of that system. The comments she has made about the litigation initiated by Mr Ashby were quite inappropriate, given the circumstances of that litigation and her obligation towards the court system. She described his case as 'vexatious' and an 'abuse of process' which had an 'ulterior motive'. She said:


The Commonwealth strongly believes that this process has been one which is really for an ulterior purpose, not for the purposes of an ordinary workplace complaint.


And, as Senator Brandis has pointed out, when other members of the government made even more injudicious remarks about this litigation—such as the remarks of Senator Carr that have been referred to—as chief officer responsible for defending the court within the parliament Ms Roxon fell silent and refused to defend the proper processes and to ask her colleagues to refrain from commenting on these matters.


Putting to one side for the moment the fact that these are matters involving allegations of sexual harassment—and we have had a lot of lecturing from those opposite about the importance of respecting people's right to pursue matters of sexual harassment in appropriate circumstances—I want to contrast those comments by the Attorney-General with the obligations of the government and particularly the Attorney-General under the government's own guidelines for litigation. These are the Legal Services Directions, which govern the way in which the Commonwealth acts as a party to litigation. Those obligations are quite clear. They indicate, for example, that in the case of major claims—that is, claims above $25,000—in which the Commonwealth is involved, they are to be settled only if:


… written advice is received from the Australian Government Solicitor or other legal adviser external to the agency that the settlement is in accordance with legal principle and practice.


What is legal principle and practice? It is set out in the same Legal Services Directions, in appendix C, item 2, where it says:


Monetary claims covered by this policy are to be settled in accordance with legal principle and practice, whatever the amount of the claim or proposed settlement. A settlement on the basis of legal principle and practice requires the existence of at least a meaningful prospect of liability being established.


And it goes on to say:


In particular, settlement is not to be effected merely because of the cost of defending what is clearly a spurious claim.


How is that obligation on Ms Roxon, as the Attorney-General, not to settle matters which are spurious in nature consistent with her claims made earlier in the litigation that the claim brought by Mr Ashby was 'vexatious', an 'abuse of process', had an 'ulterior motive' and was executed with the 'clear intent of publicising it before it was filed'? You cannot have it both ways: a matter which is so flawed and so unworthy of consideration and then the government proceeds to put $50,000 of taxpayers' money into ending the litigation against the Commonwealth. Under the Legal Services Directions that govern the actions of the Commonwealth as a litigant, it was not open to Ms Roxon to settle this matter if it was indeed without merit. It clearly must have had merit for the claim to be settled in that way. There is no other interpretation of what has been done consistent with the  Legal Services Directions.


If the government maintain otherwise, let them table the advice of respect to this matter. Why don't we see the advice? The matter has been settled; we do not need to worry about interfering with litigation. Let us see what the advice actually has to say. We have meetings of the estimates committees next week where I am sure that opportunity could be furnished by the government if they wished to do so.


The fact is this has been politicised from day one. This has been handled in a way most designed to defend this government's shaky hold on power by defending its special relationship with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Slipper, even to the point of allowing the judgement of individual members of the government to be clouded to the extent that a judge of the Federal Court had to say the other day that the behaviour of the Attorney-General, the first law officer of the Commonwealth, 'undermines public confidence in the courts'. I repeat: 'undermines public confidence in the courts'.


This has been yet another indication of how this Attorney-General has failed to understand her obligations towards the administration of justice in this country. She was quite prepared to make public prejudicial comment repeatedly when this litigation was at an early stage. But now when she has been humiliatingly forced to acknowledge that a settlement of $50,000 has been made towards Mr Ashby on that part of the litigation that she was directly involved with, she says that she does not wish to make further comment because the matter is before the courts. It was before the courts before when she said it was vexatious and an abuse of process and had an ulterior motive. It was before the courts then but there was nothing that the Attorney-General saw fit to do to prevent that kind of prejudicial comment going forward.


The comment of Senator Carr that 'this Ashby seems more rehearsed than a kabuki actor' is highly prejudicial, is highly inappropriate. Senator Carr went on to say: 'In Australia and around the world there are a lot more serious cases of infringement of human rights than this.'




Senator Brandis:
  What a thing to say about sexual harassment.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Indeed. How often has this government come into this place and the other place and lectured us about the importance of protecting people in workplaces from exposure to sexual harassment? How often has that been a theme hit by this government? Apparently a person's right to be free of sexual harassment in a workplace does not extend to people who try to enforce that right who might at the same time be undermining the Labor government's hold on power. That is what it amounts to: the right is compromised if you happen to be an enemy of the state or an enemy of the Labor government. That is extremely unfortunate.


When the Attorney-General entered the parliament in 1998, in her maiden speech she said:


We must not weaken the system.


By that she meant the legal system.


We must not weaken the system to the extent that we leave the powerful to run roughshod over others or, worse, resort to violence and intimidation to get their way. I am committed in the next 26 years to further strengthening our country's institutions.


This week and last week she has not strengthened them, she has weakened them. That is the sort of thing than anyone would be held to account for but particularly the Attorney-General of Australia.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2012-10-09,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (16:47):  I rise to make a contribution to this MPI debate. Senator Brandis has stood here today claiming that the Attorney-General has undermined public confidence in the courts and has inappropriately interfered in litigation. This is a constant complaint from Senator Brandis. He has even complained that the Attorney-General successfully defended plain-packaging legislation when various tobacco companies took the Commonwealth to the High Court. How outrageous that the Attorney-General would defend the Commonwealth against big tobacco giants and their litigation strategy! 


Senator Brandis continues to berate the Attorney-General for successfully defending this country's laws. These incredible claims come from the shadow Attorney-General, who has proven again and again that he cannot stop himself from inappropriately interfering in legislative matters in states other than those he has been elected to represent. What he does not mention in his MPI is that he tried to intervene in independent police matters earlier this year when he called the New South Wales Liberal police minister to try and force a police investigation. Senator Brandis sought to influence independent investigations by the New South Wales Police and the New South Wales DPP.




Senator Scullion:
  That is completely fallacious.




Senator FEENEY:
  I take that interjection because the facts are well known. He made phone calls to the New South Wales Attorney-General and the New South Wales police minister regarding investigations. The then New South Wales police minister went on to relay that call to the New South Wales Police Commissioner. He did not allow independent police investigations to proceed and in fact sought to influence those investigations because they involved a political opponent.


This year he sought again to interfere in the police investigation process, on this occasion referring matters relating to Australia Day to the Federal Police. He provided this letter to the media and alleged a cover-up. The Federal Police later concluded: 'The available evidence does not support the existence of any criminal offences.'




Senator Humphries:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The matter of public importance before the Senate is about the conduct of the Attorney-General, Ms Roxon. Much as Senator Feeney might want to turn this around to make it a commentary on Senator Brandis, it is not the subject matter of the matter of public importance and he should confine his remarks to Ms Roxon's behaviour.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  Continue, Senator Feeney, and please ensure that your comments refer to the question.




Senator FEENEY:
  If I may address you on the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President, I make the point that in these debates it is customary that the Senate allows a reasonable amount of latitude so that it can engender the political discourse that these debates are designed to engender. Above and beyond that, I have been speaking now for some 2½ minutes and in those 2½ minutes I have been directly relevant to the question, which is the debate around the conduct of the Attorney-General and the person who calls that conduct into account.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There was no point of order and I look forward to you continuing to make reference to the question before us.




Senator FEENEY:
  Thank you. The Federal Police later concluded that the available evidence did not support the evidence of any criminal offences. And all of this from someone who aspires to be Attorney-General. Can you imagine an Attorney-General as reckless as this senator? Think of when he compared the Greens and the Nazi party. On 29 October 2003 he said:


I intend to continue to call to the attention of the Australian people the extremely alarming, frightening similarities between the methods employed by contemporary green politics and the methods and the values of the Nazis.


And he made outrageous comments regarding the Prime Minister on 27 January 2010 when he said:


I think Julia Gillard who … has chosen not to be a parent … shows that she just doesn't understand the way parents think about their children when they reach a particular age.


The actions of this would-be Attorney-General I am afraid speak far louder than words.


Today we see that the shadow Attorney-General does not believe that the Attorney-General should be involved—




Senator Scullion:
  What about the Attorney-General?




Senator FEENEY:
  Your interjection was magnificently timed, Senator. Thank you.



Senator Scullion interjecting—




Senator FEENEY:
  Madam Acting Deputy President McKenzie, I urge you to deal with this disorderly conduct. Today we see that the shadow Attorney-General does not believe that the Attorney-General should be involved in being briefed on legal proceedings. That is right. We have heard from Senator Brandis that the Attorney-General should not speak to government engaged solicitors. What errant nonsense! It is therefore clear that he would not want to undertake a large part of the Attorney-General's workload should he ever be successfully appointed to that position. As the first law officer, it is perfectly normal for the Attorney-General to be regularly briefed and consulted by government legal teams on significant cases to which the Commonwealth is a party. Of course, when one sets it out in that way it seems blindingly obvious; but, alas, not to those opposite. Briefings have occurred in the past on everything from whaling to the chaplains case through to immigration matters, the Federal Magistrates case and, of course, in more recent times, the tobacco litigation. 


The Attorney-General also personally chairs a quarterly significant legal issues meeting, which discusses the legal matters to which the Commonwealth is a party. All of this is natural and all of this is, of course, longstanding custom and practice. Is Senator Brandis really saying today that, if he were Attorney-General, he would not regularly receive briefings and want to be consulted on significant legal matters to which the Commonwealth is a party? Is he saying that he would not perform one of the key roles of the job to which he aspires? 


In considering the remarks that have been made earlier in this debate concerning the Slipper-Ashby settlement, I will be short. I will be short in relation to the issue of the legal case of Mr Slipper and Mr Ashby for obvious reasons. This government has been mindful of its obligations to the court to use judicial resources appropriately and its obligations to taxpayers to minimise costs by trying to achieve settlement. Settlements are not about who is right and who is wrong; they are about bringing matters to a speedy conclusion, which is what the Commonwealth has now achieved. This is something that I believe is well understood by the shadow Attorney-General. But, of course, nonetheless he does not resist the temptation to try and score a political point. 


The matter between Mr Ashby and Mr Slipper continues before the Federal Court. The judge has reserved his decision in the matter of Mr Slipper's application alleging that the matter is an abuse of process. In considering the text messages that have received so much coverage today and in recent days, let it simply be said that I and, I believe, all of us would condemn these comments. We condemn sexism wherever it resides. But, again, I should note that these matters are currently before the courts. I do not believe it is appropriate—and those opposite should support me in this—for a political debate to be conducted while this matter is currently before the Federal Court of Australia. This Commonwealth takes sexual harassment very seriously. While our settlement does not admit liability, the government has agreed to establish specific training for members and senators in relation to issues of sexual harassment as well as to staff on how to deal with any such issues. 


Senator Brandis has said that it is inappropriate for the Attorney-General to provide an explanation about the approach the Commonwealth has taken before the court. It is actually completely appropriate for the Attorney-General to provide a description of the approach the Commonwealth has taken before the court—for example, which applications are being made and heard. Remember, it was the Commonwealth that was being sued and, in defending that complaint, filed an objection and made submissions that the proceedings were vexatious and an abuse of process. Those documents and the arguments are public documents on the court file. This is a particularly important point—public documents on the court file. 


As of last Thursday, the Commonwealth had settled its dispute with Mr Ashby, both his complaint against the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth's complaint about the process. It is therefore not the intention of the government to make further comments about the proceedings between the remaining two parties. What is fascinating about the MPI today is that the Attorney-General, who has been attacked for her involvement as part of the so-called handbag hit squad and attacked for not talking about policy, is in fact getting on with her job in an appropriate and conscientious way. Meanwhile, Senator Brandis wants to attack her for doing what her job requires. The coalition's position flip-flops between the Attorney-General talking about personality, not action. 


Today in the Punch the Attorney-General talked about what the government has and will deliver for women and has contrasted that with what the Liberals failed to do in their 11 years in office. In doing this, the Attorney-General has been assuring that the debate goes past personality and rather looks at the policies and actions of politicians. Senator Brandis has clearly failed the action test when it comes to being an appropriate Attorney-General, and the only way he can deal with his failure is to try and finger-point. Let us not forget that it is a constant complaint from Senator Brandis that the Attorney-General is doing her job. Think again to when he complained about the Attorney's role in successfully defending plain-packaging legislation. He aspires to one day take up the position of Attorney-General, but I ask: what will he do if he does? We know he will not defend the Commonwealth against multinational companies trying to dictate our laws. We know he will not take briefings about legal matters the Commonwealth is engaged in. But what he will do, as he has demonstrated, is intervene in independent police matters and try and force police investigations when they might pertain to those he judges to be his political opponents. The call for politicians to be judged not on personality but rather on actions is one that should be ringing in the ears of the shadow Attorney-General today.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
) (16:52):  In accordance with the usual practice and with the concurrence of the Senate I ask that the government response be incorporated in the Hansard.




The document read as follows—





Australian Government Response to the Report: 





Held Hostage: Government’s response to the kidnapping of Australian citizens overseas





Australian Government Response to the Report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee



This is the Australian Government’s response to the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee entitled:  Held Hostage.  Government’s response to the kidnapping of Australian citizens overseas, as tabled on 25 November 2011.


The government welcomes the committee’s acknowledgement of the extremely difficult work undertaken by government officials in response to kidnapping events.  Recognition that the situation where an Australian may be held captive limits the government’s ability to work towards the victim’s release, and that a hostage situation involving an Australian citizen overseas presents many challenges for the government, is also welcomed.


The committee’s agreement with the Australian Government’s no ransom policy, and that any involvement of the Australian Government in the payment of a ransom would increase the risk of kidnapping for Australians abroad, is welcomed.


The attached response to the committee’s recommendation reflects the government’s commitment to reduce the risk of Australian citizens abroad becoming the victims of kidnapping, and when it does occur, to provide effective support and assistance to the victim and their family.




Recommendation 1 paragraph 5.38 



The committee recommends that:


DFAT ensures that the next of kin of any future kidnap victim are made aware of the option of engaging a private kidnap and ransom consultant; and 


if the next of kin decide to proceed with a private consultant, DFAT ensures that any advice or information it then provides to the family is given in a non-judgemental way; that it is willing to cooperate and to share relevant information with the consultant as appropriate (given national security concerns); and that it alerts the family to possible legal complications to paying a ransom. 




Responsible Agency: DFAT





Response:
 Agreed



DFAT has committed to providing clear advice to families that they can to consult private companies on their options regarding paying a ransom, given the Government cannot.  In providing this advice, DFAT shall also provide families with a list of companies that they could consider engaging on a non-endorsement basis.  It is for the family to decide whether to enter into arrangements and/or contracts with the company directly.


If a family chooses to engage a kidnap and ransom specialist, DFAT will continue to provide the family and their representatives with as much information as possible bearing in mind national security and privacy concerns.




Recommendation 2 paragraph 6.42 



The committee supports the establishment of the regular, whole of government coordinating group and recommends that DFAT give close consideration as to how it can maintain the high level of skills that members of an interdepartmental emergency task force require to respond effectively to a kidnapping incident overseas.




Responsible Agency: DFAT





Response:
 Agreed



On 28 June 2011, DFAT led an interdepartmental roundtable to discuss the outcomes of the McCarthy Review.  At this meeting, relevant agencies agreed to establish a regular, whole of government coordinating group.  This group would meet regularly to stay abreast of kidnapping issues and best practice.




Recommendation 3 paragraph 6.43 



In particular, the committee recommends that the coordinating group: 


commits to regular meetings and keeping up-to-date with global developments in kidnapping and hostage taking;


assumes responsibility for ensuring that there is a pool of specially trained personnel across all relevant agencies ready to respond to an incident such as a kidnapping abroad;


oversees the training regime of this pool of specialists that places a high priority on continuous improvement in interagency coordination and cooperation through joint training programs and workshops; 


in consultation with other countries and organisations involved in resolving hostage situations, explores and develops strategies for dealing with protracted hostage episodes; and 


gives special attention to developing a pool of personnel ready to take on the functions of family liaison and ensures that this sub group is seen as an integral part of any interdepartmental emergency task force. (See following recommendation.) 




Responsible Agency: DFAT





Response:
 Agreed



The group will consider all of the above mentioned issues.




Recommendation 4 paragraph 7.52 



The committee recommends that any inter-departmental emergency response task force include a sub group dedicated to supporting families of a victim of kidnapping. This group should be made up of personnel specially trained for this liaison role and able to provide the family with ongoing and accurate information. Agencies should strive to maintain the continuity of the personnel assigned to act in this role.




Responsible Agency: 
DFAT





Response: 
Agreed



Consular staff form part of any emergency response task force and support the families of kidnap victims.  Consular staff are trained to assist families in difficult situations and will provide a high level of consular support consistent with DFAT’s consular charter.  Consistent with reviews of the Government’s kidnapping policy, a dedicated unit of consular and other specialists has been established to support families related to the most recent kidnapping.  This will be standard practice for all future cases.  DFAT will strive to maintain continuity of consular staff in this role, dependant on operational requirements.




Recommendation 5 paragraph 8.39 



The committee recommends that the family liaison sub group within the emergency response task force assumes responsibility for ensuring that a victim of kidnapping has access to appropriate counselling services once released and is active in helping to facilitate a smooth transition from medical and counselling services provided overseas to the appropriate domestic providers once the victim returns home. This recommendation also applies to people who are released before an emergency task force is mobilised or can take any substantial action such as in the Martinkus case.




Responsible Agency: 
DFAT





Response: 
Agreed



While a victim is overseas, DFAT will facilitate access to counselling services for family.  Upon return to Australia, DFAT can provide recommendations to kidnap victims to access counselling services but currently cannot formally facilitate access to these services as they are governed by State and Territory service providers.  DFAT will work to establish a mechanism whereby DFAT can alert appropriate service providers to the case and arrange for clear information on the services to be made available to the victim at an early date.




Recommendation 6 paragraph 9.29 



The committee recommends that DFAT examine ways to improve its relationship with the media when dealing with a kidnapping situation and how it explains its media strategy to media organisations and family members at the outset of a crisis. 




Responsible Agency: 
DFAT





Response: 
Agreed



DFAT strives to maintain an open and strong relationship with the news media, and to provide accurate and timely responses to media inquiries.  In kidnapping cases, DFAT’s firm view is that it is not helpful to provide a detailed commentary on developments in the public domain, as this is often monitored by the kidnappers and can increase their expectations, and the perceived value in cases of kidnap-for-ransom, potentially placing the victim in greater danger.  This strategy was endorsed in both the McCarthy Review and the DFAT internal review on the Nigel Brennan kidnapping.


In communicating this strategy, DFAT will engage as closely as possible with major media outlets, explaining the situation and requesting their cooperation.  DFAT will also provide on-the-record comments, where possible, in response to individual media inquiries, but these comments are unlikely to touch on operational details.  DFAT has done this – providing on the record comments and background briefing media outlets by a senior official on the overall strategy -- for the current kidnapping case.


DFAT will also explain the media strategy to the family and be open in discussing the advantages and disadvantages of engaging the media.  DFAT will involve the family in the decision making on this issue.  Ultimately, it is up to the family whether they would like to speak to the media.  If so, DFAT will offer to facilitate this contact, where appropriate.  Again, DFAT has implemented this in the current kidnapping case.


DFAT notes that if a private contractor is engaged, the family and contractor would need to assume primary responsibility for media management.




Recommendation 7 paragraphs 10.52–10.53 



In light of the difficulties experienced by both the Wood and Brennan families, the committee recommends that the government investigate thoroughly the options for making special allowance for people seeking to transmit money overseas in order to save the life of another Australian citizen being held hostage.


The committee recommends particularly that the government consider changes to the relevant sections of the Criminal Code and the United Nations Charter Act that would allow the minister at his or her discretion to grant exemptions in exceptional circumstances.




Responsible Agency: DFAT / Attorney-General’s Department





Response:
 Rejected



The Government has considered possible legislative amendments as described in Recommendation 7.  The Government does not support such legislative changes. Changing the relevant legislation would undermine Australia’s no ransom policy, and indirectly result in Australians overseas being targeted.  Providing a legislative exemption could result in opportunities for manipulation of Australia’s laws by terrorist organisations.  Australian laws imposing targeted financial sanctions against terrorist-related entities to give effect to obligations under United Nations Security Council (UNSC) decisions already provide for strictly limited exemptions in accordance with the relevant UNSC decisions themselves.  The UNSC decisions do not provide an exception for the payment of ransoms, and in respect of certain designated groups and individuals, expressly prohibits the payment of ransoms.  Therefore, legislative amendments of this type are likely to raise issues of consistency with Australia’s international legal obligations.




Recommendation 8 paragraph 11.18 



The committee believes that, after every major incident overseas, an internal review should be undertaken (the committee notes that DFAT indicated that it does so as a matter of course). This internal review should provide all agencies that formed part of the response team with necessary feedback on their performance and also on the performance of the team as a whole. The committee noted, however, that often the victim and his or her family would like to be part of a debriefing. In light of this finding, the committee recommends that: 


the government ensure that DFAT as the lead agency invites the victim and his/her family and friends to a debriefing from the whole-of-government emergency response task force including the sub unit responsible for providing support to the family. Further that: 


if accepted, this offer of a debriefing is to be a two way exchange of information providing the family with the opportunity to have their questions answered; and 


DFAT to offer to cover the costs for the victim, family and friends to attend the debriefing. 




Responsible Agency: 
DFAT





Response: 
Partially agreed



DFAT, as a matter of course, conducts an internal review in the event of every major consular case.  We will continue to do so.  Where warranted, DFAT may also request an independent review of its handling of the case, as occurred with the McCarthy Review following the Nigel Brennan kidnapping.


DFAT also conducts a debrief session with the victim and their immediate family and will arrange a suitable time for all parties and cover the costs of attending the debrief for those immediately involved.  We will continue with this practice.

If so, DFAT will offer to facilitate this contact, where appropriate.  Again, DFAT has implemented this in the current kidnapping case.


DFAT notes that if a private contractor is engaged, the family and contractor would need to assume primary responsibility for media management.




Recommendation 7 paragraphs 10.52–10.53 



In light of the difficulties experienced by both the Wood and Brennan families, the committee recommends that the government investigate thoroughly the options for making special allowance for people seeking to transmit money overseas in order to save the life of another Australian citizen being held hostage.


The committee recommends particularly that the government consider changes to the relevant sections of the Criminal Code and the United Nations Charter Act that would allow the minister at his or her discretion to grant exemptions in exceptional circumstances.




Responsible Agency: DFAT / Attorney-General’s Department





Response:
 Rejected



The Government has considered possible legislative amendments as described in Recommendation 7.  The Government does not support such legislative changes. Changing the relevant legislation would undermine Australia’s no ransom policy, and indirectly result in Australians overseas being targeted.  Providing a legislative exemption could result in opportunities for manipulation of Australia’s laws by terrorist organisations.  Australian laws imposing targeted financial sanctions against terrorist-related entities to give effect to obligations under United Nations Security Council (UNSC) decisions already provide for strictly limited exemptions in accordance with the relevant UNSC decisions themselves.  The UNSC decisions do not provide an exception for the payment of ransoms, and in respect of certain designated groups and individuals, expressly prohibits the payment of ransoms.  Therefore, legislative amendments of this type are likely to raise issues of consistency with Australia’s international legal obligations.




Recommendation 8 paragraph 11.18 



The committee believes that, after every major incident overseas, an internal review should be undertaken (the committee notes that DFAT indicated that it does so as a matter of course). This internal review should provide all agencies that formed part of the response team with necessary feedback on their performance and also on the performance of the team as a whole. The committee noted, however, that often the victim and his or her family would like to be part of a debriefing. In light of this finding, the committee recommends that: 


the government ensure that DFAT as the lead agency invites the victim and his/her family and friends to a debriefing from the whole-of-government emergency response task force including the sub unit responsible for providing support to the family. Further that: 


if accepted, this offer of a debriefing is to be a two way exchange of information providing the family with the opportunity to have their questions answered; and 


DFAT to offer to cover the costs for the victim, family and friends to attend the debriefing. 




Responsible Agency: 
DFAT





Response: 
Partially agreed



DFAT, as a matter of course, conducts an internal review in the event of every major consular case.  We will continue to do so.  Where warranted, DFAT may also request an independent review of its handling of the case, as occurred with the McCarthy Review following the Nigel Brennan kidnapping.


DFAT also conducts a debrief session with the victim and their immediate family and will arrange a suitable time for all parties and cover the costs of attending the debrief for those immediately involved.  We will continue with this practice.

",Senate,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Dementia Awareness Week</title>,DOCUMENTS,16,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-10-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:00):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I sought leave to discuss this document because I was very pleased that the Senate supported the passing of this motion, which was moved by Senator Polley and Senator Brown, on this particular issue. I thought it was important to note a couple of things, including that the report released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on 27 September contains some of the latest research on dementia. It also notes the increasing importance and need for urgency to deal with this particular issue. The report, Dementia in Australia, launched by the AIHW, shows that in the less than 10 years, by 2020, the number of people who will suffer from dementia is going to increase by at least one-third. That is a significant number. We are going to have numbers around 400,000 by 2020, and that will increase to around 900,000 by 2050.


Although the motion was relying on the current information of the time—that is, it is expected that almost 280,000 people are with dementia—the AIHW report indicates that an estimated 298,000 people were living with dementia in 2011. That is a significant number of people and, as I have articulated, the report says the number of people is going to increase significantly in the next 10 years. This highlights the need for research, which is one of the points that Ms Buttrose, the President of Alzheimer's Australia, makes in the report. That is one of the issues that Ms Buttrose points to in her letter back to the Senate about this particular motion. She said:


The missing element for the future is an investment in research that will give Australians confidence of being able to identify those at risk of dementia and to develop new treatments to modify the progression of the disease.


Alzheimer's Australia is advocating for an increase in investment in dementia research in the 2013 budget of $200 million over five years to build capacity in dementia research, fund new research projects, invest in dementia research infrastructure and promote knowledge translation. That is one of the key points that also came up the week before last when that report was released—that is, the urgent need for increased research given the increasing number of people who are going to be affected by dementia by the year 2020.


Alzheimer's Australia is continuing to do a lot of work on this issue of raising awareness. Alzheimer's Australia WA is also doing a lot of work, and on that point I would like to note that they are doing a memory walk on 21 October. They are hoping it will give the community an opportunity to get together and take a stand against dementia; to remember loved ones who have been lost to dementia as well as those who continue to suffer; and in particular to honour, help and acknowledge carers, both paid and unpaid, who are providing essential support to those living with dementia in our community. Without those carers, paid and particularly unpaid, we would not be able to deal with the growing burden of dementia in Australia.


Alzheimer's Australia WA is hoping to get at least 1,600 people at that walk, because that is the number of people diagnosed with dementia each week. Of course that number is going to grow weekly as the number of people who have dementia grow. So I certainly urge people in Western Australia to take part in that memory walk, and when they are walking—and not just those who are there, but also those who cannot make it—I urge them to think about this particular issue. Although Alzheimer's Awareness Week was in September, it has to be Alzheimer's awareness week every week. We need to be increasing awareness of Alzheimer's every week. So I urge people to keep thinking about it, to work out how they can help address the issues around Alzheimer's and, if you are in Western Australia, I urge people to get along to the walk so that they can participate in increasing awareness in their communities, with their own loved ones, family and friends because everyone needs to become aware of this particular issue.

Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network





Third Report - Australian Government Response to the Committee’s Third Report of 25 June 2012 - October 2012





Introduction



In March 2011 the Parliament established the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (the Committee) to enable the ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of all aspects relating to the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN). The Committee is required to report to the Parliament on the rollout of the NBN on a six monthly basis until the completion of the project.


The Committee has been asked to provide progress reports on:


the rollout of the NBN;


the achievement of take-up targets as set out in NBN Co Limited’s (NBN Co) Corporate Plan;


network rollout performance including service levels and faults;


the effectiveness of NBN Co in meeting its obligations as set out in its Stakeholder Charter;


NBN Co’s strategy for engaging with consumers and handling complaints;


NBN Co’s risk management processes; and


any other matter pertaining to the NBN rollout that the Committee considers relevant.


The Committee tabled its first report on the Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network on 31 August 2011 and its second report on 24 November 2011. The government’s responses to the Committee’s first and second reports were tabled in the Parliament on 1 March 2012 and 16 April 2012 respectively.


On 25 June 2012, the Committee tabled its third report, entitled Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network: Third Report. The Committee’s third report was informed by two public hearings, one site inspection and public consultation which attracted


22 submissions and two exhibits. The report made fifteen recommendations ranging across: clearance processes for responding to questions on notice; the provision of information on the NBN including key performance data on targets and actual results; communications around voice services to communities in fixed wireless and satellite areas; publishing details of NBN Co’s procurement processes; NBN Co’s policy position for the provision of costing extensions to its NBN fibre footprint, especially for regional and remote Australia; private equity funding and Telstra workforce issues.




Background



The NBN is a telecommunications network that will provide access to high-speed broadband to 100 per cent of Australian premises using a combination of fibre to the premises, fixed-wireless and satellite technologies. NBN Co’s objective is to provide 93 per cent of premises with access to a high-speed fibre network capable of providing broadband speeds of up to one gigabit per second (Gbps). Seven per cent of premises will be served by a combination of next-generation fixed-wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of 12 megabits per second (Mbps).1


The NBN will be Australia’s first national wholesale, open access broadband network offering equivalent terms and conditions to all access seekers or service providers. The Australian Government has established NBN Co to design, build and operate a new high-speed NBN. NBN Co will roll out the network and sell wholesale services to retail service providers. In turn retail service providers will offer retail services to consumers. This is a significant structural change to Australia’s telecommunications industry, aimed at encouraging vibrant retail competition.


On 7 March 2012 the Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and Telstra came into force. The Agreements pave the way for a faster, cheaper and more efficient rollout of the NBN. They include the reuse of suitable Telstra infrastructure, avoiding infrastructure duplication and for Telstra to progressively structurally separate by decommissioning its copper network during the NBN rollout. The Definitive Agreements will mean less disruption to communities, less use of overhead cables and faster access to the NBN for Australians.


Planning and construction of the NBN is well underway. On 29 March 2012 NBN Co released its first 3 year fibre rollout plan, which has an objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 3.5 million fibre premises by 30 June 2015, in every state and territory in Australia2.


At the public launch of the three year fibre rollout plan NBN Co CEO, Mr Mike Quigley, set out the principles which govern the planning of the rollout and the locations to receive fibre under the first three year plan, including:


completing rollout sites that had already been announced in the first and second release announcements and the 12 month rollout plan;


1 NBN Co is designing the NBN to be capable of delivering these speeds to NBN Co’s Retail Service Providers (RSPs) and Wholesale Service Providers (WSPs) via Fibre, Fixed Wireless and Satellite. Speeds actually achieved by End Users will depend on a number of factors including the quality of their equipment and in-premises connection, the broadband plans offered by their service provider and how their service provider designs its network to cater for multiple End Users.


2 The terms ‘construction commences’ and ‘construction completed’ throughout this document have the meaning given in NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan dated 6 August 2012.


incorporating the instructions given by the government in its capacity as the shareholder of NBN Co, such as an even rollout distribution between regional and metropolitan areas and across states and territories; completing the rollout in Tasmania by 2015; and prioritising locations likely to contain a high number of new estates in order to meet the objectives in the government’s greenfields policy;


utilising available Telstra infrastructure, including exchanges and the transit links that connect the fibre nodes back to the points of interconnect;


prioritising the links needed to provide high speed broadband to rural Australia as quickly as possible through NBN Co’s next-generation fixed wireless and satellite networks;


sequencing the rollout to ensure that costs were minimised and operations were conducted as efficiently as possible; and


ensuring the construction load was balanced for the contractors and make necessary adjustments if unacceptable congestion levels in local communities were forecast.


On 8 August 2012, the Shareholder Ministers released NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan, which confirms that the NBN is on track to be delivered to all Australians. The NBN Co 2012-15 Corporate Plan confirms:


the NBN is a sound investment that will pay its own way and generate a 7 per cent return for the taxpayer;


the government is on track to meet its target of having work for 758,000 fibre premises commenced or completed by the end of 2012;


wholesale broadband prices are projected to fall over time in both real and nominal terms;


the government’s equity contribution is forecast at $30.4 billion over the life of the project; and


the construction time for the NBN has only been extended by six months, despite a nine month delay in the completion of the Telstra deal.


The key elements of the rollout are now in place, with NBN Co making the transition from planning and initial implementation towards a full-scale rollout.


AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


The Australian Government has considered the Committee’s Third Report and provides the following response to the recommendations.




Performance Reporting





Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy review the efficiency of their current clearance processes for providing answers to questions on notice so that:


Responses to the majority of questions placed on notice by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network can be received by the due date;


Its answers to parliamentary committees are consistent, thorough and complete, so that ambiguities are minimised in public debate.


The government notes this recommendation.


The government recognises the importance of providing information to the Committee, noting that time is required to prepare accurate responses to requests for information on the NBN rollout, and for necessary due diligence processes of NBN Co and the government.


The level of interest in the rollout of the NBN attracts considerable inquiries from a range of parliamentary committees. It is worth noting that NBN Co responded to more than 320 Questions on Notice arising from Senate Estimates hearings in 2011-12 and 80 Questions on Notice from the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network since its establishment. Many questions asked by Members of Parliament or Senators have multiple sub-parts and a level of complexity around the information sought that requires significant investment of resources and time to prepare comprehensive responses.


The government and NBN Co are committed to publishing as much information as possible on the rollout, the company and the benefits of the NBN.


Shareholder departments and NBN Co continue to prioritise clearance processes for responding to questions on notice from Parliamentary Committees.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends the government include key performance information in its six-monthly National Broadband Network performance report, listing and detailing: (1) established Business Plan targets and (2) actual results for:


Homes passed;


Homes connected; and


Services in operation.


The government supports this recommendation.


The government and NBN Co are committed to publishing as much information as possible on the NBN rollout.


The government’s six-monthly report to the Committee is based on information from NBN Co and provides:


a summary of the key milestones achieved by the Company, including construction commenced, premises passed, and premises activated for brownfields, greenfields and satellite/fixed wireless;


year to date financial reports, comprising profit and loss statements, balance sheets and a consolidated statement of cash flows; and


measurement against agreed Key Performance Indicators for the Company.


The initial performance reports reflect the early stages of the rollout and as such, contain in addition to financial reports, a growing range of performance indicators as the rollout proceeds.


Key Performance Indicators to date have included information on actual results for occupational health and safety, complaint handling, and network deployment (including the number of premises under construction, passed, and activated).


The indicators included in future reports will be expanded so that, over time, the reports will include further detail as the company and its reporting systems mature and the rollout ramps up.


NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan, released on 8 August 2012, includes annual targets for premises passed and premises activated for brownfields, greenfields and satellite/fixed wireless.


NBN Co’s rollout forecasts in the 2012-15 Corporate Plan are consistent with the objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 758,000 fibre premises by 31 December 2012, in line with NBN Co’s ‘12 month Fibre Rollout Schedule’ and an objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 3.5 million fibre premises by 30 June 2015, in line with NBN Co’s ‘3 year Fibre Rollout Plan’.




Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co as soon as possible, provide further key information on its website in a user-friendly format, and also include this information in the six monthly Shareholder Ministers’ Performance Report. This information should include:


The date of the commencement of work in individual service areas;


The progress of the rollout in each service area (expressed as a percentage);


The exact date of completion of the National Broadband Network rollout in each service area;


Information about how to connect to the network; and


A list of retail service providers active in each service area.


The government supports this recommendation.


The government and NBN Co are committed to publishing as much information as possible on the NBN rollout including its progress in each service area and connection advice relevant to end-users.


On 29 March 2012 NBN Co released its first 3 year fibre rollout plan, which has an objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 3.5 million fibre premises by 30 June 2015, in every state and territory in Australia. On average it will take 12 months from the start of the fibre network rollout in a given area until services are available.


NBN Co’s three year national fibre rollout plan is updated annually with new rollout information. The plan and updates are published on NBN Co’s website www.nbnco.com.au and include advice on progress with construction, as well as listing new rollout sites where construction activity will begin.


Expected timings around the commencement and completion of work in areas within the fibre footprint area are provided in NBN Co’s Monthly Ready for Service Rollout Plan, published on NBN Co’s website http://www.nbnco.com.au/getting-connected/service¬providers/network-rollout.html and includes advice on the:


approximate number of premises within the Fibre Serving Area (FSA);


expected date for the commencement of work within an FSA; and


expected date that services will become available.


NBN Co has also published information on its website about connecting to the NBN including a step-by-step guide for individuals and businesses, a brochure on Getting Connected and a guide on Preparing for the NBN.


As of 20 August 2012, 43 service providers were listed on NBN Co’s website as active certified service providers of fibre, satellite or wireless services. The list of service providers is further divided into the following categories to assist members of the public in identifying an appropriate service:


Inland Australia - fibre service


Mainland Australia - new housing developments


Tasmania


Fixed wireless service area


Satellite service area


The decision to provide services to a specific location is a commercial matter for retail service providers.


Further information on NBN service providers is available from NBN Co’s website at http://www.nbnco.com.au/getting-connected/certified-service-providers.html. NBN Co is also exploring the possibility of including additional information on its website to enable the identification of retail service providers in service areas within each state and territory.




Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in the development of future public education activities, undertake a study of similar international networks, with a view to adoption of:


International best practice;


Strategies employed by governments and companies building these networks; and


Concrete examples of how this technology is being used and maximised by individuals, business and governments.


The government broadly supports this recommendation.


The government notes that a range of reviews and inquiries – including the House of Representatives Inquiry on role and potential of the NBN, reports by the Joint Committee on the NBN and submissions to the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee, together with a range of other surveys and research – encourage the Australian Government to provide further education and information about the NBN to promote greater awareness and understanding of the NBN and the value and benefits of being connected to, and participating, in the digital economy.


NBN Co is already undertaking a range of comprehensive public education activities at the local level and continues to engage with state-based NBN taskforces, local government and regional interest groups.


NBN Co has provided a call centre 1800 number and public website (www.nbnco.com.au) where the community and stakeholders can contact NBN Co directly with questions, queries, and problems.


To further support its public education activity, NBN Co has established two demonstration facilities; the Discovery Centre in Docklands, Melbourne and the NBN Co Discovery Truck travelling across Australia.


The government’s information-based NBN regional advertising campaign was conducted earlier this year and aimed to improve perceptions and understanding of the NBN in regional and rural Australia, including that the NBN will deliver high-speed reliable and affordable broadband to all of Australia and will have a positive impact on regional businesses.


Public information on migration activities will be undertaken by NBN Co, in consultation with government, Telstra (as the existing infrastructure provider) and the wider industry, to support the migration of consumer services during the transition from the copper network to the new fibre optic NBN.


The objective of the public information on migration activities will be to ensure to the maximum extent practicable that end users receive advance notice of the planned migration and are familiar with the action required to be taken by them to migrate to the NBN.


Further to this NBN Co, in consultation with the department, has developed a framework for engaging key stakeholders to assist with the development of public information on migration. This framework includes consulting government, relevant industry regulators, retail service providers, industry and peak bodies, and consumer groups such as ACCAN.




Regulatory and Pricing Issues





Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends that NBN Co include the consumer protection components of the Customer Service Guarantee in its Wholesale Broadband Agreement.


The government notes this recommendation.


The Customer Service Guarantee (CSG) sets minimum standards, such as connection and repair timeframes that apply to the supply of standard telephone services by retail service providers to retail customers (i.e. residential/small business end-users). NBN Co is a wholesale company that does not supply services directly to retail customers. As such it is


not appropriate to include service levels directly relating to retail customers in its Wholesale Broadband Agreement (WBA).


Notwithstanding this, the current WBA acknowledges the role of NBN Co in enabling its customers to meet their retail level obligations. To this end NBN Co’s Product Catalogue, which is part of its WBA, includes a Service Level Schedule3 which sets out a full range of connection and service assurance timeframes. NBN Co is working with its customers through its Contract Development Process (CDP) to further refine these service level commitments. NBN Co has also indicated that its revised Special Access Undertaking will address service levels and commit to an ongoing Product Development Forum.4


Prior to executing the interim WBA in February 2012, Telstra negotiated an amendment that acknowledged that nothing in the WBA amends, limits or negates the rights and obligations of the parties under section 118A of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards Act) 1999 (TCPSS Act). Relevantly, this provision imposes an obligation on a carriage service provider (here, NBN Co) to contribute to a retail service provider’s CSG liability to a retail customer as a result of a contravention of the CSG, where the contravention is wholly or partially attributable to acts or omissions by the first-mentioned carriage service provider. NBN Co subsequently offered the benefit of this amended clause to its other customers (through a variation to the WBA they had previously signed up to).




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends the Government more effectively deliver its Digital Enterprise Program to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with the aim of improving SME access to online resources and enabling interested SMEs to achieve an online presence.


The government recognises that small businesses need to be digitally literate in order to maximise opportunities and productivity benefits offered by the digital economy.


NBN Co has released the first of a series of enhancements to the fibre optic network to help enable Australian businesses to make the most of high-speed broadband. NBN For Business is available to telephone and internet service providers and is designed to meet the needs of SMEs.


These enhancements include business grade service levels, higher internet speeds than the existing residential offering and multi-line telephony capabilities.


NBN Co’s business offering is also designed to provide higher reliability, guaranteed bandwidth and faster upstream speeds to end-users. However, it is important to note that

while these services are still under development, businesses in areas where the fibre rollout has been completed are still able to obtain a standard NBN service.


The government has already provided $10 million in grant funding over three years to establish the Digital Enterprise program. The program is helping SMEs and not-for-profit organisations in 40 communities that benefit from the NBN, where work on the rollout has already commenced. The program will help these communities to better understand how they can maximise the opportunities from greater digital engagement, enabled by the NBN.


The Digital Enterprise program services are now available in the communities of Townsville in Queensland, Kiama and Armidale in New South Wales, Midway Point, Smithton and Scottsdale in Tasmania, and Willunga in South Australia.


The establishment of another 34 Digital Enterprise services are proposed for the 2012-13 financial year in the communities of St Helens, George Town, Triabunna, South Hobart, Deloraine, Launceston and Kingston Beach in Tasmania; Prospect, Adelaide City, Adelaide Hills, Salisbury and Modbury in South Australia; South Morang, Bacchus Marsh, Brunswick, Ballarat, Golden Plains Shire, Hepburn Shire and Pyrenees Shire in Victoria; Toowoomba, Goodna, Lockyer Valley and Brisbane in Queensland; Victoria Park, Geraldton and Melville in Western Australia; Richmond, Riverstone, Auburn, Penrith, Tamworth and Liverpool Plains in New South Wales; Darwin in the Northern Territory; and, the Australian Capital Territory.


Funding for the program is available until June 2014. Any extension to the program will require further consideration by the government.


The government is providing practical guidance to Australian SMEs and community organisations about how to get online and maximise the opportunities of the digital economy through its Digital Business website (digitalbusiness.gov.au). Launched in December 2010, the website is specifically designed for people who want to get the most out of the internet for their organisation, but may have limited experience, modest budgets or be busy running their business. It contains easy to understand information on establishing and enhancing an online presence, using online productivity tools to increase business efficiencies, and protecting business data. The Digital Business website contains video case studies that share real examples of Australian businesses and community organisations that are engaging in online activities, as well as a blog that provides updates on the latest trends and advice from industry experts. The website is one of the resources being used by Digital Enterprise service providers.


To give some context to the online engagement by businesses, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that in 2010-11, while 90 per cent of businesses had broadband Internet access, only 43 per cent had a web presence5. Australian Communications and Media Authority


5 ABS, Summary of IT Use and Innovation in Australian Business 20010‐11, Cat. No. 8166.0, 26 June 2012 research found that 35 percent of people had bought, sold or shopped online in the month of June 20116.


The department commissioned a study7 on the potential for small business and community organisations to take advantage of the NBN. This study identifies key opportunities presented by the NBN, in addition to outlining a number of challenges to SMEs realising the NBN’s full potential. The government is taking these challenges into consideration in relation to the delivery of its Digital Enterprise Program. They include:


cost and time constraints - costs and time associated with services resulting from the NBN and developing Internet capabilities;


information gaps - potential for information gaps to exist among NBN stakeholders regarding the NBN, its technical aspects, and the network set-up currently in progress;


technical issues - focus groups expressed concern around a number of technical aspects of the NBN (such as wireless internet speeds and international bandwidth capacity); and


behavioural issues - a continuing tendency for SMEs to more willingly commit to traditional industry practices. Some existing SMEs are still in the process of embracing existing internet technologies, and will take more time to fully realise the capabilities of the NBN. Focus groups recognised the difficulty for SMEs to conceptualise the benefits of products and practices without first experiencing them.




Contracting





Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy review its internal processes where the public interest test is used to assess whether material is commercial-in-confidence, and provide details of this review to the Committee.


The government notes this recommendation.


The department considers and responds to requests for information from the Committee in a transparent and accountable manner. Where requests involve the potential disclosure or provision of information that is considered commercially confidential, an assessment is made


6 http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC410254 p153


7 The Allen Consulting Group, Opportunities for small business and community organisation in NBN first release areas, Feb 2011,http://www.dbcde.gov.au/data/assets/pdffile/0020/135506/Opportunitiesforsmallbusinessandcommunity organisationsinNBNfirst‐releaseareas.PDF  regarding the potential commercial harm that disclosure may cause including to third parties such as suppliers and contractors, and to NBN Co. The assessment takes account of the particular facts of the matter and:


the public interest in accountability (i.e. the interest in disclosing the information); and


the public interest in protecting commercial interests (i.e. the interest in the information remaining confidential). In formulating an assessment of this interest, the department consults with any relevant third party to which the confidential information relates. The assessment considers the particular detriment that would flow from the release of the information in the particular case.


Each of the interests is weighed up to determine, on balance, whether it is in the public interest to disclose the information.


Requests for the release of information that the Committee may make in relation to the rollout of the NBN are considered on a case-by-case basis as set out above and includes an analysis, for example, as to whether potential disclosure or provision of information may cause adverse effects on commercial relationships and NBN Co’s ability to achieve its business, financial or commercial objectives and hence negatively impact upon Australian taxpayers’ investment in NBN Co.


Matters relating to departmental or NBN Co claims for non-disclosure of information to the Committee are ultimately referred to the Minister for consideration.




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, for all future contracts the NBN Co


update, and regularly maintain, its tender registry to include the following basic information:


A list of works included in the original request for tenders;


The dates at which the tender opened, closed and was awarded;


The name of the awarded company or companies;


The length of time the services or goods are expected to be completed;


The value of the contract, or where commercial sensitivities prohibit disclosure, the aggregate value of the contracts;


The details of any extensions and variations to contracts as well as the value of an extended contract;


The value and percentage of local content in the awarded contract; and


Any other relevant accompanying information.


The government is supportive of NBN Co being subject to a high level of transparency and accountability regarding its tendering activities.


NBN Co’s overall corporate governance framework is set out in the


Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act) complemented by Commonwealth Government Business Enterprise Governance and Oversight Guidelines of October 2011 (GBE Guidelines), its constitution and the Corporations Act 2001. Under the CAC Act and GBE Guidelines, NBN Co is required to notify responsible Ministers of significant events and the operations of the company and its subsidiaries, including major procurement activities.


While there are no formal requirements for tender outcomes to be published by GBEs, NBN Co publishes the details of current, closed and awarded tenders on its website at http://www.nbnco.com.au/working-for-us/tenders.html. The Company also regularly publishes announcements on its website detailing major procurement outcomes. Further, the government’s six-monthly report to the Committee includes commentary regarding major procurements, the percentage of local content in NBN Co’s contracts and a schedule of commitments detailing the aggregate value of commitments payable by type and maturity.


While contract negotiations are a matter for NBN Co, the government is confident that NBN Co has a comprehensive and documented approach to achieving value for money in procurement and undertakes the appropriate levels of due diligence in its approach to tender processes, recognising its responsibilities to demonstrate alignment with the principles of probity, transparency and value.




Services in regional and remote Australia





Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co revise its terminology and language to clarify community understanding of what the three National Broadband Network services can and cannot support, to enable the community to prepare for the network’s services appropriately and become fully informed.


The government supports this recommendation.


NBN Co has developed and published material on its website (www.nbnco.com.au) that demonstrates the opportunities created by the NBN and explains the capabilities of the three technology platforms; fibre, fixed wireless and satellite. This material includes case studies, fact sheets, videos, presentations, brochures and a range of other web content.


NBN Co has provisioned additional resources for the marketing and execution of public education activities over the deployment period and this will support the delivery of more information about the NBN in regional communities. Public education activities will be aimed at addressing consumer needs including highlighting the benefits of the different NBN technologies and ensuring information is available on how to prepare for the transition to the NBN.


Over the longer term it is expected that NBN Co will play a primary role in this activity as it aligns with the Company’s current communications plans.




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co include in its web-based interactive rollout map specific information on the provision of voice services for communities in fixed wireless and satellite access areas.


The government supports the provision of further information for consumers of voice services in fixed wireless and satellite areas.


The government is committed to the continued provision of voice services to residents and businesses in NBN fixed wireless and satellite areas. Under an agreement reached between Telstra and the Commonwealth, as administered by the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency (TUSMA), Telstra has a contractual obligation to maintain the copper network in non-fibre areas, and provide voice-only services nationally (including locations outside the fibre footprint) for a period of 20 years from


1 July 2012. TUSMA’s agreement with Telstra to deliver key services such as standard telephone services and public payphones ensures continuity of basic safeguards for all Australians and in particular, strengthens the safety net for rural and regional Australia.


For premises in NBN fixed wireless and satellite areas, residents that have existing telephone services will have the choice to maintain those services or access a voice service provided over the NBN’s fixed wireless or satellite network.


Further, the 2012 Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee recently examined telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia (‘the Sinclair Review’). The Committee’s report ‘Regional Communications: Empowering digital communities”, was tabled in the Parliament on 23 May 2012. Recommendation 2.3 of the Sinclair Review was that “the government should develop and implement a comprehensive communication strategy to raise awareness of consumer safeguards for people in regional Australia.”


The Australian Government responded to the recommendations of the Sinclair Review on 23 August 2012. In response to recommendation 2.3, the government has stated that the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy will work with the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport to develop and implement a strategy to disseminate information on consumer safeguards to people living in regional Australia, for example through Regional Development Australia committees and the ‘myregion’ website. This will include providing information on TUSMA and associated arrangements for ongoing availability of voice services, including for communities in fixed wireless and satellite access areas.




Recommendation 11



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co finalise its policy for the provision of costing extensions to its planned National Broadband Network fibre footprint:


•   And publicise the policy and its process for communities in the fixed wireless and satellite service areas; and


At the point of announcing new areas within these footprints, ensure that the policy is attached to media releases and known to the relevant local government associations.


The government supports this recommendation.


NBN Co has recently published its Network Extension Policy on its website (refer to http://www.nbnco.com.au/assets/documents/network-extension-policy.pdf).


The government is supportive of NBN Co publicising its Network Extension Policy and committed to making this information widely available in fixed wireless and satellite service areas.


The policy outlines NBN Co’s process for individuals, businesses and governments to apply for a Network Extension to build an alternate technology to that which was planned as part of NBN Co’s national rollout.


The company conducted a network extension trial process in Tasmania, which informed development of the final policy. The trial’s most important finding was the need for effective community consultation activities at the commencement of the rollout process in relevant areas. As such, the company has now published its Network Extension policy, and provides significant information to interested parties at NBN Community Information Sessions which are generally held at the commencement of the rollout in a particular area.


Further, to support the rollout in any one area, NBN Co undertakes extensive engagement with the relevant local council and information about Network Extension options is provided as part of these discussions.


There are three types of Network Extensions categorised by the size and complexity of the extension.


1. Adjacent Fibre Network Extensions - covering premises located on the edge of a fibre serving area module. These premises can be individual (e.g. a house) or a group of premises (e.g. a group of houses or a group of businesses in an industrial area);


2. Large Fibre Network Extensions - covering small communities or towns that are not planned to be serviced by fibre or individual premises or multiple premises that cannot be considered for an Adjacent Fibre Network Extension; and


3. Fixed Wireless Network Extensions - covering small communities or towns that are planned to be serviced by satellite services.


A key objective behind the Network Extension Program is to give Australian households, businesses and other premises the ability to choose, where possible, an alternative technology through which they can access the NBN.


NBN Co’s Network Extension Fact Sheet can be viewed on their website at http://www.nbnco.com.au/assets/documents/network-extension-fact-sheet.pdf


The fact sheet explains what the Network Extension Program is and outlines the process which is to be followed to apply for a network extension. The fact sheet and application form will be available at NBN Co’s Community Information Sessions held in towns where there is a potential for Network Extension projects.


NBN Co has established a dedicated group whose task is to engage with communities and stakeholders throughout the project rollout. A structured program of community and stakeholder activities has been designed and promoted.


Community engagement activities are designed to ensure that landowners, tenants, businesses and end-users are kept informed of activities and rollout progress. They include:


direct marketing;


community information sessions and forums;


key stakeholder briefings and meetings;


media and advertising; and


a range of detailed information on NBN Co’s website.




Private Equity Funding and Telstra Workforce Issues





Recommendation 12



While noting possible revisions in this area in NBN Co’s next corporate plan, the Committee recommends that NBN Co progress its consideration of debt financing arrangements as a priority.


The government supports this recommendation.


In its Statement of Expectations to NBN Co dated 17 December 2010, the government noted that during the NBN rollout period, private sector debt raised by the Company will complement government equity to fund rollout activities.


NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan includes external funding assumptions and estimates that the total debt funding to be raised from banks and financial markets is forecast at $13.7 billion from 2014-15 to 2020-21.


By the time of raising private sector finance, NBN Co will have demonstrated a strong track record in the delivery of its key objectives, established investor confidence in both the rollout and take up of this critical infrastructure, with clear visibility of positive earnings and cashflows.


The government notes, however, that debt arrangements are subject to market conditions outside of NBN Co and the government’s control and will need to be assessed closer to the point that debt is required.


Following completion of the rollout, the government will consider the optimum capital structure for the Company, noting that NBN Co is required to operate within the ownership and investment settings determined through the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011.




Recommendation 13



The Committee recommends that the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy publicly disseminate a reporting document on annual progress under the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed.


The government broadly supports this recommendation and considers that information about the progress of the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed could be included in the annual statement outlining the direct and indirect employment benefits of the National Broadband Network in response to Recommendation 15.


Under the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed, the Commonwealth provided Telstra with $100 million in funding to assist it to retrain its eligible staff to operate in an NBN environment. The retraining funding will be spread over an eight year period in which Telstra will develop courses and train staff focussing primarily on retraining staff who currently work on the copper and Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) networks, and staff whose roles are linked to supporting the copper and HFC networks including the wholesale copper workforce and the direct field support workforce. Telstra will also give priority to retraining Telstra employees in NBN related technical, process and system activities.


The provision of funding followed the government’s acceptance of Telstra’s comprehensive Training Plan which formed a key requirement of the Deed. Telstra must provide a Training.


Plan covering three years which sets out the training needs, courses to be developed, training methodology, and training targets. Six months prior to the cessation of the then current Training Plan, Telstra will submit the next Training Plan to the department for review. Under the Deed, not less than 70 per cent of funds spent in any three years of a Training Plan must go towards the development and delivery of Accredited Training Courses by a Registered Training Organisation.


The Deed includes a comprehensive reporting regime, covering both financial and training activities. Telstra must create and maintain full and accurate accounts and records of the conduct of the retraining, the use of funds, progress against the training targets and plan and the creation, acquisition and disposal of assets. Telstra is required to provide a half yearly report to government on progress against the Training Plan and a more detailed annual report to government on the Training Plan. Telstra will also meet with the department every six months and, unless agreed otherwise, hold quarterly meetings with its Unions which the department will attend as an observer.




Recommendation 14



The Committee recommends that NBN Co publicly communicate major areas of emerging training need and workforce demand with regard to the rollout of the National Broadband Network, to assist with future Australian workforce planning in this sector.


The government supports this recommendation.


NBN Co is focused on growing a pool of skilled labour within Australia and maximising local industry participation in the rollout of the NBN.


NBN Co has forecast direct employment demand for total employment in the construction phase of 16,000 to 18,000 jobs at the peak of construction. There are five key roles which make up around 80 per cent of forecast workforce demand:


Labourer (5,500)


Earthmoving Plant Operator (2,300)


Road Traffic Controller (900)


Cabler (3,000)


Telecommunications Lineworker (1,100)


NBN Co is working with all levels of government, its principal construction contractors, the industry skills boards and training organisations to facilitate partnerships and support an appropriately skilled workforce to support the rollout.


To date NBN Co has:


established a working group on skills and workforce issues involving the principal contractors;


established a workforce development group which has undertaken a detailed assessment of the tasks involved in the rollout, the skills required and the corresponding demand and supply for employment during the rollout construction;


sought expressions of interest from Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) who can deliver training courses in a range of nominated occupations in civil construction, fibre network construction and wireless network construction. The expression of interest received from RTO’s indicated these firms are looking to hire more trainers to meet the expected demand for training places so that people can gain the skills they need to participate in the rollout; and


developed a workforce development strategy that involves:


identifying the gap between supply and demand of appropriately skilled resources;


determining relevant training programs and qualifications, providers, and funding to support skills development; and


developing assurance that the NBN rollout workforce is skilled and qualified.


The workforce development strategy also recognises the dispersed nature of the rollout which will enable it to leverage workers from both regional and metropolitan areas.


As part of the strategy, NBN Co undertakes workforce modelling using the national rollout schedules to:


identify where and when NBN construction activities will take place and the type of network architecture to be built;


identify the rollout schedule data which is then overlayed with assumptions built upon construction activities, including; crew composition, productivity rates, occupations and installation guidelines; and


provide a forecast of demand for workers, by region, occupation and time.


The modelling is currently being reviewed against the three year rollout plan announced in March 2012. The review will also consider the impact of the Telstra agreement which was finalised in March 2012.


Information on this strategy is publicly available on the NBN Co website at www.nbnco.com.au.


NBN Co is also:


exploring an umbrella approach to funding proposals which would facilitate principal contractors/delivery partners and their sub-contractors being engaged with large federally funded programs. This approach will also assist their understanding of how to access government funding and how to connect with apprentices, local job seekers and Indigenous Australians; and


starting to engage with employment services providers, Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and Australian Apprenticeships Centres (AACs), through relevant government agencies, to build their understanding of the NBN and the associated rollout while also building connections of relevant stakeholders at a regional level.


Traineeships will play an important role in the development of the NBN workforce, and to date construction companies appointed by NBN Co have already taken on more than 45 trainees with plans for a further 50 to be engaged in the coming months.


The NBN Co website features information on preferred qualifications to provide clear advice to both the vocational education and training (VET) system, and individuals’ training for NBN Co’s preferred qualifications. This will assist in influencing decisions on delivery and participation in telecommunications training courses.


Other than the construction task, jobs will be created through direct NBN Co employment; through NBN Co’s purchase of inputs for the rollout and related companies; industries gearing up to deliver applications and services over the NBN infrastructure; and the flow-on effects to the businesses these firms interact with. Initial estimates prepared by the Australian Government in April 2009 indicated that the NBN would support up to 25,000 local jobs every year, on average, over the life of the project, with up to 37,000 jobs at the peak of the rollout.


NBN Co seeks local content and sourcing arrangements in its major contracts particularly where there is known local supply capacity or the potential to promote additional local production through NBN Co contracts.


Certain contracts are inherently local such as construction of the fibre network. NBN Co has awarded over $1.1 billion in construction contracts, including:


$300 million over four years to Visionstream Australia for the construction of the fibre network in Tasmania;


$19 million to Visionstream Australia to build the first stage on the transit network;


$141 million over two years to Syntheo for the construction of the fibre network in South Australia and the Northern Territory;


$133 million over two years to Transfield for the construction of the fibre network in Victoria;


$174 million over two years to Syntheo for the construction of the fibre network in Western Australia; and


$380 million over two years to Silcar for the construction of the fibre network in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.


The contract for construction in Tasmania is an example of where the NBN is not only expected to see the creation of 800 new jobs at the peak of the rollout, but it will also create a permanent workforce based in Tasmania to undertake ongoing maintenance and future upgrades.


NBN Co anticipates that between 250-300 Australian jobs will be generated by the rollout of the Long Term Satellite Service. This includes approximately 200-250 equivalent full-time positions (likely to be contractors) who will install satellite dishes and modems on the roofs and inside the homes of up to 200,000 homes and businesses across Australia from 2015.


In January 2011, NBN Co awarded three contracts worth over $1.6 billion to Australian located companies—Warren & Brown, Corning and Prysmian—to supply equipment for the NBN, including optical distribution frames, fibre optic cabling and other passive network equipment. As a direct result of being awarded an NBN contract:


Warren & Brown has advised they have so far employed an additional 40 people and anticipate another 20 will be added over the next 12 months;


Corning expects to create an additional 400 jobs at its Melbourne facility; and


50 direct new jobs were created in Prysmian’s Dee Why manufacturing facility and it is estimated that in addition to this, jobs will be created in transport, logistics, training, administration and other support roles.




Recommendation 15



The Committee recommends that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy publish, on an annual basis, a detailed statement outlining the direct and indirect employment benefits of the National Broadband Network (NBN) rollout, including in terms of local/regional employment and major areas of emerging NBN workforce demand.


The government broadly supports this recommendation.


The government established NBN Co to design, build and operate the NBN, a project that will create jobs in upstream industries as new applications are developed to utilise the network, as well as create new jobs in related sectors supplying to NBN Co and its


subcontractors in the construction, manufacturing, IT and telecommunications industries. The rollout of the NBN will also assist in developing new and wider workforce opportunities in regional areas in the sectors of health and education, and with the greater use of new online markets.


NBN Co projects that between 16,000 and 18,000 construction jobs alone will be created at the peak of the rollout. To ensure a suitably qualified and skilled workforce is available to support the rollout of the NBN, NBN Co has developed a workforce development strategy which recognizes the dispersed nature of the rollout, enabling NBN Co to leverage workers from both regional and metropolitan areas.


Other than the construction task, jobs will be created through direct NBN Co employment, through NBN Co’s purchase of inputs for the rollout and related companies, and industries gearing up to deliver applications and services over the NBN infrastructure and the flow-on effects to the businesses these firms interact with.


As at 30 June 2012, NBN Co had 1,674 employees, including contractors and labour hire.


The initial estimates prepared in April 2009 by the government on the local jobs that would be supported by the NBN relate to the broad economic impact of the government’s decision to invest in the NBN policy and include the jobs created in related sectors that have started gearing up to support or deliver services over the NBN.


NBN Co seeks local content and sourcing arrangements in its major contracts particularly where there is known local supply capacity or the potential to promote additional local production through NBN Co contracts. During 2011, NBN Co awarded a range of contracts with a total value of almost $4 billion, the majority of which was for Australian-based manufacturing and services, leading to direct new employment of approximately 700 to 1,000 new jobs.


On 20 December 2010, the government publicly released its Statement of Expectations to NBN Co. The document highlighted the government’s expectation that NBN Co will actively promote opportunities for small and medium enterprises to participate fully in this project in meaningful and continuing ways. To assist NBN Co, the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education funds an NBN National Sector Manager through the Supplier Access to Major Projects program to liaise with Industry Capability Network Consultants, suppliers, industry associations and NBN Co, to facilitate links between Australian companies and supply opportunities. The NBN National Sector Manager is working with NBN Co to identify Australian companies for tenders, verify tenders and substantiate capability statements from Australian companies including those from regional areas.


The government has also outlined the jobs benefits created by the NBN in its response to the Committee’s first report on the Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network and will provide future updates on an annual basis, including information about the progress of the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed.

Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network





Third Report - Australian Government Response to the Committee’s Third Report of 25 June 2012 - October 2012





Introduction



In March 2011 the Parliament established the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (the Committee) to enable the ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of all aspects relating to the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN). The Committee is required to report to the Parliament on the rollout of the NBN on a six monthly basis until the completion of the project.


The Committee has been asked to provide progress reports on:


the rollout of the NBN;


the achievement of take-up targets as set out in NBN Co Limited’s (NBN Co) Corporate Plan;


network rollout performance including service levels and faults;


the effectiveness of NBN Co in meeting its obligations as set out in its Stakeholder Charter;


NBN Co’s strategy for engaging with consumers and handling complaints;


NBN Co’s risk management processes; and


any other matter pertaining to the NBN rollout that the Committee considers relevant.


The Committee tabled its first report on the Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network on 31 August 2011 and its second report on 24 November 2011. The government’s responses to the Committee’s first and second reports were tabled in the Parliament on 1 March 2012 and 16 April 2012 respectively.


On 25 June 2012, the Committee tabled its third report, entitled Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network: Third Report. The Committee’s third report was informed by two public hearings, one site inspection and public consultation which attracted


22 submissions and two exhibits. The report made fifteen recommendations ranging across: clearance processes for responding to questions on notice; the provision of information on the NBN including key performance data on targets and actual results; communications around voice services to communities in fixed wireless and satellite areas; publishing details of NBN Co’s procurement processes; NBN Co’s policy position for the provision of costing extensions to its NBN fibre footprint, especially for regional and remote Australia; private equity funding and Telstra workforce issues.




Background



The NBN is a telecommunications network that will provide access to high-speed broadband to 100 per cent of Australian premises using a combination of fibre to the premises, fixed-wireless and satellite technologies. NBN Co’s objective is to provide 93 per cent of premises with access to a high-speed fibre network capable of providing broadband speeds of up to one gigabit per second (Gbps). Seven per cent of premises will be served by a combination of next-generation fixed-wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of 12 megabits per second (Mbps).1


The NBN will be Australia’s first national wholesale, open access broadband network offering equivalent terms and conditions to all access seekers or service providers. The Australian Government has established NBN Co to design, build and operate a new high-speed NBN. NBN Co will roll out the network and sell wholesale services to retail service providers. In turn retail service providers will offer retail services to consumers. This is a significant structural change to Australia’s telecommunications industry, aimed at encouraging vibrant retail competition.


On 7 March 2012 the Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and Telstra came into force. The Agreements pave the way for a faster, cheaper and more efficient rollout of the NBN. They include the reuse of suitable Telstra infrastructure, avoiding infrastructure duplication and for Telstra to progressively structurally separate by decommissioning its copper network during the NBN rollout. The Definitive Agreements will mean less disruption to communities, less use of overhead cables and faster access to the NBN for Australians.


Planning and construction of the NBN is well underway. On 29 March 2012 NBN Co released its first 3 year fibre rollout plan, which has an objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 3.5 million fibre premises by 30 June 2015, in every state and territory in Australia2.


At the public launch of the three year fibre rollout plan NBN Co CEO, Mr Mike Quigley, set out the principles which govern the planning of the rollout and the locations to receive fibre under the first three year plan, including:


completing rollout sites that had already been announced in the first and second release announcements and the 12 month rollout plan;


1 NBN Co is designing the NBN to be capable of delivering these speeds to NBN Co’s Retail Service Providers (RSPs) and Wholesale Service Providers (WSPs) via Fibre, Fixed Wireless and Satellite. Speeds actually achieved by End Users will depend on a number of factors including the quality of their equipment and in-premises connection, the broadband plans offered by their service provider and how their service provider designs its network to cater for multiple End Users.


2 The terms ‘construction commences’ and ‘construction completed’ throughout this document have the meaning given in NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan dated 6 August 2012.


incorporating the instructions given by the government in its capacity as the shareholder of NBN Co, such as an even rollout distribution between regional and metropolitan areas and across states and territories; completing the rollout in Tasmania by 2015; and prioritising locations likely to contain a high number of new estates in order to meet the objectives in the government’s greenfields policy;


utilising available Telstra infrastructure, including exchanges and the transit links that connect the fibre nodes back to the points of interconnect;


prioritising the links needed to provide high speed broadband to rural Australia as quickly as possible through NBN Co’s next-generation fixed wireless and satellite networks;


sequencing the rollout to ensure that costs were minimised and operations were conducted as efficiently as possible; and


ensuring the construction load was balanced for the contractors and make necessary adjustments if unacceptable congestion levels in local communities were forecast.


On 8 August 2012, the Shareholder Ministers released NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan, which confirms that the NBN is on track to be delivered to all Australians. The NBN Co 2012-15 Corporate Plan confirms:


the NBN is a sound investment that will pay its own way and generate a 7 per cent return for the taxpayer;


the government is on track to meet its target of having work for 758,000 fibre premises commenced or completed by the end of 2012;


wholesale broadband prices are projected to fall over time in both real and nominal terms;


the government’s equity contribution is forecast at $30.4 billion over the life of the project; and


the construction time for the NBN has only been extended by six months, despite a nine month delay in the completion of the Telstra deal.


The key elements of the rollout are now in place, with NBN Co making the transition from planning and initial implementation towards a full-scale rollout.


AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


The Australian Government has considered the Committee’s Third Report and provides the following response to the recommendations.




Performance Reporting





Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy review the efficiency of their current clearance processes for providing answers to questions on notice so that:


Responses to the majority of questions placed on notice by the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network can be received by the due date;


Its answers to parliamentary committees are consistent, thorough and complete, so that ambiguities are minimised in public debate.


The government notes this recommendation.


The government recognises the importance of providing information to the Committee, noting that time is required to prepare accurate responses to requests for information on the NBN rollout, and for necessary due diligence processes of NBN Co and the government.


The level of interest in the rollout of the NBN attracts considerable inquiries from a range of parliamentary committees. It is worth noting that NBN Co responded to more than 320 Questions on Notice arising from Senate Estimates hearings in 2011-12 and 80 Questions on Notice from the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network since its establishment. Many questions asked by Members of Parliament or Senators have multiple sub-parts and a level of complexity around the information sought that requires significant investment of resources and time to prepare comprehensive responses.


The government and NBN Co are committed to publishing as much information as possible on the rollout, the company and the benefits of the NBN.


Shareholder departments and NBN Co continue to prioritise clearance processes for responding to questions on notice from Parliamentary Committees.




Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends the government include key performance information in its six-monthly National Broadband Network performance report, listing and detailing: (1) established Business Plan targets and (2) actual results for:


Homes passed;


Homes connected; and


Services in operation.


The government supports this recommendation.


The government and NBN Co are committed to publishing as much information as possible on the NBN rollout.


The government’s six-monthly report to the Committee is based on information from NBN Co and provides:


a summary of the key milestones achieved by the Company, including construction commenced, premises passed, and premises activated for brownfields, greenfields and satellite/fixed wireless;


year to date financial reports, comprising profit and loss statements, balance sheets and a consolidated statement of cash flows; and


measurement against agreed Key Performance Indicators for the Company.


The initial performance reports reflect the early stages of the rollout and as such, contain in addition to financial reports, a growing range of performance indicators as the rollout proceeds.


Key Performance Indicators to date have included information on actual results for occupational health and safety, complaint handling, and network deployment (including the number of premises under construction, passed, and activated).


The indicators included in future reports will be expanded so that, over time, the reports will include further detail as the company and its reporting systems mature and the rollout ramps up.


NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan, released on 8 August 2012, includes annual targets for premises passed and premises activated for brownfields, greenfields and satellite/fixed wireless.


NBN Co’s rollout forecasts in the 2012-15 Corporate Plan are consistent with the objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 758,000 fibre premises by 31 December 2012, in line with NBN Co’s ‘12 month Fibre Rollout Schedule’ and an objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 3.5 million fibre premises by 30 June 2015, in line with NBN Co’s ‘3 year Fibre Rollout Plan’.




Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co as soon as possible, provide further key information on its website in a user-friendly format, and also include this information in the six monthly Shareholder Ministers’ Performance Report. This information should include:


The date of the commencement of work in individual service areas;


The progress of the rollout in each service area (expressed as a percentage);


The exact date of completion of the National Broadband Network rollout in each service area;


Information about how to connect to the network; and


A list of retail service providers active in each service area.


The government supports this recommendation.


The government and NBN Co are committed to publishing as much information as possible on the NBN rollout including its progress in each service area and connection advice relevant to end-users.


On 29 March 2012 NBN Co released its first 3 year fibre rollout plan, which has an objective of construction commenced or completed for approximately 3.5 million fibre premises by 30 June 2015, in every state and territory in Australia. On average it will take 12 months from the start of the fibre network rollout in a given area until services are available.


NBN Co’s three year national fibre rollout plan is updated annually with new rollout information. The plan and updates are published on NBN Co’s website www.nbnco.com.au and include advice on progress with construction, as well as listing new rollout sites where construction activity will begin.


Expected timings around the commencement and completion of work in areas within the fibre footprint area are provided in NBN Co’s Monthly Ready for Service Rollout Plan, published on NBN Co’s website http://www.nbnco.com.au/getting-connected/service¬providers/network-rollout.html and includes advice on the:


approximate number of premises within the Fibre Serving Area (FSA);


expected date for the commencement of work within an FSA; and


expected date that services will become available.


NBN Co has also published information on its website about connecting to the NBN including a step-by-step guide for individuals and businesses, a brochure on Getting Connected and a guide on Preparing for the NBN.


As of 20 August 2012, 43 service providers were listed on NBN Co’s website as active certified service providers of fibre, satellite or wireless services. The list of service providers is further divided into the following categories to assist members of the public in identifying an appropriate service:


Inland Australia - fibre service


Mainland Australia - new housing developments


Tasmania


Fixed wireless service area


Satellite service area


The decision to provide services to a specific location is a commercial matter for retail service providers.


Further information on NBN service providers is available from NBN Co’s website at http://www.nbnco.com.au/getting-connected/certified-service-providers.html. NBN Co is also exploring the possibility of including additional information on its website to enable the identification of retail service providers in service areas within each state and territory.




Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in the development of future public education activities, undertake a study of similar international networks, with a view to adoption of:


International best practice;


Strategies employed by governments and companies building these networks; and


Concrete examples of how this technology is being used and maximised by individuals, business and governments.


The government broadly supports this recommendation.


The government notes that a range of reviews and inquiries – including the House of Representatives Inquiry on role and potential of the NBN, reports by the Joint Committee on the NBN and submissions to the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee, together with a range of other surveys and research – encourage the Australian Government to provide further education and information about the NBN to promote greater awareness and understanding of the NBN and the value and benefits of being connected to, and participating, in the digital economy.


NBN Co is already undertaking a range of comprehensive public education activities at the local level and continues to engage with state-based NBN taskforces, local government and regional interest groups.


NBN Co has provided a call centre 1800 number and public website (www.nbnco.com.au) where the community and stakeholders can contact NBN Co directly with questions, queries, and problems.


To further support its public education activity, NBN Co has established two demonstration facilities; the Discovery Centre in Docklands, Melbourne and the NBN Co Discovery Truck travelling across Australia.


The government’s information-based NBN regional advertising campaign was conducted earlier this year and aimed to improve perceptions and understanding of the NBN in regional and rural Australia, including that the NBN will deliver high-speed reliable and affordable broadband to all of Australia and will have a positive impact on regional businesses.


Public information on migration activities will be undertaken by NBN Co, in consultation with government, Telstra (as the existing infrastructure provider) and the wider industry, to support the migration of consumer services during the transition from the copper network to the new fibre optic NBN.


The objective of the public information on migration activities will be to ensure to the maximum extent practicable that end users receive advance notice of the planned migration and are familiar with the action required to be taken by them to migrate to the NBN.


Further to this NBN Co, in consultation with the department, has developed a framework for engaging key stakeholders to assist with the development of public information on migration. This framework includes consulting government, relevant industry regulators, retail service providers, industry and peak bodies, and consumer groups such as ACCAN.




Regulatory and Pricing Issues





Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends that NBN Co include the consumer protection components of the Customer Service Guarantee in its Wholesale Broadband Agreement.


The government notes this recommendation.


The Customer Service Guarantee (CSG) sets minimum standards, such as connection and repair timeframes that apply to the supply of standard telephone services by retail service providers to retail customers (i.e. residential/small business end-users). NBN Co is a wholesale company that does not supply services directly to retail customers. As such it is


not appropriate to include service levels directly relating to retail customers in its Wholesale Broadband Agreement (WBA).


Notwithstanding this, the current WBA acknowledges the role of NBN Co in enabling its customers to meet their retail level obligations. To this end NBN Co’s Product Catalogue, which is part of its WBA, includes a Service Level Schedule3 which sets out a full range of connection and service assurance timeframes. NBN Co is working with its customers through its Contract Development Process (CDP) to further refine these service level commitments. NBN Co has also indicated that its revised Special Access Undertaking will address service levels and commit to an ongoing Product Development Forum.4


Prior to executing the interim WBA in February 2012, Telstra negotiated an amendment that acknowledged that nothing in the WBA amends, limits or negates the rights and obligations of the parties under section 118A of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards Act) 1999 (TCPSS Act). Relevantly, this provision imposes an obligation on a carriage service provider (here, NBN Co) to contribute to a retail service provider’s CSG liability to a retail customer as a result of a contravention of the CSG, where the contravention is wholly or partially attributable to acts or omissions by the first-mentioned carriage service provider. NBN Co subsequently offered the benefit of this amended clause to its other customers (through a variation to the WBA they had previously signed up to).




Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends the Government more effectively deliver its Digital Enterprise Program to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with the aim of improving SME access to online resources and enabling interested SMEs to achieve an online presence.


The government recognises that small businesses need to be digitally literate in order to maximise opportunities and productivity benefits offered by the digital economy.


NBN Co has released the first of a series of enhancements to the fibre optic network to help enable Australian businesses to make the most of high-speed broadband. NBN For Business is available to telephone and internet service providers and is designed to meet the needs of SMEs.


These enhancements include business grade service levels, higher internet speeds than the existing residential offering and multi-line telephony capabilities.


NBN Co’s business offering is also designed to provide higher reliability, guaranteed bandwidth and faster upstream speeds to end-users. However, it is important to note that


3 NBN Co, WBA Product Catalogue, 26 June 2012, http://www.nbnco.com.au/assets/documents/w-z/wba-sfaa-wba¬product-catalogue-20120626.pdf, pp.143


4 NBN Co, Incentive Based Modular SAU: Design Principles, 20 June 2012, http://www.accc.gov.au/content/ item.phtml?itemId=1060326&nodeId=ffb8fb54e17f0ecec20acf908f518257&fn=NBN%20Co%20Revised%20SAU%20propos al%20(20%20June%202012).pdf


while these services are still under development, businesses in areas where the fibre rollout has been completed are still able to obtain a standard NBN service.


The government has already provided $10 million in grant funding over three years to establish the Digital Enterprise program. The program is helping SMEs and not-for-profit organisations in 40 communities that benefit from the NBN, where work on the rollout has already commenced. The program will help these communities to better understand how they can maximise the opportunities from greater digital engagement, enabled by the NBN.


The Digital Enterprise program services are now available in the communities of Townsville in Queensland, Kiama and Armidale in New South Wales, Midway Point, Smithton and Scottsdale in Tasmania, and Willunga in South Australia.


The establishment of another 34 Digital Enterprise services are proposed for the 2012-13 financial year in the communities of St Helens, George Town, Triabunna, South Hobart, Deloraine, Launceston and Kingston Beach in Tasmania; Prospect, Adelaide City, Adelaide Hills, Salisbury and Modbury in South Australia; South Morang, Bacchus Marsh, Brunswick, Ballarat, Golden Plains Shire, Hepburn Shire and Pyrenees Shire in Victoria; Toowoomba, Goodna, Lockyer Valley and Brisbane in Queensland; Victoria Park, Geraldton and Melville in Western Australia; Richmond, Riverstone, Auburn, Penrith, Tamworth and Liverpool Plains in New South Wales; Darwin in the Northern Territory; and, the Australian Capital Territory.


Funding for the program is available until June 2014. Any extension to the program will require further consideration by the government.


The government is providing practical guidance to Australian SMEs and community organisations about how to get online and maximise the opportunities of the digital economy through its Digital Business website (digitalbusiness.gov.au). Launched in December 2010, the website is specifically designed for people who want to get the most out of the internet for their organisation, but may have limited experience, modest budgets or be busy running their business. It contains easy to understand information on establishing and enhancing an online presence, using online productivity tools to increase business efficiencies, and protecting business data. The Digital Business website contains video case studies that share real examples of Australian businesses and community organisations that are engaging in online activities, as well as a blog that provides updates on the latest trends and advice from industry experts. The website is one of the resources being used by Digital Enterprise service providers.


To give some context to the online engagement by businesses, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that in 2010-11, while 90 per cent of businesses had broadband Internet access, only 43 per cent had a web presence5. Australian Communications and Media Authority


5 ABS, Summary of IT Use and Innovation in Australian Business 20010‐11, Cat. No. 8166.0, 26 June 2012 research found that 35 percent of people had bought, sold or shopped online in the month of June 20116.


The department commissioned a study7 on the potential for small business and community organisations to take advantage of the NBN. This study identifies key opportunities presented by the NBN, in addition to outlining a number of challenges to SMEs realising the NBN’s full potential. The government is taking these challenges into consideration in relation to the delivery of its Digital Enterprise Program. They include:


cost and time constraints - costs and time associated with services resulting from the NBN and developing Internet capabilities;


information gaps - potential for information gaps to exist among NBN stakeholders regarding the NBN, its technical aspects, and the network set-up currently in progress;


technical issues - focus groups expressed concern around a number of technical aspects of the NBN (such as wireless internet speeds and international bandwidth capacity); and


behavioural issues - a continuing tendency for SMEs to more willingly commit to traditional industry practices. Some existing SMEs are still in the process of embracing existing internet technologies, and will take more time to fully realise the capabilities of the NBN. Focus groups recognised the difficulty for SMEs to conceptualise the benefits of products and practices without first experiencing them.




Contracting





Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy review its internal processes where the public interest test is used to assess whether material is commercial-in-confidence, and provide details of this review to the Committee.


The government notes this recommendation.


The department considers and responds to requests for information from the Committee in a transparent and accountable manner. Where requests involve the potential disclosure or provision of information that is considered commercially confidential, an assessment is made


6 http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC410254 p153


7 The Allen Consulting Group, Opportunities for small business and community organisation in NBN first release areas, Feb 2011,http://www.dbcde.gov.au/data/assets/pdffile/0020/135506/Opportunitiesforsmallbusinessandcommunity organisationsinNBNfirst‐releaseareas.PDF  regarding the potential commercial harm that disclosure may cause including to third parties such as suppliers and contractors, and to NBN Co. The assessment takes account of the particular facts of the matter and:


the public interest in accountability (i.e. the interest in disclosing the information); and


the public interest in protecting commercial interests (i.e. the interest in the information remaining confidential). In formulating an assessment of this interest, the department consults with any relevant third party to which the confidential information relates. The assessment considers the particular detriment that would flow from the release of the information in the particular case.


Each of the interests is weighed up to determine, on balance, whether it is in the public interest to disclose the information.


Requests for the release of information that the Committee may make in relation to the rollout of the NBN are considered on a case-by-case basis as set out above and includes an analysis, for example, as to whether potential disclosure or provision of information may cause adverse effects on commercial relationships and NBN Co’s ability to achieve its business, financial or commercial objectives and hence negatively impact upon Australian taxpayers’ investment in NBN Co.


Matters relating to departmental or NBN Co claims for non-disclosure of information to the Committee are ultimately referred to the Minister for consideration.




Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, for all future contracts the NBN Co


update, and regularly maintain, its tender registry to include the following basic information:


A list of works included in the original request for tenders;


The dates at which the tender opened, closed and was awarded;


The name of the awarded company or companies;


The length of time the services or goods are expected to be completed;


The value of the contract, or where commercial sensitivities prohibit disclosure, the aggregate value of the contracts;


The details of any extensions and variations to contracts as well as the value of an extended contract;


The value and percentage of local content in the awarded contract; and


Any other relevant accompanying information.


The government is supportive of NBN Co being subject to a high level of transparency and accountability regarding its tendering activities.


NBN Co’s overall corporate governance framework is set out in the


Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (CAC Act) complemented by Commonwealth Government Business Enterprise Governance and Oversight Guidelines of October 2011 (GBE Guidelines), its constitution and the Corporations Act 2001. Under the CAC Act and GBE Guidelines, NBN Co is required to notify responsible Ministers of significant events and the operations of the company and its subsidiaries, including major procurement activities.


While there are no formal requirements for tender outcomes to be published by GBEs, NBN Co publishes the details of current, closed and awarded tenders on its website at http://www.nbnco.com.au/working-for-us/tenders.html. The Company also regularly publishes announcements on its website detailing major procurement outcomes. Further, the government’s six-monthly report to the Committee includes commentary regarding major procurements, the percentage of local content in NBN Co’s contracts and a schedule of commitments detailing the aggregate value of commitments payable by type and maturity.


While contract negotiations are a matter for NBN Co, the government is confident that NBN Co has a comprehensive and documented approach to achieving value for money in procurement and undertakes the appropriate levels of due diligence in its approach to tender processes, recognising its responsibilities to demonstrate alignment with the principles of probity, transparency and value.




Services in regional and remote Australia





Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co revise its terminology and language to clarify community understanding of what the three National Broadband Network services can and cannot support, to enable the community to prepare for the network’s services appropriately and become fully informed.


The government supports this recommendation.


NBN Co has developed and published material on its website (www.nbnco.com.au) that demonstrates the opportunities created by the NBN and explains the capabilities of the three technology platforms; fibre, fixed wireless and satellite. This material includes case studies, fact sheets, videos, presentations, brochures and a range of other web content.


NBN Co has provisioned additional resources for the marketing and execution of public education activities over the deployment period and this will support the delivery of more information about the NBN in regional communities. Public education activities will be aimed at addressing consumer needs including highlighting the benefits of the different NBN technologies and ensuring information is available on how to prepare for the transition to the NBN.


Over the longer term it is expected that NBN Co will play a primary role in this activity as it aligns with the Company’s current communications plans.




Recommendation 10



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co include in its web-based interactive rollout map specific information on the provision of voice services for communities in fixed wireless and satellite access areas.


The government supports the provision of further information for consumers of voice services in fixed wireless and satellite areas.


The government is committed to the continued provision of voice services to residents and businesses in NBN fixed wireless and satellite areas. Under an agreement reached between Telstra and the Commonwealth, as administered by the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency (TUSMA), Telstra has a contractual obligation to maintain the copper network in non-fibre areas, and provide voice-only services nationally (including locations outside the fibre footprint) for a period of 20 years from


1 July 2012. TUSMA’s agreement with Telstra to deliver key services such as standard telephone services and public payphones ensures continuity of basic safeguards for all Australians and in particular, strengthens the safety net for rural and regional Australia.


For premises in NBN fixed wireless and satellite areas, residents that have existing telephone services will have the choice to maintain those services or access a voice service provided over the NBN’s fixed wireless or satellite network.


Further, the 2012 Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee recently examined telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia (‘the Sinclair Review’). The Committee’s report ‘Regional Communications: Empowering digital communities”, was tabled in the Parliament on 23 May 2012. Recommendation 2.3 of the Sinclair Review was that “the government should develop and implement a comprehensive communication strategy to raise awareness of consumer safeguards for people in regional Australia.”


The Australian Government responded to the recommendations of the Sinclair Review on 23 August 2012. In response to recommendation 2.3, the government has stated that the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy will work with the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport to develop and implement a strategy to disseminate information on consumer safeguards to people living in regional Australia, for example through Regional Development Australia committees and the ‘myregion’ website. This will include providing information on TUSMA and associated arrangements for ongoing availability of voice services, including for communities in fixed wireless and satellite access areas.




Recommendation 11



The Committee recommends that the NBN Co finalise its policy for the provision of costing extensions to its planned National Broadband Network fibre footprint:


•   And publicise the policy and its process for communities in the fixed wireless and satellite service areas; and


At the point of announcing new areas within these footprints, ensure that the policy is attached to media releases and known to the relevant local government associations.


The government supports this recommendation.


NBN Co has recently published its Network Extension Policy on its website (refer to http://www.nbnco.com.au/assets/documents/network-extension-policy.pdf).


The government is supportive of NBN Co publicising its Network Extension Policy and committed to making this information widely available in fixed wireless and satellite service areas.


The policy outlines NBN Co’s process for individuals, businesses and governments to apply for a Network Extension to build an alternate technology to that which was planned as part of NBN Co’s national rollout.


The company conducted a network extension trial process in Tasmania, which informed development of the final policy. The trial’s most important finding was the need for effective community consultation activities at the commencement of the rollout process in relevant areas. As such, the company has now published its Network Extension policy, and provides significant information to interested parties at NBN Community Information Sessions which are generally held at the commencement of the rollout in a particular area.


Further, to support the rollout in any one area, NBN Co undertakes extensive engagement with the relevant local council and information about Network Extension options is provided as part of these discussions.


There are three types of Network Extensions categorised by the size and complexity of the extension.


1. Adjacent Fibre Network Extensions - covering premises located on the edge of a fibre serving area module. These premises can be individual (e.g. a house) or a group of premises (e.g. a group of houses or a group of businesses in an industrial area);


2. Large Fibre Network Extensions - covering small communities or towns that are not planned to be serviced by fibre or individual premises or multiple premises that cannot be considered for an Adjacent Fibre Network Extension; and


3. Fixed Wireless Network Extensions - covering small communities or towns that are planned to be serviced by satellite services.


A key objective behind the Network Extension Program is to give Australian households, businesses and other premises the ability to choose, where possible, an alternative technology through which they can access the NBN.


NBN Co’s Network Extension Fact Sheet can be viewed on their website at http://www.nbnco.com.au/assets/documents/network-extension-fact-sheet.pdf


The fact sheet explains what the Network Extension Program is and outlines the process which is to be followed to apply for a network extension. The fact sheet and application form will be available at NBN Co’s Community Information Sessions held in towns where there is a potential for Network Extension projects.


NBN Co has established a dedicated group whose task is to engage with communities and stakeholders throughout the project rollout. A structured program of community and stakeholder activities has been designed and promoted.


Community engagement activities are designed to ensure that landowners, tenants, businesses and end-users are kept informed of activities and rollout progress. They include:


direct marketing;


community information sessions and forums;


key stakeholder briefings and meetings;


media and advertising; and


a range of detailed information on NBN Co’s website.




Private Equity Funding and Telstra Workforce Issues





Recommendation 12



While noting possible revisions in this area in NBN Co’s next corporate plan, the Committee recommends that NBN Co progress its consideration of debt financing arrangements as a priority.


The government supports this recommendation.


In its Statement of Expectations to NBN Co dated 17 December 2010, the government noted that during the NBN rollout period, private sector debt raised by the Company will complement government equity to fund rollout activities.


NBN Co’s 2012-15 Corporate Plan includes external funding assumptions and estimates that the total debt funding to be raised from banks and financial markets is forecast at $13.7 billion from 2014-15 to 2020-21.


By the time of raising private sector finance, NBN Co will have demonstrated a strong track record in the delivery of its key objectives, established investor confidence in both the rollout and take up of this critical infrastructure, with clear visibility of positive earnings and cashflows.


The government notes, however, that debt arrangements are subject to market conditions outside of NBN Co and the government’s control and will need to be assessed closer to the point that debt is required.


Following completion of the rollout, the government will consider the optimum capital structure for the Company, noting that NBN Co is required to operate within the ownership and investment settings determined through the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011.




Recommendation 13



The Committee recommends that the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy publicly disseminate a reporting document on annual progress under the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed.


The government broadly supports this recommendation and considers that information about the progress of the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed could be included in the annual statement outlining the direct and indirect employment benefits of the National Broadband Network in response to Recommendation 15.


Under the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed, the Commonwealth provided Telstra with $100 million in funding to assist it to retrain its eligible staff to operate in an NBN environment. The retraining funding will be spread over an eight year period in which Telstra will develop courses and train staff focussing primarily on retraining staff who currently work on the copper and Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) networks, and staff whose roles are linked to supporting the copper and HFC networks including the wholesale copper workforce and the direct field support workforce. Telstra will also give priority to retraining Telstra employees in NBN related technical, process and system activities.


The provision of funding followed the government’s acceptance of Telstra’s comprehensive Training Plan which formed a key requirement of the Deed. Telstra must provide a Training.


Plan covering three years which sets out the training needs, courses to be developed, training methodology, and training targets. Six months prior to the cessation of the then current Training Plan, Telstra will submit the next Training Plan to the department for review. Under the Deed, not less than 70 per cent of funds spent in any three years of a Training Plan must go towards the development and delivery of Accredited Training Courses by a Registered Training Organisation.


The Deed includes a comprehensive reporting regime, covering both financial and training activities. Telstra must create and maintain full and accurate accounts and records of the conduct of the retraining, the use of funds, progress against the training targets and plan and the creation, acquisition and disposal of assets. Telstra is required to provide a half yearly report to government on progress against the Training Plan and a more detailed annual report to government on the Training Plan. Telstra will also meet with the department every six months and, unless agreed otherwise, hold quarterly meetings with its Unions which the department will attend as an observer.




Recommendation 14



The Committee recommends that NBN Co publicly communicate major areas of emerging training need and workforce demand with regard to the rollout of the National Broadband Network, to assist with future Australian workforce planning in this sector.


The government supports this recommendation.


NBN Co is focused on growing a pool of skilled labour within Australia and maximising local industry participation in the rollout of the NBN.


NBN Co has forecast direct employment demand for total employment in the construction phase of 16,000 to 18,000 jobs at the peak of construction. There are five key roles which make up around 80 per cent of forecast workforce demand:


Labourer (5,500)


Earthmoving Plant Operator (2,300)


Road Traffic Controller (900)


Cabler (3,000)


Telecommunications Lineworker (1,100)


NBN Co is working with all levels of government, its principal construction contractors, the industry skills boards and training organisations to facilitate partnerships and support an appropriately skilled workforce to support the rollout.


To date NBN Co has:


established a working group on skills and workforce issues involving the principal contractors;


established a workforce development group which has undertaken a detailed assessment of the tasks involved in the rollout, the skills required and the corresponding demand and supply for employment during the rollout construction;


sought expressions of interest from Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) who can deliver training courses in a range of nominated occupations in civil construction, fibre network construction and wireless network construction. The expression of interest received from RTO’s indicated these firms are looking to hire more trainers to meet the expected demand for training places so that people can gain the skills they need to participate in the rollout; and


developed a workforce development strategy that involves:


identifying the gap between supply and demand of appropriately skilled resources;


determining relevant training programs and qualifications, providers, and funding to support skills development; and


developing assurance that the NBN rollout workforce is skilled and qualified.


The workforce development strategy also recognises the dispersed nature of the rollout which will enable it to leverage workers from both regional and metropolitan areas.


As part of the strategy, NBN Co undertakes workforce modelling using the national rollout schedules to:


identify where and when NBN construction activities will take place and the type of network architecture to be built;


identify the rollout schedule data which is then overlayed with assumptions built upon construction activities, including; crew composition, productivity rates, occupations and installation guidelines; and


provide a forecast of demand for workers, by region, occupation and time.


The modelling is currently being reviewed against the three year rollout plan announced in March 2012. The review will also consider the impact of the Telstra agreement which was finalised in March 2012.


Information on this strategy is publicly available on the NBN Co website at www.nbnco.com.au.


NBN Co is also:


exploring an umbrella approach to funding proposals which would facilitate principal contractors/delivery partners and their sub-contractors being engaged with large federally funded programs. This approach will also assist their understanding of how to access government funding and how to connect with apprentices, local job seekers and Indigenous Australians; and


starting to engage with employment services providers, Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and Australian Apprenticeships Centres (AACs), through relevant government agencies, to build their understanding of the NBN and the associated rollout while also building connections of relevant stakeholders at a regional level.


Traineeships will play an important role in the development of the NBN workforce, and to date construction companies appointed by NBN Co have already taken on more than 45 trainees with plans for a further 50 to be engaged in the coming months.


The NBN Co website features information on preferred qualifications to provide clear advice to both the vocational education and training (VET) system, and individuals’ training for NBN Co’s preferred qualifications. This will assist in influencing decisions on delivery and participation in telecommunications training courses.


Other than the construction task, jobs will be created through direct NBN Co employment; through NBN Co’s purchase of inputs for the rollout and related companies; industries gearing up to deliver applications and services over the NBN infrastructure; and the flow-on effects to the businesses these firms interact with. Initial estimates prepared by the Australian Government in April 2009 indicated that the NBN would support up to 25,000 local jobs every year, on average, over the life of the project, with up to 37,000 jobs at the peak of the rollout.


NBN Co seeks local content and sourcing arrangements in its major contracts particularly where there is known local supply capacity or the potential to promote additional local production through NBN Co contracts.


Certain contracts are inherently local such as construction of the fibre network. NBN Co has awarded over $1.1 billion in construction contracts, including:


$300 million over four years to Visionstream Australia for the construction of the fibre network in Tasmania;


$19 million to Visionstream Australia to build the first stage on the transit network;


$141 million over two years to Syntheo for the construction of the fibre network in South Australia and the Northern Territory;


$133 million over two years to Transfield for the construction of the fibre network in Victoria;


$174 million over two years to Syntheo for the construction of the fibre network in Western Australia; and


$380 million over two years to Silcar for the construction of the fibre network in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.


The contract for construction in Tasmania is an example of where the NBN is not only expected to see the creation of 800 new jobs at the peak of the rollout, but it will also create a permanent workforce based in Tasmania to undertake ongoing maintenance and future upgrades.


NBN Co anticipates that between 250-300 Australian jobs will be generated by the rollout of the Long Term Satellite Service. This includes approximately 200-250 equivalent full-time positions (likely to be contractors) who will install satellite dishes and modems on the roofs and inside the homes of up to 200,000 homes and businesses across Australia from 2015.


In January 2011, NBN Co awarded three contracts worth over $1.6 billion to Australian located companies—Warren & Brown, Corning and Prysmian—to supply equipment for the NBN, including optical distribution frames, fibre optic cabling and other passive network equipment. As a direct result of being awarded an NBN contract:


Warren & Brown has advised they have so far employed an additional 40 people and anticipate another 20 will be added over the next 12 months;


Corning expects to create an additional 400 jobs at its Melbourne facility; and


50 direct new jobs were created in Prysmian’s Dee Why manufacturing facility and it is estimated that in addition to this, jobs will be created in transport, logistics, training, administration and other support roles.




Recommendation 15



The Committee recommends that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy publish, on an annual basis, a detailed statement outlining the direct and indirect employment benefits of the National Broadband Network (NBN) rollout, including in terms of local/regional employment and major areas of emerging NBN workforce demand.


The government broadly supports this recommendation.


The government established NBN Co to design, build and operate the NBN, a project that will create jobs in upstream industries as new applications are developed to utilise the network, as well as create new jobs in related sectors supplying to NBN Co and its


subcontractors in the construction, manufacturing, IT and telecommunications industries. The rollout of the NBN will also assist in developing new and wider workforce opportunities in regional areas in the sectors of health and education, and with the greater use of new online markets.


NBN Co projects that between 16,000 and 18,000 construction jobs alone will be created at the peak of the rollout. To ensure a suitably qualified and skilled workforce is available to support the rollout of the NBN, NBN Co has developed a workforce development strategy which recognizes the dispersed nature of the rollout, enabling NBN Co to leverage workers from both regional and metropolitan areas.


Other than the construction task, jobs will be created through direct NBN Co employment, through NBN Co’s purchase of inputs for the rollout and related companies, and industries gearing up to deliver applications and services over the NBN infrastructure and the flow-on effects to the businesses these firms interact with.


As at 30 June 2012, NBN Co had 1,674 employees, including contractors and labour hire.


The initial estimates prepared in April 2009 by the government on the local jobs that would be supported by the NBN relate to the broad economic impact of the government’s decision to invest in the NBN policy and include the jobs created in related sectors that have started gearing up to support or deliver services over the NBN.


NBN Co seeks local content and sourcing arrangements in its major contracts particularly where there is known local supply capacity or the potential to promote additional local production through NBN Co contracts. During 2011, NBN Co awarded a range of contracts with a total value of almost $4 billion, the majority of which was for Australian-based manufacturing and services, leading to direct new employment of approximately 700 to 1,000 new jobs.


On 20 December 2010, the government publicly released its Statement of Expectations to NBN Co. The document highlighted the government’s expectation that NBN Co will actively promote opportunities for small and medium enterprises to participate fully in this project in meaningful and continuing ways. To assist NBN Co, the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education funds an NBN National Sector Manager through the Supplier Access to Major Projects program to liaise with Industry Capability Network Consultants, suppliers, industry associations and NBN Co, to facilitate links between Australian companies and supply opportunities. The NBN National Sector Manager is working with NBN Co to identify Australian companies for tenders, verify tenders and substantiate capability statements from Australian companies including those from regional areas.


The government has also outlined the jobs benefits created by the NBN in its response to the Committee’s first report on the Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network and will provide future updates on an annual basis, including information about the progress of the Telstra Retraining Funding Deed.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-10-09,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (18:56):  I rise tonight to speak on the Digital Local Government program, and other government programs that form part of the National Digital Economy Strategy. We are moving into an increasingly interconnected future. It is a future whereby people expect to be able to conduct their business with governments when it is most convenient to them, whether this is from the comfort and convenience of their own home, while at work or on a mobile or tablet device. It is a future whereby we can harness new technologies to make the operations of government more efficient. It is a future whereby we save time and money by dealing with local government digitally.


The Australian government's $17.1 million Digital Local Government program provides funding to local governments in communities that are among the first to benefit from the National Broadband Network, or the NBN. The program encourages local government to develop online services that other local governments across Australia can adapt and use. Like the Digital Hubs program and the Digital Enterprise program, the Digital Local Government program is a key element of the National Digital Economy Strategy to realise the Australian government's vision for Australia to become a leading digital economy by 2020. It is assisting to deliver significant improvements in the quality, availability and speed of local government services. It will provide significant benefits to the members of these communities by improving the ways that they interact with their local government.


Tasmanian communities are at the forefront of the Digital Local Government program, as they are with the NBN itself, with 11 Tasmanian local governments having been announced as either being eligible for funding or having received funding under the Digital Local Government program. These local councils cover all parts of Tasmania: Circular Head, Sorell, Dorset, Glamorgan Spring Bay, George Town, Break O'Day, Launceston, Clarence, Kingborough, Meander Valley and Hobart. The projects are diverse and interesting, and highlight how different local councils can find solutions to meet their own needs.


For example, the Circular Head Council has been provided with project funding of $375,000 to transform its building and development application process using a web based videoconferencing platform. This should allow people to retain the face-to-face service they traditionally receive from council while at the same time avoid the need to travel to Smithton, which to a lot of people in the area is a fair distance to travel, to discuss their building and development plans.


Similarly, both the Glamorgan Spring Bay Council and the George Town Council have also each received project funding of $375,000 to develop online planning and development application services. This should streamline the development process, making it easier and cheaper for members of these communities to undertake the business they need to undertake with their local council by late 2012. The Sorell Council has received project funding of $292,000 to develop an online emergency management system using videoconferencing technology. This project will allow better coordination in emergency management situations for the community and may lead to a reduction in the loss of property and may also save lives. This service begins in late 2012.


It is a project that we can see has the ability to improve emergency management coordination across Australia, improving the safety of Australians during emergency events.


The Dorset Council has received project funding of $225,000, and the Council for the Break O'Day $373,000, to develop online platforms to facilitate enhanced community engagement, including planning and development application services. This will allow members of these communities to better participate in local government from late 2012 or early 2013.


The department is currently working with Kingborough Council to develop a project business case to deliver enhanced online engagement with the community, including ways of delivering interactive online training in topics such as food handling. This project will provide a unique way for council to deliver training services, and it will allow training to be delivered more flexibly and to occur at a time that is mutually suitable for the employer, employee and the council. It will result in lower costs for businesses in training, and the flexibility provided will allow greater productivity, as time taken off for training will be less. The Launceston City Council and the Clarence City Council are also eligible to apply for Digital Local Government program funding of up to $375,000, and the department is currently working with them to develop project business cases.


Another component in the National Digital Economy Strategy is the Digital Hubs program. Digital Hubs offers services to assist local residents to better understand how they benefit from the NBN and to improve their digital literacy skills. The training provided includes basic computer operations; performing everyday online activities; online safety and security, which, of course, is very important; connectivity options to the internet; and benefits of the NBN to households. I have seen the Midway Point digital hub in action, when the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety was invited to see its operations on 7 August.


The Midway Point digital hub, housed at the Pittwater community centre, provides a number of functions for the community of Sorell, Pittwater and Midway Point. Training services began in February 2012, and the digital hub has received $145,000 in funding under the Digital Hubs program. One of the services provided is a regular Tuesday afternoon computer class run by Mr Martin Holloway. Martin's class allows members of these communities to learn introductory computer skills in a friendly environment, including using email, the internet, Google and desktop publishing. Learning is conducted in a very hands-on manner at a speed which suits the individual student. When the committee visited, one of the participants in the class was over 90 years of age and about to buy her first computer—which just shows that you are never too old to get online.


The Midway Point digital hub is allowing hundreds of people who would otherwise have not gone online to take their first steps into the online world. The government is supporting digital hubs in a number of other Tasmanian communities as well. I had the opportunity last Wednesday to visit the digital hub under construction at Kingston Beach, near my electorate office, with the Minister for Broadband, Communications, and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy. Along with us came the Kingborough mayor, Dr Graham Bury.


The Kingborough council has signed a funding agreement to receive $338,000, with training services due to commence in late October or November 2012. The funding has already transformed the look of the back of the old Kingston Beach hall into a modern, flexible learning environment. High-speed wireless internet will be available throughout the hall, delivered to the hall via the NBN optic fibre that is installed throughout Kingston Beach. I look forward to visiting the facility again when classes begin in the next few weeks.


Since March 2012, members of the Scottsdale community have also benefited from a digital hub, with the Dorset Council receiving $345,000. The communities of George Town, Triabunna, St Helens and Smithton will soon also have the benefit of digital hubs, due to begin in October 2012, with the federal government providing funds of $394,000, $197,000 and $379,000 respectively. 


Through the Digital Enterprise program, services are being offered to assist small-to-medium enterprises and not-for-profit organisations to better understand how to take advantage of the NBN to improve the efficiency and reach of their operations.


The training provided for SMEs includes improving their online presence and marketing, increasing their competitiveness and internal efficiencies, and expanding their national and international markets. Training provided to NFPs includes how to deliver their services online, undertaking online fundraising and awareness activities, and achieving administrative efficiencies using online tools. In Tasmania, the NFPs and SMEs in the communities of Smithton, Midway Point and Scottsdale have received training services from 3p Consulting that started in February 2012. Training for NFPs and SMEs in St Helens, Deloraine and George Town has just begun, commencing in August 2012.


A large number of organisations in these communities have received this training, in either a group setting or on a one-to-one basis. They are using the training to leverage the power of the NBN to promote their unique enterprises and the unique parts of Tasmania that they originate from. Minister Conroy and I had the pleasure of visiting a small business last week, Wafu Works, located next to the Kingston Beach Digital hub. It is just one of many businesses across Tasmania already enjoying the benefits of having reliable, fast internet. Training has also just started being provided in Triabunna, through the Orford Triabunna Chamber of Commerce, and in Launceston, South Hobart and Kingborough, through Community Potential Foundation Ltd. 


The Gillard Labor government is acting to improve the way that local governments, individuals, and not-for-profits utilise the NBN. The Digital Local Government program is contributing to the Australian government's vision that Australia will become a leading global digital economy by 2020. In particular, the program contributes to the digital economy goal that, by 2020, four out of five Australians will choose to engage with government through online services.


The programs being funded are diverse and allow individual councils to find unique solutions to the issues they face in their own local government areas. They also allow these solutions, once trialled, to be adopted and adapted by councils across the country. The Digital Local Government program, the Digital Hubs program, and the Digital Enterprises program are helping local councils, individuals, and small-to-medium enterprises to maximise the benefits of the very important NBN.
