"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-08-31,"—Pursuant to notice given at the last day of sitting, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I now withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for today.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,0,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-08-31,"—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper. I move:
That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 28 August this year. ,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-08-31,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 1:
(1)	Page 2 (after line 2), after clause 3, insert:
4 Review of operation of Act
	(1)	If an order is given under section 51A, 51B or 51C, the Minister must cause a review of the effect of the order to be undertaken within 6 months after the order ceases to be in force.
	(2)	A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report of the review.
	(3)	The Minister must cause copies of the report of the review to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after receiving it.
This amendment is so that, if an order is given under this bill, there is a full and written review to report why the order was given, what it was for, how it was carried out and why it was needed. The points about our review, as opposed to others, are that it should be undertaken within six months of the order ceasing to have effect, the minister must receive the report and it must be tabled in each house within five sitting days of the minister receiving it.
I should make the point at the very beginning of this committee stage that this would be in addition to a sunset clause. We think the bill should not go through at all but, if it does, we think the sunset clause is absolutely essential and it is the absolute basis of the entire bill. We should have more debate on this and we should have been talking about this for a long time beforehand, but just in case the bill happens to go through—which I certainly hope it does not—firstly, we need a sunset clause and, secondly, we need an awful lot of other amendments. This is the first of the amendments that we are recommending. I really think it is an improvement on any other review amendment, so I commend it to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—For the record, the government will oppose this amendment. We believe there are sufficient proposals in this bill for review, and I refer to the parliamentary committee and the independent review which forms part of those proposals. So for those reasons, we will oppose the amendment put by the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I indicate through you, Mr Temporary Chairman Watson, to Senator Bourne that the opposition certainly accepts the view that she has expressed to the chamber that the question of review is a fundamental one and one worthy of this committee deliberating on at some length. I indicate that the approach of the opposition will be to commend the next amendment that this committee will deal with in relation to reviewing the operation of the act.
Simply put—and I do not want to delay the committee too long here—while we accept obviously that this is an essential matter for amendment, I will be proposing very soon an amendment that I think is a better option for this committee, and a significantly better option at that. When presenting that to the committee, I will speak at greater length. Given that the opposition will oppose this Democrat amendment, I did want to put that in some context—namely, that the opposition will put forward what is I think a more thorough, more effective and more useful review process. It is in that context, but in that context only, that the opposition will not be supporting this particular amendment that is proposed by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Democrats and that we will be putting forward our own proposal in short order.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—My view on this matter on behalf of the Greens is that we ought never be in a position where we are asking for a review after the deployment of the Australian defence forces in a domestic situation in which parliament has had no say. This legislation enables the ministers of the day—that is, politicians here in Canberra—to bring out the Australian defence forces for a situation where they think and they have the pretext in their mind, whatever it might be that enables them to think, that there is likely to be violence. Let us make it clear that this covers such events as the Olympics and the upcoming World Economic Forum, where there has been speculation in the media and abroad about potential violence in both cases and where it would be quite within the purview of this legislation for Canberra to send in the troops. 
I would like to know from the government at the outset to what degree the Australian defence forces are being deployed for either of those events at the moment. I noted on the news last night that soldiers are being used for surveillance at the Olympic site for the purpose of making sure that the site is safe. I would like to know under what conditions the soldiers are being used there and whether the previous stipulation which was in place—a specific directive to the defence forces that they were not to be training for a potential situation in which they could be used against Australian civilians—is still in place or whether it has been lifted.
I refer the chamber to a question by Mr Cameron in the House in 1993 of the then Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, about the use of the Manual of Land Warfare produced by the department, which is effectively pamphlet No. 2 `Aid to civil power', for the use of the defence forces were they to be involved in a civil situation in Australia. Mr Beazley said, as part of that answer, `I reiterate that there is a specific directive which prohibits this type of training.' I ask the minister: is that directive still in place? If it is not, what sort of training has been taking place for the use of the Australian defence forces against civilians, under what circumstances and when did that change take place? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I understand that the directive is that the ADF does not train for the sort of activity as outlined by Senator Brown—that is, in relation to domestic situations. However, there is training in relation to peacekeeping. That is something which is quite distinct, and we have seen that in places like East Timor. But there is no training as such for the domestic situations that Senator Brown has outlined.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,—Could the minister foresee the use of the Australian defence forces during the Olympics?,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—Yes, there is a memorandum of understanding between the Australian defence forces and the New South Wales police for activities which would be low level and non call-out. That is something which is not the subject of what we envisage here, which would be a call-out situation. That is set out in the memorandum of understanding between the New South Wales police and the Australian defence forces.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—Is the government in any way contemplating a call-out? Are there circumstances in which a call-out would come or is the minister giving the chamber an explicit commitment that there will be no call-out in the Olympics, regardless of circumstances?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,—The national antiterrorist plan does envisage the possibility of a call-out. It is not something I can predict or not predict. I do not have a crystal ball. What I can say is that the national antiterrorist plan does have a provision for that possibility. Senator Brown asked whether I foresee it happening or whether the government contemplates it happening. We would think the need would not be there and hopefully the games will go ahead incident free. But the national antiterrorist plan does have a provision for the possibility of a call-out.,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—The Victorian government has pointed out that there is no point in having this bill implemented prior to the Olympics if the supporting protocols are not in place, and it points out that there are no supporting protocols. I ask the minister, seeing that he has flagged the potential for the use of the defence forces in a terrorist situation in the Olympics: where are the protocols that would enable this legislation to be used? When did the discussions take place with the states that would allow the provisions of this legislation to be used? Or is the minister saying that this legislation is incidental and is not to be drawn upon as far as the Olympics are concerned, that any use of the ADF during the Olympics would be a use that would be contemplated under the existing legislation? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—Dealing with the second part of Senator Brown's question first, there is currently a situation where the Commonwealth could call out the Australian defence forces. This bill is setting out to clarify the circumstances and also to bring consistency to the various sorts of call-outs you can get. Yes, this bill does affect any potential call-out, whether that be during the Olympics or not. The first part of Senator Brown's question touched on the point of protocols. The national antiterrorist plan, which the states and the Commonwealth subscribe to, does have provisions which would deal with the situations that Senator Brown has mentioned, and we feel that would be sufficient. Protocols are really not essential because the national antiterrorist plan caters adequately for any situation that might arise. Should this bill be passed, there may well be some slight amendments to the national antiterrorist plan. We would say that those protocols are not necessary. Any potential situation is covered by the provisions of the national antiterrorist plan.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—The government cannot have it both ways. The government is saying on the one hand that any situation is covered by the existing situation. On the other hand, if there is a call-out during the Olympics or some other event, such as the World Economic Forum or some future event that has not come to mind yet, then the provisions of this legislation will be invoked. I want to read from the submission by the Victorian government to the Senate committee, which said:
If the bill passes through parliament, the existing SAC-PAV NATP protocols already in place—
the ones that the minister referred to—
to support the Defence Act must be updated to take into account the new call-out framework proposed by the bill. Such protocols should be developed prior to the bill taking effect.
That is a reasonable point, one would submit. The submission continued:
So that all relevant parties are clear about the roles in the event of an emergency. If the bill takes effect prior to the protocols being revised, there is a risk of conflict between the legislation and the existing protocols. Potentially conflicting and confusing guidelines are not going to be an asset in an emergency situation. There is no point in having this bill implemented prior to the Olympics if the supporting protocols are not in place.
Indeed, the New South Wales government's submission flagged the unthinkable situation where the police would be on one side and the ADF on the other side, with no clear guidelines drawn up to deal with that situation. I ask the minister: where are the protocols that will be used under this legislation? Have they been drawn up? If so, will he present them to the committee?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—For a start, I think that letter was written by the Premier of Victoria in circumstances where Victoria was of a view that there would not be any consultation with the states. In relation to this bill, there are some amendments forthcoming which will deal with consultation, and they will adequately address those concerns. So we have moved on since that letter from the Premier of Victoria.
In any event, this bill sets out to reflect the national antiterrorist plan. It is entirely appropriate that any plan of that sort is covered by legislation which is transparent, succinct and consistent. That is what we are doing because the current system needs that clarification. We would argue that this legislation, if for nothing else, is needed for that purpose. The question of protocols has already been covered by my previous answer in relation to the national antiterrorist plan—the provisions are there.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—So the minister is telling the committee that there are no new protocols, that there has been no work on new protocols and that there is no work the government or its agencies have done on the guidelines for the use of the ADF, consequent upon this bill. We simply have the legislation and a totally old set of protocols that do not cover the range of possibilities envisaged by this legislation. Nothing new has been done in terms of guidelines, manuals, protocols and instructions for the use of the ADF under this legislation. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I answered that question about manuals in question time the other day when Senator Brown asked that. If this bill goes through, there will have to be a revision of various manuals. The one that Senator Brown cited in particular I said would have to be revised. There is work already being done on revising the national antiterrorist plan to meet the requirements of this bill, should it be passed. As I said previously this morning to Senator Brown, should this bill be passed there will be necessary revisions, albeit slight, to the national antiterrorist plan. So that is quite clear—there will be revisions to the national antiterrorist plan as a result of passing this bill. I think that squarely meets Senator Brown's question.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—My comments are on the same matter that Senator Brown is pursuing. I think the minister would acknowledge that some of the concerns that state governments have had are in fact that the national antiterrorist plan will remain in place. I think you would acknowledge, Minister, that that has been a concern. I think the committee has heard what you have said. Perhaps, more importantly, there is concern that the passage of this particular piece of legislation will not interfere in the operations of the national antiterrorist plan. It might assist the committee perhaps to receive some assurance from you on these matters. It may assist the line of questioning that Senator Brown is engaging in if you could give the committee some assurances in relation to that.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I can place on record the government's assurance that the passing of this bill will not interfere with the operation of the national antiterrorist plan. In fact, I see the two as being complementary.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I thank the minister for that assurance. There was a second element to the question that I asked, following up Senator Brown's line of questioning. It would be an assurance to hear that the bill in no way would interfere with the operations of the national antiterrorist plan—I think that is an important assurance to give the committee, too.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,—Yes. I can also give that assurance on behalf of the government: it will in no way interfere with the operation of the national antiterrorist plan. I think that meets Senator Faulkner's question.,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I would like to follow on from what Senator Faulkner and Senator Brown have been saying. I think what has us concerned is that, if in fact an incident did occur, people would be at risk. Military personnel and the terrorists who are carrying out the exercise would be there. But other people at risk in a city like Sydney would be the citizens—the adults and children—that might be in the area. I think the concern is that we as a parliament ought to have some criteria we can look at, so we can say that the action in this case was such as preserved the safety of the people who might be around, including that of the soldiers.
That is a very difficult thing, because the sorts of actions that the soldiers might use may well be much more restrained than the sort of actions that terrorists use. Minister, having appeared many a time in a criminal case as an advocate—of course—and as an outstanding advocate in Western Australia, may I say, you would understand the point I am making. The sort of action that the police or the troops might use has to be much more restrained than that which the terrorists might use. This is the whole problem about policing: because you want to have a civilised society, you have to act in a particular way. What is being asked is this: what criteria can be made public so that people can say, `Yes, these are the sorts of things that apply,' to assure us that the troops will act in the way that we would like? That is distinct from the battle plan, or whatever you want to call it, that you might have. 
—It is a very tense century! 
—Yes, that is right. I do not think the plan to overcome terrorism is what is being sought, but rather what criteria can we look at so that we can be assured that things will be safe for citizens.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I am advised that the MLW—which, to the uninitiated like me, is the Manual of Land Warfare—covers a good portion of what Senator Cooney is addressing, and is much like the police standing orders which police forces around the country have. There are, however, some security aspects which are operational and are not public, of course—and that is understandable. But the MLW would, as I understand it, meet what Senator Cooney is talking about. It is quite a comprehensive document, I understand. But there are aspects to security operations which are not made public—again, for obvious reasons. Capability of response and types of responses—the sorts of things that I saw at the SAS barracks on my visit the other day—are things that you would not make public because, obviously, any potential terrorist would then know what to cater for in a situation. That, I think, covers Senator Cooney's question.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—Let me follow through on what Senator Cooney has been asking, because it is a very important issue, as you would appreciate. Perhaps I can encapsulate this, and I hope this assists Senator Cooney. I think what Senator Cooney is asking, Minister, is whether in the event of a call-out the ADF would operate under the doctrines of the Manual of Land Warfare or whether there would be new doctrines established, as a result of the passage of this legislation, to apply in the event of a call-out. I see some of my colleagues in the chamber nodding their heads. I am trying to encapsulate this, but I think that is a key point on which the committee would like to hear from the minister. That is it, Barney, isn't it?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—I would like to assist the chamber here by saying that the Manual of Land Warfare that the minister refers to has only a cursory reference to what would happen if there were a civil disturbance. It does not cover the field at all. The minister has hinted at some other form of regulation, and I think that is really what Senator Cooney is wanting to know about. You see, what we have here is a piece of legislation that is not antiterrorist; that is part of it. If it were antiterrorist, I would not be nearly so concerned about this, but it opens up the whole field to the use of the ADF in circumstances where civilians are not just indirectly but maybe directly involved in a protest situation, for example. We are trying to find out here what the operative guidelines are in those circumstances. The Manual of Land Warfare certainly is not an operative guideline and does not deal with that in any detail at all.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I think both Senator Faulkner's and Senator Brown's points do have relevance to each other. Perhaps I can put it this way: the Manual of Land Warfare of course would have to be reviewed after the passage of this bill, as I have mentioned earlier. Furthermore, there are training notes supplementary to that manual. So it is not just the manual itself; there are supplementary training notes to it. I would draw that to Senator Brown's attention.
In relation to the points that Senator Faulkner raised, I think we have to remember, as the very basis, that any member of the Australian Defence Force would be subject to the law as it applies in that state or territory, and there is no escaping from that. So the Manual of Land Warfare would not necessarily give that person exemption from any of the laws of the land. For example, a member of the Australian Defence Force would not be exempted from the provisions relating to murder or assault. Those criminal provisions would still apply to that member of the ADF as much as to any other citizen in that jurisdiction. That is the starting point. The law applies to any member of the ADF in the call-out situation as it does to any other citizen. What you have, of course, with the MLW is a manual which deals with how they go about their business in that call-out. But it is not a manual which overrides in any way the law which applies in that jurisdiction. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—Minister, I think behind the questions is a knowledge by the Senate that, really, any manual on standing orders or procedures needs to be broken up into its different uses in situations of different intent. Typically, if I may deal with the first and most obvious, a manual of land warfare would have to deal with a situation where Australia was at war and either conducting a war on foreign ground or defending a situation on its own ground. Secondly, it would need to deal with a situation of civil war. Thirdly, it would need to deal with your being required to act, generally speaking, in a foreign situation in pursuit of a particular objective. That might be a situation such as the East Timor objective, which is not a situation of war, but it is obviously a situation of great danger at times. Lastly, and I would think very far back in the military's mind—I would not think of it as being something that the military contemplates as being an expected occurrence—would be the situation that this bill deals with: troops being called out to deal with a domestic incident of some sort, perhaps provoked by terrorism.
I have not read the MLW; I have just gone through a set of logical characterisations which seems apparent to me. I think it is not just a matter of the committee asking that that manual be reviewed to reflect the intentions of the bill but also that that manual would need to very much reflect the very different circumstances of troops being involved, to use Senator Cooney's example, in Sydney during a terrorism incident. It is the specific development of standing orders to deal with a domestic situation, particularly an urban situation, in Australia which any manual of standing orders would need to deal with. That is an explanation I would seek, because I assume that the Manual of Land Warfare, in fact, covers the other range of activities that I have outlined and would be deficient in the area of domestic incidents.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—Just to follow on from Senator Murray: I was wrong a while ago when I said that the Manual of Land Warfare does not cover the civil situation. I had the manuals mixed. It does, in fact, and it is still in place. What would happen if the Australian defence forces were to confront a crowd of Australian people who are protesting? Let me quote from the Manual of Land Warfare, the pamphlet on the `Aid to Civil Power':
Use of Force
537.	The intention of the military commander to use force must be communicated to the crowd. Communication can be achieved by the use of a loud hailer or banners giving a first and second warning as follows:
(a)  First Warning. `DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY OR WE WILL USE FORCE.'
(b)  Second Warning. `DISPERSE IMMED-IAT-ELY OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE.'
538.	A possible sequence of events in dispersal of a crowd is shown in Table 1.
At paragraph 539, suddenly the terminology applying to the crowd changes. It is now headed `Firing on a mob'. It states:
539.	Firing on a Mob. Before opening fire to disperse a crowd, the commander must be sure that his decision to open fire is his only viable option. To that end, after the crowd has been warned, all actions performed by the troops in preparation to fire must be obvious to the mob. The `LOAD' and `ACTION' orders may serve to convey the import of the troops' action to the crowd and encourage its dispersal, thereby avoiding the necessity to open fire.
540. 	Opening Fire. Fire must be controlled and directed only at specific individuals by a responsible officer. For example, an order may be ...
and then there is the order:
`NUMBER ONE SECTION, ADOPT THE KNEELING POSITION; LOAD; MAN IN BLUE SHIRT WAVING AXE, AIM; NUMBER THREE RIFLEMAN, ACTION, INSTANT, ONE ROUND, FIRE!'
541.	The Point of Aim. The nominated rifleman, on receiving a fire order, shall aim in such a way as to disable the person. Because of the many variable conditions and factors involved, the requirement to disable and avoid causing injury to innocent bystanders is met by aiming for the centre of the target, that is, the visible mass. The nominated rifleman should, therefore, aim for the centre of the mass, except where he is sure of accomplishing his intent by aiming to hit an extremity such as a foot, shoulder or arm, without endangering any other person.
Then it goes on to explain how a subunit can open fire without that sequence of orders, if they are in fear of being overrun. 
I ask the minister: is this in compliance with the state laws? Remember that these troops are at a distance beyond projectiles, so the person wielding the axe, for example, cannot get to the troops in that situation. There are police and other members of the crowd in the immediate field. But here we have an instruction to kill somebody in a crowd of Australians who are demonstrating but who presumably have not committed a serious injury. I just wonder how the minister can maintain that this is a lawful action and that a soldier given these instructions is within the laws of New South Wales, Tasmania or wherever the state may be.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—Thank you, Senator Brown, that was very helpful. With the permission of the chair and the minister, I would like to assist briefly. I have familiarity with high velocity weapons. A disabling shot to the central body with a modern weapon will kill, and that bullet will pass through the individual. Therefore, in situations of crowd control you cannot with a high velocity weapon take out one person and guarantee that that person alone will be hit, because the bullet will go through. The proposed section read did not indicate an awareness of that consequence.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—Can I reiterate that the manual that Senator Brown is referring to is reflected in part 5 of the Australian Military Regulations 1927, which is headed `Duties in Aid of the Civil Power During Domestic Violence'. We have said on previous occasions that these regulations are antiquated and that they need clarification and revision. In fact, I am advised that these regulations will be repealed on the passing of this bill. I think that might have been a concern for the opposition. What we would have to do is redraft the provisions that Senator Brown is talking about to reflect the passing of this bill.
Can I also say that the member of the ADF would still have to carry out that guideline in accordance with the law, so all your provisions relating to self-defence would apply. That member of the ADF would be subject to those just as any other citizen is. So, if they were going to use force, it would have to be in accordance with the law, and we know what those provisions are. In the various states and territories, it would be under the Commonwealth Criminal Code or under common law and the provisions relating to self-defence or relating to an emergency where someone else's life is threatened. All the provisions which apply to all Australian citizens would apply to the members of the ADF. But I do stress that this manual reflects the regulations, which we say are outdated and which will be repealed and replaced with new ones on the passing of this bill.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I thank the minister for that information and hear what he says about part 5 of the Australian Military Regulations, which is of course `Duties in Aid of the Civil Power During Domestic Violence'. As I understand what the minister has told us, the plan is to repeal part 5 of the AMR and to replace it with new regulations. I think that is the indication that you have made to the committee, Minister. For the benefit of the committee, can you indicate the status of any new Australian military regulations and whether they are instruments disallowable in the Senate?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I understand that, just as other regulations are disallowable, so are these.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-08-31,"—In rising to contribute to the debate in the committee, I would like to place on the record One Nation's total opposition to the bill. In speaking to the point that has been raised by Senators Faulkner, Brown and Murray, I would like to go to proposed section 51T(3). That portion of the bill refers to the use of `reasonable and necessary' force. Clause 51T(3) states:
In addition, if a person is attempting to escape being detained by fleeing, a member of the Defence Force must not do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the person has, if practicable, been called on to surrender—
so this raises Senator Brown's earlier point— 
and the member believes on reasonable grounds that the person cannot be apprehended in any other manner.
The bill itself is wide open to an instance where the ADF will be able to use lethal force. The bill itself does not even state that that person has to be in any danger themselves. The ADF member does not have to substantiate that they were in imminent danger; all they have to be able to do is on reasonable grounds say that they could not apprehend the person in any other manner. If we go to the definitions in the front of the bill, the person that it is the intent to apprehend will be apprehended because they have one of the following things: a gun, a knife, a bomb or chemical weapons. I do not have any great problem at all with this applying to anyone who is threatening an ADF member with a gun, a knife—unless there is some reasonable doubt as to whether they should use lethal force—a bomb or a chemical weapon. But the definition itself also refers to `any other thing that is reasonably likely to be used to cause serious damage'. So the bill itself is so totally wide open that almost anything could be substantiated. A picket off a fence or anything like that used as a weapon could be substantiated as reason to use lethal force. For the purpose of the committee, can the minister convey how he sees that a member of the ADF will be required to prove on reasonable grounds that they believe there is no other manner of apprehending the person?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—In relation to clause 51T of the bill, I point out to Senator Harris that subclause (2) has to be read with subclause (3). Subclause (3) begins with the words `in addition', and that means `in addition to the provisions in subclause (2)'. In subclause (2), there is the requirement that a member of the ADF, in exercising that force, must not:
... do anything that is likely to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the person unless the member believes on reasonable grounds that doing that thing is necessary to protect the life of, or to prevent serious injury to, another person (including the member); or
subject the person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances.
In subclause (2)(a) there is a restatement of the law as it exists across Australia in relation to self-defence, the protection of life, and also in relation to the protection of the life of another person or protection against injury to another person. Subclause (3) is in addition to that. You cannot read subclause (3) in isolation. Subclause (3) has been included because there may be a hostage situation where the person who is fleeing is fleeing to execute hostages. Subclause (3) is to incorporate any possible situation that might arise. Remember that we are dealing with very serious circumstances. Look back to the Munich Games and the hostage situation with the Israeli athletes—that is a classic circumstance where this provision might apply. But it must be read with subclause (2), which has that onus on the member of the ADF. Subclauses (2) and (3) must be read together, and we do not believe that gives a member of the ADF any increased licence to break the law.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—Minister Ellison has said that the new rules which are going to govern the use of the ADF in civil situations, if this legislation passes, will be a disallowable instrument. Until that instrument has been allowed or disallowed, he is indicating that the current manual is in place. I ask the minister: are the new set of rules to be brought before the parliament in the next week? If not, is it not quite clearly the case that the current Manual of Land Warfare `Aid to Civil Power' is the instrument that will be in place to guide the potential use of the ADF in the coming months during the Olympics and the World Economic Forum period?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-08-31,"—In addition to Senator Brown's comments, I turn to clause 51T of the bill. I have discussed this with Mr Dabb. It is always a great pleasure to discuss things with Mr Geoffrey Dabb—and with Mr McDougall, for that matter, but Mr McDougall is much younger and not yet as wise as Mr Dabb.
—Shows enormous promise.
—Yes. To look at subclauses (2) and (3), we have discussed the words `in addition'. Minister Ellison says that subclause (3) has to be taken with subclause (2), but I am not sure how it can be. Clause 51T talks about the `use of reasonable and necessary force'. Subclause (1) says that a member of the ADF may use such force against persons. Subclause (2) says that, in circumstances where you want to prevent serious injury to another person or to protect the life of another person, you can take certain action—that is, you can cause death or grievous bodily harm. That is where you have somebody who is going to cause serious injury to another person—for example, you are a soldier and you see that Senator Crowley is going to cause serious injury to Mr Evans, so you take action against Senator Crowley. That is a situation where she is causing serious injury to someone. Subclause (3) does not contemplate that at all. Subclause (3) is aimed at stopping somebody from escaping. There is nothing in subclause (3) that suggests that the person, while escaping, should be causing bodily harm to anybody else. In most cases where they are escaping, they are running away—of course, they might be shooting as they are running away. But, in spite of the words `in addition', subclause (3) seems to contemplate something quite different from subclause (2). I do not want to cast any aspersions on the Office of Legislative Drafting—I would never do that—but I am not sure that the words `in addition' do carry this into a situation where subclauses (2) and (3) are taken together. They seem to be quite separate situations—unless you say that you can take this action only when the person escaping is likely to cause injury to somebody else, but that does not quite make sense. 
 (Senator Crowley)—The chair is pleased to assist Senator Cooney but is not keen on being an exemplar of the unkindest behaviour.
—I offer a great apology to a person whom I have known all my adult life as a person of the kindest and most glorious disposition.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—For the record, it is clearly the intention of this legislation that subsection (3) be in addition to subsection (2). The factual situation that might be relied on is somewhat complex. I will put it this way: if, in a terrorist situation, the authorities had them at bay and one of the terrorists tried to escape to get to a position—say, up a parapet—to fire down on the crowd, that person could be termed as escaping to get to a different situation in order to inflict more harm. In the Munich situation, one of the terrorists ran away from the police to throw a grenade into a helicopter to kill the athletes who were inside it. In that situation a person was escaping from the police to do some harm. It is a situation that could be envisaged here: a terrorist could be escaping to get to another position to fire back from. The ADF member is in a situation where there is a threat and where the provisions of (2) are being met. On the face of it, one might say that the person is running away and that there is no more threat, but they are running away to another position to increase the threat, and that is what is being envisaged here. For the record, the intention is clearly that (3) be read in addition to (2).",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The only problem with that proposition, Minister, is that, if the situation is covered by (2) in any event, why have we got (3)? If a person is about to injure somebody else, whether he or she is escaping or is not escaping but is simply there trying to cause danger, (2) covers it in any event. Why do you want the additional (3)? Subsection (2) states that an ADF member can shoot if he or she thinks that the person being shot at will cause serious injury to another person. Subsection (3) does not really add anything to that because, whether the person is fleeing or whether they are taking up a stationary position, that person—the criminal, if you like—is still going to inflict serious injury on another. The fact of escaping is quite irrelevant to that. So, the only additional thing in (3) is the escaping. If you were charging a jury, you would say that (2) really covers the whole situation and the only additional thing about (3) is that the person is escaping.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—There is an aspect I would like to raise. Firstly, to take the scenario I mentioned earlier, it could be said to the member of the ADF, `Why did you fire? That person was running away.' Subsection (3) covers that situa-tion squarely. If you did not have (3), that could be raised under (2) and it could be said, `That person was escaping and you shouldn't have fired.' Then they would say, `I fired because that person was going away to do more damage.' Then it could be said, `It did not look as though that was the case. Where were the reasonable grounds for think-ing that?' What (3) does is bring it into focus and squarely give that person the legiti-mate coverage. It adds another dimension. It has the requirement that the person is being called on to surrender.  
It says that the member of the ADF cannot act in the manner described unless, if practicable, the person has been called on to surrender and that the member believes that the person escaping cannot be apprehended in any other manner. It provides also protection for the individual in the exercise of this power because, if you have a practical call to surrender and there is no other means to stop the person, it allows the ADF to act in circumstances where an escape is not really to run away but to run away and do some harm.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—Senator Cooney is pointing out the real core of the problem we have with this legislation. It is not anti-terrorist legislation; it is not confined to terrorism. It is legislation that is available to be used in a whole range of situations where the Prime Minister or the minister for defence of the day thinks there might be domestic violence, that is, in crowd control against Australian citizens. So, the list of instructions which might apply to a terrorist situation—like the Munich situation that the minister gave as an example—apply to crowd control situations in Australia without any further specific direction. It does not say that a person escaping can be shot if they are about to throw a grenade which will kill people. It just says a person can be shot if they are escaping.
I think that leaves the defence forces vulnerable, and it certainly seems to be a licence which ought not to be there when you are controlling domestic violence within Australia. The problem with this legislation is that it is aimed at terrorism but has been extended to a whole range of unspecified domestic situations in which it becomes terrifying. If the government wanted to have the ADF on hand to deal with domestic situations which do not involve foreign terrorists, the legislation should specifically deal with that. We should have a separate piece of legislation dealing with terrorism, but we do not. They are all bundled in together. That is the whole problem with this legislation. It is treating, in certain circumstances, an Australian crowd as a terrorist phenomenon. It is not, it never will be and it never has been. It gives the defence forces powers beyond those of the state police forces, and it does not specify them.
A really important question is: does the Manual of Land Warfare or whatever replaces it have the power of law? Would a soldier who fired on and killed an Australian citizen, under the rules as outlined in that manual, be able to use that as a defence in the court? I do not think they would. No wonder the states have said that it is unsatisfactory to bring this legislation before the parliament without consulting them. We have a century of developing laws under which the police are used in domestic violence situations, and the laws are honed very finely for that. They have always been upgraded to meet the situation of a civilian emergency or crisis. That is not the situation with this legislation.
The ADF has never been used in armed confrontation with Australian citizens, but suddenly it is going to be used without that whole history which allows the laws to be very explicit as to what soldiers can or cannot do. The police know what they can or cannot do. I submit to you, Minister, through the chair, that this leaves not only citizens vulnerable but also members of the ADF vulnerable. This manual is not a legal document. It exposes members of the armed services to court action which will make them very vulnerable indeed—and so they should be. The alternative is to say to soldiers who are brought into a civil conflict in Australia, `You have to know what the law is in the Northern Territory, Western Australia or Tasmania, wherever it might be. You have to do a crash course. You have to be up to speed, as police officers are.' That is unreal. That is not going to happen. The government is exposing not only Australians but also the Australian defence forces to a legally indefensible situation through this legislation.  
The minister did not answer my previous question, so I will ask him to do so. The Manual of Land Warfare currently guides the ADF on what to do in a confrontation in Australia. The minister says it will be replaced in the wake of this legislation with a new instrument which is disallowable. I ask the minister: will that instrument be brought before the parliament in the next week? If it will not, that means the Manual of Land Warfare which we have here is the guiding document as far as the armed services are con-cerned until some time after the Olympics. We are told that this is for the Olympics and for other events that might occur in the next couple of months, but we are not seeing the rules and regulations that come with this legislation. It seems to be a very profound shortcoming here.
I ask the minister: will he bring to the com-mittee the new guidelines? I do not believe that they do not exist. I think they are there. I think they are ready to be put in place. If they are not, they should be because we should not have legislation before the parlia-ment when its implementation depends on a set of regulations which are not available. The states have complained about that. The Senate should not allow the situation to occur where we have the legislation but we do not have the all-important regulations. We should be discussing the two together. Unless the minister can say otherwise, we are left with the real situation that this Manual of land warfare is going to be the de facto document—the set of standing rules—should the ADF be used in the coming months.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—For a start, the manual is not a disallowable instrument and the manual can be revised as soon as this bill is passed. The manual reflects the regulations, which I have mentioned, and they will be replaced. From an operational point of view, on the passing of this bill the new provisions can be put into effect almost immediately. The manual is not the disallowable instrument. As I mentioned earlier to Senator Faulkner in relation to his query, it is the regulations that are disallowable. The regulations will be brought in as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,—I understand that the manual is actually under revision at this moment. The revision has not yet been completed.,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—I do not believe that. We were told that a new manual would be ready to be brought in as soon as this legislation was through. That will be tonight. What the minister is saying is that there is a manual there that we cannot see because it is not finished, but it will be ready in the morning. I do not accept that situation. I think a lot of work has been done on that manual. I think we are being foxed, and that is not good enough. I believe there is a lot of secrecy being indulged in here. The parliament needs to know what it is dealing with.
The minister says that this manual comes from the 1920s. It is dated 1983. It is the current manual in place. It will not be in place with the passage of this legislation. I want to see the new manual. That is commonsense. I do not accept that somebody is still changing the rules and does not have a manual in place that would be the one we would be dealing with if the government's legislation, as it stands, gets through. I am satisfied that there may be some changes if there are amendments made in the Senate. But I believe that manual is there. I believe it has been drawn up to meet the provisions of the legislation as it stands and that the Senate should see it.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I said that the revision of the manual will be completed on the passing of this bill because, naturally, we have to see in what form this bill will be passed. I am assuming that it will be, but the fact remains that there are some other amendments coming from the opposition. 
—Very good ones, too.
—We are agreeing to those amendments. As I understand it, we have had some consultation with the opposition on these matters. But I just want to say that the manual is under revision. That revision cannot be completed until this bill is passed so that we know exactly what we are dealing with. We are revising the manual at this moment.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-08-31,"—I would like to go back to an issue that Senator Brown raised briefly earlier. He referred to a hypothetical event where in one area we have the state police and, if we then have the situation where the ADF has been called out, we have the ADF in another area. The minister earlier on said that Defence Force personnel are going to be submitted to the same laws as the police or any other citizen in the state. How does the minister reconcile that with section 51F subsection (2), which states:
Subsection (1) does not require or permit the Chief of the Defence Force to transfer to any extent command of the Defence Force to the State or the Territory, or to a police force or member of the police force of the State or the Territory.
So we have a situation where there is an in-cident and there are police and Army personnel involved. The bill itself specifically says that the troops are under the control of the Chief of the Defence Force. Is there any con-flict then between the rules or the laws that they would be subjected to under the pro-vision that they are being directed by the Chief of the Defence Force and the minister's statement that they will be subject to the laws of the state in the same way as any other citizen?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—The advice I have is that this reflects the constitutional provision of the states not being able to raise a military or paramilitary force themselves. You have this provision so that the Chief of the Defence Force is in command, because the Constitution says that if there is any military force the Commonwealth should be in charge of that. That does not mean, however, that the state or territory police—whoever it is—would not be in control of the situation. This merely covers that constitutional provision, citing that if you have a parliament paramilitary situation the Chief of the Defence Force should be in command. That is a constitutional provision.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-08-31,"—The minister is clarifying a section on defence. My question went specifically to the legal situation that a member of the Defence Force finds themselves in where the government's bill clearly articulates that the Chief of the Defence Force is not even permitted to transfer the control of that force to anyone else. The minister clearly said before that those defence personnel would be subject to the laws of the state. Is there any conflict between the position of ADF personnel being members of the armed forces—in other words, they have rights and responsibilities as members of the ADF—and your statement where you said that they would be subject to the laws of the state?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—Not at all. In relation to that, it is very clear. You cannot have a police superintendent commanding members of the ADF, and the fact that we have this provision in no way means that members of the ADF are above or in any way not subject to the laws applying to that state or territory. So I can assure Senator Harris in that respect that there is no conflict whatsoever.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-08-31,"—I would just like to go back to Senator Cooney's reference to section 51T where he was speaking of the structure and drafting of the bill. As the minister has indicated, if we look at subsection (2) of section 51T between parts (a) and (b), we find the word `or'—this is in continuation of Senator Cooney's point—so there is a linkage between those two parts of the bill. There is no such linkage at the conclusion of part (b) and subsection (3). If it is the government's intention that these be linked, I would suggest removing the full stop after `circumstances', putting in a semicolon and inserting the word `and'. The bill would then read: `subject the person to greater indignity than is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances; and in addition” That would provide the linkage. Would the minister also give us an indication of what is inferred by the word `indignity'? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I want to assure Senator Harris that the words `in addition' in subsection (3) are exactly that—it is in addition to subsection (2). As I re-iterated in response to this point when it was raised by Senator Cooney, I do not think I can take it any further. It is clearly the intention that this is in addition to the other subsection.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-08-31,"—It is normal drafting procedure that if there are to be linkages between sections of a bill that is clearly indicated. What I am saying to the government is there is no linkage between those two sections. If it is the government's intention to have the linkage, put the word `and' after the completion of (b). It is very simple. It is a simple amendment. Then there is clarity, there is absolutely no way that that could be misunderstood. The second part of that question that I put to the minister was: would the minister indicate to the committee what is the definition of the word `indignity' when it is used in (b)?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—Firstly, we just apply the ordinary meaning to `indignity'. I really do not think I can take it any further. If we included `and' in this it would, we believe, add no value and make the drafting even messier. I think it is quite clear as it is, and I have expressed the intention of the government.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—I come back to my previous point. The minister has said that the Manual of Land Warfare is the current operative manual but that it will be replaced by a revised edition with the passage of this legislation. I have asked the minister to present the committee with the edition revised to take into account the government's legislation, because that exists. If it does not, the minister can say so, but I tell you, Madam Chairman, that that exists. What the minister is saying is that he will have to change it to accord with the Labor amendments—which we now hear are going to be accepted by the government—so he cannot give us the final manual. What I am asking the minister—and I am going to get an answer on this, one way or another—is: will that manual be presented to the Senate before we rise for the Olympics?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I cannot give that undertaking, because we just do not know when this bill will be passed and in what form. I can say again—and I do not think I can take it any further—that this manual is under revision. It is a working document. It has not been finalised. I think that makes it very clear. Perhaps we can move on to some other areas and make some progress.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—The minister might hope! What we have here is a cover-up. We are being told by the government that they want this legislation through for the Olympics, and they have a manual which is going to replace the current instruction manual for soldiers who are deployed in a terrorist situation or in a situation against Australian protesters or strikers—forever and a day. The government are saying they have got the rules that apply to the new legislation but they are not going to show the Senate and they are not going to tell the Australian public. I reiterate: if this was an antiterrorist bill I would have sympathy with secret instructions about the operations at ground level—that is sensible—but the government has opened this right up. This is now legislation where the Australian defence forces can be deployed against Australian civilians who are protesting or striking, in any situation in which a minister named in the bill takes it into his head with colleagues that there could be domestic violence further down the line. What is more, the ADF in those circumstances can be deployed without the consent of a state or territory government. This is a massive change to a century of practice in this country.
I want to see—and this parliament should insist on seeing—the operative guidelines for when a future government brings out the troops against Australian civilians. We know what the police guidelines are at state level; we should know what the ADF guidelines are. It is reprehensible that this government is not honest enough to tell the Australian people how it would use the defence forces if they are brought out against the Australian people. It is not acceptable. I will not accept it. This government has an obligation—this is a democracy; it is not an authoritarian state—to be open and honest about this matter. 
—Tell the UN that.
—That interjection from the government ranks speaks for itself. This government has moved deliberately to give itself the power to bring out the ADF against Australian citizens protesting or in a whole series of situations, so let the government be honest and bring out the manual that is going to be used, given to those soldiers or service people, in that situation. What the government is saying is it will not, that it is secret. That is a totally intolerable situation in a free and open democracy. It is reprehensible. It is not acceptable. I reiterate: if we were dealing with terrorism per se—if that was it—different argument. If we were dealing just with a terrorist situation potentially with the Olympics, a la Munich: different situation. But the government has opened this right up, to every situation in future that occurs in Australia anywhere. It is up to ministers, to politicians here in Canberra, to be able to say, `Is this a situation where—for political purposes if they want to—we bring out the ADF, to defend a policy decision we have made?'
This is putting the ADF in a situation where it can be used for political purposes in this country. The government must, if it is hon-est about this, present the guidelines to the parliament. The states have said they were not consulted before this legislation came in. The states have said, `Where are the opera-tive guidelines?' The states have a point. I do not believe anybody in this Senate should allow us to pass this legislation without our seeing those guidelines. It is a very ser-ious matter. I appeal to the rest of the Senate if the government has not got the decency to treat the Australian public with the respect it deserves with this massive change in the way in which the government can in the future employ troops in domestic situations in Australia.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—On the same point, I would like to add my support to Senator Brown's remarks. The fact is that, until such time as there is a manual, the current manual applies, as I understand it. And I would assume that sold-iers in the ADF are trained in respect of that manual. When the new manual comes out—and we have no idea when it will come out—I assume that there then will be a training period required for soldiers to adjust to the new rules, which hopefully will be a little more apposite to our situation and the prospect of the bill than that manual is, such as I have heard read out. So my question to the min-ister is: when the manual comes out, how long will it be before ADF troops who are cap-able of being used under this legislation are fully trained in respect of the new manual?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I think I covered this the other day when a question was put to me about there being in existence some task force. I said there was some training in existence, which is the case. Having regard to that, the introduction of a new manual would not pose any problems in regard to the capability of any task force to be available for deployment in any situation at the Olympic Games. So, really, the introduction of a new manual would not be seen as such a problem in that regard.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—I ask the minister to clarify that. He says that there is some training taking place under the rules as they exist, but earlier in the debate he told the chamber that the situation still existed which Mr Beazley, the then Minister for Defence, told the parliament about on 20 October 1993. Mr Beazley said:
I reiterate that there is a specific directive which prohibits this type of training.
Has that directive been abandoned?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—That was a directive about riot control; this is something quite different that I am talking about. That directive which was mentioned then by the Leader of the Opposition is a directive which remains in force, and it relates to riot control. 
—No, he was the Minister for Defence. He wasn't the Leader of the Opposition; he was the Minister for Defence.
—He is the Leader of the Opposition now.
—Yes, but he was the Minister for Defence. That is the context that you're talking about.
—I think the Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Minister for Defence—
—Correct. I'm glad you've got it right.
—He was referring to a different situation. If Senator Faulkner wants to prolong these proceedings, we can debate that all day. But I think that answers Senator Brown's question quite clearly.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—It does the exact opposite; it gets the minister into further difficulties because this manual specifically is about everything but riot control. What the manual says is that riot control is a matter for the police. This is not a manual for riot control; it is a manual for assault on a civilian crowd which has gone beyond what is classified as a riot. This manual is specifically about everything beyond riot control. The then Minister for Defence said:
I reiterate that there is a specific directive which prohibits this type of training.
The minister said that there has been training under this manual. He then tried to duck it by saying it was riot control training. I have acquainted him now with the fact that this manual is about dealing with crowds, which is not riot control. He has told the parliament that there is a specific directive still in place which says that there shall not be training according to the rules in this manual. He is in a situation of contradiction. I would like him to clarify it.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I do not think I can take it any further than to say that Senator Brown is misunderstanding the difference between the training that I have mentioned and the directive that applies to riot control. The Manual of Land Warfare is quite clear in what it covers. The training that is in existence, and which I have mentioned, is not in conflict with the directive that was made in relation to riot control.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-08-31,"—I would like to broaden the discussion we are having on this point by drawing from the minister an explanation of how the Australian people can accept the situation that the government is going to put before them. The government is proposing a diametric change from any situation that we have previously had in Australia. The Australian defence forces are trained to neutralise an enemy, which is the sanitised terminology; they are trained to kill. On the other hand, we have the Australian Federal Police who are trained to protect both life and property. 
My question to the minister is: why is the government bringing forward this bill which will result in Australian defence forces being brought out against Australian citizens, irrespective of the circumstances, when the Australian defence forces are trained to neutralise an enemy and the government has at its disposal the Australian Federal Police, which I might add the Australian defence forces can be and have been seconded to serve under? So why is it that the government is bringing forward this bill in the form that it is when it has the option of seconding Australian defence forces to the Australian Federal Police and the government is totally turning its back on SAC-PAV, which is the organisation that was set up to do exactly what the government is saying this bill will provide?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—Senator Harris needs to look at the second reading speech and the speech in reply, which outline this all very clearly. This is setting in place a fair and transparent regime which deals with call-outs. It is replacing an antiquated regime that we have in place at the moment and it provides, I believe, accountability and transparency, which is much improved on the current situation. It is a situation which deals with call-outs. Call-outs are not where you use the defence forces to merely do policing work. It is a very serious situation that is contemplated here and something which would only happen in extreme circumstances where the state or territory police force are not able to cope with a situation. I just ask Senator Harris to look at those speeches. It is covered adequately there.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The point I want to make—and I think the minister will understand this—is that a lot of these problems that have been raised give rise to the question of what sort of people are going to be used. We have all had the experience of young, immature policemen, as distinct from the mature and the wise, who can cause all sorts of problems in the street by approaching a group in the wrong way. I was wondering whether the Army or the government have in mind the sorts of people they are going to use to carry out any activity that needs to be carried out in Sydney or elsewhere. In other words, are there any regulations or guidelines as to the maturity of the troops? If you have a young fellow who is going to shoot because he is frightened, then that is understandable. The way to prevent that is to have people of the proper disposition and proper character—not in terms of moral character, but proper fibre—and people who are not going to panic in dangerous situations.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—In answer to Senator Cooney's question, obviously only experienced and trained people would be used. I just point out that 57 per cent of the ADF personnel these days have a tertiary qualification. It is obvious that people who are inexperienced would not be used in these circumstances. You would use them for the training and experience they have.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,—I come back to the point of the directive that the Australian defence forces were not to be used in the type of training which could be utilised against Australians. I ask the minister: is that the case? Has there been no training of that sort?,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,—I am advised that there has been training in relation to the specific tasks as outlined in the national antiterrorist plan and that that training is appropriate for those purposes.,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—What happens if a civil emergency arises where there are not terrorists but a domestic violence situation, to use the government's word, involving a protest or a strike?
—The police would deal with that situation.
—Then why allow for the troops to be brought in in that situation under this legislation?
—As I stated earlier, the call-out would only be in the circumstance that the situation was beyond the capability of the police force involved.
—Has there been training by the Australian defence forces to meet a situation where a protest or a strike gets beyond the ability of the police to control?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I will briefly outline the tasks that are mentioned here—that is, in the event of a call-out, the sorts of tasks we are looking at are the recovery of hostages held by terrorists; recovery of aircraft, ships and land vehicles; recovery of offshore oil and gas installations; recovery of buildings and installations; cordon; building search; control of public movement; picketing; and guarding. Those are the sorts of tasks that we are envisaging in the situation of a call-out. I think that is fairly clear.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—The advice I have is that the training does involve dealing with members of the public. The guarding and picketing I have mentioned could cover, say, the containment of a very dangerous situation—that is, a situation where the defence forces are guarding a potentially dangerous situation. For instance, to cordon it off from the public would be a highly desirable situation. They have training in relation to how they deal with the public. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—Is the minister referring to the public picketing or to the troops picketing?
—It is picketing by the troops.
—Minister, how does the ADF or the minister involved determine that the police are unable to handle the situation? Does this require in all circumstances a written communication from the police to say that they need help?
—No, it is done in consultation with the police force in the state or territory where the situation has arisen.
—The bill does not say that. I ask the minister to point out where it does, and I ask what `consultation' means. Does this mean that consent?
—There are proposed amendments dealing with this. But, in any event, the national antiterrorist plan covers that very point of consultation.
—Is it required that there be police consent?
—There is a provision under the bill itself for request by the police. But, in any event, the consultation of the police is required by the current national antiterrorist plan.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—The point Senator Brown is making is that there is no requirement for the consent of the police commissioner of a state, there is no requirement for the consent of the premier of a state, there is no requirement for the consent of his or her cabinet, and there is no requirement for the consent of the leader of the opposition of a state. So you do not get the consent of the police commissioner of a state, the premier of a state, the leader of the opposition of a state or the cabinet of a state. In other words, if you read this bill, `consultation' is the word used. Consent is not required, and that means that the Commonwealth authorities, the ministers concerned, could take arbitrary action. Where in this bill does it require consent?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I point to section 51F, which states:
... the Chief of Defence Force must, as far as is reasonably practical, ensure that:
...		...		...	
(b) the Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force of the State or the Territory specified in the order requests, in writing, that the Defence Force be so utilised.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—But the authorisation, Minister, does not come from the Chief of the Defence Force; the authorisation comes from the authorising minister or ministers. They give orders to the Defence Force and the Defence Force will enact them. Nowhere does it require those authorising ministers to have received the consent of a police commissioner, a premier, a cabinet or a leader of the opposition. The authorising ministers are not required in this bill.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—You could have a call-out, but the call-out would be to no avail if there was no request by the police. The call-out could be made and nothing would be done because the point I have just made is crucial. The particular task which has to be carried out has to be at the request of the police. You could have a call-out and they are all there but they do nothing.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—So does that mean, where a Commonwealth installation is at stake, there is a call-out and the ADF cannot be deployed without the use of the police?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,—That is a totally different situation which is covered by different legislation. The Crimes Act deals with that.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—It is not. The problem here is that the minister is trying to fox us again. This bill does not require a call-out from the state. The bill gets around that. It says that, where Commonwealth interests are involved, the ADF can be sent in because a minister or three ministers believe that there is likely to be violence, which is unspecified. Minister, in that circumstance are the police going to be consulted, and in that circumstance is police permission required before the deployment of the ADF?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—To reach call-out the minister has to be satisfied that there is a lack of capability, and that cannot be arrived at without consultation with the police concerned. So you just cannot get to that point. You are saying that this could lead to a situation where the police are bypassed. That cannot happen. There has to be that consultation for the minister to get to that decision that there should be a call-out.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—That is not so. That is not in this legislation. That is what we are moving to put into this legislation, that the consent of the state be required—that is, the consent of the police and the state government that is involved. The government is going to vote against that, specifically because it does not want the consultation mechanism that it talks about to be a permission mechanism. It is not in the business here of saying, `We will be guided ultimately by the police as to whether or not they are being overrun.' That is not in this legislation. This legislation is about sending in the troops anyway. The minister can talk about how consultations might or might not take place, but they are not specified in the bill and consent is not required. That is what is wrong with this legislation.
Mr Wilkins from the cabinet office in New South Wales, in writing to the Senate committee, pointed out that an extraordinary situ-a-tion could arise where state police are in an oppo-sitional situation to the Australian Defence Force—that is unthinkable. That is because this legislation is totally unsatisfactory, unless you are looking at it from an authoritar-ian viewpoint of a government here in Can-berra which says, `In the future we want full rein on what we do in respect of interest groups and protests.' The police are cut out of this. Consultation, as we all know in this place, means a phone call to tell you that some-thing is happening, if that is what the min-ister wants to limit it to. It does not require permission or consent. It requires noth-ing more than a phone call to say that this is what is happening and a response. That is tot-ally unsatisfactory. I cannot believe that the Labor Party is going to go along with that.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—I rise to speak on the same point about the minister's discretion. Minister, we are bringing your attention here to the problem that the discretion is too broad and the safeguards are too limited. Without specific consent from a state police commissioner, a state premier, his or her cabinet and a state leader of the opposition, we are left in a position under this bill of having to accept the `trust us' line. I think your problem is that you are seeing it from the perspective of the current government. Whilst it may be appropriate to have a `trust us' line for the current government or the Labor opposition, neither the current government nor the Labor opposition can foresee what kind of government and what kind of opposition we will have in the future. It might well be that you would act properly as a government, even despite the extraordinary discretion given to you by this bill. It might well be that the Labor opposition, if they obtained government, would also behave in that same way. But you cannot guarantee to us the nature, form, manner or morals of a future government or a future opposition in this country. 
The discretion you are permitting to go through with this bill—the lack of consent, the lack of safeguards—can potentially put us in dire peril, as it has in other countries in the world which have been given such discretions and authorities. It is an act of extreme naivety to believe that Australia can be protected from the evils and bad morals in government that have afflicted other countries. That is what we are arguing. We have consistently said that there is absolutely no problem with having a narrowly defined bill, specifically one that deals with terrorism and other issues of national emergency, but the discretions here are too wide and there are limited safeguards. Minister, it is true, is it not, that consent is not required? Consultation in the hands of a government of bad faith could simply represent the telling of that government as to what you are going to do because consultation is not defined and consent is absent from the bill.

The Senate committee, when it looked at this, made a recommendation that we are following, which dealt with notifying the state or territory. We believe that the provisions dealing with consultation are adequate. In relation to the discretion of the minister, this bill actually circumscribes the discretion which exists at the moment. In fact, this bill is bringing more transparency than previously existed.

(a) the Defence Force is utilised to assist the State or Territory specified in the order and   cooperates with the police force of the State or Territory; and
(b) the Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force of the State or the Territory specified in the order requests, in writing, that the Defence Force be so utilised.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—The current manual in use, which we have referred to, is always in a situation in which the police are there to control the riot and, when the riot gets out of hand, the Australian Defence Force is brought in. But we now have the situation where the police may not necessarily be there. Under this legislation, you could have a call-out of the troops and notification of the state, but the state not having its police officers either working with or at the site of the point of concern.
Under the existing rules, section 525 talks about a number of operations that could be used against demonstrators for crowd control, including the use of gas, where gasmasks must be issued to the troops in that circumstance. The next part reads:
d. Application of Fire.  As a last resort, troops may be required to open fire on the crowd to disperse it. The principle of minimum force must be kept in mind by the commander. Therefore, initially, only selected individuals should be nominated to fire upon selected agitators in the crowd. The agitators will be nominated by the representative of the civil authority—
that is, the police. My question here is: what happens when the police are not there to select the agitators who are to be shot in a protest that is occurring in Australia?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I have said it before and I will say it again: this manual is one that, on the passing of this bill, will be revised. It is the intention under the provisions of this bill that the ADF work closely with the police authorities concerned, and that very provision could well be one of the ones that is totally revised as a result of the passing of this bill. To discuss the current manual really is of no value, because we are talking about a new regime of things, which is incorporated in this bill. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—The minister is insulting this committee in that he is saying that we cannot validly discuss the current regulations but he is not going to give the new regulations to us to look at and debate. That is a travesty of informed debate in the Senate about a matter which affects Australia very much. It is totally unacceptable behaviour by the government. I would point out here that the rules will be revised, and they will be revised for the situation where there are not police on hand. We then have the situation where the Australian Defence Force will selectively pick out people in the crowd to be shot. These people are progressively described as `dissenters' and then, when it gets to the actual crowd situation, they become `agitators'. The current rules go on to say that in those circumstances:
Such fire must cease as soon as the crowd begins to disperse. Fire by subunits—
that is, of the Australian Defence Force—
can only be justified as a final defensive measure if the troops are in danger of being overrun and weapons lost, or against armed dissidents ...
What we have been dealing with is an unarmed crowd, where the defence forces are used to shoot selected individuals in an unarmed crowd. I find this extraordinary. This manual, in some ways, would do justice to a regime in some of the worst places in the world. It is not defined. It is an outrageous projection of the abuse of the Australian defence forces against Australian civilians who are acting peacefully to protest or to strike. The revision should be before the Senate, so that we can eliminate this sort of military projection of the use of deadly weapons against crowds of Australian people. No wonder there has been a directive in place over the last decade that the Australian Defence Force shall not be trained, according to this manual, for use against Australian civilians. But it appears—although I cannot get to that, and the minister is certainly not going to admit to it here—that in recent times that directive has either been abused or at least loosened or bent to some degree.
We ought to have these matters being debated before the Senate. We are not going to get that debate, and I am surprised that the opposition is not leading the charge on this matter. This is profoundly serious legislation that affects the Australian community. As Senator Murray has said, legislation like this ought to be drawn up, having in mind a less responsible government somewhere down the line in the future, to circumscribe the government from unleashing the Australian Defence Force, so that it cannot be abused by a government down the line. To think that cannot happen in this country is to be naive, absolutely naive. We should be legislating responsibly here, and we are not. I can go on to enumerate other parts of this manual. The minister will always say, `Well, it is being revised.' As far as I am concerned, the fact is that that revision will be taking place in secrecy and the minister has indicated that we are never going to see it; it will be confidential as far as the government is concerned.
—That is not the case.
—The minister is interjecting and saying that is not the case. I ask the minister again: will you bring the new regulations before the Senate next week? The government has mishandled this issue—and I notice that Senator Faulkner agrees with this.
—He has handled this very badly.
—Yes, and the government has scheduled it now when debate is being truncated. The minister will not get to his feet and say, `I'll bring in the new manual next week.' That is what I am asking for. If this is all aboveboard, let the minister say that. But the minister is not prepared to do so. That is what is wrong with this debate. The manual is not going to be a disallowable instrument. The regulations are; the manual will not be. There is a very clear difference there. I believe that the manual should be debated and approved by the parliament of this country. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I certainly agree with some of what Senator Brown has just said. Yes, I agree that the government has mishandled this matter very badly indeed. I think I mentioned it and provided support for that view in, I think, a persuasive argument I mounted in my speech on the second reading debate—and I would commend that to Senator Brown. No, I do not agree that the committee stage debate has been truncated. I think debate on the first amendment, which we are dealing with, has ranged widely. At some point we will perhaps get to determine that amendment and move on to others.
But the substantive point that Senator Brown raises is one that this committee should treat seriously. Senator Brown is saying to this committee—Senator Murray has been saying it, and I hear this point, and the opposition certainly has concerns about it—that the current situation is highly undesirable and unsatisfactory. Senator Brown has, in recent minutes and during his most recent contributions, placed into the parliamentary record some of the reasons why this current situation is so unsatisfactory. God, I am battling through this in illness and in health, as best I can.
—At least you can still smile.
—Always. I want to make this clear: the opposition accepts that the status quo is imperfect—highly imperfect. Senator Brown and Senator Murray have made a strong case that the current situation is not acceptable. That is why the opposition, for its part, has gone into this question in relation to this particular legislation—which is significant legislation—with an open mind. We accept that we have to do something about this unsatisfactory situation. I rise to make that point because the motivation of the opposition has been questioned in the most recent contribution that Senator Brown has made.
It would assist the committee if the minister could be clear in relation to the timing for parliamentary scrutiny, and availability, of the manuals that will replace the current Manual of Land Warfare as opposed to regulations. Senator Brown in his most recent contribution makes the distinction—and it is appropriate—about which of these particular manuals or regulations are and are not disallowable instruments before the parliament. But for clarity's sake, I think it would be extremely helpful if the minister would now indicate, in very clear terms to the committee, what the government's intentions are in terms of replacement manuals—not the regulations. The regulations I think we have heard about, and we know they are disallowable. So we know that there is an opportunity in this chamber—and that there is also some capacity afforded to the House of Representatives, if it so desires—for parliamentary consideration.
Let us just get it clear, Minister, for the sake of the record: what will replace the manuals; and when do you believe they will be ready? And I hear the point you make, which is not without some justification. You are saying, `Well, their content to some extent'—I imagine only a comparatively minor extent—`will depend on the nature of the final bill, if and when it is passed.' You make that point. But, frankly, there are only a few amendments to this legislation—they are important amendments, but there is only a limited number—that this committee will be examining. When is it likely that those manuals will be ready? What opportunity will be afforded for parliamentary scrutiny, if any, of those manuals? What commitments will you, as minister, or the government be willing to make in terms of making that manual, or those manuals, available to the parliament or available publicly? Perhaps we can get some actual clarity around that. I do not think there is any certainty about that. I think there is more certainty—I understand from what you have been saying—in relation to the regulations themselves.
We know that the situation is unsatisfactory and that the current manuals are unsatisfactory—that has been highlighted during the committee stage. If we can get some clarity about that, it might help. Let us just get on the record in this committee what will be made available and when it will be made available. I understand that the legislation has not passed the parliament yet and that, if it does, there might be some minor doubt about what it might contain in the final analysis. We all understand that is what we face. If you can give some indication to the committee about this, I suspect we might be able to move on and deal with the first amendment.

In relation to division 2, which relates to counter-terrorist activity, that is more an operational matter and for obvious reasons that is not made public. That deals more with security matters.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-31,"—I might point out that in all of this you only use appropriate force for the circumstances—that is, where there is force, you provide equal force. The situation is that tank deployment would occur only if there were a risk, a threat or an emergency of equivalent proportions. That is quite clear. You would not use it willy-nilly. It would be used only in those extreme circumstances where it was necessary. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—The minister is wrong. He says that where there is force you should use only equal and opposite force. That is not what this manual is about; this manual is about overrunning crowds through force of arms. It is about overwhelming crowds. It is about the use of arms even when the crowd is not armed. That is what is so worrying about it. I get back to this point: if it is about terrorism then undefined words are sometimes used, because you cannot gauge all the situations. But the government is explicitly extending this legislation to deal with a whole range of protest and strike situations in Australia by Australians, and the Australian Defence Force is to be brought out against them.
It is wholly unsatisfactory that we have a manual in existence—until it is replaced—which allows unarmed crowds to be shot at. It allows the deployment of tanks in a so-called emergency situation—which the minister cannot define, but it could be any call-out situation and a situation in which, moreover, the request to the police is no longer required. Sure, there is going to be consultation, but the request and consent of the state and the state police force involved is not necessary under this legislation. Commonsense will prevail with governments as we know them, but legislation like this is quite dangerous if it does not take into account the potential for abuse. That is what is totally wrong with this legislation, and that is why it should be opposed. I could enumerate many things from the Manual of Land Warfare `Aid to Civil Power'. It has come from the point of view of dealing with terrorism, dealing with foreign invasion and dealing with threats from armed people. It applies this to the civil domain, and you cannot do that. That is why we have police forces. This is very dangerous, because it does not maintain the integrity of the last century of practice, where the police forces keep the domestic peace and the defence forces protect us from foreign insurgency. There is a crossover situation where there is potential for terrorism. We would be foolish not to be prepared for that. But I reiterate that we are not dealing with antiterrorist legislation; we are dealing with legislation that goes to the civil domain. It does not have the checks and balances in it that it should have, and it should not be passed in the Senate. I do not want to provoke Senator Faulkner—
—You're very generous. But you're going to.
—Let me look at the changes in the Labor Party amendments that were presumably devised overnight. My office asked about amendments last night, and there were said to be none. But, suddenly, there are some this morning. These amendments change the circumstances in which the ADF could be brought in against a community collection in Australia. The previous version of Labor Party amendment (R3)—which, I hear, the government is going to support—read that the armed forces could not be used to:
... stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action that does not pose a direct and immediate threat of serious injury or death to a person ...
It could not be used in those circumstances. But the new amendment says that the armed forces cannot be used to:
... stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons ...
So what was a clear injunction is now a matter of opinion—a `reasonable likelihood'. I maintain that that is totally unsatisfactory. This is a retraction from the position that Labor held, which I found unsatisfactory before. It is a weakening of the Labor Party position. In the backroom overnight, the government and Labor found some words they can accommodate. That has provoked Senator Faulkner. Let us have an explanation as to why the change has been made. Labor had a long time to consider this legislation. I know Senator Faulkner is not going to argue that the Labor Party amendment has been strengthened by the change; it has been manifestly weakened. We can debate until the cows come home the meaning of the word `reasonable' that has come in there—reasonable to whom? 
—I think you're wrong on this, but I'm happy to respond.
—I do not think I am wrong. I am very sorry that, at this hour, to get this legislation through, we have seen a change in the Labor amendment. In the overall order of things, it is a weakening of the amendment. We are dealing here with the crux of this matter, which is a situation in which the defence forces are brought out against strikers or peaceful protesters in Australia. It is a situation we all do not ever want to see, but it is now being codified in this legislation. The Labor amendment, which is going to be accepted by the government, is crucial.
—It's not going to be accepted by the government, as I understand it.
—I stand corrected, if that is the case, Senator Faulkner. I misheard Minister Ellison earlier on, when he indicated he would be accepting it.
—They're saying that they're now going to amend it and, therefore, it's not going to be accepted.
—It will be interesting to see what the amendment is, Senator.
—It will be, won't it.
—Yes.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—Senator Brown is right about one thing: he has provoked me. Ill as I am, I must respond to a couple of the things Senator Brown has said. There seems to be a lack of clarity here. I want to say this to Senator Brown, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: I understand why you raise the concerns that you have raised about the shooting of civilians and the use of APCs, or tanks. I note that you quote from the totally unsatisfactory manual that is currently in existence. We do share those sorts of concerns about the current situation. One difference is that we have tried to come to this with a somewhat open mind. We have come to examine this legislation from the perspective that, if we can improve it, we will. Like you, we are not satisfied with the situation. It is, as you have most eloquently and at great length outlined to us, unsatisfactory. You win that debate; you make that point. You have made it strongly, and you have made it consistently. Fair enough: very many people in the parliament—perhaps everyone in the parliament—and many in the wider community would share those concerns.
What has our approach been in that circumstance? We have come to the Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000 with an open mind to see if we can right some of those grievous wrongs that Senator Brown outlined to the committee. We do not believe the government has achieved that in the bill it has placed before the parliament. Again, we have come to the debate in the spirit of saying that, if we can improve the bill in a number of crucial areas so that it deals with those problems and the new problems that the government's legislation has created, we will accept that that is a significant improvement. But there are a lot of qualifications there, and they are really important qualifications from the perspective of the Labor opposition. What is the key qualification as far as this bill is concerned? Let me state it to this committee: we want to ensure that the Australian Defence Force will never—I stress `never'—be used against any peaceful protest, dissent, assembly or—particularly, from a Labor perspective—industrial action. That is why we have moved the amendment, and we are going to stand by it.
As far as the Labor Party are concerned, it is a principle we will never resile from and, if it does not stand, the bill will fail. There is no argument about that. Senator Brown makes a point. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, let me say to Senator Brown: we are happy to have the debate around the Labor amendment. I would say to everyone in the committee: let us have the debate about the Labor amendment when it is moved and not during the debate on the first amendment that stands in Senator Bourne's name about a review of the legislation. I do not want to duck away from it, Senator Brown. You are entitled to put your view on that strongly, and I want to engage in it. I am not going to slide away from the debate on the propositions that the opposition is putting before the committee. But, with respect, I would suggest we have it at the appropriate time and place. 
The only difference between the Labor amendment that was originally circulated and the one that you now have before you is that in the meantime the drafters got at it. I am assured that, in effect, there is no difference at all and no diminution of its intention or effect. But let us have that debate and, if you can convince me otherwise, we will be very interested, let me assure you. It is not the subject of some closed-door secret deal with the government or anybody else. That is the position that the Labor Party have put before this parliament and we will be arguing that position very strongly at the appropriate time in this committee stage.
We are not going to slide away from our commitment that the defence forces of this nation should never be used against peaceful protest or industrial action, and I think we share those concerns with many in this parliament and many in the community. Let the record be clear on what Labor intend to do and why we are going to do it. That is the initiative we have taken, and the opposition amendments are to give effect to that. As I hear from the Special Minister of State at the table, the government plan is to amend that opposition amendment that Senator Brown has quoted. I will have a look at what the government plan to do and what they say in support of any proposal to amend the opposition amendment. I cannot make a comment about that because I do not know what is being proposed at this stage.
The concerns that senators have raised are shared by the opposition. We are also concerned about the elements of the manual that Senator Brown has quoted—what can occur in the current situation. That is why we have looked at this bill from the point of view of trying to improve the status quo. That has been our motivation, and it will continue to be our motivation as we work through these issues before the committee—that is, if we move off the question of the review that stands in the name of Senator Bourne. I have indicated that we think it is an important principle too, but we think we have got a better formulation than the one Senator Bourne has put before this committee. We do accept that it is a crucial element of the bill, and we are treating that matter seriously as well. But for heaven's sake—and I think the minister should have made this point—there is a range of issues of concern to senators and there is a range of issues where the current drafting of the bill, in the view of many in this chamber, is inadequate. I am going to try to focus my remarks on the matters that are before the chair. I think I am showing a great deal more discipline than the minister is in that regard.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—I will show equal discipline. I am going to come back to Senator Bourne's amendment in a moment, but I want to respond to what Senator Faulkner had to say. The key point he was making is that the opposition wants to ensure that the Australian Defence Force will never be used against peaceful protest or industrial action. If you are going to achieve that aim, that is what you write into legislation. That is why the Labor Party should be supporting the Greens amendment. Let me read how the Greens amendment fulfils that aspiration. The Greens amendment says the ADF can be deployed:
Provided always that the Defence Force shall not be called out or utilized in connexion with an industrial dispute.
A further amendment says:
And further provided always that the Defence Force shall not be called out against people who are engaging in peaceful protest or civil disobedience.
That is exactly what Senator Faulkner says the opposition is setting out to do. If the opposition has those aims in mind, it should support the Greens amendments. It should not be using the weasel words that are in the ALP amendment which says the ADF can be used in civil situations, protests or strikes but not to `stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons'. I submit to the chamber that that covers many, if not most, of the great protests and strikes of the last century. It could be in the minds of an antipathetic government here in Canberra that that situation is likely to lead to serious injury or death. Many situations in civil life present that predicament. Many workplaces present that predicament. Travelling to and from work presents that predicament for all of us. It leaves the field open to the misdirected but imaginative mind of a future set of ministers in a government which is not behaving well, as Senator Murray said in other words. And we should be covering that situation.  
I put to the opposition that, if its aim is indeed, as Senator Faulkner said, to improve this legislation—and it will accept significant improvements—and the aim is to ensure that the Australian Defence Force will never be used against peaceful protest or industrial action when that time comes, that is exactly what my amendments for the Greens do. They are quite explicit: there are no ill-defined words; they are quite clear. They say exactly what Senator Faulkner says the opposition wants to achieve, and therefore they should be supported. I support Senator Bourne's amendment.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I move opposition amendment No. 5 on sheet 1895:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 24 (after line 22), after section 51X, insert:
51XA  Review of operation of Part
Independent review where first orders made
	(1)	If:
	(a)	before the end of 3 years after the commencement of this Part:
	(i)	an order under this Part ceases to be in force, where the order is not one of 2 or more orders to which subparagraph (ii) applies; or
	(ii)	2 or more orders under this Part cease to be in force, where the orders were about the same or related circumstances and came into force in succession, without any intervening period when no such order was in force; and
	(b)	no order under this Part had previously been made;
the Minister must, subject to subsection (2), before the end of 6 months after the order mentioned in subparagraph (a)(i), or the last of the orders mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii), ceases to be in force, arrange for the carrying out of an independent review (see subsection (5)) of the operation of this Part in relation to the order or orders).
Independent review not required if Parliamentary committee report
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply if a committee of one or both of the Houses of the Parliament has already presented a report to that House or both of the Houses, as the case may be, about the operation of this Part in relation to the order or orders.
Independent review where no orders made
	(3)	If no order under this Part ceases to be in force before the end of 3 years after the commencement of this Part, the Minister must, subject to subsection (4), as soon as practicable after those 3 years, arrange for the carrying out of an independent review of the operation of this Part during those 3 years.
Independent review not required if Parliamentary committee report
	(4)	Subsection (3) does not apply if a committee of one or both of the Houses of the Parliament has already presented a report to that House or those Houses, as the cases may be, about the operation of this Part during those 3 years.
Tabling of report of independent review
	(5)	The Minister must arrange for a copy of the report of any independent review under subsection (1) or (3) to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the Minister is given the report.
Meaning of “independent review”
	(6)	In this section:
independent review means a review, and report to the Minister, by 2 or more persons who:
	(a)	in the Minister's opinion, possess appropriate qualifications to carry out the review; and
	(b)	include at least one person who: 
	(i)	is not employed by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority; and
	(ii)	has not, since the commencement of this Part, provided services to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under or in connection with a contract.
This amendment goes to the same issue that Senator Bourne has raised. As all are now aware, the purpose of the bill before us is to provide a proper legislative framework for the exercise of the existing constitutional powers of the Commonwealth government to use its defence forces in domestic security situations. As I have indicated I hope clearly in my most recent contribution, the opposition believe that the current situation, the status quo, is imperfect. We accept that change is required. We accept that good legislation is needed. That is the fundamental reason why we have not embraced the proposal for a sunset clause, which has the effect of returning us to an unsatisfactory situation. But it is also essential in our view that this question of review is adequately dealt with.
We are critical about the way the government has drawn up this legislation. We are very critical about the lack of consultation. We are critical and concerned about the inadequate public debate. I think even our harshest critics would have to acknowledge that the Labor opposition have worked hard to see if we could correct that situation. The opposition took the initiative of having this bill investigated by a Senate committee. I think the opposition have been very serious in responding to the concerns that were put before that committee and have been aired in the ensuing public debate, which I think has largely resulted from the work of that Senate committee and its report. We are working to address the concerns that the committee had through the amendments we are moving.
We do face a real problem with the legislation, because of the unsatisfactory processes that I have outlined. This legislation has been brought forward in haste. There may well be a range of problems that have not already been identified and detected. That is the reason why the opposition are proposing this amendment to require a review of the legislation either within six months of the use of the call-out power or within three years of its enactment. This will ensure that the parliament and of course the community at large have an opportunity to not only review but, in the case of this parliament, amend the legislation if necessary.
I indicate to the chamber that the changes we have made to the original amendment—I have no doubt that Senator Brown might have identified this; he seems to look at these things pretty closely—which of course are reflected in the opposition amendment sheet 1895 revised 2, do not change the substance of our amendment on this issue. They, like the other changes I was speaking of a moment ago, are a response to the legislative drafting advice that we received and are aimed at ensuring our amendments are as clear as possible, as concise as possible and as effective as possible. I think the opposition's amendment here on this question of review of the legislation is an important one, and I commend it to the committee.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-08-31,"—It appears to us that this is not nearly as good as having the review that we suggested—which has just been voted down—as well as the sunset clause. I cannot even say that it is a tenth as good. It is quite inadequate. Senator Faulkner mentioned that he believed a sunset clause would have the effect of returning to an unsatisfactory situation. No, it would not. Any government with any foresight at all and any feeling that this legislation was about to come to its sunset clause—and if a sunset clause is put in, we will all know exactly when that is—would write up a bill to replace this bill well and truly, months and months at least, before that sunset clause took effect. And even if that did not happen, why do we think Australia has suddenly turned into such a dangerous place that we need this? We have been going since 1903 as we are now. Why is it that we have to change next week?
We are being told that it is because of the Olympics. I do not think that is right. I think there has been so much security and so much ability to use security put in place for these Olympic Games that this has to be the most secure Olympic Games—without this bill—ever held; incredibly secure. Look at the changes to the New South Wales legislation; look at the training of the New South Wales police force and the TRG—and even of the SAS. I know that they are from the Defence Force, but they could be used under certain circumstances. They could be used to show the police what to do; they could be used under other circumstances. There is no need for this bill; there just is not the need for it now. Australia is not that dangerous a place that we certainly have to have this. Since 1903 we have been going along very nicely, thank you very much. The disaster has not happened; the disaster is not going to happen. The disaster is certainly not going to happen before we can get this bill right. So I do not think this is necessary. 
On the other hand, my proposed amendment for a review has just gone down, so we are not having one. I honestly fear that the proposed amendments for a sunset clause will probably go down—all of them. I am going to vote for all of them, but I think they are all going to go down. I also fear, more than anything, that the Labor Party in the end will vote for this bill. I think that is a great tragedy. Because of all of that, to make it a bit better, I will be voting for this because I think it is about the fifth-rate way of making it better. It is certainly not the best way of making it better and it is not the second-best way of making it better. How many amendments do I have? It comes after them—it comes after the Greens amendments; it comes after Senator Harris's amendments and it comes after the opposition's and the government's amendments. This really is not the way to go—to just leave this bill in force and have a review.
We had a review after the incident at CHOGM in 1975. Justice Hope had a review and made some very good recommendations, some excellent recommendations, which have not been brought up in this bill. So you have a review, but that does not mean that what is said will be taken into account. We have Senate inquiries all the time that have excellent recommendations, very well thought out and very well-written recommendations, that could quite easily be put into legislation and should be, and everybody agrees that they should be. But they never are. There are an awful lot of Senate committee and joint committee recommendations that go absolutely nowhere. So you have a review and what happens? Nothing—far too often, nothing. I can see nothing in here at all that would make them implement the recommendations of any review. Where is the bit of this amendment that says that the recommendations of the review must be carried out? There is nothing like that, and of course they will not put that in. 
There is a recommendation in the Hope report that states:
The Defence Force should be used only as a last resort, and an overriding principle is that troops should never in any circumstances be used to confront political demonstrators or participants in industrial disputes. Whatever logistical support they render, they must be protected by police, who alone must deal with any violence arising from objection to their support.
Where has the government put that into the bill? That was a very good recommendation of the Hope report. It came out of a review, and where is it in what has ensued from that review? Nowhere. The government has not even considered that recommendation. So what government is going to consider the recommendations? I guess it will consider the recommendations of any review that happens under this opposition amendment. Yes, it will consider those recommendations. Then it will probably say, `No, sorry, it is working perfectly, thank you very much,' because nothing will have happened. And even if something does happen, it will probably be the same. There will be a review and nothing will happen.
It is just as well to have a review, because—as I, myself, said with the last amendment—it would, I hope, bring out exactly what happened if any action was taken. I hope to goodness no action ever will be taken; but if it is then this should bring out what happened. But there will have to be a review of the legislation after three years and things will have to happen if there is a sunset clause. If we vote for this one, there will have to be a review but nothing need happen at all—and I suspect that is what will happen.
So a sunset clause, I believe, is a far better way to go. Better still than that is to vote against it now and let us start again. But we are not going to get that. Since we are not going to get that I will be voting for this. But I really think we should all go away and over the lunch break think very seriously about what will happen if this keeps going, what will happen if this bill is put in and there is no sunset clause, if this bill is put in at all. Australia is not that dangerous a place. It really is not a very dangerous place at all, thank goodness, and there is no necessity to put this in right now. We could do it next month or the month after or the month after. We could think about it properly. We could do it properly. We do not have to do this. Please consider that.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-08-31,"—We are dealing with guns and answering it with blancmange. That is what the opposition's amendments are. Senator Bourne is absolutely right. A review that takes place here does not even have to have public input. `A review'—no specifications about it at all. Senator Bourne is absolutely right. This is legislation that was predicated on the Olympics; Lt. Gen. Cosgrove has said so again in the last couple of days. We should, therefore, be having a sunset clause to it and then a full debate about the ramifications of this legislation on a whole range of potential civilian situations in the coming century and on the balance under the constitution and between the states.
By the way—and I will get on to this later, Mr Temporary Chairman—I believe that there are eminent grounds here for a challenge to this legislation, because it is in breach of the Constitution. I have had advice on that from Mr Gary Corr, a barrister in Canberra, and there are other legal minds who believe the same. But we will keep that for later in the debate. I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Bourne. This is a very unsatisfactory amendment. It has to be read in conjunction, though—and I am sure Senator Faulkner will understand this—with the fact that Labor is about to vote down the sunset clause provisions put by the various parties in this corner of the House.
—I spoke about our approach on that. I am not denying we are going to vote down the sunset clause. We don't want to get back to tanks rolling down the street.
—I have not got any assurance that the tanks cannot roll down the street under this legislation. That is what worries me.
—They have got to come a long way from where they are at the moment.
—That is what worries me. We are dealing with a real piece of legislation here which is not about the Olympics, which is about events that could unfold under a non-benign federal regime, government or set of politicians somewhere down the line. That is what we are dealing with, and that is what we should be concentrating on here. If we do not focus on that we make a mistake, and I am afraid Labor is not focusing on that potential.
—You would not have an amendment like this before us as a review.
—Like Senator Bourne said, it is all we are left with—because we are not going to get her proposal for a review and we are not going to get a sunset clause. We have here the potential for a review which could be an independent review held entirely in private without public input.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—Firstly, the sunset clause was an issue that was canvassed at the hearing held by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on this matter.
—Did you go to that hearing?
—I am glad Senator Faulkner interjects here. Who was present at that hearing? I most certainly was there. I was there all day. I certainly did not see anyone from the Democrats at that hearing, and I did not see Senator Brown. The people who are raising the most objection about this bill did not front up at all.
—But Labor fought the good fight. 
—Yes. The issue of the sunset clause was raised, and in the discussions before the committee that day it was clearly determined that if we went down the path of having a sunset clause, Senator Brown, we would have exactly the circumstances that exist today, the circumstances that are completely anathema to what we should have. This bill goes to the point of tightening up—not opening up—the processes. Having a sunset clause there would achieve the very opposite of what you would hope it would achieve. That is the first thing.
The second thing is that a number of people—as I said in my speech in the second reading debate—have found this bill a fertile opportunity to go out there and stir up a lot of the conspiracy theorists. There is no doubt that that has happened. But there are genuine concerns that people have raised about this bill and that have been pursued both at the committee level in the Senate and also before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee itself. I believe that the amendments that Labor have brought forward are genuine attempts to deal with the concerns that exist out there.
I have had people come to my office, sit down with me and go through some of the concerns that have been raised by Senator Brown, Senator Murray, Senator Harris and others in this debate. When I sit down with the people and take them through, firstly, the piece of legislation—which most of them have neither sighted nor heard of, apart from a couple of rumours on the news or something that someone has told them second- or third-hand—secondly, the Hansard of the Senate legislation committee, thirdly, the recommendations that came out of that legislation committee, and fourthly the further parliamentary processes that will be involved, whilst it does not offer them a complete panacea nonetheless it allays a lot of the fears that have been promoted during the campaign waged against this particular piece of legislation. The fact is that all the powers are, as I understand it, already there. What we have through this piece of legislation and, in particular, through the amendments that are being put forward by Labor, is a tightening up process—not a loosening process; a tightening up process. I think the review process will stand this piece of legislation in good stead. The process is one that was insisted upon by the committee in its report. The amendment that has been put forward by Senator Faulkner tightens up the legislation even further. I think that it is an excellent amendment, and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-08-31,"—I cannot let that one go, I am sorry. We are not discussing the Senate committee report; we are discussing the bill. If we were discussing the Senate committee report, I think Senator Hogg would have some right to say that I did not turn up to that day of do not care.
 hearings. He can feel free to say it anyway—I —You put in a minority report.
—I said it in my own minority report—that is exactly right. In fact, Senator Hogg would have the right to tell me off for not canvassing this issue in that report if that were the case, but it is not the case. We are not discussing the committee report; we are discussing every aspect of this bill. Let me make this point very strongly: we are discussing those aspects of the bill which people had not even thought of when the committee report was done. That committee report was done at the beginning of the public discussion of this bill. This should not be the end, but it is. What we do today or on Monday, on Tuesday, on Wednesday or on Thursday—whenever this finishes—will be the end of the discussion of this bill. The reason that it will be the end of the discussion of this bill is that the Labor Party will agree to it, so we will not have a chance to look at it again in the same way as we are right now.
Half the problem is that we have thought of things as we have gone through the bill since the beginning of the debate which started with the public hearing. I am sorry I could not get to that one day. If you had made it another day, perhaps I could have. But you did not. I did not get to that one day, and I apologise for that. But the point is that I read the submissions, I read the report and I wrote another report. Many things have come up since then. People have looked through the bill. 
—Most of them haven't, Senator Bourne. You know the truth.
—People have not looked through the bill—you are right, Senator Hogg. People have come to me who have not looked through the bill as well. But some people have looked through the bill, and they have found problems. They have found things in this bill that they think are not addressed in that report—and I agree with them. If we had to stick to exactly what happened weeks ago when those hearings happened we would be in big trouble, but fortunately we do not.
—You've changed your position, haven't you?
—Yes, I have, because I have evolved. You have changed your position—you have evolved. Senator Brown has changed his position. Senator Harris has changed his. The system is evolving, which is why it was so unfair and unfortunate of Senator Hogg to have said those dreadful things. But he did. The point is that we have all evolved since then, and we have evolved purely because we have all looked again at the bill. It is not just us in this chamber who have looked again at the bill; many people outside the chamber have looked again at the bill and have found things. They have thought of things and they have determined things that need to be looked at again. It is happening daily. It happened yesterday. The opposition keep changing their amendments. I see no problem with that. If they are improving them, great! But we have not finished, have we? We changed them again yesterday. We will probably change them again today. We might change them again on Monday or on Tuesday or on Wednesday or whenever this finishes. The point is that it still is evolving. We still are finding things that are wrong with this bill because it has not had enough public debate—that is the point. We will keep finding things that are wrong with this bill.
—That was the thing I said.
—Exactly. That is the point. Senator Hogg says that was the thing that he said—which makes me wonder why he got up and said I should not have changed my mind since writing my report. I find that very odd.
—I never said that. You're not quoting me correctly. Read it again.
—I will go back and read it again, Senator Hogg. But I feel that you have been somewhat unfair to me, which is why I felt forced to stand up and defend myself. But the point about this is that we are discussing the bill. We are discussing aspects of the bill that people both inside this parliament and outside this parliament still are discovering to be in conflict with things—to be not what they thought. It is not true that this purely codifies without making any change. If it made no change, we would not need the bill. Of course it makes a change. Of course it enables the defence forces to do things legally that they could not do before. It has to. If it did not, we might as well toss it out now—who cares; we do not need it. But we do need something, obviously. Is this what we need? That is the question. The problem is that none of us know. We will not know until it has been gone through a lot more thoroughly—and it will take more than a couple of hours to do that.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I think that Senator Bourne has, in part, made a strong case for a review, which is the intention of the opposition's amendment. I hope that, as she gives this further consideration, Senator Bourne might even consider voting for it.
—I'm not going to vote for it. It's lousy.
—We have accepted the time frame of the urgency of the Olympics that the minister talks to us about. Let me say, Senator Bourne, that we thought he was talking about the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. Now we realise that you are talking about the Athens Olympics in the year 2004. Judging by the length of time taken on this debate, Senator Bourne, it will be 2004 before we finish.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-08-31,"—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 30 August 2000. I seek leave to make a brief statement in this regard.
Leave granted.
—The original amendments provided in the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000 strengthened the role of the secretary through the Therapeutic Goods Administration in the monitoring of access to unapproved drugs in Australia. Since 1991, a focus of the therapeutic goods legislation has been to ensure greater access by the Australian community to new drugs through the creation of exemptions to the requirement for all drugs to be entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods before supply. These exemptions include supply through clinical trials, the special access scheme and authorised prescribers. 
The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000 will provide additional powers to the secretary to ensure the use, handling and supply of unapproved therapeutic goods is in accord with the terms and conditions applied when the exemption for supply is granted. This greater control will be achieved principally through the secretary's new powers to require persons to whom an approval or an authority has been granted to supply unapproved products to provide information about how the goods are used. It also provides that, should the information provided warrant it, the TGA could audit the processes used to supply the goods, including the conduct of clinical trials. An amendment also enables the secretary to release information where necessary to appropriate authorities in the states or territories with functions relating to therapeutic goods and to medical or pharmacy boards. 
The amendments which the government wishes to add to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000 today will ensure public health and safety through correcting a number of deficiencies relating to product recalls in the existing legislation. Since March this year, there have been two instances of product tampering involving paracetamol products. Both incidents involved attempted extortion and resulted in serious poisoning. In both cases, the sponsors of the paracetamol products, Herron Pharmaceuticals and SmithKline Beecham, undertook voluntary recalls of potentially affected products. To date, the extortionist has not been apprehended.
On 31 March 2000, following contamination of products supplied by Herron Pharmaceuticals, the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr, wrote to the Prime Minister seeking agreement to urgent action by the Commonwealth to take a leading role in streamlining the product recall process at the national level. On 29 June 2000, the National Consultative Committee on Therapeutic Goods, comprising representatives of Commonwealth, state and territory health authorities, met urgently to agree on strategies to manage future attempts to tamper or interfere with therapeutic goods. At that meeting the adequacy of recall powers and other powers available under the existing therapeutic goods legislation, particularly those in the Commonwealth's Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, was also examined. The committee urged the legislative amendments be made with some urgency to safeguard integrity of medicines and medical devices in the marketplace and to minimise the risk to public health.
The committee recommended that the Commonwealth's Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 be amended to include a requirement for mandatory reporting of product tampering or implied tampering, incorporating penalty provisions for non-compliance; mandatory recall powers in cases of product tampering and/or where sponsors refused to recall goods with penalty provisions for non-compliance; the introduction of a new category of offence for the supply of a recalled product; and the release of information by the Commonwealth relating to product tampering to state, territory and overseas regulatory authorities with responsibilities for therapeutic goods or terrorism. The recommendations of the committee have been discussed with and agreed to by the peak therapeutic goods industry associations—the APMA, the ASMI, the CHC, the MIAA, and the Consumer's Health Forum. State and territory governments have given their written support for the proposed measures to be effected through changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we support the passage of Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000, including the amendments that the parliamentary secretary has foreshadowed. This legislation deals with very important issues. Firstly, the original bill deals with the monitoring of the supply and use of unapproved therapeutic goods, and, secondly, the amendments deal with the recent extortion attempts and the impact that that had on the public of Australia. It was a very serious matter, as we know. We fully support the increased powers being granted to the TGA to deal with those issues involving public health and safety. On that basis, we support the passage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-08-31,"—The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2000, as I see it, not only deals with the question of tampering, which I had inadvertently considered it to be, but also has privileges in it relating to the powers of the secretary and the CTN scheme. Honourable senators will recall that I have had a longstanding interest in the CTN scheme and whether it was adequate in a number of areas, not least the area of critical assessment of the application for the clinical trials as to their being ethical, as to their being safe, and the like. Honourable senators can see that I have raised these matters during estimates committee hearings and so on. 
I do apologise to the parliamentary secretary for not raising these matters before and clearing them with him and his office. But I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary would elaborate on what is contained in part of the second reading speech where it states:
Since 1991 a focus of the therapeutic goods legislation has been to ensure greater access by the Australian community to new drugs through the creation of exemptions to the requirement for all drugs to be entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods before supply. These exemptions include supply through clinical trials, the Special Access Scheme and Authorised Prescribers.
The resulting exemptions have been very successful in achieving greater patient access to new drugs. Notification of clinical trials to the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the CTN scheme has resulted in a very marked increase in clinical trial activity in Australia. From less than 50 clinical trials conducted in 1990 there are now well over 400 new clinical trials notified to the TGA each year. 
The very success of the programs has led to occasional concern.
This is a matter that I want to raise in the committee. It continues:
The nature of notification schemes is such that Commonwealth involvement is minimal. They rely on certification and approval by medical practitioners and institutions. Should the processes of approval be less than rigorous, the legislation gives no ability to the Commonwealth to investigate and take action to ensure patient safety.
The parliamentary secretary goes on:
The amendments in this Bill will provide additional power to the Secretary to ensure the use, handling and supply of unapproved therapeutic goods is in accord with the terms and conditions applied when the exemption for supply is granted.
It goes on to talk about how these greater controls are applied. I remind the Senate, however, that in respect of the clinical trials the TGA in effect is not required to approve trials because the approval is by an ethics committee. I know we are all concerned at times by the fact that some medical practitioners do believe that they have almighty powers, and I think that very often there is too much obeisance paid to doctors who have a couple of letters after their name. Obviously these are in the tiny minority of the profession. Members of the profession are very often concerned about the activities of these people because they reflect on the whole profession. 
If the parliamentary secretary would not mind, I would like him to indicate to the committee just two things: one, is the proposal that is now before us actually strengthening the power of supervision of CTNs and, two, how will this be achieved? If that is the case, then obviously there is no need to pursue the matter at this particular stage. I do apologise again to the committee and particularly the parliamentary secretary that I had not noted this particular change. Obviously I did not then take advantage of my ability to seek to refuse this matter going formally before the chamber. I will not press that because it is entirely my fault that I had not sufficiently availed myself of the very generous offer of the parliamentary secretary to have his officers brief me.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-08-31,"—I thank the Senate for its comments and support with regard to the matters of tampering and recalls in this area. I now turn to the issues that have been addressed by Senator Harradine, particularly with regard to clinical trials. I indicate that the changes relating to clinical trials and the use of unregistered drugs provide additional public health and safety measures so that people involved in trials or who need to use unregistered drugs for some reason can have greater confidence that their interests are protected and that there are appropriate powers resting with the Department of Health and the TGA to make inquiries and take action, should that be necessary. These changes clarify the necessary powers required for the secretary to ensure that there are appropriate oversight and safety measures for trials. Australia's provisions for clinical trials, including the CTN scheme, have served Australia well. These changes strengthen protections for Australians, and I am certainly pleased to note Senator Harradine's ongoing interest in this issue. 
The current amendments leave intact the process of clinical trials and special access. They incorporate in the legislation that the standard of clinical trials should be that set by the NHMRC's national statement on ethical conduct in research involving humans. This also incorporates the code of good clinical practice, which is an international standard for the conduct of clinical trials. The amendments provide for the TGA to have the power to inquire and, if necessary, to audit the function of doctors and institutions supplying unapproved products should there be any evidence that patients are not being adequately protected.
I think Senator Harradine also asked what sort of information would be sought under the power to inquire. I am informed that the information required by the secretary will be that which is necessary to allow the secretary to establish that the supply, handling and use of unapproved products meets acceptable standards. Depending on circumstances of the use of the product, this information may be required from the doctor to whom an approval is given in relation to SAS or authorised prescribers, the sponsor of a clinical trial who has either notified a trial under the CTN scheme or been given approval in relation to the CTX scheme, or a clinical investigator participating in a clinical trial using goods for which an approval has been given to someone else.
With regard to how the operation of the special access scheme will be affected, the day-to-day operation of the special access scheme will be unaffected. The main changes are in relation to the secretary's ability to formally inquire about the use of unapproved products under the SAS, particularly in relation to supply to category A patients. The supply of unapproved therapeutic goods to category A patients as defined in the regulations does not require prior approval by the TGA. The secretary will be able to request information where necessary about the use of the product, including the condition of the patient being treated. This will ensure that this mechanism is not used to bypass the requirement to otherwise obtain TGA approval prior to the supply of an unapproved product. The proposed change does not change the original intent of the category A provisions whereby access to unregistered products for persons with life-threatening conditions is considered to be a matter for the patient and doctor without interference from government.
What effect will there be on the conduct of clinical trials? The overall effect of the changes will be to further enhance the rights, safety and wellbeing of participants in clinical trials in Australia. The changes ensure that investigators must comply with appropriate standards when conducting clinical trials. This will include the need for compliance with good clinical practice, an internationally accepted standard for the design, conduct, recording and reporting of clinical trials and compliance with the trial protocol and with Australian ethical standards. In addition, the secretary will be able to investigate matters relating to clinical trials conducted under the clinical trial notification and the clinical trial exemption schemes.
Initial inquiries about and subsequent inspections of clinical trials would be undertaken where necessary on safety grounds and to investigate non-compliance with legislative requirements, the trial protocol or accepted standards for conduct of a trial. The CTN scheme will remain a notification scheme. The CTX scheme remains an application-based scheme. I trust this explanation picks up the points that Senator Harradine has raised. As I said earlier, we are pleased to note his ongoing interest in this issue and will continue in dialogue with him.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-08-31,"—The opposition supports the passage of the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme Extension Bill 2000 but I do wish to make a couple of comments in regard to the legislation. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to extend the operation of the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme from the current expiry date of 14 September 2000 to a new expiry date of 30 June 2001.
The Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme, as I am sure senators will recall, was announced back in 1997 by the then minister, John Anderson. It was part of the government's much vaunted AAA package—Agriculture Advancing Australia. This scheme allowed farmers a three-year period, commencing on 14 September 1997, to gift their farms and farm assets up to a value of $500,000 to their children or the next generation of the family without that affecting their access or entitlement to receive an age or Veterans' Affairs pension. At the time it was said by the government that this was to assist farmers to pass on the operations of their farm and the assets of their farm to the next generation in the family.
A number of eligibility criteria were laid down, but the main ones were: first, there had to be a long-term involvement in farming; second, the total income had to be less than the applicable age or veterans pension rate for the three years prior to transfer; and, third, persons had to be of age pension age or reach that age before the expiry of this scheme. The government claimed at the time that this scheme would be taken up by 10,000 farmers. 
—Less than 2,000. 
—Yes. Senator Woodley has stolen my thunder, but I am happy to acknowledge his interjection. The government's great predictions for this scheme, just as happened with their great predictions for other elements of the AAA package, have really come to very little. Indeed, rather than get 10,000 farmers to take up this opportunity, to date the figure is around only 1,400 farmers. 
—1,700.
—The parliamentary secretary says 1,700. My figures say 1,400. In any event, the fact is that it is a long way short of the stated target—an expectation of 10,000. Of course, the farming communities themselves—the farmer organisations—have been particularly critical of the scheme, claiming that the asset and income test is too tight and is a barrier to farmers accessing it. As Senator Woodley will recall, this is an issue that we in the opposition—and I know he has—have taken up probably at every estimates hearing since the scheme was announced. So, once again, we have an indication of the claims made by this government at that time. As I said, Agriculture Advancing Australia has really done little to improve the position of the farming community. 
We nevertheless do support the extension of the scheme because it will allow a further period of 9 months or so to enable any other farmers who may qualify and who wish to take up the opportunities under the scheme to do so. That is the purpose of the legislation being before the chamber. On that basis, we support it. As I said, we indicate that this would not have been necessary if the government had better understood the farming community's needs and had not been as expansive in their predictions as they were at the outset.",SENATE,<title>RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS SCHEME EXTENSION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-08-31,"—Let me begin my contribution today by saying that the Democrats are very pleased to see the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme Extension Bill 2000 introduced into federal parliament, legislation which extends the time for the take-up of the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme. I add to the comments made by Senator Forshaw that our disappointment is that, although this is a very good scheme, it is far too restrictive. The last time we debated this legislation, I placed on record the fact that I wished to move a number of amendments to the legislation which would have solved many of the problems the bill has encountered over the last three years. Unfortunately, I did not get any support from the government for that. It should have supported me. At the time, the Labor Party indicated that it could not support those amendments either, although I feel that at the time perhaps Senator Forshaw would like to have supported them. However, that is history, as they say. 
—There are so many problems to fix, Senator Woodley; it's hard to know where to start.
—That is true, Senator Forshaw, but of course my commitment to farming communities means that I always make that a priority, and I guess that is what comes forward. In fact, senators will be aware that the Democrats, over the past seven or eight years, have actively pursued the issues of farmers' access to welfare payments. 
I want to digress from 1998 to talk about a study tour which I have just concluded, which took in Ireland, Wales and parts of England. I followed up a number of agricultural issues that I had pursued a couple of years earlier, and I was very interested in the approach of the Irish government to rural policy. The one thing that we cannot duplicate, of course, in our rural policy is the subsidies that they receive from the EU, but I have got to say that they certainly use those subsidies in a very creative way and in a very comprehensive overall farm policy that I was entirely impressed with. 
—That wasn't a study tour you were on, was it?
—Why don't you go over and have a look yourself, Senator McGauran, and maybe you would learn something. I discovered that they had this comprehensive farm policy which picked up the very issue that we are debating today: the retirement of older farmers so that younger farmers can access the farms and come onto the land. They did not treat it as welfare. That was interesting. It was administered by the department of agriculture in Ireland as a total approach to retaining population in rural communities and rural areas and supporting farmers in terms of their income, their approach to the environment and their approach to rural cultural heritage. In fact, it was a total overview of how farm policy can be used to support the total rural population and rural income in Ireland. In terms of retirement assistance for farmers, which is what I want to concentrate on today, they did not view the retirement of farmers as a social security issue; they viewed it as part of an overall approach to support for rural communities. Their retirement policy has few of the restrictions that our policy seems to be totally hedged in by. The pension there for aged farmers is around 10,000 Irish pounds per year—roughly around $20,000. 
There are two very, very significant outcomes from the retirement policy in Ireland and the other support policies that surround it. The first one is that they are finding now that the average age of farmers is beginning to be lowered. In Australia and in many other developed nations we are finding that the average age of family farmers is going up; I think that it is about 58 at the present time in Australia. What is happening is that, because of the way in which this particular policy is directed in Ireland, the average age of farmers is starting to go down, because it is allowing older farmers to retire with proper support and with dignity and, therefore, allowing younger farmers at an earlier age to come onto the land and to take up farming. That is, I believe, a very beneficial outcome of that policy. 
The other thing that this policy is doing is actually keeping farming families intact in rural areas. Of course, that is one of the biggest problems we have in Australia: young people are not only leaving farming but leaving rural communities altogether.
 (Senator Bartlett)—Order! I am personally quite interested in hearing Senator Woodley's contribution and I request that members on both sides do not have conversations across the chamber.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was actually ignoring them, but I know you are closer and so you no doubt were being interrupted. These are some of the beneficial aspects of a total rural policy administered by the agriculture department, so it is not seen as a welfare payment or as a social security issue. That is why I believe we should be looking at what the Irish are doing. Perhaps we cannot access the kinds of subsidies which they access. Nevertheless, I believe we could learn much from many of the policies that they have put in place, which take a comprehensive approach to rural communities and to farming. In the coming weeks in this chamber I hope to put some more of what they are doing on the record, because I think it would be useful for us to have a look at that. 
I think Senator Forshaw was arguing across the chamber in respect of the figure and whether it was 1,400 or 1,700. I am not sure that is an argument that matters. Less than 2,000 have taken up this scheme. Minister Anderson announced at the time, when he trumpeted the benefits of the AAA package, that 10,000 would take it up. The number is certainly well short of that mark. I urge the government not only to extend the time for this scheme but also to have a look at some of the restrictions on it, because a lot of farmers will not take it up even if we do extend the time unless we deal with some of the other stumbling blocks. 
I was going to give a fair bit of detail about those stumbling blocks, just as I did in my speech in 1998. However, given the limitation on time in this place and the wish of the government that the bill be passed, I will not do so. I am sure that senators are not going to rush off and read my 1998 speech. However, I will say that, in talking to staff from Mr Truss's office who came to brief me on the bill, when I told them about some of those amendments and the Irish scheme they seemed interested and said that they would certainly look into it. They may wish to look up my 1998 speech, because it sets out all of the stumbling blocks that we see in the way of the operation of this scheme.  
I might add that, in moving amendments in 1998, what we were doing, of course, was totally endorsing the approach of the National Farmers Federation, which agreed totally with the amendments that we sought to move. Those amendments were supported by a Senate inquiry; there was lots of evidence that what we said then was true. One of the amendments we wanted to move was to extend the scheme from three years to five years. In effect, that is what we are doing today. What we said then was true and the government is now catching up. That is good to see. I hope that the scheme—which is still, I believe, being strangled by restrictions—can be looked at in terms of extending the time and that the government will also in the future look at reviewing the eligibility criteria. If it does not do that, this will be an opportunity which, once again, the government will have missed. I commend the bill. It is a good piece of legislation. The scheme needs to be extended. At this point, we support extending the time for its take-up.",SENATE,<title>RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS SCHEME EXTENSION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2000-08-31,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, in common with you I look forward to further instalments of Senator Woodley's travelogue and I am sure that we will all be, if not the wiser, better informed as a result of future contributions by the honourable senator. 
I thank senators for their cooperation in this debate. This bill extends the successful Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme for a further nine months. For the record, I point out that 1,724 farmers and their partners have in fact been assisted under this scheme. It has enabled them to pass the farm to the next generation, continuing the tradition of the family farm. The number of farmers assisted so far is close to the target of 2,100, which I understand was the figure referred to during the second reading speech when this legislation was introduced.
 Furthermore, there are a further 165 applicants that have been pre-assessed as eligible if they choose to go ahead. It should be remembered that this scheme is, in fact, demand driven. I understand that the figure of 10,000 may have been obtained from a media release that mentioned a preliminary review of ABARE farm survey data that suggested that as many as 10,000 farms could potentially meet the eligibility criteria for this measure. That figure has now been bandied around as somehow meaning that, of necessity, 10,000 would take it up. The simple fact is that that is what the ABARE figures indicated. When we introduced the legislation, we talked about a figure of 2,100. 
Senator Woodley and Senator Forshaw undoubtedly know that this is a demand driven scheme. Also, Senator Woodley would be very well aware of the cultural difficulties for farmers in actually moving off the land or saying that they are going to retire from farming. Farmers have great emotional attachment to their properties, and the thought of giving up farming is a great emotional adjustment that some of them have made and others have not found themselves able to make. As a result, I think it is a bit unfair to try to criticise the scheme because of the quite understandable emotional attachment of many farmers to their property.
As I indicated, the bill does not change the eligibility criteria in any other way. I think there is acceptance around the chamber that, as part of our AAA package, this was a good initiative. We can argue around the boundaries, but in general terms there is support for it. I thank honourable senators for their cooperation with this legislation.

Government Response  to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report on Childbirth Procedures “Rocking the Cradle”
Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care
August 2000
INTRODUCTION
The Government provides the following response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report “Rocking the Cradle - A Report into Childbirth Procedures”.  The Report provides an overview of antenatal, birthing and postnatal phases of maternal and infant care in childbirth across Australia and builds on earlier reports at state and national levels relating to maternity services.  Most of the views and recommendations of the Report however, are in the realm of State and Territory Government responsibilities or comment upon clinical decisions.  The Government does not consider that this form of inquiry is best suited to assess quality, safety and relevance in clinical matters.
The Committee found that Australia has a high rate of obstetric intervention compared to some other developed countries. However, as the Report notes, intervention rates vary considerably between countries. The Committee found that there is widespread satisfaction with the quality of birthing services available in this country.  
The Report draws attention to the significant improvements achieved in recent decades in maternal and infant mortality in Australia, this country's rates now comparing favourably with those of other first world countries.  Having a baby in Australia, by any standards, is a safe event for most women.  
The Report notes that many factors have contributed to the dramatic improvements in maternal and infant mortality in Australia and highlights the role that population health measures have played alongside other factors such as medical advances in treatment and application of technology.   
Government Approaches to Improving Australia's Health System
The Government is funding and driving programs of health system improvement on a scale greater than has been seen in Australia before.  Criteria of quality, safety, relevance, choice, equity of access and effectiveness based on evidence are paramount.  This Response to the Report outlines some relevant initiatives. 
The Government's view however, is that a vital element of these initiatives has been to foster decision-making at the level and area most suited to meeting regional, local community or individual needs. 
Needy Populations
The Report draws attention to the fact that aggregate data does not tell the whole story.  There are particular efforts in place to improve outcomes in childbirth for certain population groups, including Indigenous peoples, and those living in rural and remote Australia.
People Living in Rural and Remote Areas 
Improving the delivery of health and community services to Australians living in rural and remote regions is a major priority for the Government. In the 2000-01 Budget the Government introduced a $562 million Regional Health Strategy to improve health services in rural and regional Australia and to significantly increase the rural health workforce. Many of these measures are expected to have an impact on rural women receiving antenatal care ie: 
·	$49.5 million over four years to increase the range of allied health services available to rural and regional communities. This will enable rural GPs to employ nurses and allied health professionals to meet locally identified need. 
·	$48.4 million over four years for a rural specialist outreach program, which will allow rural residents to receive some specialist services in their own communities, rather than having to travel long distances. 
·	$68.9 million to expand the Regional Health Services Program introduced in the previous Budget. These centres draw together health, aged care and other community services to a central location providing a flexible mix of services based on community need.
·	$102.1 million over four years to increase the number of GP registrars in rural areas. 
Other measures announced in the Budget will enhance rural education and training for health professionals through additional University Departments of Rural Health, the establishment of additional clinical schools in rural and regional areas, and the provision of additional training scholarships. 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People
The Government continues to deliver on its commitment to improve the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with a focus on expanding primary health care services.  Building on initiatives announced in previous Budgets, the 1999 Budget boosted Commonwealth funding for this purpose by $100 million over four years. 
The greater part of this funding ($78.8 million) is being used to improve access for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to primary health care through the Primary Health Care Access Program. This initiative will establish a framework for the coordinated expansion of comprehensive health care services including clinical care, illness prevention and early intervention activities. 
For the first time, national performance indicators and targets for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health have been agreed to by all Australian Health Ministers. The indicators include measures relating to still births, infant deaths and low birth weight among Indigenous children.
With Commonwealth leadership, innovative service delivery models are being developed in collaboration with the Aboriginal controlled health sector, State and Territory Governments, General Practice and other health professionals.  These will build on current services and help integrate mainstream providers in delivering services, including maternal and child health services, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This will mean that the best mix of care is available to meet the health care needs of these clearly disadvantaged people. 
Leadership in Health
The Commonwealth's role in health is to provide strong national leadership in a collaborative process of health sector reform aimed at developing a strong population health approach to disease prevention, health promotion and education; to improve the availability of high quality, integrated and cost effective services with a strong consumer focus; and to develop a sound evidence base to support population health measures and clinical care and treatment. 
The Commonwealth provides leadership through working collaboratively with stakeholders to develop broad policy frameworks and through both the provision of funding and the purchase of services. 
The Government's reform agenda is consistent with the main thrust, and many of the recommendations, of “Rocking the Cradle” in that it aims to enhance continuity in care for consumers, to remove artificial barriers, and to encourage collaborative arrangements between health care providers at the community level.
Private Health Insurance
The Government is continuing to improve the attractiveness of private health insurance to the Australian population through key reforms that address affordability of premiums, innovative products and structural reform of the sector.  These reforms increase the level of patient choice in health care for all Australians.
The 30% rebate on health insurance premiums has addressed the issue of affordability for all Australians.
Lifetime Health Cover builds on the existing community rating system through a new, fairer and workable lifetime approach to health insurance cover.
The Government can also increase the attractiveness of the private health insurance product through regulatory change.  Steps have been taken to expand the models of care available to the privately insured that have previously been unavailable such as early discharge and hospital in the home care.
Industry efficiency benefits patients and their choice of care.  A consumer strategy focusing on greater patient education and information is underway.  Key features include a statement of what can be expected when holding private health cover and a trial of a consumer hotline are the first steps.
Through these and other reforms, the Government is active in ensuring the Australian population has a choice in health care.  This is of particular importance with respect to all aspects of care during pregnancy and childbirth.
Alternative Birthing Services
The Report commends the contribution that the Commonwealth has made towards the promotion of consumer choice in birthing services through providing incentive funds for the establishment of birthing centres in States and Territories under the Alternative Birthing Service Program.  ABSP funds also contributed towards the establishment of culturally appropriate birthing services for Indigenous women.  The Report places particular emphasis on the provision of culturally appropriate and comprehensive antenatal information for individual women according to their ethnicity and cultural backgrounds.   
Evidence Base
The Government has given priority to investing in research and information which will maximise the quality of services and the effectiveness of the health system.
The Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care has recently been established by all Health Ministers as a means of coordinating national actions to build upon the many safety and quality improvement activities taking place around Australia.  The new Council is a national partnership between governments, health care providers and consumers. It will contribute to improvements in the safety and quality of care for patients and help reduce the risk of adverse events. 
The National Institute of Clinical Studies, which will be established by the Commonwealth Government later this year, will also play a role in improving the quality of health care in Australia and ensuring the health system is underpinned by world's best clinical practice.  The Institute will work closely with stakeholders to identify, develop and promote best clinical practice throughout the public and private sectors. 
The Government has also invested in improvements to national information and data with a major focus being on the role of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. One of the particular activities that are funded through the auspices of AIHW is the National Perinatal Statistics Unit (NPSU). The NPSU has developed a number of data systems on women's reproductive health services and pregnancy outcomes services that cover the period from conception to birth and up to one year.  The NPSU publishes regular reports on mothers and babies including a separate report on Indigenous mothers and babies.
Research into the effectiveness of interventions, the development of best practice guidelines by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the co-sponsorship of the Australasian Cochrane Centre by the Government are contributing to the increase of knowledge and improving the basis for decision making. 
Commonwealth Funding Assistance to State and Territory Governments for Health Care   
For the greater part, the Report recommendations are concerned with service delivery issues which are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.  This observation was made in the minority report by Government Senators and included the comment that “the Federal Government should not be dictating to the States how they should be running services that fall within their responsibilities.”  
This view is consistent with the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, a statutory committee of the Australian Parliament.  In Report No 342 of November 1995 the JCPA Chairman stated:
The Committee believes that the Commonwealth needs to have a clearer focus on strategic planning and articulating SSP (Specific Purpose Payment) objectives in the community... the Commonwealth should progressively disengage itself from SPP micro-management, leaving this task to state governments and other non-Commonwealth parties to SPP agreements.  Primary accountability (by funded parties) to the Commonwealth should increasingly be for outcomes achieved rather than for inputs and processes.
The Committee went further in Recommendation 3 of the same Report ie:
Commonwealth departments administering SPPs involving more than one level of government should ensure that the SPP agreements do not prescribe the method of service delivery by another level of government.
Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements
In line with the JCPA recommendations the Commonwealth Government contributes towards the capacity of individual States and Territories to maintain and improve the general level of Australia's health through broad Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs).  The base funding in the PHOFAs resulted from the broadbanding of Commonwealth funding to States and Territories for eight established public health programs (SPPs), including the National Women's Health Program and the Alternative Birthing Services Program.   
The current PHOFAs are for a five-year period, 1999-2004 and will provide in excess of $900 million to States and Territories during that time. They focus strategically on maintenance of effort through the specification of annual performance reporting requirements for population health outcomes relating to the incorporated SPPs.  State and Territory Offices of Health and Aged Care collaborate with State and Territory Health Authorities in monitoring and reporting performance under the PHOFAs at the local level. The annual performance reports from the States and Territories are published on the website of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care. 
These funding Agreements are designed to provide States and Territories with the flexibility to `mix and match' Commonwealth financial assistance to meet the varying needs of their respective populations while at the same time ensuring that the States and Territories remain part of a nationally coordinated effort in areas of high national priority. 
Funding of Services
Commonwealth funding for public hospitals is provided through the 1998-2003 Australian Health Care Agreements (AHCAs). The Agreements are a vehicle both for committing Commonwealth funds to public hospital services delivered by the State and Territory Governments, and for instigating reform in the funding arrangements for acute health services.
Under the AHCAs the Commonwealth is providing substantial financial assistance to the States and Territories to meet the cost of public hospital services. Over the life of the Agreements, the States and Territories will receive total funding of around $31.3 billion, representing a 25 percent real increase in funding over the five years to 2002-03. State and Territory Governments have responsibility for, and indeed, are in the best position to, make decisions about the allocation of AHCA funding to public hospitals for particular purposes, including for the provision of obstetric services to women in rural and remote areas.
In addition to the core funding arrangements, the AHCAs also commit the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to working in partnership to achieve agreed health service delivery reform and set out a number of specific areas where reform of the health system and its funding may be advanced, including:
·	integration of care through measure and share arrangements;
·	information technology reform;
·	more responsive funding;
·	additional funding in the area of quality improvement and enhancement;
·	funding for the establishment of a National Health Development Fund.
The Government is also a major funder of prenatal and birthing care through Medicare payments for a wide range of antenatal, peri-natal and birthing services for pregnant women, apart from those using birthing centres or public patients using hospital based services. 
In 1998-99, $57.7 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of 1.55 million obstetrics services.  In addition, in 1998-99 $38.6 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of 514,014 ultrasound in pregnancy services.
Private health insurers are also a major source of funding for all aspects of care during pregnancy and childbirth.  While an indepth consideration of the role of the private insurance providers was not included in the Committee's Terms of Reference, Committee members did acknowledge that the availability of private health insurance is providing many women with real options in antenatal care and birthing services. 
Conclusion
Initiatives of this Government across the spectrum of funding of States and Territories, private health insurance, rural health, Indigenous health and quality in health provision have established an environment in which quality, choice, equity and effectiveness in health service provision can flourish as never before.  In this environment, the Government is confident that the relevant decision-makers can assess the recommendations of the Report “Rocking the Cradle - A Report into Childbirth Procedures.”.
While the delivery of medical and midwifery services is the responsibility of State and Territory health authorities, as well as clinicians in their support of patients, the Government has endeavoured as far as possible to provide responses to individual recommendations in this Report from the Opposition Members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee.  These responses are set out below. 
(Note that a sequential numbering system has been added to the set of recommendations to assist in identifying the responses.)
CHAPTER 2: ANTENATAL CARE
Recommendation 1:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to implement the recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council as they relate to continuity of care and shared care during pregnancy and birth.   
The Government draws on the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines as part of its evidence base for national strategic planning across the full spectrum of health care including obstetric care.  
The range of antenatal services available in Australia is extensive and Australian women have generally enjoyed access to a high standard of care during pregnancy and birthing. Maternity services are often based on a traditional model of obstetric care, with women in hospital being cared for by a team headed by a general practitioner or specialist obstetrician. 
The Commonwealth is currently working with the States and Territories to provide better integration of care through the following provisions in the Australian Health Care Agreements for patients using public hospital services and through other mechanisms to ensure integrated approaches to population health and primary health care.
Australian Health Care Agreements
National Health Development Fund
The National Health Development Fund (NHDF) has been established to foster innovation in hospital services provision through funding projects at the regional or State wide scale that improve:
·	patient outcomes;
·	efficiency and effectiveness in, or reduce the demand for, the delivery of public hospital services; and
·	integration of care between public hospital services and broader health and community care services.
Approximately $253 million in Commonwealth funding is available over the life of the Agreements for projects that bring about long term improvements in health care delivery. 
Measure and Share Provisions
Under the Measure and Share provisions of the Australian Health Care Agreements the Commonwealth and the States and Territories have agreed to work on proposals for improving the integration of service delivery by removing artificial Commonwealth/State financial barriers.  Decisions relating to the aspects of service delivery arrangements that are brought forward for consideration in relation to measure and share proposals remain with State and Territory Governments.
The National Demonstration Hospitals Program (NDHP)
Since 1995 the NDHP has funded time-limited, demonstration projects in selected hospitals to explore and develop new approaches to the organisation and delivery of acute care service. 
Of the projects funded by the NDHP in major tertiary teaching hospitals over two thirds have taken place in hospitals with a substantial component of midwifery patients. Of the other 60 projects funded by the program, over three quarters have been in hospitals that provide care for some midwifery patients. 
Divisions of General Practice Strategy  
A sizeable number of Divisions of General Practice are involved in shared care arrangements for obstetric patients, such as the Brisbane Southside Collaboration referred to in the earlier Submission to the Committee from the Department of Health and Aged Care.  This Collaboration is a linked project between a GP Division and a major hospital as part of the National Demonstration Hospitals Program. The focus is on piloting antenatal and postnatal shared care and in its evaluation information will be sought about patient and provider satisfaction as well as clinical outcomes.
Recommendation 2:
The Committee recommends that all pregnant women in Australia be provided with a maternity record by their principal carer giving details of their health as it relates to their pregnancy and any test results or treatment, with a duplicate to be held by their principal carer.  
The issue of health consumer access to personal health information is an important one and one which this Government is addressing within the context of its planned Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000, which includes a commitment to consumer access to personal information. 
Many Divisions of General Practice have programs targeting obstetric shared care, including several with a focus on antenatal and postnatal shared care.  A number of these programs include the use of patient held personal record cards throughout pregnancy.   The Government would be interested to see more widespread application of such approaches.  
Recommendation 3:
Commonwealth Government fund major tertiary hospitals to extend the provision of satellite clinics and visiting teams of obstetricians to assist women in rural and remote areas.  
The Commonwealth Government is committed to improving access to specialist services in rural and regional Australia. The 2000-01 Budget provides $48.4 million over four years for a rural outreach program for specialist services. This will include incentives and/or travel costs for specialists to conduct outreach specialty work and to act as mentors for local health professionals to help them increase their skills. The program will be implemented in collaboration with the States and Territories, as well as specialist colleges, divisions of general practice and rural workforce agencies. The program will target a range of specialist services and geographical areas based on need.
This initiative complements the existing Commonwealth initiative to establish specialist training posts in rural areas, under which four rural registrar posts in obstetrics and gynaecology were funded in 1999. It also complements the efforts of State and Territory Governments to increase the presence of specialists in rural and regional areas. In addition the Commonwealth has funded a female obstetrician post attached to the University Department of Rural Health in Victoria, to address the needs of Muslim women in the Hume Region.
Recommendation 4:
The Committee recommends that the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health provide recurrent funding to ensure continuity for existing antenatal programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and to establish new programs in areas of need.  
The Government contributes towards the provision of antenatal programs for Indigenous families through its funding of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. As outlined in the Introduction, the Commonwealth emphasis is on improved access to primary health care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and will be achieved in two ways: 
·	expansion of Aboriginal community controlled primary health care services; and 
·	improved orientation of mainstream services to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  
Further expansion of community controlled primary health care services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is aligned with the continued development of regional planning processes, which are the mechanism for identifying agreed priority areas of need. The expansion of primary health care through the increased federal budget commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health will support the continuation and improved development of ante-natal and post-natal programs in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations.
Recommendation 5:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to reinstate programs to assist women from non English speaking backgrounds to gain access to antenatal services, using funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.
Recommendation 6:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to promote antenatal programs targetted to adolescent mothers.  
Recommendation 7:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that comprehensive, accurate and objective information is made available to all pregnant women on the antenatal and birth options available to them, with funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements. 
AND
Recommendation 8:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that comprehensive, accurate and current information is made available to all principal carers of pregnant women about the antenatal and birth options and services available in their area, with funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.  
As outlined in the Introduction, responsibility for delivery of population health measures rests primarily with State and Territory Governments and with Divisions of General Practice and individual GP's. The Commonwealth has a broad policy leadership and financing role in promoting population health action including the integration of population health within the wider health system. The Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) are broadbanded funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories that set out in a single Agreement the ongoing Commonwealth funding provisions for a number of public health programs including the National Women's Health Program and the Alternative Birthing Services Program. 
State and Territory Governments have the flexibiltiy and the responsibility under the PHOFAs to allocate resources according to local priorities and population needs while maintaining effort and reporting annually against agreed national performance indicators set out in the funding agreements.  Decisions about funding allocations to women's health services, including birthing and pregnancy support services are the responsibility of State and Territory health authorities.  
Recommendation 9:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments  to ensure that antenatal information is made available to all Indigenous women in a language and format that meets their needs, with funding provided through the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health.  
Through the allocation of resources to establish and maintain comprehensive primary health care services, regional planning processes, and commitment to community consultation, the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) supports provision of culturally appropriate information in identified areas of need. In order to be appropriate, information must be locally tailored. OATSIH funded Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations are well placed to contribute to the development and provision of this information. Facilities available through local tertiary health services should be accessible to the Aboriginal community controlled sector to ensure integration of culturally appropriate materials in mainstream health programs as well.
Recommendation 10:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that antenatal information is made available to all women from non English speaking backgrounds in a language and format that meets their needs, with funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.
See response to recommendations 5,6,7 and 8 above. 
Recommendation 11:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research  Council, in conjunction with professional medical bodies and midwives' organisations, establish guidelines governing the prior provision of counselling and information on all antenatal screening tests, for adoption and implementation by the professional bodies.
AND
Recommendation 12:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council, in conjunction with professional medical bodies and midwives' organisations, establish guidelines governing the provision of counselling and information on the benefits and disadvantages of the various forms of intervention which may be required by women during birth, for adoption and implementation by the professional bodies. 
The Committee's recommendation has been referred to the NHMRC for consideration and possible inclusion in its work plan for the 2000 - 2002 triennium.
Recommendation 13:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that adequate and appropriate antenatal education classes are generally available, using funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.  
See response to recommendations 5,6,7 and 8 above.
CHAPTER 3: ANTENATAL SCREENING SERVICES
Ultrasound in Pregnancy
The Commonwealth has a strong commitment to ensuring that Australian women have access to high quality, cost effective obstetric ultrasound services through Medicare. The Department of Health and Aged Care is responsible for managing the Medicare funding of ultrasound and other diagnostic imaging services. 
As part of this management, the Department has established the Diagnostic Imaging Agreement with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR).  The purpose of this agreement is to foster the joint management of Medicare funding for diagnostic imaging between the Commonwealth and the profession. The Agreement is intended to ensure that patients can access high quality, clinically appropriate and affordable diagnostic imaging services. 
The Department has introduced a number of initiatives to improve the quality use of pregnancy related ultrasound.  These initiatives include funding for the development of accreditation and quality assurance for providers of obstetric ultrasound, the introduction of professional supervision requirements for ultrasound, and referral of new technologies, such as nuchal translucency, to the Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) for assessment of evidence and appropriateness. 
As part of the management of diagnostic imaging, the Department has undertaken a systematic restructure of the Medicare obstetric ultrasound items. 
The changes, effective from 1 February 2000, introduce new obstetric ultrasound items that cover the full range of services provided in pregnancy, and that fund these services according to their complexity. New items are provided for early, mid and late pregnancy ultrasound, and for more complex services. The new items also introduce clinical indicators to ensure that ultrasound services are provided when clinically necessary for the good management of the pregnancy.  
It is important to recognise that while the Department can make changes to the Medicare obstetric ultrasound items, a significant proportion of obstetric ultrasound is carried out within the public hospital system, and in accordance with the provisions of the AHCAs, decisions relating to service delivery in public hospitals are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. 
Recommendation 14:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council develop standards for the training of operators of all obstetrical ultrasound equipment and for those who interpret the results of those tests. 
The Committee's recommendation has been referred to NHMRC for consideration and possible inclusion in its work plan for 2000-02 triennium.
The Government has provided nearly $400,000 to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) over the past 3 years to develop and implement standards for accreditation of medical imaging practices. The College is covering all modalities of medical imaging in this exercise, including obstetrical ultrasound. 
In addition, the Government is providing $80,000 to the Australasian Sonographer Accreditation Register (ASAR) to develop, establish and implement a mechanism for the accreditation of Sonography training and education programs. 
The Department is also negotiating the provision of $100,000 to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) and the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (NASOG) for the development of Continuing Medical Education and Quality Assurance Program (CME & QA) requirements for obstetric and gynaecological ultrasound practice. 
In recognition of the particular problems facing rural areas, funding is also being provided to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, to work with the RANZCR and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), to develop, establish and implement a CME & QA for general practitioners who utilise ultrasound under exemptions contained in the legislation governing ultrasound and payment of Medicare Benefits.    
The four major Colleges concerned with obstetric ultrasound have agreed to work with the Government to develop appropriate CME & QA and accreditation standards for adoption by all Colleges.
Recommendation 15:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council develop guidelines governing the safe use of all obstetrical ultrasound equipment. 
The safety of medical service provision is principally a State responsibility.  However, the Commonwealth is strongly committed to ensuring that services funded under Medicare are safe, clinically appropriate and reflect best practice, and has introduced initiatives to ensure this.  Several of these initiatives impact on the use of obstetric ultrasound equipment.  See response to recommendation 14 above also. 
Recommendation 16:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council develop or coordinate the development of evidence based assessments of the efficacy of routine ultrasound scanning in pregnancy and that it conduct a cost benefit analysis of current ultrasound practices. 
AND
Recommendation 17:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council conduct or oversee the conduct of an Australian multicentre trial of nuchal fold screening to determine its efficacy for use among pregnant women generally, and among those considered at particular risk of carrying babies with Down's Syndrome. 
The Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is an independent committee which has been established to provide advice to the Minister for Health and Aged Care on the strength of evidence available on new medical technologies and procedures in terms of their safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness.  
The MSAC process involves the rigorous assessment and classification of evidence from available medical research according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) four-point hierarchy of evidence. The findings of MSAC help inform Government decisions about which new medical services should attract funding under Medicare.
MSAC is currently establishing a committee to examine the nuchal translucency test and its use in early pregnancy ultrasound. 
Recommendation 18:
The Committee recommends that earlier recommendations relating to the training of operators and the regulation of equipment used in routine ultrasound screening should also apply to nuchal fold screening. 
Any action on this recommendation is dependent on the evidence that emerges from the MSAC evaluation of the nuchal translucency test. 
CHAPTER 4: CARE DURING BIRTH
Recommendation 19:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure the continuation and expansion of hospital birthing centres.  
The Government notes the Report's findings on consumer satisfaction with birthing centres in public hospitals as a service of choice for many pregnant women.   The Government also notes the Committee's support for the expansion of birthing centres as part of the mainstream health system, with funding from hospital budgets.  This is a matter for State and Territory Governments to determine in the context of their own budgets.  It should be noted however that the Australian Health Care Agreements do not:
·	require State and Territory Governments to ensure the continuation and expansion of hospital birthing services;
·	afford the Commonwealth the authority to raise issues regarding the direction of funds to particular purposes with State and Territory Ministers.
Decisions relating to the allocation of AHCA funding to public hospitals for particular purposes, including for the continuation and expansion of hospital birthing centres, rest with State and Territory Governments.
The Commonwealth provided funding under the Alternative Birthing Services Program to pilot increased options in birthing services including the establishment of new birthing centres.  The Alternative Birthing Services Program is one of the broadbanded programs within the PHOFAs. States and Territories are required to provide annual performance reports covering the broadbanded programs, including for example reporting the number of midwife based birthing services established in the publicly funded health care system.   
Recommendation 20:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government continue to fund midwives to assist at home births for women at low risk through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.  
See the response to recommendations 5,6,7 and 8 above.  
Recommendation 21:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who have to give birth outside their communities by funding an accompanying family member, with funding provided through their patient transfer assistance schemes.  
Funding under the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) was transferred to States and Territories who are now responsible for the management and funding of this Scheme. It has been recognised however that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's access has been problematic and that the need to travel long distances to give birth and lack of family support is a major issue for Indigenous people in remote locations. 
The issue was raised by the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) members at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Council in 1997 - 98.  As a result, the Council referred the matter to the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC). The Department is now awaiting the outcome of AHMAC consideration of this issue.
Recommendation 22:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, through the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, fund culturally appropriate birthing services, either in hospitals or stand alone, in centres with large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. 
Tertiary care services are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.  Decisions relating to the allocation of AHCA funding to public hospitals for particular purposes, including culturally appropriate birthing services, rest with State and Territory Governments.
CHAPTER 5: INTERVENTIONS IN CHILDBIRTH - CAESAREAN SECTION
Recommendation 23:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council work with the relevant professional bodies to develop best practice guidelines for elective Caesarean sections. 
The NHMRC has had an ongoing interest in antenatal care, and in 1996 published the paper Options for effective childbirth that explored the then predominantly medically-based model of childbirth procedures, and offered other options without compromising the desire of consumers for safety.  Subsequent to the release of the paper, the need for clear information for consumers on elective caesarean sections was identified, and the NHMRC is currently working with key organisations to prepare appropriate literature.
Recommendation 24:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to decide a target rate for Caesarean sections, moving towards the target of 15% recommended by the World Health Organisation.  
As the Committee Report notes, the rates for Caesarean sections vary greatly between countries. The Government believes that the key issue is to ensure adoption of best practice guidelines for elective Caesarean sections and to ensure women have appropriate information available to them.  Setting targets does not necessarily address these issues although it may point to issues of differential practice that the profession may then address.  Establishment of targets also raises the issue of what happens when that figure is reached and women who want, or need, a procedure, cannot be given it.  
Under the AHCAs, State and Territory Governments are responsible for ensuring the provision of public hospital services, including admitted and non-admitted patient services, free of charge to public patients on the basis of clinical need and within a clinically appropriate period.  Against this background, the AHCAs do not afford the Commonwealth the authority to raise issues with State and Territory Governments regarding the target rate for Caesarean sections in relation to public hospital services.
Recommendation 25:
The Committee recommends that the Joint Maternity Services Committee monitor the implementation of best practice guidelines for Caesarean sections and report upon the extent to which individual hospitals meet the proposed target for Caesarean sections of 15%.  
As the Report notes, membership of the Joint Committee on Maternity Services includes representatives from the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Australian College of Midwives Incorporated. The Committee is largely inactive at present.  Any broader role for this Committee would need to be taken up by the Colleges involved. 
See also the response to recommendation 24 above.
CHAPTER 7: BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR ANTENATAL CARE AND FOR CARE DURING BIRTH
Recommendation 26:
The Committee recommends that research and guidelines on the use of routine ultrasound in pregnancy be an immediate priority for the National Health and Medical Research Council.   An earlier recommendation set out those aspects of routine ultrasound requiring urgent attention. 
As a general rule the NHMRC does not dictate what research will be undertaken.  The NHMRC directs the majority of funds on the basis of scientific excellence in research to projects initiated by the research community itself.  While most research is investigator-initiated, the Strategic Research Development Committee (SRDC) of NHMRC is charged with identifying and filling gaps in the national research effort.  The SRDC has recently completed consultative workshops around Australia to inform the setting of the SRDC research agenda.  Peak organisations are asked to nominate issues they believe are important, addressing specific criteria which include measures of the burden of the disease and whether the issue is of particular relevance to Australia.  
The Senate Committee's recommendation has been referred to the NHMRC for further consideration.
Recommendation 27:
The Committee recommends the enhancement of the Joint Committee on Maternity Services to include professional groups involved in antenatal, birth and post natal care as well as consumers. The Joint Committee should have responsibility for advising Ministers on the implementation and evaluation of best practice guidelines in maternal and infant health care and on measures to reduce current fragmentation in the provision of maternal and infant health services.  
See response to recommendation 25 above.
Recommendation 28:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure the annual publication of a list of all of its hospitals where births take place, with statistics on each of the birth-related interventions performed there and the insurance status of the women on whom they are performed. 
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) is an independent health and welfare statistics and information agency within the portfolio of Health and Aged Care.  AIHW has responsibility, in collaboration with the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the development, collection and publication of national health and welfare statistics.  AIHW considers that a national report could be produced containing information on birth related interventions, if appropriate funding was available.  
However, for confidentiality reasons such a report would not be able to include information identified at the establishment level. 
CHAPTER 8: POST NATAL CARE
Recommendation 29:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that maternity and infant welfare services are in place to assist women following their return home after childbirth. 
State and Territory Governments have responsibility for the provision of maternity and infant welfare services.  
Recommendation 30:
The Committee recommends that community care services for women discharged early from hospital following childbirth be eligible for funding through the National Demonstration Hospitals Program. 
See response to recommendation 29 above.
Recommendation 31:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council conduct research into post natal depression. 
As discussed in the response to recommendation 26, while most research is investigator initiated, the Strategic Research Development Committee (SRDC) of NHMRC is charged with identifying and filling gaps in the national research effort.  The Committee's recommendation for research has been referred to the NHMRC for further consideration in that context. 
In 1998 the NHMRC was commissioned by the Department of Health and Aged Care to develop information on postnatal depression that would assist clinicians to detect and treat the disorder. The NHMRC completed the project in November 1999 and endorsed the publication Postnatal depression: a systematic review of published scientific literature 
1980-1999.   The paper presents a review of current literature that may be useful for practitioners and consumers to understand the condition, and inform clinical management decisions.  
CHAPTER 9: FUNDING ISSUES
Recommendation 32:
The Committee recommends that the Health Insurance Commission monitor the new Medicare rebate for complex births to ensure that it does not lead to overservicing.
The Department is monitoring the use of this item on an ongoing basis using Health Insurance Commission data.  Monitoring is based on the appropriateness of item use as well as the identification of possible overservicing.  The Department is working with the Health Insurance Commission in this regard. 
Recommendation 33:
The Committee recommends that the Health Insurance Act be amended to define as `patients' all neonates in hospital who require medical attention, regardless of whether they are located with their mothers or not.  
The Government considers that there is no logic in admitting to a hospital, well persons (in this case well newborn babies), as they do not require the acute and intense medical and nursing care provided in a hospital setting.  This arrangement has been well-established for many years and is accepted by all State and Territory health authorities and the health insurance and private hospital industries, as is evidenced by the definition of `admitted patient' contained in the National Health Data Dictionary (Version 9, 2000, pp. 265-257).
As the Committee noted, where a neonate requires care which is available in a location separate from its mother in accordance with agreed standards for neonatal care facilities, then the neonate is considered to be an admitted patient.  The Department of Health and Aged Care consults regularly with the Division of Paediatrics, Royal Australasian College of Physicians, regarding standards for the treatment of neonates.  The College recently reviewed these standards and indicated to the Department that they remain current.
However, given recent advances in technology and treatments for seriously ill newborns, the Department has also requested the College to review whether babies with certain serious conditions might be safely accommodated and treated next to the mother's bedside rather than in an approved special care nursery.  Their advice will inform possible future developments in the standards for the treatment of neonates.
CHAPTER 10: LITIGATION AND OBSTETRIC PRACTICE AND PROVISION
Recommendation 34:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare establish national comprehensive data on medical defence organisations to cover negligence cases and include such data as premium payments, number of cases, number of claims, number of out of court settlements, size of payments and size of fund reserves.  
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare advises that to undertake such a collection would require the support of indemnity insurers and substantial additional resources. The Government does not agree that this recommendation is a priority or that there is sound evidence to support funds being allocated to this at this point in time.
Recommendation 35:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government establish an independent inquiry into medical indemnity and litigation, including the impact of litigation and indemnity on the provision and practice of obstetric services, alternative approaches to the funding of medical litigation and alternative approaches to the funding of compensation for disability.  
The Government does not believe that an independent inquiry into medical indemnity is appropriate at this point in time.  These matters will be best handled through the current consultative process between the Department of Health and Aged Care and the profession.
As an example, following the Australian Medical Association's proposal of a Cerebral Palsy compensation scheme at their summit of 10 December 1999, the Department of Health and Aged Care has met with the profession in relation to the medical indemnity issue and will continue to do so in order to properly pursue these issues.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-08-31,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This government response is a welcomed government response, and one that is much more timely than others in the past. The report itself raises some very important questions, and in some ways I appreciate having, in this response from government, a fairly clear description of what I think is a major area of difficulty. One of the things our report found was that Australia was a country with one of the highest caesarean section rates in the world, and that if you were privately insured you were much more likely to have a caesarean section than if you were a patient in the public sector. Evidence provided to the committee showed there was no clear reason why that should be the case.
I received a report today, Thursday 31 August—I think it is probably off my email—which said that, in the United States, after years of decline, caesarean sections are on the rise again. The evidence in the report from America is extremely similar to what we found in our report: that there is a very big difference between caesarean section rates across the country and that there is a much higher likelihood of caesarean sections for women if they are privately insured than if they are public patients. That seems to me to be, first of all, worthy of very serious investigation and follow-up. The government's response says:
Most of the views and recommendations of the Report however, are in the realm of State and Territory Government responsibilities or comment upon clinical decisions. The Government does not consider that this form of inquiry—
presumably a Senate inquiry—
is best suited to assess quality, safety and relevance in clinical matters.
It says four paragraphs later:
Government Approaches to Improving Australia's Health System
The Government is funding and driving programs of health system improvement on a scale greater than has been seen in Australia before. Criteria of quality, safety, relevance, choice, equity of access and effectiveness based on evidence are paramount. This Response to the Report outlines some relevant initiatives.
My first-up confusion about this is that paragraph 1 says that quality, safety and relevance are judged as clinical matters and outside the purview of a Senate inquiry, while paragraph 5 says that quality, safety, relevance, choice, access and effectiveness are criteria for the federal government's health policy. If we do not want to have a brawl, could I please have some further clarification? If, as the government say, they are concerned that quality, safety, relevance and choice, for example, are criteria by which you would judge an Australian health system but not this report because some of those applied to clinical matters, then I am nothing if not confused about what is the government's response in this area.
I am particularly concerned when they say that a lot of our recommendations go to things like how services are delivered in the states, but the states' way of delivering the services is outside the responsibility of the federal government. However, the federal government provide, through broad public health outcome funding agreements—PHOFAs—funding to state and territory governments and have agreements with them for delivering those services. If a caesarean section rate is not an outcome, what is it? If I seriously wanted to know how to judge in an appropriate way—without intruding on clinical professional decisions and without intruding on states' rights to do things—where Commonwealth dollars allocated to childbirth and delivery go in this country, then the way I measure this is in outcomes. What is the caesarean section rate if it is not an outcome? The caesarean section rate is merely data counting. It would be entirely proper for the federal government to be concerned about an outcome under their public health outcome funding agreements where caesarean section rates are higher in this country than anywhere else in the world and higher by a significant factor for privately insured patients and higher from one state to another. 
My own state of South Australia, as I recollect, has the highest figure, or it did in the findings of our report. When we asked if that had anything to do with the state having the highest number of obstetricians, there was some concern that there might be a correlation. We concluded that, as they were the only people who could do caesarean sections, it was a very valid reason to worry. The American data shows just that. In fact, one college in America is concerned that the only differences between caesarean section rates are the practices and the habits of doctors. We were also told of one doctor who went to a large public hospital in South Australia and had set out to significantly lower the caesarean section rate. He was very successful in doing this. There was no increase in infant mortality or maternal damage. There was just a significant lowering of the caesarean section rate in the public hospital and, interestingly, an allied reduction in the caesarean section rate amongst the private practitioners in the environs of that hospital. We also heard that this same pattern happened when a senior obstetrician in Tasmania set out to look at the figures in Tasmania and to work with clinicians to see if that figure could not be lowered. I have been talking about caesarean section rates, but the figures are on the increase for all interventions in childbirth—be they episiotomies, vacuum extractions, the use of forceps, medication, epidurals, anaesthetics and so on.
I thank the government for the response, but I have to remark on the way they have said that a number of our recommendations belong in the state and territory area and that, therefore, the Commonwealth does not want to have much say about them. When the Commonwealth directly funds those programs with precious Commonwealth taxpayer dollars, I would like to know how the Commonwealth is so easily able to say, `We handball that to the states; it is not our responsibility.'
I heard, during question time today, considerable kudos being claimed for itself by the government, for how it has reduced through the immunisation program the number of people who have had measles, mumps, diphtheria and so on. The immunisation program is a classic Commonwealth-state program. It is a service delivered by the states, providing data to the Commonwealth, and it is a very good example—and I think the Commonwealth properly can claim some responsibility for reducing immunisation rates. But it does not do this by saying, `Don't talk to us about those figures; that is a state matter; we do not really have any responsibility for it.' Yes, the Commonwealth does have. It has clear responsibility under its own public health outcomes funding agreements. I want to know what they call `outcomes'. I am also concerned about how I can go to the estimates and find out how our Commonwealth dollars are being spent on health and on obstetric services. To be met by the Commonwealth saying, `Well, it's really a state matter—talk to them,' is not, I believe, a sufficient answer or justification. As I say, it is quite contrary to what they are claiming in the area of immunisation.
There are some other points here that I think are very important. The government clearly recognises the importance of our inquiry and agrees that some of the recommendations we have made should be picked up on, particularly where we have asked whether the NHMRC could pick up and develop the research, and so on. The Commonwealth also says—and this is a concern for me—that it has a very direct responsibility for something like, for example, ultrasound—and indeed this report tells us that in 1998-99 $38.6 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of ultrasound. But they then go on to say that a lot of the ultrasound work is done in public hospitals, and that that is a state funding matter and not something that the Commonwealth would concern itself about.
I find that extremely disappointing, because half of the funding to our public hospitals is from the Commonwealth and also because the criterion for reasonable and decent ultrasound has to apply in the public as well as the private sector—and some of that is acknowledged by the Commonwealth in its response to other recommendations. Importantly, continuity of care—which we found so important in reducing caesarean section rates and in having happier mothers and happier babies—is certainly given support by the Commonwealth. The government says in its response that some of its funding is going very much into that kind of area, and so I acknowledge that support for the recommendations we made in that area. I think it was an invaluable report from the Senate. The government's response is largely positive but, as I say, its qualification about some of these matters being state government responsibilities does not hold water and does not assist with outcomes for Australian women.  ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-08-31,"—I wish to make a few comments on the government's response to the report from the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on childbirth procedures, called Rocking the cradle: a report into childbirth procedures. It is an interesting coverage that Senator Crowley, as chairman, has just given in the response to the response, in terms of dismissing the way in which the states are responsible for funding of these procedures. My comments when the report of the committee was handed down were the same as they were when the reference was put to the committee, and they are the same as those I will make today. These are issues that are within the responsibility of the states. That did not seem to matter; we still went ahead with the inquiry.
Interestingly enough, I suppose one should also draw attention to the fact that, while there is little doubt that caesarean section numbers have increased over time, if one were to listen to the Labor opposition senators one would think that that has only occurred since this government has been in office. It has not. The trend rates quite clearly show that the increase has been happening for many years. Be that as it may, why then, when Labor were in government for 13 years, did they not act—if it is possible now, according to Labor—to have it reduced? I do not understand that. Anyway, my answer to that is that there is no doubt that the rate is high. Evidence has shown that. But my question still remains: how do governments, or in fact Senate committees, change that? They cannot. The decisions on the procedures that people undergo at any time are the decisions of clinical practice and decisions that are made between doctors and patients: not through senators, not via ministers of health and not via governments—and may I say thanks very much for that; I am glad of that.
I want to make sure that the government position is clear on the way in which we have increased funding in so many areas. One of the most important things for the government is the committee finding of widespread satisfaction with the quality of birthing services available in this country. Maternal and infant mortality rates are the lowest they have ever been in Australia and they compare favourably with the rest of the world's, and that is solid proof that Australia's health policies are working. We should not be under any misapprehension about the level of satisfaction that exists.
The report identifies some concerns about access to antenatal services for women living in rural and remote areas. I just want to make sure that the Senate understands what has been done in that area, because much evidence was given of the concerns of rural and regional people. An amount of $49.5 million was allocated over four years in the 2000-01 budget to increase the range of allied health professionals working with GPs to meet locally identified needs. Another allocation of $48.4 million was made over four years to improve access to specialist services in rural and regional Australia—and that, I might add, complements the existing initiative to establish specialist training posts in rural areas, including four registrar posts in obstetrics and gynaecology that were funded in 1999. Another amount of $68.9 million was allocated to expand the Regional Health Service Program—and these centres in rural communities will draw together a flexible mix of service based on community need. Also, $102.1 million was allocated over four years to increase the number of GP registrars in rural areas. It is important to note that these things have all been done since the coalition government has been in office. They were not undertaken under the previous government over 13 years.
The report commends the contribution that the government has made towards promoting greater choice for women giving birth under the Alternative Birthing Service Program. As the report points out, the birth centres have been an outstanding success in terms of both medical outcome and consumer satisfaction. Many of the states and territories have continued to fund models that were initiated by the program. 
But the government is particularly proud of a current initiative that it has put in place—and that supports rural women's access to appropriate antenatal information in their community. Under the fly-in female general practitioner service, about four times each year female GPs will visit up to 160 locations across the country where women do not have such local services.
This government also shares the concern of the committee about higher death rates for indigenous mothers and babies compared to the rest of the population. As a large proportion of indigenous people live in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are expected to be major beneficiaries of the new regional health strategy—and that has been particularly targeted for them and needs to be acknowledged.
The government has, I believe, demonstrated its commitment to improve the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through recent initiatives. The 1999 budget, for example, boosted Commonwealth funding by $100 million over the next four years, most of which will be used to improve access for ATSI people to primary health care. This expansion of primary health care will support the continuation and improved development of antenatal and postnatal programs in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. For the first time also, national performance indicators and targets for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health have been agreed to by all Australian health ministers. These indicators include indigenous stillbirths, infant deaths and low birth weight. A strong emphasis on the Alternative Birthing Service Program has been to establish a culturally appropriate birthing service for indigenous women, such as the community based service for Koori women in Victoria.
I would draw the attention of senators to the fact that the recommendations in this report, as I mentioned before, are basically the words of opposition senators—and that is why the government senators provided the minority report in which we pointed out that most of the subject matter of this inquiry into childbirth procedures is, in fact, outside the jurisdiction of the federal government. The delivery of medical and midwifery services are the responsibility of state and territory health authorities—and we must not forget that. We must not start and try to intervene, as members of parliament or as governments, in those clinical practices. It is not the role of the Commonwealth to dictate how states and territories should be running services that fall within their responsibilities. The Labor government did not do it, we do not do it—and we do not see a future in making that a practice.
This government has good cause to be proud of the contribution it is making to enhancing childbirth outcomes for Australian families. Initiatives across the spectrum of funding to states and territories—private health insurance, rural health, indigenous health and quality and health provision—have established an environment in which quality, choice, equity and effectiveness in health service provision can flourish as never before. Clearly, this government is providing strong national leadership in this area and a broadly based structural reform.
I think Dr Wooldridge really does need to be congratulated for what he has done as health minister since 1996—and in consultation, in many respects, with Senator Herron, the minister for Aboriginal affairs. Both Dr Wooldridge and Senator Herron are medical practitioners. Both are abundantly aware of the real problems being experienced by the indigenous population, and both are abundantly aware of the real problems being experienced by rural and remote communities. They have spent many hours, many weeks, many months in fact, if you total it all up—the time in opposition and since in government—in making sure that their understanding of the requirements are known—and not only known but acted upon. I think this government really does need to be congratulated for the efforts it has put into allocating millions and millions of dollars and resources to give people in country areas and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities far better access to health across the board—not just in childbirth procedures.

Government Response  to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report on Childbirth Procedures “Rocking the Cradle”
Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care
August 2000
INTRODUCTION
The Government provides the following response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report “Rocking the Cradle - A Report into Childbirth Procedures”.  The Report provides an overview of antenatal, birthing and postnatal phases of maternal and infant care in childbirth across Australia and builds on earlier reports at state and national levels relating to maternity services.  Most of the views and recommendations of the Report however, are in the realm of State and Territory Government responsibilities or comment upon clinical decisions.  The Government does not consider that this form of inquiry is best suited to assess quality, safety and relevance in clinical matters.
The Committee found that Australia has a high rate of obstetric intervention compared to some other developed countries. However, as the Report notes, intervention rates vary considerably between countries. The Committee found that there is widespread satisfaction with the quality of birthing services available in this country.  
The Report draws attention to the significant improvements achieved in recent decades in maternal and infant mortality in Australia, this country's rates now comparing favourably with those of other first world countries.  Having a baby in Australia, by any standards, is a safe event for most women.  
The Report notes that many factors have contributed to the dramatic improvements in maternal and infant mortality in Australia and highlights the role that population health measures have played alongside other factors such as medical advances in treatment and application of technology.   
Government Approaches to Improving Australia's Health System
The Government is funding and driving programs of health system improvement on a scale greater than has been seen in Australia before.  Criteria of quality, safety, relevance, choice, equity of access and effectiveness based on evidence are paramount.  This Response to the Report outlines some relevant initiatives. 
The Government's view however, is that a vital element of these initiatives has been to foster decision-making at the level and area most suited to meeting regional, local community or individual needs. 
Needy Populations
The Report draws attention to the fact that aggregate data does not tell the whole story.  There are particular efforts in place to improve outcomes in childbirth for certain population groups, including Indigenous peoples, and those living in rural and remote Australia.
People Living in Rural and Remote Areas 
Improving the delivery of health and community services to Australians living in rural and remote regions is a major priority for the Government. In the 2000-01 Budget the Government introduced a $562 million Regional Health Strategy to improve health services in rural and regional Australia and to significantly increase the rural health workforce. Many of these measures are expected to have an impact on rural women receiving antenatal care ie: 
·	$49.5 million over four years to increase the range of allied health services available to rural and regional communities. This will enable rural GPs to employ nurses and allied health professionals to meet locally identified need. 
·	$48.4 million over four years for a rural specialist outreach program, which will allow rural residents to receive some specialist services in their own communities, rather than having to travel long distances. 
·	$68.9 million to expand the Regional Health Services Program introduced in the previous Budget. These centres draw together health, aged care and other community services to a central location providing a flexible mix of services based on community need.
·	$102.1 million over four years to increase the number of GP registrars in rural areas. 
Other measures announced in the Budget will enhance rural education and training for health professionals through additional University Departments of Rural Health, the establishment of additional clinical schools in rural and regional areas, and the provision of additional training scholarships. 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People
The Government continues to deliver on its commitment to improve the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with a focus on expanding primary health care services.  Building on initiatives announced in previous Budgets, the 1999 Budget boosted Commonwealth funding for this purpose by $100 million over four years. 
The greater part of this funding ($78.8 million) is being used to improve access for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to primary health care through the Primary Health Care Access Program. This initiative will establish a framework for the coordinated expansion of comprehensive health care services including clinical care, illness prevention and early intervention activities. 
For the first time, national performance indicators and targets for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health have been agreed to by all Australian Health Ministers. The indicators include measures relating to still births, infant deaths and low birth weight among Indigenous children.
With Commonwealth leadership, innovative service delivery models are being developed in collaboration with the Aboriginal controlled health sector, State and Territory Governments, General Practice and other health professionals.  These will build on current services and help integrate mainstream providers in delivering services, including maternal and child health services, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This will mean that the best mix of care is available to meet the health care needs of these clearly disadvantaged people. 
Leadership in Health
The Commonwealth's role in health is to provide strong national leadership in a collaborative process of health sector reform aimed at developing a strong population health approach to disease prevention, health promotion and education; to improve the availability of high quality, integrated and cost effective services with a strong consumer focus; and to develop a sound evidence base to support population health measures and clinical care and treatment. 
The Commonwealth provides leadership through working collaboratively with stakeholders to develop broad policy frameworks and through both the provision of funding and the purchase of services. 
The Government's reform agenda is consistent with the main thrust, and many of the recommendations, of “Rocking the Cradle” in that it aims to enhance continuity in care for consumers, to remove artificial barriers, and to encourage collaborative arrangements between health care providers at the community level.
Private Health Insurance
The Government is continuing to improve the attractiveness of private health insurance to the Australian population through key reforms that address affordability of premiums, innovative products and structural reform of the sector.  These reforms increase the level of patient choice in health care for all Australians.
The 30% rebate on health insurance premiums has addressed the issue of affordability for all Australians.
Lifetime Health Cover builds on the existing community rating system through a new, fairer and workable lifetime approach to health insurance cover.
The Government can also increase the attractiveness of the private health insurance product through regulatory change.  Steps have been taken to expand the models of care available to the privately insured that have previously been unavailable such as early discharge and hospital in the home care.
Industry efficiency benefits patients and their choice of care.  A consumer strategy focusing on greater patient education and information is underway.  Key features include a statement of what can be expected when holding private health cover and a trial of a consumer hotline are the first steps.
Through these and other reforms, the Government is active in ensuring the Australian population has a choice in health care.  This is of particular importance with respect to all aspects of care during pregnancy and childbirth.
Alternative Birthing Services
The Report commends the contribution that the Commonwealth has made towards the promotion of consumer choice in birthing services through providing incentive funds for the establishment of birthing centres in States and Territories under the Alternative Birthing Service Program.  ABSP funds also contributed towards the establishment of culturally appropriate birthing services for Indigenous women.  The Report places particular emphasis on the provision of culturally appropriate and comprehensive antenatal information for individual women according to their ethnicity and cultural backgrounds.   
Evidence Base
The Government has given priority to investing in research and information which will maximise the quality of services and the effectiveness of the health system.
The Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care has recently been established by all Health Ministers as a means of coordinating national actions to build upon the many safety and quality improvement activities taking place around Australia.  The new Council is a national partnership between governments, health care providers and consumers. It will contribute to improvements in the safety and quality of care for patients and help reduce the risk of adverse events. 
The National Institute of Clinical Studies, which will be established by the Commonwealth Government later this year, will also play a role in improving the quality of health care in Australia and ensuring the health system is underpinned by world's best clinical practice.  The Institute will work closely with stakeholders to identify, develop and promote best clinical practice throughout the public and private sectors. 
The Government has also invested in improvements to national information and data with a major focus being on the role of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. One of the particular activities that are funded through the auspices of AIHW is the National Perinatal Statistics Unit (NPSU). The NPSU has developed a number of data systems on women's reproductive health services and pregnancy outcomes services that cover the period from conception to birth and up to one year.  The NPSU publishes regular reports on mothers and babies including a separate report on Indigenous mothers and babies.
Research into the effectiveness of interventions, the development of best practice guidelines by the National Health and Medical Research Council and the co-sponsorship of the Australasian Cochrane Centre by the Government are contributing to the increase of knowledge and improving the basis for decision making. 
Commonwealth Funding Assistance to State and Territory Governments for Health Care   
For the greater part, the Report recommendations are concerned with service delivery issues which are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.  This observation was made in the minority report by Government Senators and included the comment that “the Federal Government should not be dictating to the States how they should be running services that fall within their responsibilities.”  
This view is consistent with the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, a statutory committee of the Australian Parliament.  In Report No 342 of November 1995 the JCPA Chairman stated:
The Committee believes that the Commonwealth needs to have a clearer focus on strategic planning and articulating SSP (Specific Purpose Payment) objectives in the community... the Commonwealth should progressively disengage itself from SPP micro-management, leaving this task to state governments and other non-Commonwealth parties to SPP agreements.  Primary accountability (by funded parties) to the Commonwealth should increasingly be for outcomes achieved rather than for inputs and processes.
The Committee went further in Recommendation 3 of the same Report ie:
Commonwealth departments administering SPPs involving more than one level of government should ensure that the SPP agreements do not prescribe the method of service delivery by another level of government.
Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements
In line with the JCPA recommendations the Commonwealth Government contributes towards the capacity of individual States and Territories to maintain and improve the general level of Australia's health through broad Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs).  The base funding in the PHOFAs resulted from the broadbanding of Commonwealth funding to States and Territories for eight established public health programs (SPPs), including the National Women's Health Program and the Alternative Birthing Services Program.   
The current PHOFAs are for a five-year period, 1999-2004 and will provide in excess of $900 million to States and Territories during that time. They focus strategically on maintenance of effort through the specification of annual performance reporting requirements for population health outcomes relating to the incorporated SPPs.  State and Territory Offices of Health and Aged Care collaborate with State and Territory Health Authorities in monitoring and reporting performance under the PHOFAs at the local level. The annual performance reports from the States and Territories are published on the website of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care. 
These funding Agreements are designed to provide States and Territories with the flexibility to `mix and match' Commonwealth financial assistance to meet the varying needs of their respective populations while at the same time ensuring that the States and Territories remain part of a nationally coordinated effort in areas of high national priority. 
Funding of Services
Commonwealth funding for public hospitals is provided through the 1998-2003 Australian Health Care Agreements (AHCAs). The Agreements are a vehicle both for committing Commonwealth funds to public hospital services delivered by the State and Territory Governments, and for instigating reform in the funding arrangements for acute health services.
Under the AHCAs the Commonwealth is providing substantial financial assistance to the States and Territories to meet the cost of public hospital services. Over the life of the Agreements, the States and Territories will receive total funding of around $31.3 billion, representing a 25 percent real increase in funding over the five years to 2002-03. State and Territory Governments have responsibility for, and indeed, are in the best position to, make decisions about the allocation of AHCA funding to public hospitals for particular purposes, including for the provision of obstetric services to women in rural and remote areas.
In addition to the core funding arrangements, the AHCAs also commit the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to working in partnership to achieve agreed health service delivery reform and set out a number of specific areas where reform of the health system and its funding may be advanced, including:
·	integration of care through measure and share arrangements;
·	information technology reform;
·	more responsive funding;
·	additional funding in the area of quality improvement and enhancement;
·	funding for the establishment of a National Health Development Fund.
The Government is also a major funder of prenatal and birthing care through Medicare payments for a wide range of antenatal, peri-natal and birthing services for pregnant women, apart from those using birthing centres or public patients using hospital based services. 
In 1998-99, $57.7 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of 1.55 million obstetrics services.  In addition, in 1998-99 $38.6 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of 514,014 ultrasound in pregnancy services.
Private health insurers are also a major source of funding for all aspects of care during pregnancy and childbirth.  While an indepth consideration of the role of the private insurance providers was not included in the Committee's Terms of Reference, Committee members did acknowledge that the availability of private health insurance is providing many women with real options in antenatal care and birthing services. 
Conclusion
Initiatives of this Government across the spectrum of funding of States and Territories, private health insurance, rural health, Indigenous health and quality in health provision have established an environment in which quality, choice, equity and effectiveness in health service provision can flourish as never before.  In this environment, the Government is confident that the relevant decision-makers can assess the recommendations of the Report “Rocking the Cradle - A Report into Childbirth Procedures.”.
While the delivery of medical and midwifery services is the responsibility of State and Territory health authorities, as well as clinicians in their support of patients, the Government has endeavoured as far as possible to provide responses to individual recommendations in this Report from the Opposition Members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee.  These responses are set out below. 
(Note that a sequential numbering system has been added to the set of recommendations to assist in identifying the responses.)
CHAPTER 2: ANTENATAL CARE
Recommendation 1:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to implement the recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council as they relate to continuity of care and shared care during pregnancy and birth.   
The Government draws on the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines as part of its evidence base for national strategic planning across the full spectrum of health care including obstetric care.  
The range of antenatal services available in Australia is extensive and Australian women have generally enjoyed access to a high standard of care during pregnancy and birthing. Maternity services are often based on a traditional model of obstetric care, with women in hospital being cared for by a team headed by a general practitioner or specialist obstetrician. 
The Commonwealth is currently working with the States and Territories to provide better integration of care through the following provisions in the Australian Health Care Agreements for patients using public hospital services and through other mechanisms to ensure integrated approaches to population health and primary health care.
Australian Health Care Agreements
National Health Development Fund
The National Health Development Fund (NHDF) has been established to foster innovation in hospital services provision through funding projects at the regional or State wide scale that improve:
·	patient outcomes;
·	efficiency and effectiveness in, or reduce the demand for, the delivery of public hospital services; and
·	integration of care between public hospital services and broader health and community care services.
Approximately $253 million in Commonwealth funding is available over the life of the Agreements for projects that bring about long term improvements in health care delivery. 
Measure and Share Provisions
Under the Measure and Share provisions of the Australian Health Care Agreements the Commonwealth and the States and Territories have agreed to work on proposals for improving the integration of service delivery by removing artificial Commonwealth/State financial barriers.  Decisions relating to the aspects of service delivery arrangements that are brought forward for consideration in relation to measure and share proposals remain with State and Territory Governments.
The National Demonstration Hospitals Program (NDHP)
Since 1995 the NDHP has funded time-limited, demonstration projects in selected hospitals to explore and develop new approaches to the organisation and delivery of acute care service. 
Of the projects funded by the NDHP in major tertiary teaching hospitals over two thirds have taken place in hospitals with a substantial component of midwifery patients. Of the other 60 projects funded by the program, over three quarters have been in hospitals that provide care for some midwifery patients. 
Divisions of General Practice Strategy  
A sizeable number of Divisions of General Practice are involved in shared care arrangements for obstetric patients, such as the Brisbane Southside Collaboration referred to in the earlier Submission to the Committee from the Department of Health and Aged Care.  This Collaboration is a linked project between a GP Division and a major hospital as part of the National Demonstration Hospitals Program. The focus is on piloting antenatal and postnatal shared care and in its evaluation information will be sought about patient and provider satisfaction as well as clinical outcomes.
Recommendation 2:
The Committee recommends that all pregnant women in Australia be provided with a maternity record by their principal carer giving details of their health as it relates to their pregnancy and any test results or treatment, with a duplicate to be held by their principal carer.  
The issue of health consumer access to personal health information is an important one and one which this Government is addressing within the context of its planned Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000, which includes a commitment to consumer access to personal information. 
Many Divisions of General Practice have programs targeting obstetric shared care, including several with a focus on antenatal and postnatal shared care.  A number of these programs include the use of patient held personal record cards throughout pregnancy.   The Government would be interested to see more widespread application of such approaches.  
Recommendation 3:
Commonwealth Government fund major tertiary hospitals to extend the provision of satellite clinics and visiting teams of obstetricians to assist women in rural and remote areas.  
The Commonwealth Government is committed to improving access to specialist services in rural and regional Australia. The 2000-01 Budget provides $48.4 million over four years for a rural outreach program for specialist services. This will include incentives and/or travel costs for specialists to conduct outreach specialty work and to act as mentors for local health professionals to help them increase their skills. The program will be implemented in collaboration with the States and Territories, as well as specialist colleges, divisions of general practice and rural workforce agencies. The program will target a range of specialist services and geographical areas based on need.
This initiative complements the existing Commonwealth initiative to establish specialist training posts in rural areas, under which four rural registrar posts in obstetrics and gynaecology were funded in 1999. It also complements the efforts of State and Territory Governments to increase the presence of specialists in rural and regional areas. In addition the Commonwealth has funded a female obstetrician post attached to the University Department of Rural Health in Victoria, to address the needs of Muslim women in the Hume Region.
Recommendation 4:
The Committee recommends that the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health provide recurrent funding to ensure continuity for existing antenatal programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and to establish new programs in areas of need.  
The Government contributes towards the provision of antenatal programs for Indigenous families through its funding of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. As outlined in the Introduction, the Commonwealth emphasis is on improved access to primary health care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and will be achieved in two ways: 
·	expansion of Aboriginal community controlled primary health care services; and 
·	improved orientation of mainstream services to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  
Further expansion of community controlled primary health care services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is aligned with the continued development of regional planning processes, which are the mechanism for identifying agreed priority areas of need. The expansion of primary health care through the increased federal budget commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health will support the continuation and improved development of ante-natal and post-natal programs in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations.
Recommendation 5:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to reinstate programs to assist women from non English speaking backgrounds to gain access to antenatal services, using funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.
Recommendation 6:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to promote antenatal programs targetted to adolescent mothers.  
Recommendation 7:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that comprehensive, accurate and objective information is made available to all pregnant women on the antenatal and birth options available to them, with funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements. 
AND
Recommendation 8:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that comprehensive, accurate and current information is made available to all principal carers of pregnant women about the antenatal and birth options and services available in their area, with funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.  
As outlined in the Introduction, responsibility for delivery of population health measures rests primarily with State and Territory Governments and with Divisions of General Practice and individual GP's. The Commonwealth has a broad policy leadership and financing role in promoting population health action including the integration of population health within the wider health system. The Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) are broadbanded funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories that set out in a single Agreement the ongoing Commonwealth funding provisions for a number of public health programs including the National Women's Health Program and the Alternative Birthing Services Program. 
State and Territory Governments have the flexibiltiy and the responsibility under the PHOFAs to allocate resources according to local priorities and population needs while maintaining effort and reporting annually against agreed national performance indicators set out in the funding agreements.  Decisions about funding allocations to women's health services, including birthing and pregnancy support services are the responsibility of State and Territory health authorities.  
Recommendation 9:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments  to ensure that antenatal information is made available to all Indigenous women in a language and format that meets their needs, with funding provided through the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health.  
Through the allocation of resources to establish and maintain comprehensive primary health care services, regional planning processes, and commitment to community consultation, the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) supports provision of culturally appropriate information in identified areas of need. In order to be appropriate, information must be locally tailored. OATSIH funded Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations are well placed to contribute to the development and provision of this information. Facilities available through local tertiary health services should be accessible to the Aboriginal community controlled sector to ensure integration of culturally appropriate materials in mainstream health programs as well.
Recommendation 10:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that antenatal information is made available to all women from non English speaking backgrounds in a language and format that meets their needs, with funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.
See response to recommendations 5,6,7 and 8 above. 
Recommendation 11:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research  Council, in conjunction with professional medical bodies and midwives' organisations, establish guidelines governing the prior provision of counselling and information on all antenatal screening tests, for adoption and implementation by the professional bodies.
AND
Recommendation 12:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council, in conjunction with professional medical bodies and midwives' organisations, establish guidelines governing the provision of counselling and information on the benefits and disadvantages of the various forms of intervention which may be required by women during birth, for adoption and implementation by the professional bodies. 
The Committee's recommendation has been referred to the NHMRC for consideration and possible inclusion in its work plan for the 2000 - 2002 triennium.
Recommendation 13:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that adequate and appropriate antenatal education classes are generally available, using funding provided through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.  
See response to recommendations 5,6,7 and 8 above.
CHAPTER 3: ANTENATAL SCREENING SERVICES
Ultrasound in Pregnancy
The Commonwealth has a strong commitment to ensuring that Australian women have access to high quality, cost effective obstetric ultrasound services through Medicare. The Department of Health and Aged Care is responsible for managing the Medicare funding of ultrasound and other diagnostic imaging services. 
As part of this management, the Department has established the Diagnostic Imaging Agreement with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR).  The purpose of this agreement is to foster the joint management of Medicare funding for diagnostic imaging between the Commonwealth and the profession. The Agreement is intended to ensure that patients can access high quality, clinically appropriate and affordable diagnostic imaging services. 
The Department has introduced a number of initiatives to improve the quality use of pregnancy related ultrasound.  These initiatives include funding for the development of accreditation and quality assurance for providers of obstetric ultrasound, the introduction of professional supervision requirements for ultrasound, and referral of new technologies, such as nuchal translucency, to the Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) for assessment of evidence and appropriateness. 
As part of the management of diagnostic imaging, the Department has undertaken a systematic restructure of the Medicare obstetric ultrasound items. 
The changes, effective from 1 February 2000, introduce new obstetric ultrasound items that cover the full range of services provided in pregnancy, and that fund these services according to their complexity. New items are provided for early, mid and late pregnancy ultrasound, and for more complex services. The new items also introduce clinical indicators to ensure that ultrasound services are provided when clinically necessary for the good management of the pregnancy.  
It is important to recognise that while the Department can make changes to the Medicare obstetric ultrasound items, a significant proportion of obstetric ultrasound is carried out within the public hospital system, and in accordance with the provisions of the AHCAs, decisions relating to service delivery in public hospitals are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. 
Recommendation 14:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council develop standards for the training of operators of all obstetrical ultrasound equipment and for those who interpret the results of those tests. 
The Committee's recommendation has been referred to NHMRC for consideration and possible inclusion in its work plan for 2000-02 triennium.
The Government has provided nearly $400,000 to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) over the past 3 years to develop and implement standards for accreditation of medical imaging practices. The College is covering all modalities of medical imaging in this exercise, including obstetrical ultrasound. 
In addition, the Government is providing $80,000 to the Australasian Sonographer Accreditation Register (ASAR) to develop, establish and implement a mechanism for the accreditation of Sonography training and education programs. 
The Department is also negotiating the provision of $100,000 to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) and the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (NASOG) for the development of Continuing Medical Education and Quality Assurance Program (CME & QA) requirements for obstetric and gynaecological ultrasound practice. 
In recognition of the particular problems facing rural areas, funding is also being provided to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, to work with the RANZCR and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), to develop, establish and implement a CME & QA for general practitioners who utilise ultrasound under exemptions contained in the legislation governing ultrasound and payment of Medicare Benefits.    
The four major Colleges concerned with obstetric ultrasound have agreed to work with the Government to develop appropriate CME & QA and accreditation standards for adoption by all Colleges.
Recommendation 15:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council develop guidelines governing the safe use of all obstetrical ultrasound equipment. 
The safety of medical service provision is principally a State responsibility.  However, the Commonwealth is strongly committed to ensuring that services funded under Medicare are safe, clinically appropriate and reflect best practice, and has introduced initiatives to ensure this.  Several of these initiatives impact on the use of obstetric ultrasound equipment.  See response to recommendation 14 above also. 
Recommendation 16:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council develop or coordinate the development of evidence based assessments of the efficacy of routine ultrasound scanning in pregnancy and that it conduct a cost benefit analysis of current ultrasound practices. 
AND
Recommendation 17:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council conduct or oversee the conduct of an Australian multicentre trial of nuchal fold screening to determine its efficacy for use among pregnant women generally, and among those considered at particular risk of carrying babies with Down's Syndrome. 
The Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is an independent committee which has been established to provide advice to the Minister for Health and Aged Care on the strength of evidence available on new medical technologies and procedures in terms of their safety, effectiveness and cost effectiveness.  
The MSAC process involves the rigorous assessment and classification of evidence from available medical research according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) four-point hierarchy of evidence. The findings of MSAC help inform Government decisions about which new medical services should attract funding under Medicare.
MSAC is currently establishing a committee to examine the nuchal translucency test and its use in early pregnancy ultrasound. 
Recommendation 18:
The Committee recommends that earlier recommendations relating to the training of operators and the regulation of equipment used in routine ultrasound screening should also apply to nuchal fold screening. 
Any action on this recommendation is dependent on the evidence that emerges from the MSAC evaluation of the nuchal translucency test. 
CHAPTER 4: CARE DURING BIRTH
Recommendation 19:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure the continuation and expansion of hospital birthing centres.  
The Government notes the Report's findings on consumer satisfaction with birthing centres in public hospitals as a service of choice for many pregnant women.   The Government also notes the Committee's support for the expansion of birthing centres as part of the mainstream health system, with funding from hospital budgets.  This is a matter for State and Territory Governments to determine in the context of their own budgets.  It should be noted however that the Australian Health Care Agreements do not:
·	require State and Territory Governments to ensure the continuation and expansion of hospital birthing services;
·	afford the Commonwealth the authority to raise issues regarding the direction of funds to particular purposes with State and Territory Ministers.
Decisions relating to the allocation of AHCA funding to public hospitals for particular purposes, including for the continuation and expansion of hospital birthing centres, rest with State and Territory Governments.
The Commonwealth provided funding under the Alternative Birthing Services Program to pilot increased options in birthing services including the establishment of new birthing centres.  The Alternative Birthing Services Program is one of the broadbanded programs within the PHOFAs. States and Territories are required to provide annual performance reports covering the broadbanded programs, including for example reporting the number of midwife based birthing services established in the publicly funded health care system.   
Recommendation 20:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government continue to fund midwives to assist at home births for women at low risk through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.  
See the response to recommendations 5,6,7 and 8 above.  
Recommendation 21:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who have to give birth outside their communities by funding an accompanying family member, with funding provided through their patient transfer assistance schemes.  
Funding under the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) was transferred to States and Territories who are now responsible for the management and funding of this Scheme. It has been recognised however that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's access has been problematic and that the need to travel long distances to give birth and lack of family support is a major issue for Indigenous people in remote locations. 
The issue was raised by the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) members at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Council in 1997 - 98.  As a result, the Council referred the matter to the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC). The Department is now awaiting the outcome of AHMAC consideration of this issue.
Recommendation 22:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, through the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, fund culturally appropriate birthing services, either in hospitals or stand alone, in centres with large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. 
Tertiary care services are the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.  Decisions relating to the allocation of AHCA funding to public hospitals for particular purposes, including culturally appropriate birthing services, rest with State and Territory Governments.
CHAPTER 5: INTERVENTIONS IN CHILDBIRTH - CAESAREAN SECTION
Recommendation 23:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council work with the relevant professional bodies to develop best practice guidelines for elective Caesarean sections. 
The NHMRC has had an ongoing interest in antenatal care, and in 1996 published the paper Options for effective childbirth that explored the then predominantly medically-based model of childbirth procedures, and offered other options without compromising the desire of consumers for safety.  Subsequent to the release of the paper, the need for clear information for consumers on elective caesarean sections was identified, and the NHMRC is currently working with key organisations to prepare appropriate literature.
Recommendation 24:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to decide a target rate for Caesarean sections, moving towards the target of 15% recommended by the World Health Organisation.  
As the Committee Report notes, the rates for Caesarean sections vary greatly between countries. The Government believes that the key issue is to ensure adoption of best practice guidelines for elective Caesarean sections and to ensure women have appropriate information available to them.  Setting targets does not necessarily address these issues although it may point to issues of differential practice that the profession may then address.  Establishment of targets also raises the issue of what happens when that figure is reached and women who want, or need, a procedure, cannot be given it.  
Under the AHCAs, State and Territory Governments are responsible for ensuring the provision of public hospital services, including admitted and non-admitted patient services, free of charge to public patients on the basis of clinical need and within a clinically appropriate period.  Against this background, the AHCAs do not afford the Commonwealth the authority to raise issues with State and Territory Governments regarding the target rate for Caesarean sections in relation to public hospital services.
Recommendation 25:
The Committee recommends that the Joint Maternity Services Committee monitor the implementation of best practice guidelines for Caesarean sections and report upon the extent to which individual hospitals meet the proposed target for Caesarean sections of 15%.  
As the Report notes, membership of the Joint Committee on Maternity Services includes representatives from the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Australian College of Midwives Incorporated. The Committee is largely inactive at present.  Any broader role for this Committee would need to be taken up by the Colleges involved. 
See also the response to recommendation 24 above.
CHAPTER 7: BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR ANTENATAL CARE AND FOR CARE DURING BIRTH
Recommendation 26:
The Committee recommends that research and guidelines on the use of routine ultrasound in pregnancy be an immediate priority for the National Health and Medical Research Council.   An earlier recommendation set out those aspects of routine ultrasound requiring urgent attention. 
As a general rule the NHMRC does not dictate what research will be undertaken.  The NHMRC directs the majority of funds on the basis of scientific excellence in research to projects initiated by the research community itself.  While most research is investigator-initiated, the Strategic Research Development Committee (SRDC) of NHMRC is charged with identifying and filling gaps in the national research effort.  The SRDC has recently completed consultative workshops around Australia to inform the setting of the SRDC research agenda.  Peak organisations are asked to nominate issues they believe are important, addressing specific criteria which include measures of the burden of the disease and whether the issue is of particular relevance to Australia.  
The Senate Committee's recommendation has been referred to the NHMRC for further consideration.
Recommendation 27:
The Committee recommends the enhancement of the Joint Committee on Maternity Services to include professional groups involved in antenatal, birth and post natal care as well as consumers. The Joint Committee should have responsibility for advising Ministers on the implementation and evaluation of best practice guidelines in maternal and infant health care and on measures to reduce current fragmentation in the provision of maternal and infant health services.  
See response to recommendation 25 above.
Recommendation 28:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure the annual publication of a list of all of its hospitals where births take place, with statistics on each of the birth-related interventions performed there and the insurance status of the women on whom they are performed. 
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) is an independent health and welfare statistics and information agency within the portfolio of Health and Aged Care.  AIHW has responsibility, in collaboration with the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the development, collection and publication of national health and welfare statistics.  AIHW considers that a national report could be produced containing information on birth related interventions, if appropriate funding was available.  
However, for confidentiality reasons such a report would not be able to include information identified at the establishment level. 
CHAPTER 8: POST NATAL CARE
Recommendation 29:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government work with State Governments to ensure that maternity and infant welfare services are in place to assist women following their return home after childbirth. 
State and Territory Governments have responsibility for the provision of maternity and infant welfare services.  
Recommendation 30:
The Committee recommends that community care services for women discharged early from hospital following childbirth be eligible for funding through the National Demonstration Hospitals Program. 
See response to recommendation 29 above.
Recommendation 31:
The Committee recommends that the National Health and Medical Research Council conduct research into post natal depression. 
As discussed in the response to recommendation 26, while most research is investigator initiated, the Strategic Research Development Committee (SRDC) of NHMRC is charged with identifying and filling gaps in the national research effort.  The Committee's recommendation for research has been referred to the NHMRC for further consideration in that context. 
In 1998 the NHMRC was commissioned by the Department of Health and Aged Care to develop information on postnatal depression that would assist clinicians to detect and treat the disorder. The NHMRC completed the project in November 1999 and endorsed the publication Postnatal depression: a systematic review of published scientific literature 
1980-1999.   The paper presents a review of current literature that may be useful for practitioners and consumers to understand the condition, and inform clinical management decisions.  
CHAPTER 9: FUNDING ISSUES
Recommendation 32:
The Committee recommends that the Health Insurance Commission monitor the new Medicare rebate for complex births to ensure that it does not lead to overservicing.
The Department is monitoring the use of this item on an ongoing basis using Health Insurance Commission data.  Monitoring is based on the appropriateness of item use as well as the identification of possible overservicing.  The Department is working with the Health Insurance Commission in this regard. 
Recommendation 33:
The Committee recommends that the Health Insurance Act be amended to define as `patients' all neonates in hospital who require medical attention, regardless of whether they are located with their mothers or not.  
The Government considers that there is no logic in admitting to a hospital, well persons (in this case well newborn babies), as they do not require the acute and intense medical and nursing care provided in a hospital setting.  This arrangement has been well-established for many years and is accepted by all State and Territory health authorities and the health insurance and private hospital industries, as is evidenced by the definition of `admitted patient' contained in the National Health Data Dictionary (Version 9, 2000, pp. 265-257).
As the Committee noted, where a neonate requires care which is available in a location separate from its mother in accordance with agreed standards for neonatal care facilities, then the neonate is considered to be an admitted patient.  The Department of Health and Aged Care consults regularly with the Division of Paediatrics, Royal Australasian College of Physicians, regarding standards for the treatment of neonates.  The College recently reviewed these standards and indicated to the Department that they remain current.
However, given recent advances in technology and treatments for seriously ill newborns, the Department has also requested the College to review whether babies with certain serious conditions might be safely accommodated and treated next to the mother's bedside rather than in an approved special care nursery.  Their advice will inform possible future developments in the standards for the treatment of neonates.
CHAPTER 10: LITIGATION AND OBSTETRIC PRACTICE AND PROVISION
Recommendation 34:
The Committee recommends that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare establish national comprehensive data on medical defence organisations to cover negligence cases and include such data as premium payments, number of cases, number of claims, number of out of court settlements, size of payments and size of fund reserves.  
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare advises that to undertake such a collection would require the support of indemnity insurers and substantial additional resources. The Government does not agree that this recommendation is a priority or that there is sound evidence to support funds being allocated to this at this point in time.
Recommendation 35:
The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government establish an independent inquiry into medical indemnity and litigation, including the impact of litigation and indemnity on the provision and practice of obstetric services, alternative approaches to the funding of medical litigation and alternative approaches to the funding of compensation for disability.  
The Government does not believe that an independent inquiry into medical indemnity is appropriate at this point in time.  These matters will be best handled through the current consultative process between the Department of Health and Aged Care and the profession.
As an example, following the Australian Medical Association's proposal of a Cerebral Palsy compensation scheme at their summit of 10 December 1999, the Department of Health and Aged Care has met with the profession in relation to the medical indemnity issue and will continue to do so in order to properly pursue these issues.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-08-31,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This government response is a welcomed government response, and one that is much more timely than others in the past. The report itself raises some very important questions, and in some ways I appreciate having, in this response from government, a fairly clear description of what I think is a major area of difficulty. One of the things our report found was that Australia was a country with one of the highest caesarean section rates in the world, and that if you were privately insured you were much more likely to have a caesarean section than if you were a patient in the public sector. Evidence provided to the committee showed there was no clear reason why that should be the case.
I received a report today, Thursday 31 August—I think it is probably off my email—which said that, in the United States, after years of decline, caesarean sections are on the rise again. The evidence in the report from America is extremely similar to what we found in our report: that there is a very big difference between caesarean section rates across the country and that there is a much higher likelihood of caesarean sections for women if they are privately insured than if they are public patients. That seems to me to be, first of all, worthy of very serious investigation and follow-up. The government's response says:
Most of the views and recommendations of the Report however, are in the realm of State and Territory Government responsibilities or comment upon clinical decisions. The Government does not consider that this form of inquiry—
presumably a Senate inquiry—
is best suited to assess quality, safety and relevance in clinical matters.
It says four paragraphs later:
Government Approaches to Improving Australia's Health System
The Government is funding and driving programs of health system improvement on a scale greater than has been seen in Australia before. Criteria of quality, safety, relevance, choice, equity of access and effectiveness based on evidence are paramount. This Response to the Report outlines some relevant initiatives.
My first-up confusion about this is that paragraph 1 says that quality, safety and relevance are judged as clinical matters and outside the purview of a Senate inquiry, while paragraph 5 says that quality, safety, relevance, choice, access and effectiveness are criteria for the federal government's health policy. If we do not want to have a brawl, could I please have some further clarification? If, as the government say, they are concerned that quality, safety, relevance and choice, for example, are criteria by which you would judge an Australian health system but not this report because some of those applied to clinical matters, then I am nothing if not confused about what is the government's response in this area.
I am particularly concerned when they say that a lot of our recommendations go to things like how services are delivered in the states, but the states' way of delivering the services is outside the responsibility of the federal government. However, the federal government provide, through broad public health outcome funding agreements—PHOFAs—funding to state and territory governments and have agreements with them for delivering those services. If a caesarean section rate is not an outcome, what is it? If I seriously wanted to know how to judge in an appropriate way—without intruding on clinical professional decisions and without intruding on states' rights to do things—where Commonwealth dollars allocated to childbirth and delivery go in this country, then the way I measure this is in outcomes. What is the caesarean section rate if it is not an outcome? The caesarean section rate is merely data counting. It would be entirely proper for the federal government to be concerned about an outcome under their public health outcome funding agreements where caesarean section rates are higher in this country than anywhere else in the world and higher by a significant factor for privately insured patients and higher from one state to another. 
My own state of South Australia, as I recollect, has the highest figure, or it did in the findings of our report. When we asked if that had anything to do with the state having the highest number of obstetricians, there was some concern that there might be a correlation. We concluded that, as they were the only people who could do caesarean sections, it was a very valid reason to worry. The American data shows just that. In fact, one college in America is concerned that the only differences between caesarean section rates are the practices and the habits of doctors. We were also told of one doctor who went to a large public hospital in South Australia and had set out to significantly lower the caesarean section rate. He was very successful in doing this. There was no increase in infant mortality or maternal damage. There was just a significant lowering of the caesarean section rate in the public hospital and, interestingly, an allied reduction in the caesarean section rate amongst the private practitioners in the environs of that hospital. We also heard that this same pattern happened when a senior obstetrician in Tasmania set out to look at the figures in Tasmania and to work with clinicians to see if that figure could not be lowered. I have been talking about caesarean section rates, but the figures are on the increase for all interventions in childbirth—be they episiotomies, vacuum extractions, the use of forceps, medication, epidurals, anaesthetics and so on.
I thank the government for the response, but I have to remark on the way they have said that a number of our recommendations belong in the state and territory area and that, therefore, the Commonwealth does not want to have much say about them. When the Commonwealth directly funds those programs with precious Commonwealth taxpayer dollars, I would like to know how the Commonwealth is so easily able to say, `We handball that to the states; it is not our responsibility.'
I heard, during question time today, considerable kudos being claimed for itself by the government, for how it has reduced through the immunisation program the number of people who have had measles, mumps, diphtheria and so on. The immunisation program is a classic Commonwealth-state program. It is a service delivered by the states, providing data to the Commonwealth, and it is a very good example—and I think the Commonwealth properly can claim some responsibility for reducing immunisation rates. But it does not do this by saying, `Don't talk to us about those figures; that is a state matter; we do not really have any responsibility for it.' Yes, the Commonwealth does have. It has clear responsibility under its own public health outcomes funding agreements. I want to know what they call `outcomes'. I am also concerned about how I can go to the estimates and find out how our Commonwealth dollars are being spent on health and on obstetric services. To be met by the Commonwealth saying, `Well, it's really a state matter—talk to them,' is not, I believe, a sufficient answer or justification. As I say, it is quite contrary to what they are claiming in the area of immunisation.
There are some other points here that I think are very important. The government clearly recognises the importance of our inquiry and agrees that some of the recommendations we have made should be picked up on, particularly where we have asked whether the NHMRC could pick up and develop the research, and so on. The Commonwealth also says—and this is a concern for me—that it has a very direct responsibility for something like, for example, ultrasound—and indeed this report tells us that in 1998-99 $38.6 million was paid in Medicare benefits in respect of ultrasound. But they then go on to say that a lot of the ultrasound work is done in public hospitals, and that that is a state funding matter and not something that the Commonwealth would concern itself about.
I find that extremely disappointing, because half of the funding to our public hospitals is from the Commonwealth and also because the criterion for reasonable and decent ultrasound has to apply in the public as well as the private sector—and some of that is acknowledged by the Commonwealth in its response to other recommendations. Importantly, continuity of care—which we found so important in reducing caesarean section rates and in having happier mothers and happier babies—is certainly given support by the Commonwealth. The government says in its response that some of its funding is going very much into that kind of area, and so I acknowledge that support for the recommendations we made in that area. I think it was an invaluable report from the Senate. The government's response is largely positive but, as I say, its qualification about some of these matters being state government responsibilities does not hold water and does not assist with outcomes for Australian women.  ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,18,2
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-08-31,"—I wish to make a few comments on the government's response to the report from the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on childbirth procedures, called Rocking the cradle: a report into childbirth procedures. It is an interesting coverage that Senator Crowley, as chairman, has just given in the response to the response, in terms of dismissing the way in which the states are responsible for funding of these procedures. My comments when the report of the committee was handed down were the same as they were when the reference was put to the committee, and they are the same as those I will make today. These are issues that are within the responsibility of the states. That did not seem to matter; we still went ahead with the inquiry.
Interestingly enough, I suppose one should also draw attention to the fact that, while there is little doubt that caesarean section numbers have increased over time, if one were to listen to the Labor opposition senators one would think that that has only occurred since this government has been in office. It has not. The trend rates quite clearly show that the increase has been happening for many years. Be that as it may, why then, when Labor were in government for 13 years, did they not act—if it is possible now, according to Labor—to have it reduced? I do not understand that. Anyway, my answer to that is that there is no doubt that the rate is high. Evidence has shown that. But my question still remains: how do governments, or in fact Senate committees, change that? They cannot. The decisions on the procedures that people undergo at any time are the decisions of clinical practice and decisions that are made between doctors and patients: not through senators, not via ministers of health and not via governments—and may I say thanks very much for that; I am glad of that.
I want to make sure that the government position is clear on the way in which we have increased funding in so many areas. One of the most important things for the government is the committee finding of widespread satisfaction with the quality of birthing services available in this country. Maternal and infant mortality rates are the lowest they have ever been in Australia and they compare favourably with the rest of the world's, and that is solid proof that Australia's health policies are working. We should not be under any misapprehension about the level of satisfaction that exists.
The report identifies some concerns about access to antenatal services for women living in rural and remote areas. I just want to make sure that the Senate understands what has been done in that area, because much evidence was given of the concerns of rural and regional people. An amount of $49.5 million was allocated over four years in the 2000-01 budget to increase the range of allied health professionals working with GPs to meet locally identified needs. Another allocation of $48.4 million was made over four years to improve access to specialist services in rural and regional Australia—and that, I might add, complements the existing initiative to establish specialist training posts in rural areas, including four registrar posts in obstetrics and gynaecology that were funded in 1999. Another amount of $68.9 million was allocated to expand the Regional Health Service Program—and these centres in rural communities will draw together a flexible mix of service based on community need. Also, $102.1 million was allocated over four years to increase the number of GP registrars in rural areas. It is important to note that these things have all been done since the coalition government has been in office. They were not undertaken under the previous government over 13 years.
The report commends the contribution that the government has made towards promoting greater choice for women giving birth under the Alternative Birthing Service Program. As the report points out, the birth centres have been an outstanding success in terms of both medical outcome and consumer satisfaction. Many of the states and territories have continued to fund models that were initiated by the program. 
But the government is particularly proud of a current initiative that it has put in place—and that supports rural women's access to appropriate antenatal information in their community. Under the fly-in female general practitioner service, about four times each year female GPs will visit up to 160 locations across the country where women do not have such local services.
This government also shares the concern of the committee about higher death rates for indigenous mothers and babies compared to the rest of the population. As a large proportion of indigenous people live in rural areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are expected to be major beneficiaries of the new regional health strategy—and that has been particularly targeted for them and needs to be acknowledged.
The government has, I believe, demonstrated its commitment to improve the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through recent initiatives. The 1999 budget, for example, boosted Commonwealth funding by $100 million over the next four years, most of which will be used to improve access for ATSI people to primary health care. This expansion of primary health care will support the continuation and improved development of antenatal and postnatal programs in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. For the first time also, national performance indicators and targets for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health have been agreed to by all Australian health ministers. These indicators include indigenous stillbirths, infant deaths and low birth weight. A strong emphasis on the Alternative Birthing Service Program has been to establish a culturally appropriate birthing service for indigenous women, such as the community based service for Koori women in Victoria.
I would draw the attention of senators to the fact that the recommendations in this report, as I mentioned before, are basically the words of opposition senators—and that is why the government senators provided the minority report in which we pointed out that most of the subject matter of this inquiry into childbirth procedures is, in fact, outside the jurisdiction of the federal government. The delivery of medical and midwifery services are the responsibility of state and territory health authorities—and we must not forget that. We must not start and try to intervene, as members of parliament or as governments, in those clinical practices. It is not the role of the Commonwealth to dictate how states and territories should be running services that fall within their responsibilities. The Labor government did not do it, we do not do it—and we do not see a future in making that a practice.
This government has good cause to be proud of the contribution it is making to enhancing childbirth outcomes for Australian families. Initiatives across the spectrum of funding to states and territories—private health insurance, rural health, indigenous health and quality and health provision—have established an environment in which quality, choice, equity and effectiveness in health service provision can flourish as never before. Clearly, this government is providing strong national leadership in this area and a broadly based structural reform.
I think Dr Wooldridge really does need to be congratulated for what he has done as health minister since 1996—and in consultation, in many respects, with Senator Herron, the minister for Aboriginal affairs. Both Dr Wooldridge and Senator Herron are medical practitioners. Both are abundantly aware of the real problems being experienced by the indigenous population, and both are abundantly aware of the real problems being experienced by rural and remote communities. They have spent many hours, many weeks, many months in fact, if you total it all up—the time in opposition and since in government—in making sure that their understanding of the requirements are known—and not only known but acted upon. I think this government really does need to be congratulated for the efforts it has put into allocating millions and millions of dollars and resources to give people in country areas and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities far better access to health across the board—not just in childbirth procedures.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document follows on quite appropriately from the debate we have just been having. It is a positive move that regularly tabled in both houses is a list of all the different multilateral treaty actions presently—or expected to be within 12 months—under negotiation or consideration by the Australian government. It is particularly important in light of the government's actions in the last couple of days to wonder whether it is worth all the bother. There is a huge number of different treaties happening here, and at the same time we have got the federal government walking away from its obligations internationally, vilifying the United Nations, vilifying the whole concept of working internationally with other organisations uness they agree with what we are doing. You have to wonder what the point of all of this work is. 
Of course, a lot of these treaties are for areas much broader than just the United Nations, but there is work being done that is listed here. Negotiations are under way for amendments to or supplements to existing treaties under the human rights section of the United Nations. This is part of the international treaties where the government is now saying, `We won't invite them in here. We won't let them in here, unless they have got a really good reason,' yet we have got public servants working at taxpayers' expense currently negotiating for amendments and supplement to existing treaties on the convention against torture, and the convention against the prohibition of development, prohibition and stockpiling of biological weapons and the destruction of those weapons. These are very important areas where, unfortunately, now the impetus of Australia in working with these areas with other nations around the world is being dramatically undermined by the actions of the federal government. This is all as a result of a couple of reports from a committee somewhere criticising us. There is no requirement, no onus on us to do anything, no compromise of our sovereignty.
Another area that is listed in this document as having activities happening is the World Trade Organisation. There is a whole range of agreements in terms of ongoing negotiations with the WTO—agreements on government procurement, on trade related aspects of international property rights, on agreement on rules of origin, and on General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade amendments. The WTO is an area where we have a recent example where an unelected, non-accountable international body—controlled not by NGOs on a guilt trip but by huge companies, by multinational corporations, by large nations and their trading interest—made a ruling. They made a finding, and they forced Australia to act. They forced Australia to change. They forced Australia to take a greater risk in terms of importing diseased animal products, fish products, into our nation.
That is a case where Australia was impacted by an international, unelected, non-accountable body. Do we see the federal government saying, `We'll step back from the WTO because it is imposing on our sovereignty'—not to mention putting our environment, particularly the environment of Tasmania, at risk? No action there. It is full steam ahead. Yet when we get a little report from a committee saying that we are contravening some human rights or not meeting our obligations suddenly we are putting up the brick walls, not letting anybody in to the country, refusing to work with them, and saying that the whole process is flawed. Where are the statements from the government saying the WTO is flawed when it is forcing us to take higher risks in terms of taking imports of diseased salmon, just to use one example. And there are other examples in terms of putting ourselves up for greater environmental risk. There are no words from the government in relation to that. And, as this document shows, there is ongoing work happening to continue to expand our involvement in the WTO.
I am not necessarily someone who says we should remove ourselves from the WTO, but if we are looking at reforming a process how about looking at reforming the WTO, so that it more appropriately takes into account our national interest, our national need—whether you are talking about environment, economy or social standards? There are no words from the government on that. The only area of concern is human rights. That is where we want to back away—the rights of women, the rights of refugees. How is the government's action impacting on all the work that is represented in this document—the work of so many public servants, whom I am sure are working with the best of intentions—in this list of treaties, many of which are in the UN human rights area: conventions on the rights of the child, optional protocols on children in armed conflict. Our efforts in trying to get positive change in really important areas are clearly being undermined by the government's actions in so many of the areas that are contained in this document.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-08-31,"—Earlier this afternoon we spoke about the UN convention and the position of the government in relation to treaties, and tonight we are considering a list of multilateral treaty action presently under negotiation or consideration by the Australian government. But in an article in today's Australian under the headline `Senate must rescue treaties from abuse' we find the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, Mr Andrew Thomson, taking what could only be described as a cheap shot at not only the treaties committee but also, I suspect, the treaty system we adopt in Australia. He promotes that:
We ought to consider amending the Constitution to make a two-thirds majority vote of the Senate a condition to any future government ratifying a treaty.
As lofty as that position might be, I do not know whether Mr Thomson has consulted Mr Downer about it or whether it is a position he has come up with. He certainly has not, as I understand it, taken it to the treaties committee for consideration or looked at reviewing the treaty committee process itself. 
The treaty making process has been subject to a review; it was revamped in 1996. A government document about the treaties committee and its role was produced in 1999. It was a document that tried to present a bright future for the treaty committee. Instead, we now have the chair of the committee lapsing into what could only be described as unusual abuse of the treaty making process. As far as the criticism is concerned, I quote from the article:
They allow no cross-examination of NGO evidence by accused states, instead favouring an inquisitorial approach wherein the committee members ...
I leave the quote at that point, because I want to focus on the word `inquisitorial'. Later on in the article, the chair of the committee, Mr Andrew Thomson, contrasts that inquisitorial system with the International Court of Justice in The Hague. When we look at the Court of Justice in The Hague, we find that it does not use a common law system. It uses an inquisitorial system, as I understand it. It might be an amalgam, but the European system is a civil system, not a common law system. It might draw parts of the common law and parts of the civil system into an amalgam process. But it is quite unusual in this case to find Mr Thomson complaining about an inquisitorial process and then promoting it because it is on another plane. I suspect Mr Thomson needs to read a little bit wider. 
Mr Thomson goes on in the article to talk about rights. He says:
Instead of rights, why not be clearer and propose obligations that nations must sign up to?
He goes on to say:
It's the lack of clarity about human rights that frustrates so many people. Our common law is pretty clear.
That is another extraordinary claim: `our common law is pretty clear'. I would be surprised to find that. The greatest part of our common law is that it is a system that is built upon decisions and precedent. It is not clear at all; it is not as clear as Mr Andrew Thomson thinks it is. Certainly it works, but it does not work because it is clear, as Mr Thomson says in his article. In the last part of his article, Mr Thomson says that he seeks change along the lines that he has adopted. I wait for him to put that change to the treaties committee, to promote it and to get Mr Downer's approval.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Treaties</title>,Documents,21,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-08-31,"—I rise on the same matter. I was not going to jump up, but I am obliged to do so after hearing Senator Ludwig's comments. Senator Sherry and Senator McKiernan are the only two senators in the chamber at the moment who were here when Senator Evans was the foreign minister in the Labor government. Senator Sherry, you should be a scholar: please brief these new senators who come in here. Let them know what a foolish venture it is for them to defend United Nations treaties without question. Senator Kemp built his career on bringing United Nations treaties to account. Day in, day out, he questioned the then foreign minister about the accountability of United Nations treaties and how this parliament should have a say in them. As a result of that, we have that very good committee that Andrew Thomson chairs. To a large extent it is bipartisan—or it was until just recently. 
—Foolish interjection! My point is that there was such a public groundswell of concern that the then government was forced to change the arrangements for signing off on treaties and agreements—it could have been as many as 1,000 when you were in government—without question. Now we have an accountability system. The government now simply wish to extend the accountability and the workability of the United Nations treaty system. And why shouldn't we? We rate very highly in the democratic states. As the chairman of the treaties committee said, we are a gold-plated democracy. 
I make that point because it was a former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who said:
There is an obvious connection between democratic practices such as the rule of law and transparency and decision making and the achievement of true peace and security in a new and stable political order.
The charter for the United Nations is peace, security and human rights. The point that Boutros-Ghali was trying to make is that a democracy is the building stone for peace and security, which is the mission statement of the United Nations. Australia is a gilt-edged democracy. We have nothing to be ashamed of. All I have heard this afternoon is the opposition and the Democrats knocking Australia's sovereignty and its right to administer its own laws. All afternoon the opposition and the Democrats have attacked Australia as if they were strangers in their own country. We have a right to lay down laws, and we have nothing to be ashamed of in implementing our own domestic laws. Look at what we have. We have an equal, free democracy, unmatched in the world. We have checks and balances in our system. We have the Senate and the House of Representatives. We have a judicial system. We have both a state system and a federal system. My point is that we have, I believe, more checks and balances in our democracy than there are in any other country. This country has nothing to be ashamed of; it has everything to be proud of. 
I think it is a disgrace when committees of the United Nations rate Australia as worse offenders in relation to racial discrimination than countries like Pakistan, China and Cuba. For heaven's sake, use some basic commonsense and a bit of pride. Of course, why would you have pride in your country? You are the mob who want to change the flag. Not only do you want to change the flag; you want us to acquiesce to countries like Cuba, China and Pakistan. How dare you rate us! You will never get into government on that.
To return to the point in the short time I have left, Senator McKiernan knows this only too well, because he speaks very highly of this country's laws in relation to refugees. I would like to see Senator McKiernan get up and speak about this country's treatment of refugees. We have nothing to be ashamed of in regard to human rights, yet you would have certain members of the human rights committee criticising this country. You are on a loser.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-08-31,"—What an interesting contribution from Senator McGauran. It really was interesting, given the comments made about the UN compared with those comments made about the WTO. I was interested in Senator Bartlett's comments. It seems that, with regard to international forums, we have a different approach from the government when it comes to the WTO. I was interested to listen to Senator Coonan yesterday, who went to some of the matters of the WTO dispute settlement system. I would be interested to hear Senator McGauran's position on this, being a National Party member and a representative of the rural sector and the agricultural sector of this country.  
—No.
—Well, he claims to be. Senator Coonan said yesterday:
I want to raise as a matter of public interest today an issue fundamental to Australia's ability to participate in the World Trade Organisation—that is, our capacity to engage the dispute settlement system. Writing recently in the Australian Financial Review, the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Mark Vaile, recognised that there is an urgent need to increase understanding of the WTO dispute processes among Australian industry.
What an amazing statement. Further, Senator Coonan said: 
... I visited Washington and Brussels to examine the use of the WTO dispute settlement system by the United States and the European Union to see if there are lessons we could learn from their aggressive advocacy that has seen Australia on the receiving end of some pretty controversial cases—
One of the cases that she cites is Canadian salmon, and we certainly were on the receiving end there. Senator Coonan went on to say:
... I was recently asked by DFAT to open two WTO dispute settlement seminars held in Parramatta and Sydney. The aim of these seminars was to inform and educate legal practitioners and other business people about the practical implementation and use of the WTO dispute settlement system. 
I say to Senator Coonan and the government: the first cab off the rank to teach anybody—or, as she said here, to `educate' anybody—ought to have been DFAT and A-G's. That is where they ought to have been conducting an education program because, if ever there was a case where we demonstrated a complete and utter lack of ability to combat the arguments put up by another country, the Canadian salmon case was it. We were so stupid in that case that we actually provided to the applying countries—the countries that were seeking to have our quarantine measures lowered—not one but two draft reports, one of which contained recommendations that the quarantine measures that were currently in place ought to be removed. How smart is that? How smart is that in terms of international law? Not very, I would suggest to Senator McGauran. Not very smart at all. Senator Coonan went on to say:
Put simply, Australia's future economic prosperity is inextricably linked to our export success and our ability to get access to new and emerging markets. 
It is not only that; it is also about protecting our own industries and our own environment, and we sadly failed. The reason we failed—and I will say it again—is our inability, on the basis of either lack of knowledge, lack of expertise or lack of resources, to actually combat these things.
Senator Coonan went on further and talked about the efforts of the United States and Canada and what they do. I suggest to Senator Coonan and, again, to the government that the first place you ought to look is in your own backyard. What you ought to be doing is ensuring that A-G's and DFAT have the resources to actually get in the game because they do not have those things at the moment. That is where we ought to be focusing in terms of international trade agreements. You people whinge and whine about some UN committee picking on us with regard to some aspects of our human rights. Let me tell you: if our human rights place is good, why worry about comparing us with Afghanistan? Why don't you just get on and argue our case? (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—As we are talking about treaties so much today—
—This is tedious repetition. This is your third go this afternoon.
—It might be repetition but I am sure it is not tedious. I want to speak to this motion to take note of the report—a motion moved by Senator O'Brien, who I am sure is taking an interest in this as well. The report entitled Two treaties tabled on 6 June 2000 was tabled by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties this week, the committee chaired by the fast becoming notorious Mr Andrew Thomson, whose remarks had some coverage earlier this week in relation to other issues. I disagree very much with those remarks, but the conduct of the chair in the way he does business through the committee is something that I do not criticise. Indeed, I thank him in relation to this report and specifically for his willingness to seek a common agreement so that a consensus report could be put down, and that is what has occurred.
The report deals with two treaties. I will not go through with tedious repetition the government's position in relation to treaties more broadly. Suffice to say, the committee as a whole and its role highlight the importance of engaging internationally and examining and hopefully increasing community awareness and understanding the great benefit we get from many of the international agreements that we reach. One of the treaties covered in this report is the proposed agreement with Spain on remunerated employment for dependants of personnel at diplomatic and consular missions. The committee did not have any problems with that. The other treaty, which I want to speak about at more length, is the proposed amendments to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species. 
The committee supported the amendments, and I personally very strongly support them—one amendment in particular will uplist the dugong to the highest level of protection in this convention. I think that is an appropriate move and a welcome one. From my own personal experience as environment spokesperson for the Democrats, I have a lot to criticise the federal government for in relation to their environment performance but, broadly speaking, their performance in relation to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species has been reasonably positive. There were some areas the Democrats would have liked the government to have put forward for uplisting and they have not but, generally speaking, I think the federal government has a reasonably positive record. 
However, this report does focus on some concerns about the information provided by the Department of the Environment and Heritage to the committee in the process of the committee's consideration of the convention. It does make some criticisms about the inadequacies of the information the department provided originally, and I think those criticisms are fair enough. If all the information that was eventually provided had been provided initially, I think there would have been a lot less concern and a lot less scope for misunderstanding, shall we say, about the value or otherwise of what the government had done in supporting the uplisting of a number of different species, including dugong, and increasing the protection available to some endangered species under this convention. 
I have spoken previously about the World Trade Organisation and its role in trade somewhat critically. This is another convention that deals with trade—with trade of endangered species only, but it is a very important mechanism for regulating, controlling, overseeing and managing trade in wildlife and plant species that are under threat. For some of those people in the community who like to suggest that one of the best ways to preserve wildlife is to commercialise it, I think the very existence of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species highlights the dangers of commercialising trade in wildlife, because in many cases the reason why species are listed as endangered under this convention is the existence of trade and the commercial industry surrounding some of those species. So it is a very important convention.
I think it is worth noting the importance of this convention, particularly given all the commentary not just in this place but in the broader community about international treaties and conventions. This is one that Australia has engaged in very constructively and reasonably effectively and with a strong willingness to enhance environmental protection around the world. It shows the benefits of engaging constructively. We do not always win. We cop a lot of criticism from other governments about some of the things we propose, but for some reason copping criticism in this area has not led us to talk about withdrawing, and nor should it. Similarly, Australia is critical of other countries in terms of some of their proposals. There is often robust debate and a lot of fairly intensive lobbying at the various meetings that regularly take place to look at the various species and categories of species listed in the convention.
It is worth emphasising the recommendations. There are specific recommendations encouraging the department to provide information about proposed amendments to the convention much further in advance than it has done. I think that is appropriate and very important, and I hope the Minister for the Environment and Heritage takes that on board. There is another recommendation that deals with the impact of automatic entry into force provisions. That means that when the convention agrees to make a change it will automatically come into force after 90 days. That raises some issues about whether that will give adequate opportunity for scrutiny by the community. I think that is an issue appropriate for debate. I am personally very dubious about the need to extend periods of time for entry into force under this convention anyway, particularly if notification is given to the committee and to the Australian community about proposed changes much earlier, as is recommended elsewhere in the report. But I do not have a problem with it being examined. I certainly do not have a problem with the government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other relevant ministers identifying those international agreements to which Australia is party that allow amendments agreed at a conference of parties to automatically enter into force without having to go through some further process—which is the thrust of the other recommendation. 
As part of the broader ongoing need to increase community awareness and understanding of how some of these treaties and conventions operate, I think getting the facts of their operation out into the community, out into the public arena, would be valuable. Indeed, just into our arena and raising the awareness of parliamentarians would be a start because I am sure most of us do not know which treaties and conventions have those provisions in them. I think that is a recommendation worth supporting, although my personal view, in relation to this specific convention, CITES, is that I do not support and would not support extending or removing the automatic entry into force. I think it is important for prompt action to increase protection for endangered species where it is identified as necessary. It is a recommendation that I support, and I think this convention—the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species—is a classic example of a positive international convention that Australia, thankfully, is continuing to engage in, rather than withdrawing from, criticising, ridiculing and misrepresenting. I hope that the government reconsiders its approach to some other UN international processes and similarly engages more constructively on those, using the approach that the environment department has done under this minister and, I believe, under previous ministers. It is a positive one that has helped not just the Australian environment and the biodiversity of our species but also endangered species around the world.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,Committees,22,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-08-31,"—I was asked to keep this item on the Notice Paper for another senator. I was very interested in Senator Bartlett's comments about the CITES, given I was involved in some work with the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. That work involved the commercialisation of native wildlife and the interaction that the committee had with regard to proposals to trade in certain species of Australian birds, in particular, but in some respects reptiles as well. Restrictions were imposed on that trade not only by the CITES but also by the states, although there were differences in regulations between the states. So it was not just a question of international trade that the CITES covers but also a question of interstate trade and the requirements of state laws with regard to that trading.
We discovered in that inquiry that there appeared to be a connection between commercialisation of certain species and the maintenance of habitat. In fact, in many cases the endangered species problem was connected with the conversion of habitat from the native state to the farmland state—draining of swamps, deforestation and the like. On private land, there was no gain to be made and no living to be made without that sort of interaction. The preservation of the habitat of some of the endangered species would only occur—indeed, there are examples from the United States and the African continent of positive experiences in the preservation of endangered species—because of a commercialisation of the species through various means, be it hunting, game park facilities or the like. As I said, at the commencement, I was asked to keep this matter on the Notice Paper for another senator who is unable to be here, so I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-31,"—As we are talking about treaties so much today—
—This is tedious repetition. This is your third go this afternoon.
—It might be repetition but I am sure it is not tedious. I want to speak to this motion to take note of the report—a motion moved by Senator O'Brien, who I am sure is taking an interest in this as well. The report entitled Two treaties tabled on 6 June 2000 was tabled by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties this week, the committee chaired by the fast becoming notorious Mr Andrew Thomson, whose remarks had some coverage earlier this week in relation to other issues. I disagree very much with those remarks, but the conduct of the chair in the way he does business through the committee is something that I do not criticise. Indeed, I thank him in relation to this report and specifically for his willingness to seek a common agreement so that a consensus report could be put down, and that is what has occurred.
The report deals with two treaties. I will not go through with tedious repetition the government's position in relation to treaties more broadly. Suffice to say, the committee as a whole and its role highlight the importance of engaging internationally and examining and hopefully increasing community awareness and understanding the great benefit we get from many of the international agreements that we reach. One of the treaties covered in this report is the proposed agreement with Spain on remunerated employment for dependants of personnel at diplomatic and consular missions. The committee did not have any problems with that. The other treaty, which I want to speak about at more length, is the proposed amendments to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species. 
The committee supported the amendments, and I personally very strongly support them—one amendment in particular will uplist the dugong to the highest level of protection in this convention. I think that is an appropriate move and a welcome one. From my own personal experience as environment spokesperson for the Democrats, I have a lot to criticise the federal government for in relation to their environment performance but, broadly speaking, their performance in relation to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species has been reasonably positive. There were some areas the Democrats would have liked the government to have put forward for uplisting and they have not but, generally speaking, I think the federal government has a reasonably positive record. 
However, this report does focus on some concerns about the information provided by the Department of the Environment and Heritage to the committee in the process of the committee's consideration of the convention. It does make some criticisms about the inadequacies of the information the department provided originally, and I think those criticisms are fair enough.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-08-31,"—The Howard coalition government is strongly committed to encouraging Australian industries to become more innovative and world competitive. This commitment is manifested in support for research and development projects with clearly developed and focused commercial outcomes. One of the features of the Howard government is the integration and cooperation between the various ministries and, in relation to the issues I am talking about tonight, I commend the partnership and cooperation between the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, and the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile. 
The importance the federal government places on research and development is reflected in the government's focus on getting the policy settings for innovation right. Grants and tax concessions have their place, but I commend Senator Minchin for the progress he has made in getting the policy settings for innovation correct. The recommendations of the National Innovation Summit and the report following the commissioning of the Science Capability Review are important elements in the government's innovation action plan, which will clearly identify and address future innovation priorities for Australia. This plan will be in place by the end of the year. I think we should take some time in this adjournment debate tonight to look at a number of components of that. Firstly, there is technology, which is an important part of the world competitive business strategy. We have seen some excellent examples coming to the fore because of the current government's initiatives. To mention but one, the Prime Minister recently launched the $40 million technology based Intelligent Island Program in my home state of Tasmania, made possible by the sale of the second tranche of Telstra.
The word `technology' is used frequently and quite often loosely. But what is `technology'? It is the practical knowledge, the know-how, the skills and the artefacts that can be used to develop new products or services as well as their production and delivery systems. The concept involves three elements: product technology, process technology and management technology. In addition to technology we require innovation. In a progressive society, technology is here today but becomes rapidly obsolete. As new technologies come on line, applications create or revolutionise demand. The concept of innovation implies discovery of something that existed before, although we may not have known about it, and invention of something that did not exist before and is brand new. To be successful innovation must work; technological innovation, to be commercially successful, must provide a return on investment.
Just as `position, position, position' is the key to real estate purchasing, creativity is critical to the corporate climate. This creativity is essential for health, happiness and success in business, especially in starting new ventures. Change has become an essential part of our way of life and creating the right environment is particularly important. It is up to governments to create a climate in which people react positively to change rather than take troglodyte positions. Governments must also encourage entrepreneurial forces which must focus on opportunities. These people must have real commitment to seizing those opportunities at the same time as accepting reasonable risk. Corporate research and development is a crucial component of the wealth creation process and is essential to maintaining our international competitiveness. Governments have a large role to play in encouraging innovation and, therefore, research and development. They must provide leadership and vision and champion the causes of those who are prepared to take risks. They must create the environment in which innovation can flourish. 
I take this opportunity of commending the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, for his achievements to date. I encourage him to continue and expand this good work, especially in the area of research and development. Research and development, as I mentioned earlier, is more than just throwing money and tax concessions at R&D. The National Innovation Summit, which I referred to earlier, brought together leaders from business, government and academic organisations to pinpoint and deal with pivotal issues. I will share some of those findings with the Senate tonight. Firstly, business confidence must be promoted by making sure that risk taking is rewarded and that regulation is not a burden. Secondly, internationally competitive incentives, including taxation concessions, grants, loans and venture capital, are necessary to support the full range of innovation activities. Most important is that an educational system be developed that is appropriate to a knowledge based economy. Here the work of Dr Kemp really comes to the fore. One must expect nowadays that lifelong learning is the norm—learning that responds to the needs of business, that expects and feeds off inputs from industry and that inculcates the concepts and fundamentals of entrepreneurialism from an early age.
There is a need in Australia—I think it is appropriate at this time of the Olympics—to raise this concept that we must develop a sports-like pride and passion in the whole community to develop our innovative achievements. These must be recognised at the start to invest in a world-class research environment, and this must be the foundation for the future. In order to apply the summit's findings, a post-summit high-level implementation group is continuing the partnership model of business, research, education and government, with three senior representatives from each sector. Their report to the minister is imminent. I take this opportunity to applaud this group's ongoing work and their commitment to innovation.
As a government, we must encourage and reward investment and innovation to ensure that Australia participates in the global benefits of innovation and subsequent reward and growth. I therefore encourage greater government support for innovation and urge Australian industry and business, large and small, to enthusiastically embrace research and development to ensure higher growth in this very important area, because, as such, Australians' living standards will be enhanced and Australia will take its place rightfully as one of the leading nations of this world.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Research and Development: Government Policy</title>,Adjournment,23,1
