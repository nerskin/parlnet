"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2003-10-13,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report, entitled Review of the Defence annual report 2001-02.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have pleasure in presenting the committee's report. The 2001-02 Defence annual report covers a period of climactic events affecting Australian and world security. The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the rise of non-state adversaries are causing nations to evaluate and reconsider their national defence strategies and priorities. Australia is not alone in this challenge. The review of the Defence annual report provides an opportunity to scrutinise the performance of Defence in delivering key services and in reacting to new security threats.
Defence has recently established a Special Operations Command. Key components of this are the new Tactical Assault Group East and the Incident Response Regiment. A key challenge faced by Defence in providing these new capabilities is the provision of highly trained personnel. The Australian Defence Force, particularly the Army, is subject to high operational tempo which has implications for personnel, training and equipment. The committee examined how Defence is managing Army personnel and equipment.
A key Defence procurement program is the replacement of the FA18 and F111 combat and strike aircraft. The government has committed funding to the systems design and development stage of the joint strike fighter —the F35 program. A decision on whether to purchase the F35 is not required until 2006. The committee examined the F35's capability, the transitional arrangements from the existing aircraft to the F35 and possible Australian industry involvement opportunities. Financial management and performance reporting of Defence outcomes and outputs are key requirements which require transparency and accountability to the parliament.
The 2003-04 portfolio budget statements are an improvement over the previous year. Further improvements, however, are possible. Through the review of the 2001-02 Defence annual report, the committee recommends that the Department of Defence should:
	include in future portfolio budget statements cost data on the ADF Reserve Forces, including total cost data and cost data by service; and
	respond to the measures proposed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute to improve Defence budgetary transparency, discussed on pages 99 to 105 of the ASPI Defence budget brief 2003-04.
In addition, the Department of Defence should provide information in its annual report:
	indicating and giving reasons for the key changes to Defence capability which are identified in the next defence capability plan; 
	detailing the Army's personnel deficiencies and the measures being undertaken to address these problems;
	detailing the work and performance outcomes of the Military Inspector General for Military Justice of the Australian Defence Force;
	giving a description of the role, structure and function, including transition to new functions of Reserve forces and the extent to which Army is blending them with regular units; and 
	outlining Australia's role in the joint strike fighter program, the projected cost, transitional arrangements and progress with Australian industry involvement in the program. The Department of Defence should include performance targets and objectives in its report. Subsequent annual reports should report outcomes against those targets and objectives.
The committee concludes that the implementation of these measures will enhance transparency and parliamentary accountability of Defence operations. In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the review of the 2001-02 Defence annual report. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I support the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa and want to make a few comments about the report. It is unfortunate that this report is being tabled at a time when I think the next annual report has already been put to bed and is shortly due for release. Hopefully, that is something we can address in the next review of the annual report. I cannot comment on all of the report, given the limited time available. However, I would like to reiterate a few of the recommendations, some mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa.
Firstly, in relation to the Inspector-General for Military Justice of the Australian Defence Force, I think it is a pity that, given this was an initiative of the defence forces and of the government, there is actually nothing in the annual report that details the activities of the inspector-general. In fact, the Singleton Army training establishment has been subject to well-publicised issues concerning bastardisation of some recruits, so the absence of the inspector-general's report is somewhat startling. While talking about military justice, I should mention that we have called for the public release of the review of the Defence Legal Service. I must say, I await that with great anticipation.
The subcommittee has been pursuing the issue of reserves, particularly the Army Reserve, for some time. There have been some significant changes to the reserves. Two of the recommendations apply to reserves—particularly the inclusion of the cost data of the ADF reserves, as well as their capability and measurable performance indicators. This report for the first time establishes the cost of each member of the Army Reserve at $60,000 per annum. I think it is only reasonable that we should try to see what value for money we are getting. Recommendation 7 asks that the annual report include detailed information on the role, structure and function, including the transition to new functions, of the reserve forces, in particular the Army Reserve.
It is a disappointment, I think, to all those who take an interest in defence matters that the changes to the reserves have not produced one ministerial statement. I think it is fair to say that in the seven years of the Howard government there has not been one ministerial statement by a junior minister for defence, much less on this important issue of reserves. I remind the House—

—Thank you, Mr Speaker. What constitutes the high Ready Reserve, and how they are organised, is an abiding issue for the committee. We are certainly hopeful that by stating our interest in this report we will get some comprehensive answers in the future.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2003-10-13,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	condemns the abuse of human rights in North Korea and the unconscionable treat-ment by that government of its citizens;
(2)	calls on the Government of North Korea to comply with international standards to reform conditions for its citizens;
(3)	urges the DPRK to engage more fully with the international community to address Australia's and the international commun-ity's concerns over border crossers in North Korea and notes Australian support for further scrutiny by the UN Commission on Human Rights of the human rights situation in the DPRK; and 
(4)	calls on the North Korean regime to cease and desist from any development of weapons of mass destruction.
It has been written:
North Korea is a desperado in the international arena, holed up in its enclave and taunting its enemies to come and get it. Kim Jong Il runs the place as a criminal syndicate, maintaining his kingdom with money earned primarily from arms trading, drug running, money-counterfeiting, and foreign aid. He spends the money on his own pleasures—lavish feasts, flocks of dancing girls, barrels of fine wines and spirits, fleets of black Mercedes-Benz sedans to dole out as gifts—and on the People's Army. The only thing the country still produces that has much export value is weaponry.
Whilst recently in South Korea, the appalling condition of border crossers came to my attention, as did the fact that an estimated 50,000 North Korean refugees flee into China in any one year. As many as 100,000 North Koreans are displaced inside North Korea and an unknown number of North Koreans, who might be refugees, are in Russia and elsewhere, while 583 North Koreans ran the dreadful risk of crossing the border into South Korea during the year. It is claimed by authorities of the United Nations that up to two million North Koreans, or nearly 10 per cent of the population, have died from hunger or famine related disease since 1994. Some estimates of mortality range as high as 2.5 million citizens. In fact, we have the situation where border crossers into China have been attempting to get to the Australian consulate in South China. There was a report in the Australian on Monday, 8 September 2003 of Mr Ri Chae-woo, said to be a North Korean biological weapons expert, attempting to enter the Australian consulate in South China on Friday, prior to this report, but being arrested by Chinese security agents who keep a watch on the Australian consulate.
Whilst in South Korea, I made the acquaintance of the honourable Hwang Woo-yea, a civil rights worker, who proposed that we should consider establishing in Australia some sort of charter of international parl-iamentarians to deal with the problems of North Korean refugees. I believe that is a very honourable and worthwhile suggestion. I will read briefly to the House some of the objectives of such an organisation:
The members of “International Parliamentarians' Coalition for the North Korean Refugees and Human Rights” shall make the following efforts to protect the Human Rights of North Korean refugees.
We will do our best first to improve the general conditions of North Korea to reduce the number of refugees. Second, to make every effort that official refugee status of the United Nations be given to North Korean Refugees. Third, to make every effort for the establishment of resettlement towns in a third country other than the current one in the Republic of Korea. Fourth, to make every effort to stop the forced repatriation of the refugees to North Korea when arrested by the security police of neighbouring countries.
That is to say, China. I was told horrific stories of people who were being forcibly repatriated having hooks through their jaws and being led around like cattle. It is a most horrific and difficult circumstance, on top of which weapons of mass destruction have been developed by that terrible regime in North Korea. I believe that this House needs to take action to resolve these matters. (Time expired)
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>North Korea</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—Human rights abuses occur every day in almost every part of the world. Human rights abuse has become so much a part of our daily digest of news that we have become numb to its realities and desensitised to its horror. We need not look far for evidence of these abuses. No international teams of experts are required to gauge the depth of human rights abuse in nations that do little to hide its existence and even less to prevent its occurrence. Whether it be the child soldiers of the Congo, the religious and political freedoms violated in Vietnam or the starving masses of Zimbabweans living in fear under the dictatorship of Robert Mugabe and others suffering under the many other regimes around the world that torture, starve and repress their own people, the sad news is that the world is a place where daily life for many people is a life of abuse and despair.
But there is always hope, and part of that hope is that wealthy countries such as Australia speak out about and make known to the rest of the world the abuses that do occur but which may not be seen because regimes actively deceive, and conceal their repressive activities. One such place is North Korea. For many years North Korea has been the focus of international attention. Australia has been anxiously watching and observing the development of activities in the Korean peninsula. North Korea remains at the forefront of human rights abusers, with its people being systematically starved and forced to live in a closed and oppressive world where dictatorship is absolute and freedom is non-existent. Matters are made worse by the security tensions in the region and the continuing likelihood that no real solutions will be found for either the escalating nuclear proliferation issue or the need for energy and food. North Korea is facing a generational `dumb-ing down' and the starvation of its people, who count for little in a country that focuses more on defence than on existence.
At the briefing of the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch urged the commission to adopt a resolution condemning the serious and widespread violations of basic human rights in the DPRK. Human Rights Watch has conducted research with North Korean refugees who fled to China and now reside in Seoul. They collected testimony on the horrific conditions and treatment in labour camps and prisons in the DPRK. In a recent report on North Korean refugees published in November 2002, Human Rights Watch documented serious abuses, including the arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of citizens based on their family background, and the torture and cruel and degrading treatment of detainees in labour training camps, provincial concentration centres and in the political prison camps known as administration camps.
Other reports of serious abuses in the DPRK include arbitrary arrests and detention; severe restrictions on the basic and fundamental freedoms of belief, assembly, association, religion and the press; severe restrictions on freedom of movement; and, of course, the use of the death penalty. Criminal law in the DPRK prohibits unauthorized departure from the country, in violation of the fundamental right to leave one's country which is guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. DPRK law provides for potentially severe penalties for offenders, from a sentence of three years in labour re-education camps to punishment by execution of `one who escapes to another country or to the enemy in betrayal of his motherland'.
North Korea is a country that is struggling; it is a country that teeters on the edge between survival and exploding tensions with its neighbours and the rest of the world. For Australia, those tensions are very real and very close to home. But in these tense times we also need level heads and diplomatic caution, not bravado or rhetoric. Australia has direct concerns with North Korea's nuclear program, and we have made that fact public. Australia also has direct concerns about the current reach and prospective reach of the DPRK's ballistic missile program. 
Australia also has concerns about the continued problem of the proliferation of ballistic missile systems and technologies and their sale to the rest of the world, including to the Middle East. On these matters we should also be concerned about the views of the Australian Prime Minister, who has openly talked about of the possibility of war should diplomacy fail. This bravado and pre-emptive attitude is exactly the same as that employed by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to our own neighbours, which has caused the frosting of relationships and has built a level of distrust in Australia's intentions.
Labor, on the other hand, believes in the importance of the consensus between China, Russia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the US in terms of how the Proliferations Strategic Initiative should be advanced. This consensus is crucial if the six-party talks are to have any prospect of success. If we are to be part of the human rights and anti-nuclear-proliferation solution on the Korean peninsula, then we ought not to be part of the diplomacy that encourages difference and isolates people and nations. I congratulate the member for Mitchell on his excellent motion and on his concern about human rights violations in North Korea.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2003-10-13,"—The goings-on in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have long been of concern to the Western world. The citizens of a hardline, rogue regime are generally the first to suffer at its hands. I wholly endorse the sentiments of the member for Mitchell's motion, which condemns such actions and calls for serious reform of the regime. I and others speaking to this motion roundly condemn the appalling record of atrocities carried out by the North Korean government upon its 22.5 million citizens. These atrocities include torture, arbitrary detention, imprisonment, public execution by hanging or by firing squad, and the direct and indirect withholding of food to create famine conditions. This has been happening since the mid-1990s.
This is a regime which prefers to pour billions of dollars into military hardware and the development of nuclear weapons rather than feed its own people. It is a regime which spent $5.2 billion on its military outlays in the 2002 financial year and has an available military manpower of 6.1 million. Yet, indeed, nearly $300 million in food aid alone from the US, South Korea, Japan, the EU, the United Nations and non-government organisations has gone to this country to save it from starvation. This mass shortage of food is not solely due to drought and human conditions; the North Korean government also has a hand. It is a regime which has set up government sponsored groups to replace religious bodies. This regime cloaks its 200,000 or so domestic detainees by placing hardline restrictions on foreign access and journalists. This is a regime which has developed an array of artillery that could place 500,000 shells on the Inchon to Seoul corridor in the first hour of any conflict—a chilling statistic.
Most tellingly, this regime seeks to develop nuclear weapons. The spectre of a mass exodus from North Korea is not an appealing one, and it is already happening, with Japan, China and South Korea already bearing the brunt of this phenomenon. Already 598 North Korean citizens have fled across the border into South Korea during the first half of the year—an increase of seven per cent on the same period last year. 
Our government recognises that the way to break Kim Jong Il's iron grip on North Korea—and thereby bring some security to its people and stability to the global community—is by engaging the nation both diplomatically and economically. But engagement is a two-way street. Little headway can be made with a nation which uses terror as its chief domestic policy weapon and overt military threats to negotiate with the wider world. Quite clearly, the onus is on North Korea to join in the first steps towards this reform.
We too have tried to engage in this reform. Along with the member for Mitchell, who moved this motion, and Mr Gary Gray, a representative of the ALP, I represented the Australian Political Exchange Council in a recent two-day visit to Seoul, where we met with representatives of the main political parties. We were charged with setting up a political exchange between the South Korean government and the Australian government. This is still being negotiated. The young politicians of South Korea have a huge challenge in front of them. That challenge is to negotiate with North Korea, to understand North Korea and to protect their own South Korean people. Our idea is this: with the exchange of politicians between our country and South Korea, we believe that we can help reinforce those young politicians with our parliamentary procedures and views on international affairs and that our politicians, especially our young politicians going from Australia to Korea, can have a better assessment of these things. Anyone who has been to Panmunjon—the armistice village—and looked across the Freedom Bridge to North Korea has had a chilling experience. That experience has to stop. We have to see North Korea brought into the global family, playing a constructive and nonviolent part in that global family. I compliment the member for Mitchell, who led the delegation so well. We hope that this political exchange becomes a reality in the coming year.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>North Korea</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-10-13,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the member for Mitchell's motion condemning human rights abuses in the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, or North Korea, as it is commonly known. The motion also raises the issue of the present extreme malnutrition crisis in that country and the recent threats by the North Korean government to develop a nuclear weapons capability and further destabilise the region. The Kim Jong Il regime is one the most—if not the most—repressive and totalitarian on our planet.
In speaking to this motion, I would like to reiterate that one of the core principles of the Australian Greens is the active support of peace and nonviolence. The member for Mitchell's motion goes to the heart of that principle. It is one of universal application, not simply applying within Australia's borders. It is also a principle which sits easily with the Australian people during a time in which we are faced with the harsh realities of war and terrorism.
This motion is of relevance to Australia, as we may be directly affected by the misguided policies of the government in North Korea. I am sure many members have seen the maps which indicate North Korea's likely missile launch capability, and those maps indicate that Australia is within its reach. Australia therefore needs to strengthen its efforts to obtain a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the North Korea problem and offer to assist in turning around the dreadful humanitarian crisis faced by the North Korean people. 
As members may be aware, on 16 April this year Australia, along with 27 other member countries of the UN Commission on Human Rights, voted in support of a resolution put by the European Union pertaining to the unacceptable human rights situation in North Korea. The motion, in part, expressed:
... deep concern about reports of systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights, including torture, public executions, imposition of the death penalty for political reasons, the existence of a large number of prison camps, the extensive used of forced labour, and lack of respect for the rights of persons deprived of their liberty; all-pervasive and severe restrictions on the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion, opinion, expression, peaceful assembly and association and on access of everyone to information, and limits imposed on movement; mistreatment of and discrimination against disabled children ... continued violations of the human rights of women ...
The UN was also critical of North Korea's refusal to allow humanitarian organisations to have free and open access to that country. It was a very comprehensive motion and a damning indictment of the action of the North Korean government in failing to work in the best interests of the people of North Korea.
Voting against the motion were 10 nations, including China, Malaysia, Zimbabwe, Syria, Libya and the Russian Federation. It is disheartening to see that China, North Korea's neighbour and ally, is not supportive of efforts to improve human rights abuses in that country. China has been guilty in recent times of forcibly returning refugees to North Korea, knowing that they almost certainly face imprisonment, torture and possibly even death for having left the country—a crime in North Korea.
I hope that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will take the opportunity during President Hu's imminent visit to Australia to raise the issue of North Korea, along with other human rights issues, such as the treatment of political and religious dissidents within China and Tibet. In not supporting the recent UN North Korea motion, China stated that it was against targeting specific countries, and it believed the resolution could not contribute to the relaxation of tension or resolve the problems faced on the Korean peninsula. I suggest that Australians believe otherwise: that open and frank discussion and targeted criticism is not only desirable but obligatory on the part of the world community. I therefore congratulate the government on supporting the motion.
It is clear that, in order to address issues such as human rights abuses and threats to international security as posed by North Korea, a number of approaches must be adopted. Diplomacy is vital, as is the development of relationships with individual members of the administration, perhaps by improved cultural and economic ties. And, of course, open and public dissent and criticism should be accepted by all parties.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—The plight of the 17 workers who were locked out of the Blue Ribbon meatworks in Launceston has been well documented in this House. Recently we had the Tasmanian Industrial Commission decision on this, which will be as pleasing to other members of the House as it is to me. The commission has ordered that the Blue Ribbon workers are to have the employment arrangements that existed immediately prior to 2 April 2003, the day they were locked out, reinstated. The commission also ordered that the workers receive back pay for the amount of wages they would have received from that date. 
The commission found that there was no valid reason for the termination of the workers' employment and that the termination was procedurally unfair. It found that the conditions of the employment agreement, which the workers refused to sign, were a contrivance to avoid award obligations and industrial consequences. These workers were locked out of their workplace for a total of 182 days for no good reason, except that they had an expectation that they would be employed under award conditions for a job that most of them had been doing for many years. The decision is a victory for the 17 Blue Ribbon workers, but it is also a victory for the right of all Australian workers to be treated fairly and with respect in relation to their employment conditions, contrary to the actions of this government.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Workplace Relations: Blue Ribbon Products</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Leader of the Nationals. I refer to the Nationals' new target voters, Peter and Lindy—a couple in their early 30s with two to three children and a double income, with Peter working in a light industrial centre and Lindy working as a part-time librarian. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that since 1996, Peter and Lindy are paying an extra $8,000 in federal taxes, including $5,000 in income tax with an effective marginal tax rate of more than 60 per cent? Why then has the Acting Prime Minister said that tax relief for working Australians is a low priority? Why shouldn't Peter and Lindy receive relief from the highest taxing government in Australia's history? ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Families</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2003-10-13,"—The first point I would make is that Peter and Lindy are far more likely to have a job in the first place than when the Labor Party was in government. The second point I would make is that their home mortgage repayments are infinitely lower than they were when the Labor Party was in government.

I can tell the House that, whatever they are, the extrapolation made cannot possibly have been accurate because tax rates have come down, not up.

That this House:
(1)	acknowledges the importance of 17 October 2003 being the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty;
(2)	is deeply concerned about the 1.2 billion people world-wide who are required to live on less than $1 per day, and the adverse effects on health, education, and income earning ability which result;
(3)	supports efforts by the United Nations to reduce world poverty through the develop-ment of its Millennium Development Goals, which call for:
(a)	halving the proportion of people living on $1 per day and halving the number of people who suffer from hunger; 
(b)	ensuring that boys and girls alike complete primary schooling;
(c)	eliminating gender disparity in all levels of education;
(d)	reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate;
(e)	reducing by three-quarters the maternal mortality ratio;
(f)	reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major infectious diseases;
(g)	ensuring environmental sustainability through integration of sustainable development into country policies and reversing the loss of environmental resources, halving the proportion of people without access to potable water and significantly improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers; and
(h)	developing a global partnership for development through raising official development assistance, expanding market access, and encouraging debt sustainability; and
(4)	calls on all national governments and international institutions to make achieve-ment of the Millennium Development Goals a key purpose of their international and domestic programs.  
I draw the attention of members of the House to the fact that this Friday, 17 October has been declared by the General Assembly of the United Nations as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. I would like to thank Mr Ian Sansom of Ulverstone, in my electorate, for prompting me on this very important matter. In observing this day, we pay attention to the specific problems of the destitute and to promoting concrete activities for the eradication of poverty in our world. A review of World Bank reports gives a clear indication of global trends on key poverty indicators. For example, 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 per day and three billion live on less than $2 per day; 113 million children are out of school, two-thirds of them girls; and a billion adults are illiterate. Each year, more than 13 million people lose their lives to HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria and acute respiratory infections. It is estimated that over 500,000 women died from causes related to childbirth in 1995 alone.
While some progress has been made in reducing the effects of poverty, there is still a very long way to go before we can say that extreme poverty has been eradicated. It is therefore important for this House to formally recognise 17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty and to focus on how it will direct the affairs of this nation to realise a world where extreme poverty and destitution are eradicated and, to quote Professor Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, `where they are features of our history and now confined to museums'.
A concrete way in which our nation can work constructively towards a world without poverty is to fully back and actively implement the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Some of the principal goals are: (1) to halve the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day and those who suffer from hunger; (2) to ensure that all boys and girls complete primary school; (3) to reduce by two-thirds the mortality rate among children under five; (4) to reduce by three-quarters the ratio of women dying in childbirth; and (5) to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS and the incidence of malaria and other major diseases throughout our world.
These goals have been commonly accepted by the members of the United Nations, including Australia, as a framework for shaping and measuring the progress of development. A report by the United Nations Secretary-General concerning these issues concludes that, despite the best efforts of many of the poorer countries to use fully their domestic resources for development and poverty reduction, external assistance and international cooperation are still key to ensure that they will be able to achieve the development goals as envisaged in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.
The report goes on to say that microcredit in particular, which is small loans schemes for the very poor, and other financial services are important instruments for poverty reduction and for empowering poor people, especially women. It says that expanding microcredit and microfinance outreach can make significant contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, particularly targets relating to halving by 2015 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. Promoting the greater use of microcredit and increasing funding of microcredit programs in the overseas aid budget should therefore be a priority in Australia's overseas development program. 
The amount allocated in the overseas aid budget for microcredit has increased in recent years. However, spending levels need to increase significantly if more adequate levels of poverty eradication through the use of such programs are to be achieved. Perhaps some might ask why Australia should support the eradication of poverty, particularly that which occurs overseas. I would like to return to this later when I next speak.

"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2003-10-13,"—I second the motion. Amongst our collective policy debates and in our personal deliberations we rarely focus on the fundamentals such as adequate nutrition, infant mortality rates and life expectancy—things that we take for granted but which are the primary concern for hundreds of millions if not billions of people in the world. With the coming Friday being the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, it is appropriate that we consider these issues and I commend the member for Braddon for proposing this motion.
We could debate all day the reasons for poverty—and there are many—but, with resolve, there are also means by which we can make progress on addressing these concerns. In the 2000 UN Millennium Declaration, world leaders committed to doing all they could to eradicate poverty, setting clearly defined targets to be achieved by the year 2015. These Millennium Development Goals covered eight key areas. They were to be benchmarked against 1990 figures, with clear targets for improvement by 2015.
The first was to halve the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day and those who suffer from hunger. One billion people in the world still live on less than $1 a day and an estimated three billion live on less than $2 a day. We have seen some progress in recent years in the Asia-Pacific region but substantial problems still exist in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Central Asia. To address these concerns we need strong economic growth, increased agricultural productivity and policies to better distribute the proceeds of that economic growth amongst those families particularly in need.
The second aim is to ensure that all boys and girls complete primary school education. Currently an estimated 113 million children around the world do not attend school, 60 per cent of those being girls, but this target for 2015 is achievable. We need to ensure that people in the poorest countries can achieve these goals. Youth literacy levels in the high-income earning countries are 95.4 per cent; in the poorer countries, less than 80 per cent—75.9 per cent on average. We need to address issues of literacy. The third goal is to ensure that we eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and that by 2015 we achieve equal levels of education for boys and girls and men and women in these countries.
The fourth target is to reduce by two-thirds the mortality rate of children under five. Every year, nearly 11 million young children die before their fifth birthday, mainly from preventable illnesses. This must be addressed. That number is coming down but there is a lot more to do. In high-income countries, the number of deaths of under five-year-olds is as low as seven per thousand live births; but in low-income countries it is as high as 121 per thousand live births. We need to do whatever we can to address this grave issue. The fifth target is to reduce by three-quarters the ratio of women dying in childbirth. Again the contrast is stark. In high-income countries, only 12 women per 100,000 live births die in the process of birth. In low-income countries the figure is as high as 670 per 100,000 live births. 
The sixth aim is to halt and reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS and the incidence of malaria and other major diseases. It is estimated that 40 million people are living with HIV, including five million newly infected in 2001. Countries like Brazil, Senegal, Thailand and Uganda have shown that the spread of HIV can be stemmed. Other communicable diseases need to be addressed also, such as the high rates of tuberculosis. In low-income countries there are 197 cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people compared with only nine per 100,000 in high-income countries. Mortality rates, which in high-income countries are two per 100,000, in low-income countries are 45 per 100,000.
The seventh aim is to ensure environmental sustainability, to integrate the principles of sustainable development so that we can reduce by at least half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers around the world who do not have access to clean water or sanitation. The eighth aim of these millennium goals is to do what we can to develop global partnerships for development to ensure that we do what we can to work with these poorer people in these less-developed countries.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—In December 1992, under United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/196, 17 October was declared the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. On 17 October, every nation is invited to devote the day to presenting and promoting activities on the eradication of poverty both internationally and nationally. In the UK this year this has created initiatives such as `Ringing out against poverty'. This involves all places of worship ringing their bell at 12 noon as a call for the recognition of the worth and dignity of every man, woman and child condemned to live in poverty. Other countries around the world will have events of similar standing such as public meetings, walks, displays and exhibitions. Sadly—and I believe this is due to minimal government impetus—there are no such events occurring in Australia this year, according to the UN.
This measure towards the eradication of poverty is just one of the Millennium Development Goals which the UN has sought to achieve by 2015. In his message on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the Secretary General said:
Approximately 1.2 billion people struggle to survive on less than a dollar a day. An estimated 840 million suffer the gnawing pain of hunger, and as many as 24,000 people, many of them children, die every day as a result. People who are hungry are more susceptible to disease, and find their capacity to work diminished as well. Hunger also impairs children's ability to learn, with consequences that are felt long after childhood is over. There is no time to lose if we are to reach the Millennium Development Goal—agreed by all the world's countries—of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who live on less than a dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.
The main aim in announcing these objectives is to set time-bound and measurable goals. But, just as importantly, the UN announcement gives these issues and goals the prominence necessary so that macro and micro policy formation, at both government and non-government levels, can incorporate them into the very essence of the targets their policies hope to address.
Although these priorities are paramount, none can be said to be more important than eradicating poverty. This is evidenced by the UN declaring the decade between 1997 and 2006 the decade for the eradication of poverty in resolution 50/107. This declaration, along with the 17 October initiative, has seen a sizeable decline in the number of people living on less than a dollar a day. Having said this, due to the eradication being patchy and uneven that number still stands at a staggering 1.2 billion people—about one in every five. 
But the problem with poverty figures is this: we can measure poverty in so many ways that we can delude ourselves that, in Australia, poverty in insignificant. This is untrue. Although poverty in Australia is not measured by those living on less than a dollar a day, or absolute poverty, we do have relative poverty rates that are of concern, and certainly high poverty rates amongst our Indigenous communities.
In the last figures available, Australians living at the poverty line of 40 per cent of the median equivalent income was 7.1 per cent. To the uninitiated, this means that 7.1 per cent of Australians are living on about 40 per cent of the average wage. This is in excess of half a per cent more than Canada for the same period of time, more than double that of France and nearly three per cent more than that of the UK and Germany. This results in having people living in poverty within my own electorate of Chisolm, where they need food vouchers in order to give their family and themselves the bare essentials. All too often, these are also the working poor—people who are actually working but are unable to meet their day-to-day needs. They will never own their own house and they will never be free from debt—they are predominately living on credit card debt—and will never cease requiring some form of special support just to have the bare necessities.
The distressing part of living in a country like Australia, where most have enough and some have plenty, is that there is a firm denial about poverty. Even in my electorate, which ranges from the lower end of the economic scale to the very high end, many do not believe that there are those amongst us who live in poverty. It makes many feel much better to place the blame on the victim, to label them or to simply ignore them and refuse to help. This requires less empathy and takes less time than trying to understand how poverty could occur in such a lucky country. But it does, and all too often.
I want to thank the member for Braddon for raising this very important issue in the House and I echo his call that the Millennium Development Goals be achieved through international and domestic programs, especially in eradicating poverty. I hope the government heeds this call and gives prominence to these goals, given its recent $7.5 billion surplus. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>International Day for the Eradication of Poverty</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-10-13,"—I would also like the thank the member for Braddon for bringing to the notice of this House the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, which is actually on Friday, 17 October. I hope that all Australians will join us in thinking about what it must be like to live in a country that is stricken by poverty—to be in one of those families who cannot provide basic food, shelter, health care, clean water and sanitation, and whose children die from common diseases which are almost unknown in Australia today.
Poverty robs people of their dignity, although I have found in visiting some of these poverty-stricken areas that there is a certain dignity to these people. But it does rob people of their dignity when they cannot work, when they cannot provide for their families and when they cannot fully participate in our society. Poverty-stricken areas around the world provide very fertile ground for people, some of whom are wealthy or well educated but who have dreadful motives, to ply their trade of terrorism. If world leaders are serious about ending terrorism, they surely have to address the root cause of terrorism—recognise it, acknowledge it and then go some way towards fixing the problem. 
In that context I would like to highlight some of the things that the Australian government does. Obviously because of our geographic location, we have a particular interest in the Asia-Pacific region. The aim of the Australian assistance program is to reduce poverty and to achieve sustainable development. In recent times, I had the privilege of seeing two AusAID-initiated programs that benefit people in poorer regions. One was in a remote village of Tibet. I noticed the little booklet put out by RESULTS Australia features children in Tibet on its front cover. These children's lives were changed because Australia had contributed to a clean water project by providing the village with a well. It is simple projects like this that can mean the difference between life and death for the children who live in those villages. I also recently visited an AIDS project in Urumqi in Xinjiang province in China, where the rate of HIV-AIDS infection is very high. Our AusAID people were working with local health professionals and prison officials to try to reduce the number of infections in that region.
Clean water is essential for health and food production. In Asia two billion people do not have access to hygienic sanitation, and around 700 million do not have access to safe drinking water. Our programs, whether they specifically address health issues such as tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS or lack of iodine in the diets of children in some of these countries, help to address the issue of poverty. Australia provides $1.8 billion as official development assistance and supports the role of the millennium goals to focus national and international efforts.
I would also like to comment that we all have a role to play. It is the responsibility not only of governments to alleviate poverty; it is an issue that every one of us can and should contribute to. I would like to acknowledge people in my electorate whose character and temperament have provided great assistance to people in poverty stricken areas. These people not only go to help people in poorer areas but, when they come back, they also enrich Australia's society and strengthen our links with other countries. Their work fosters better understanding between our countries. Peter and Jenny Ripley of Mundaring in my electorate are a couple that have been to Tonga as volunteers. Jean Arnold has been in Vietnam giving her time on a volunteer basis. I understand that 7,000 Australian volunteers play a very important role in alleviating poverty. In fact, the longest serving volunteer, who served in community health, did so in India for 31 years. This is a joint responsibility if we are going to address the needs of alleviating poverty world wide.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to speak again without closing the debate.
Leave granted.
—I would like to acknowledge the contributions of my colleagues in the House: the member for Macquarie, the member for Chisholm, the member for Pearce and, in anticipation, the member for Cowper. Thank you very much for taking up this important discussion today. Last time I spoke I said that some people might ask why Australia should support the eradication of poverty and particularly that which occurs overseas. I thank in particular the member for Pearce for her comments in relation to this. We need look no further for an answer to this question than the 1997 Simons report, which reviewed Australia's overseas aid program. In establishing a case for overseas aid, Mr Simons said: 
The prosperity of the developing world is clearly in Australia's national interest—not only for regional stability and security but also for our own economic future.
He identified threats to national and global security and said:
Few ... threats ... can be dealt with effectively by markets, by individual nations, or even by bilateral partnerships. They require consistent, coordinated and effective multilateral responses.
In relation to Australia's economy, Mr Simons said:
A fundamental international economic challenge is to increase the number of countries which enjoy broad-based sustainable growth.
A prosperous region creates opportunities for growth in trade and the Australian economy. Finally, in terms of our moral obligation as a relatively wealthy country, he said we should `assist those with significantly less opportunity than ourselves'. So, in short, Mr Simons was saying that Australia should have an effective overseas aid program because it increases our security, builds our domestic economy and has a moral imperative. The same arguments apply to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals as outlined by the member for Macquarie. A prosperous world helps the poor, increases international security and builds our economy. But above the material benefits is the more fundamental and moral argument that we should support them because they are the best route to eradicating poverty and because it is the right thing to do.
It is essential that the Millennium Development Goals are implemented with a sense of urgency and aggressive determination through our international and domestic development programs. Our past and present efforts at assisting the world's poor have been and are commendable. However, we can always do better. I call on members of this House along with my colleagues to make the eradication of poverty central to our role as Australian parliamentarians. I would like to quote from the Global Poverty Report of July 2000, because I think it encapsulates what the implications and meanings of poverty really are. It says:
Poverty goes beyond lack of income. It encompasses economic, social, and governance dimensions. Economically, the poor are not only deprived of income and resources, but of opportunities. Markets and jobs are often difficult to access, because of low capabilities and geographical and social exclusion. Limited access to education affects the ability of the poor to get jobs and to obtain information that could improve the quality of their lives. Poor health due to inadequate nutrition, hygiene and health services further limits their prospects for work and from realizing their mental and physical potential. This fragile position is exacerbated by insecurity. Living in marginal conditions with no resources to fall back on, shocks become hard or impossible to offset. The situation is made worse by the structure of societies and institutions that tends to exclude the poor from participating in decision-making over the direction of social and economic development.
I again thank all those members who spoke to this motion. I know that they in particular will join with me in emphasising 17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>International Day for the Eradication of Poverty</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NP,2003-10-13,"—I would like to commend the member for Braddon on his motion concerning the vitally important issue of poverty. I believe that part of the true tragedy in this whole issue for less developed countries is that the OECD has provided some $318 billion in subsidies and support for agriculture. The World Bank has found that full liberalisation of trade could lead to global gains in the order of $832 billion and that almost two-thirds of those gains would flow to low- and middle-income countries. To put this in perspective, this is some five times the aid that flows to developing countries. It is an amazing thought that we could massively increase the wellbeing of our less developed countries at relatively little or no cost merely by reforming the corrupted system of agricultural subsidies. 
Some tariffs on products are as high as 1,000 per cent. James Wolfensohn of the World Bank has stated that the average European cow receives more in subsidies than the average income of a person in Africa. That is a pretty staggering statement. Japan imposes a 778 per cent tariff on rice, and butter gets in at the relatively lighter tariff of 546 per cent. In the EU there is a 228 per cent tariff on sugar. The resources which many less developed countries need to fight poverty, to fight poor health, to achieve good education outcomes, to fight AIDS and to protect their environment are denied to them because they are locked out of many agricultural markets where they could compete. I am pleased to say that Australia is playing its part, having offered generous market access to some of the world's poorest countries over the last 25 years. From 1 July 2003 Australia has provided tariff-free entry of goods from quite a number of the world's least developed countries with no exclusions, including East Timor, Cambodia, Bangladesh and a large number of sub-Saharan countries. Kofi Annan has said:
No single change could make a greater contribution to eliminating poverty than opening up the markets of prosperous countries to the goods produced by the poorer ones.
Our trade minister, Mark Vaile, has been working tirelessly to achieve an improved world trade regime but the world is held back, being able to travel only at the pace of the least progressive countries. If we could increase the speed limit that is being imposed by the least progressive countries we could get a better outcome on world trade and a better outcome for less developed countries.
In the light of the failed Cancun negotiations the implications are clear: poor countries will continue to suffer most, as their economies are heavily reliant on agriculture, their governments cannot match the subsidies that are put in place by the Europeans and they are unable to break through tariff and quota barriers. Australia not only plays its part in the area of trade but also is active in foreign aid. AusAID is involved in a range of projects in many countries around the world. AusAID is involved in capital works projects but it also participates in a range of niche projects—relatively small, low-cost projects that are producing real outcomes on the ground. I have been fortunate in being able to visit a number of AusAID projects such as a sanitation project in Timor and, in Cambodia, an employment project for blind people—people who had no prospect of employment in Cambodia as it is today. That project used a small amount of funding from Australia, combined with people on the ground in Cambodia. For instance, some great work by Volunteers Abroad is producing some real outcomes to help people in those countries.
The millennium development goals provide some worthy objectives for international programs. Those goals should be commended. The international community has a huge role to play in the fight against poverty and improving the quality of life in the Third World. It is hypocritical for European countries and others on the one hand to claim that they have very effective and large foreign aid programs but, on the other hand, to condemn those countries to poverty by locking them out of their markets and ensuring that they are dependent on aid well into the future. Australia is playing its part through its aid program. Australia is also playing its part through attempting to liberalise world markets. We have to keep up the pressure for trade reform and we have to keep up our aid program. The figures are incredible. I go back to that statement by James Wolfensohn: the average European cow is receiving more in subsidies than the average African's income. The figure is staggering.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—This afternoon I want to look at two matters of great concern to people in my electorate of Fowler. The first issue I want to raise is one which has alarmed the Vietnamese community in my electorate and in other parts of Australia. On Monday, 6 October this year, the Vietnamese language segment on SBS TV services commenced the daily broadcasting of a news program sourced from the Vietnamese state-run news service VTV4.
As members would be aware, the great majority of Vietnamese people in Australia came here as refugees from the present government in Vietnam. Many suffered under the oppressive regime and have traumatic memories of their experience before coming to Australia. You can therefore appreciate the alarm of Vietnamese Australians when their Vietnamese language news program is sourced from that same regime. At best, the program could be dismissed as propaganda but, at worst, it is a daily reminder of the reach of the government of Vietnam into the homes of Vietnamese Australians.
VTV4 has content designed by the Vietnamese ministry of culture. It contains information aimed at Vietnamese living abroad and has a publicly stated focus of propagandising to Vietnamese expatriates. The decision by SBS TV to go ahead with the broadcasting of VTV4 news goes against the promise made in March 2002 by the then head of SBS TV, Mr Peter Cavanagh, to invite comment from leaders of the Vietnamese community in Australia before any decision was made about important programming. But there has been no consultation and no indication that SBS TV will review the decision to screen VTV4 news. SBS TV has now gone ahead and, despite the pleas of the Vietnamese community in Australia, refuses to withdraw the program. 
The continued screening by SBS TV of the blatant propaganda of VTV4 news is offensive to the many thousands of Vietnamese Australians who fled from the oppression of the communist regime. This makes the decision by SBS TV very hard to understand. The great majority of Vietnamese speakers in Australia will simply refuse to watch the program. They have seen enough propaganda to last them a lifetime. A generation of younger Vietnamese speakers will be discouraged from watching the program, which is seen to be heavily biased towards the Hanoi regime. The important role of providing community language programs to encourage the maintenance of language skills will be lost. An independent Vietnamese language news service, reporting objectively on events in Vietnam, will simply not be available. As a result, SBS TV will lose significant audience and, while it does not rely on ratings, it is in clear breach of its charter when it fails to provide suitable programs to its audience.
The hard-won integrity of SBS TV is compromised by this decision. Access to objective news services for Vietnamese speakers, which should be a priority of SBS TV, is sacrificed for the sake of what appear to be commercial reasons. I call on the management of SBS TV to immediately review its decision to include VTV4 news in its Vietnamese language programming and to consult closely—and it has to consult closely—with the Vietnamese community in Australia to select the most appropriate sources for its Vietnamese language news services.
The second issue I want to raise is emerging as one of the biggest concerns in my electorate of Fowler—that is, the service, or lack of it, provided by Australia Post in the suburbs that make up the electorate of Fowler. Just on a year ago, the main Australia Post shop in George Street, Liverpool was severely damaged by fire. The Post shop has remained closed since then. It is my understanding that a dispute with the owner of the premises is behind the lack of urgency in restoring Post shop services on that site. So, if you live in Liverpool and you need to access Australia Post services, the only alternative is to use the remaining Australia Post shop at Westfield Liverpool.
Here we have a major urban centre in Sydney served only by one rather small Australia Post shop. It is not surprising that, every time I go past the Australia Post shop in Liverpool, the long lines to the counters stretch out the doors and into the mall areas of Westfield shopping centre. I have had complaints from constituents who claim to have waited for more than 20 minutes each time they use the post office. That is not hard to believe if you have seen the long queues.
Australia Post services are especially important in areas like Liverpool. There was a time when water, gas, telephone and electricity services operated offices at which customers could pay their bills over the counter. But times have changed since then. If you need to pay a bill these days, the only place you can go to is the Australia Post shop. Many people in the electorate of Fowler do not have a cheque account, so they cannot post off a cheque to pay a bill. They keep only a small balance in their bank accounts, so they cannot safely use direct debit facilities. If they have a credit card they often keep a small credit limit, and many people lack the confidence to use phone services for paying bills. Of course, not many older people have the access and skills to use the Internet to pay their bills. So their only option is to join the long queue at the Australia Post shop to pay their bills. Many face a bus trip to Liverpool or Cabramatta and then a 15- to 20-minute wait in the queue. That is not easy for some older people. Paying a bill has become a dreaded experience. 
Bill paying is not the only business at Australia Post shops. The electorate of Fowler has the greatest number of residents born overseas, and mail services are one of the most commonly used contacts that people have with their families and friends overseas. So there is a high demand for regular post services. With the major Liverpool Post shop having been closed for nearly a year, the people of Liverpool have suffered the delays and inconvenience for far too long.
Earlier this year I was pleased to support an application for a post office agency in Warwick Farm. This would have taken some of the strain off the Westfield Liverpool post office and provided a much-needed service to the many older residents of Warwick Farm. But Australia Post knocked back the application on the grounds that there would not be sufficient demand for postal services in Warwick Farm. They were so wrong. So the people of that part of the electorate will have to make their way to Liverpool and get on the end of the queue at the Westfield shop.
As we know, Australia Post has a monopoly on postal services, but much of its service is now closer to retailing and banking services. Of course, it is in effect a profit-making corporation, so the actions of Australia Post in not reopening the main Liverpool Australia Post shop can only be seen as a means of maximising its profit from its operations. But that profit comes at the cost of great inconvenience to its customers. As I have said, these customers have no choice when it comes to dealing with Australia Post. They have no real choice but to line up and wait their turn.
Many banks in my electorate also have long queues but, when compared to Australia Post, bank customers get first-class service. I have great sympathy for the staff at Australia Post shops in my area. When customers have been waiting for more than 20 minutes, they can get a bit touchy to deal with. I cannot say I blame them, but the long wait they endure is not the fault of Australia Post staff—it is the fault of its management. The situation with Australia Post services in Liverpool is a disgrace. The failure to reopen the George Street, Liverpool Australia Post shop shows a contempt for the people of Liverpool. The refusal to allow the opening of an agency in Warwick Farm shows that Australia Post is only interested in profits and not people.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-10-13,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments (1) to (4), (8) to (11) and (13) to (15) be agreed to, and that amendments (5) to (7) and (12) be disagreed to. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendments (1) to (4), (8) to (11) and (13) to (15) and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to consider amendments (5) to (7) and (12). I move:
That Senate amendments (1) to (4), (8) to (11) and (13) to (15) be agreed to.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer reached an agreement with the Australian Democrats to enable passage of both the government's superannuation co-contribution for low-income earners bill and the superannuation surcharge rate reduction measures bill. Savings generated from the smaller reduction in the superannuation surcharge rates will be applied to this measure, thereby enabling the government to extend the co-contribution scheme's parameters. The changes mean that, while the total pool of money spent on the co-contribution and surcharge rate reduction measures is not estimated to change significantly, it is now applied in favour of low-income earners at the rate of 66 per cent to 34 per cent over the budget years 2004-05 to 2007-08.
Amendments (1) to (4), (8) to (11) and (13) to (15) to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 give effect to this agreement. These amendments will mean that qualifying people earning up to $40,000 will now be entitled to a co-contribution if they make eligible personal superannuation contributions. This measure is a significantly greater incentive than the current tax offset it is replacing and will be a direct injection into the retirement savings of qualifying people. In addition, the thresholds will be indexed from the 2007-08 income year onwards to maintain the scheme's targeting of low-income earners.
The amendments also provide for the measure to now apply to eligible personal superannuation contributions made on or after 1 July this year. Further to this, the date on which superannuation providers must give statements for the purposes of the co-contribution will be prescribed in regulations to enable the government to provide industry groups with time to implement the necessary alteration to their systems. Finally, the amendments also provide for additional reporting to the parliament on a quarterly and annual basis about the operation of the co-contribution measure, including details about the recipients and payments made. I commend these amendments to the House.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-10-13,"—I move:
That amendments (5) to (7) and (12) be disagreed to.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the government is opposing amendments (5) to (7) and (12) to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribut-ion for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003. It appears that the Senate has misunderstood the intended operation of this bill and its application to same-sex couples. The co-contribution measure in this bill only applies to an individual. The bill does not distinguish between eligible individuals in same-sex relationships and eligible individuals in any other relationships. The co-contribution will be available to an eligible person regardless of their marital status or sexual preference. The same-sex amendments to this bill are redundant because there is no possible discrimination in respect of the operation of this bill.
Let me conclude by restating that the agreement negotiated between the government and the Australian Democrats did not include any agreement to deal with the subject matter of this amendment. The government will honour the agreement it has with the Australian Democrats, which is confined to the subject matter of the bill. The government will be rejecting this amendment in the House and will not support it if it is considered again in the Senate. The failure of this bill to achieve passage, or further delays, will significantly reduce the retirement benefits for low-income earners.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration just indicated to the parliament that the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 does not discriminate against people—and their right to benefit from this legislation—on the basis of their sexual preference or the sort of relationship they are in. The truth is, however, that the whole of the superannuation system currently discriminates against same-sex couples, and that is what these amendments go to. It is a very important principle, because superannuation is meant to be universal. When the Labor government amended superannuation in 1992, the minister at the time clearly indicated in his second reading speech the change to the definition of `spouse'. He said:
The key criterion for eligibility of a surviving spouse ... will be the existence of a permanent and bona fide ... relationship.
There was no discussion at the time about whether it was meant to apply to same-sex relationships or exclusively to heterosexual relationships. There was no judgment there, because it was considered that de facto relationships would remove this discrimination.
The truth, as we know from practical examples and court cases, is that the legislation does currently discriminate. Hence these amendments are an attempt to change that and clause 12 is a direct take from my private member's bill, superannuation entitlements of same-sex couples, to which I have moved three first reading amendments and one second reading amendment in this House. It is a bill which I have pursued with a great deal of vigour. I moved it first on 22 June 1998. I reintroduced it on 7 December 1998. It had a second reading on 7 June 1999 and was reintroduced on 25 June 2001. It had a Senate select committee reference and that committee recommended that my bill be supported. It is supported by industry, in particular the superannuation industry, which does not want to deal with complexities in law about the nature of relationships and which understands that super-annuation represents someone's retirement income savings and that it is their money to give to their legitimate spouse regardless of a judgment which some of the moral pygmies opposite might make about the legitimacy of a relationship. I say: nobody in the government or society has the right to make that judgment. It is up to an individual to determine who they are in a relationship with. 
This amendment is simply an attempt to bring superannuation legislation into the present. It is very disappointing that the government have accepted every other amendment except this one; even more disappointing is the Australian Democrats' betrayal of their purported constituency. When the government say that they are in agreement with the Australian Democrats, they are saying they have done the sleaziest deal since Meg Lees did the deal with the government over the GST, that new tax on ordinary Australians. 
The hypocrisy is mind-boggling. Brian Greig, the Senate spokesperson for the Democrats on sexuality issues released press releases on 15 February 2000, 29 February 2000, 24 August 2001, 29 June 2001, 4 April 2000, 12 March 2002 and 23 June 2002 in which he condemns the Labor Party for not fixing up this legislation in spite of the fact that we were well ahead of the game. If you look up Hansard and you type in `same-sex superannuation', you will not see it mentioned first by the Democrats over the other side. The first mention is from the Australian Labor Party representatives on this side. The leader of the Labor Party, Simon Crean, the member for Hotham, came down to Melbourne—along with the member for Melbourne Ports, Michael Danby, and the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek—to help me launch the `same sex, same rights' campaign conducted by the Body Shop two years ago. They collected petitions over a period of a week. This was a private sector organisation—one with a heart and some compassion and social responsibility—taking up this issue not asking for special rights or special consideration just equal rights.
The Labor Party have been at the forefront of this campaign. We will continue to be, and we will not be part of sleazy arrangements with the government in order to stop reform. But the Democrats know they are in trouble, because Brian Greig is on the record time after time talking about this issue and tonight he stands exposed for his hypocrisy. Last week's issue of the Sydney Star Observer,issue No. 683, said:
Greig said he hoped the credibility of Democrats would not be damaged.
Bad luck, Brian, because you are incredibly damaged by this sell-out. He said:
I encourage the community to look at this issue in its complexity ... It's not as black and white as our critics are making out.
It has been black-and-white in the past for Senator Greig and the Australian Democrats who have refused to be a part of the broad campaign and have chosen a sectarian road on this issue in attacking people who support reform. The government has again rejected these amendments in spite of the views of people such as the member for North Sydney and the member for Bradfield, who, to their credit, have indicated their support for reform. The government, led by a bigot in the Prime Minister when it comes to issues of sexual preference, is refusing to allow this much needed reform. 
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—Order! The honourable member has used the word `bigot' to describe the Prime Minister. I understand that the word `bigot' is unparliamentary.
—I note that no-one on the government side objected, but I withdraw the term `bigot' and use `prejudiced' in terms of sexual relations. That is something that stands as a record and people are going to vote on it. People are going to vote for prejudice on the basis of sexual preference in this House—that is what they will be doing if they reject these amendments. They are saying that, if you happen to be gay or lesbian and in a relationship, you do not have the right to determine where your super funds go if you depart this life. When people should be allowed to grieve, at such a traumatic time of losing their partners, they end up in legal disputes. It is the last thing that should occur, but it does. There is a real human dimension to the issues in this bill and real pain caused by this discrimination.
That is why this is a lost opportunity for the Democrats. I first spoke on this issue in December 1996. It is seven years on and we have an opportunity. All the Democrats have to do is say no to the government and the government will fold because the central part of this legislation—and there are two parts to it—that the government wants to get through is tax cuts in superannuation for high-income earners, including parliamentarians. We will benefit from this legislation—a pecuniary interest. That is why the government would have folded if the Democrats had one ounce of ticker, but instead Senator Greig and Senator Stott Despoja later tonight are going to walk across and vote against the coalition and pretend to be pure. What a farce! The Democrats are exposed by this. It is a lost opportunity. The government stands condemned and I am very disappointed that we are not holding a celebration for the end of discrimination but that, instead, we will have to wait for the election of a Labor government to remove this discrimination.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, before I start I want to seek your advice. The honourable member for Grayndler was pulled up for using the term `bigot'. I just wondered whether or not `homophobe' is parliamentary language.
 (Hon. D.G.H. Adams)—I believe that it generally would be.
—That is yet to be seen. This is a missed opportunity to right the wrong that has long been done to same-sex couples in the area of superannuation in Australia. The amendment to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 that was moved by Senator Nick Sherry was perfectly reasonable. It provided that: on retirement of the contributor refusal to pay a joint pension for the contributor and his or her same-sex partner would be removed; on retirement of the contributor refusal to pay a lump sum benefit in respect of the same-sex partner would be prevented; on the death of the contributor refusal to pay death benefits to a same-sex partner, either by reversionary pension or lump sum benefits, would be dispensed with; on the death of the contributor failure to investigate or acknowledge the claim of dependency of a child of a same-sex couple where the contributor is not the biological parent of the child would be prevented; and on the death of the contributor payment of death benefits to the estate of the contributor rather than to the same-sex partner as a dependant would be prevented. 
It is really not controversial, you would think. This is something that the Australian Labor Party has been working towards since 1996, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. To me it seems bizarre that in 2003—seven years after this issue was first raised in the federal parliament—we are still squabbling over whether same-sex couples deserve the same basic rights as heterosexual couples when it comes to superannuation in this country. It is difficult to understand why the government is resisting these changes. It has been suggested that, if enacted, this legislation would not affect heterosexual or homosexual couples. This proposed legislation is an opportunity, however, to right the wrong that is being done in superannuation more generally. It is an opportunity for us as a parliament to say that we do not approve of systemic discrimination against same-sex couples. It is the perfect opportunity.
We can only hazard a guess as to the reason this opportunity is not being taken: the government sees it as politically unpopular to protect the rights of same-sex couples. Remembering what the Prime Minister did when he raised the issue of lesbians having access to IVF, it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that this government sees protecting the rights of same-sex couples as not just politically unpopular but also, perhaps, sees attacking the rights of these people as a vote winner. I must say it really shocks me that the Democrats are prepared to be part of this hatchet job. The Democrats want to pride themselves on protecting the interests of minority groups. To cave in to the government and not insist on amendments to protect the rights of same-sex couples, just so the government can pass on a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this community, seems absolutely bizarre to me. There has never been a better time for the Democrats to flex a bit of political muscle because we know the government is so desperate to get this legislation—these tax cuts for high-income earners—through as it affects their base constituency so much. The Democrats really could have held out a bit longer and insisted on this amendment.
I am also amazed that when this debate last arose in the House of Representatives the only Greens member in the chamber, the member for Cunningham, did not participate. I am not sure whether he was boycotting or whether he just stuffed up and did not get to the chamber in time to vote. With the Greens priding themselves on their record on rights for same-sex couples and against discrimination on the basis of sexuality, I would have thought it was worth the walk to the chamber for the member for Cunningham. I believe the member for Parramatta has previously raised the proposition that choice of superannuation funds will solve this problem because, as soon as you have choice of superannuation funds, people can go to a fund that will pay their money to the person of their choice in the event of their death. It really seems bizarre to me that, one more time, we are going to let the market do what the parliament should be doing, which is making sure that people are not discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—Amendments (5), (6), (7) and (12) to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 go to the discriminatory nature of the way this government treats same-sex couples. As the member for Grayndler quite rightly pointed out, superannuation ought to be universal. The fact that same-sex couples are not able to pass on their superannuation—as all other people are—to their partners in the event of death is, in my view, discriminatory. It is this discrimination that these amendments moved by the Labor Party focus on. 
As the members for Grayndler and Sydney have said, the legislation we have before us is a perfect opportunity to make sure that both the House of Representatives and the Senate pass these amendments which would correct this ridiculous discrimination that is more suited to the 1950s than to the 21st century. But we have this cabal of Australian Democrats working, as they did with the GST, with the government and sabotaging a piece of legislation which they have supported and spoken in favour of for a decade. I find their attitudes on this wholly extraordinary. I know that Senators Greig and Stott Despoja will, as the member for Grayndler said, cross the floor and vote with the opposition on this, but that is, frankly, not good enough. The Australian Democrats have a policy which binds them all to vote for the essence of the four amendments which the government wants us to vote against, and the Democrats are not going to do that. They are going to vote for the government's bill.
There are other areas of discrimination against same-sex couples that I want to highlight to show that this is an issue that is of wider concern. One area was recently brought to my attention by a constituent, Sarah—not her real name, of course. She has been through a very difficult and acrimonious break-up, including a Supreme Court case dealing with dividing the couple's assets. Soon after this was finished, she received a very large capital gains tax bill from the Australian Taxation Office. She consulted the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—an act which, thanks to the former Labor government's taxation law improvement program, seems to make taxation law easier for people to understand. It is a program which I understand is coming to a grinding halt under this government. The relevant provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 126-5, quite reasonably suggested that where property is transferred because of a marriage or de facto relationship breaking down, the transferor does not get hit with a capital gains tax bill. Labor has always supported this provision and will continue to support it. However, this section applies only if the capital gains tax event involves the person's spouse or a former spouse. The Victorian government has changed the law to allow for recognition of same-sex couples on the same basis as de facto opposite sex relationships. This allows same-sex couples to be treated the same as de facto opposite sex couples in all areas of Victorian law, including the breakdown of relationships and the dividing of property.
Here again is an example of why these amendments need to be passed. We have continuing discrimination, not just with superannuation but in this example of capital gains tax, which is a federal tax. The federal definition of `de facto' is the one that is relevant in Sarah's case. Unfortunately, this government's 1950s attitudes prevail. In section 995-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the definition of `spouse' includes de facto spouses. However, `de facto' is defined as `a relationship between two persons who, although not legally married to each other, live with each other on a bona fide basis as husband and wife'. The ATO noted that there is in the definition no requirement to be legally married according to laws of Australia or another nation; however, the definition states that the person must live with a person on a genuine domestic basis as the person's husband or wife. The terms `husband' and `wife' are not defined in the tax legislation; therefore the ordinary meaning of the term is utilised.
In the landmark same-sex discrimination case of Gregory Brown v. Commissioner for Superannuation 1995, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal stated:
For whatever other changes the words, `husband' and `wife', may have undergone over the years they retain, in our opinion, their complementary gender connotations. 
(Extension of time granted) A wife, according to this definition of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, is the female partner of a marital relationship and a husband is the male partner. The result is that, even if a state court makes a property order in regard to a same-sex de facto couple or if a court defines `de facto couple' to include same-sex couples, rollover relief will not be available, as the property is not transferred to the person's spouse as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This definition of `spouse' has been used in a number of other areas where the definition of `spouse' is relevant to entitlement. For example, even though a same-sex couple live together, the taxpayer did not derive any income and was financially supported by the taxpayer, a superannuation spouse contribution offset was not available as the same-sex couple could not meet the definition of spouse—which is what the amendment before this House deals with.
The payment of first child tax offset—the baby bonus—could not be transferred to a member of a same-sex couple, as the person could not satisfy the definition of `spouse'. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 allows the payment to be transferred to a spouse in certain circumstances. I think that this situation is completely unfair and discriminatory. I draw the attention of the House to my question on notice No. 2383 to the Attorney-General where I have asked:
Is the government considering which other Commonwealth laws and payments may be affected by the decision of the UN Human Rights Commission? If so, is he able to say which laws and payments may be affected? Is he aware of the statement by the Prime Minister of 25 August 2001 to the effect that he is opposed to discrimination on the basis of sexual preference; and will he introduce legislation to ensure that Australia complies with international law in respect to these matters?
I conclude by echoing the claims of the member for Grayndler and the member for Sydney that this is a lost opportunity. It could not be truer that this Democrat-government opposition to these amendments is a vote for prejudice. There is no other way of describing the majority position if we the parliament vote against these amendments. By not amending this legislation we are discriminating against people who are simply trying to pass on their retirement incomes to a person with whom they are living in a loving and longterm relationship. This is not the kind of Australia that I believe is fitting for the 21st century. These amendments should be passed, along with the bill.
 (Mr Lindsay)—The question is that the amendments be disagreed to. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 193 the division is deferred until after 8 p.m.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—In continuing to speak on this very important legislation, the Higher Education Support Bill 2003, I do so as a representative of the people of Western Sydney and as an unabashed supporter of the region's university—the University of Western Sydney. When the Hawke government merged a number a colleges of advanced education in 1989 to form the University of Western Sydney, our region saw this as a fantastic moment in its history. It was a symbol of progress; it was a symbol of hope. In fact, many momentous events occurred in 1989, and this was one of them.  
Fourteen years later, this government is doing its utmost to destroy that vision of 1989. What this government is intent upon doing is thwarting the ambitions of many young people to gain a tertiary education. Going through many of our students' minds at the moment is that they could now be saddled with enormous debts if they decide to enrol in a university degree. Whilst we have the Treasurer crowing about the extent of the budget surplus, we have a university crying out for help to a government that is determined to ignore it. We have five Liberal members representing seats in the west and south-west of Sydney who should be jumping up and down and banging on the doors of the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Prime Minister for more funding for our university. Instead, we have the member for Lindsay castigating the university itself, while the others are so silent on this issue that you could hear a pin drop. Where are their names to speak on this bill? Where is the member for Parramatta, the member for Macarthur, the member for Mitchell and the member for Lindsay? Their names are absent from the list to speak. 
It is an absolute disgrace that these careerist politicians turn a blind eye because they do not want to upset their Prime Minister. What about representing the concerns of their constituents? Ninety per cent of the people in Western Sydney want this university and they want it properly funded. All this ideologically driven nonsense that is coming from this government on this issue will ruin this institution. I can assure you that I and my colleagues will do all within our power to stop them.
The public do not trust this government on education. They may trust them to chase leaky boats out to sea, but not in this area—the future of our kids. It amazes me that after years of attempting to change a higher education system from one that was established for the elite to one that was based on equality of opportunity this government is intent upon returning to the past. I always thought that reform meant moving and progressing forward, not returning to some distant past. I state categorically and emphatically in this House that I will never, ever support a system where the ability to pay is more important than merit. That type of system was removed from Australia 30 years ago by the Whitlam government, and in no way should it be returned. 
The government refuses to countenance a strong university sector. Having a large group of educated people who are creative, intellectually stimulating, progressive and robust does not suit this government, especially if they are the kids that I represent—the kids that are the first generation of their families to attend a university; the ones that come from non-English-speaking backgrounds. 
I return to what the government is trying to do to our university. The government has had the temerity to announce a cut in funding to the University of Western Sydney. There is some contention over the amount of cuts involved. Janice Reid, who is Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, claims that the government will be reducing funding by $14 million over three years. The government has stated that it is only $4.2 million. I tend to believe Professor Reid. But even in the minute chance that the government could be correct, this is still a $4.2 million cut, and it is money that the University of Western Sydney desperately needs. This is from a government that claims to know all about the aspirations and needs of our people in Western Sydney.  
I can assure this government that Western Sydney is expected to increase its population by 25 per cent over the next 20-odd years, and this should surprise no-one. In the last few decades, migrants have tended to settle in Western Sydney because of jobs there and its relative affordability. A prediction of a population growth of that size is essentially a continuation of events over the last couple of decades. 
When the Hawke government established our University of Western Sydney in 1989, this size of population growth was anticipated. We knew that migrants and our young families would buy or rent in Western Sydney. Western Sydney presented to them an opportunity to get ahead with their lives. That is why the charter of our University of Western Sydney was established in black and white—that the university was there to provide university level education and research in a regional context. In other words, UWS was there to provide a service to the people of Western Sydney. Its mission is—and I will quote part of it—`to be a university of international standing and outlook, achieving excellence through scholarship, teaching, learning, research and service to its regional, national and international communities. Beginning'—and I emphasise that—`with the people of Greater Western Sydney.' 
Of the more than 35,000 students who now attend UWS, 71 per cent come from Western Sydney. The statistics show categorically that the university is the university for Western Sydney. Whilst Charles Sturt University will get $40.2 million, Newcastle University will get $19 million and Wollongong University will get $9.7 million, the University of Western Sydney will lose $14 million. I am not criticising the universities that are getting those extra funds. They need them. They deserve them. But what about our University of Western Sydney? What have they done so wrong to deserve this cut?
What our UWS seems to have done wrong in the eyes of this increasingly undemocratic government is criticise the funding mix. That is right; in a democratic society, UWS had the temerity to question this government. For doing this, it is being punished by having its funding cut. Too bad for the students, for the lecturers and the supporters of UWS; they will lose out because of the sensitivities of this government. Instead, we get abuse of the university from the member for Lindsay. She decided enough was enough and she could no longer put up with criticism of the government. In a letter to a member of the University of Western Sydney's board, dated 6 August 2003, the member for Lindsay went to town, so to speak. This is a quote from just part of her letter:
To constantly criticise the Federal Government for lack of funding when all other universities have expressed support for the proposed framework, shows a lack of leadership in tapping other funding sources such as Alumni, business sponsorship, support from sporting bodies ... The University is now 13 years old with a decade of alumni. It can no longer act like a baby institution.
I could go on and read the rest of her letter, but I will not because commonsense should tell her and everyone in this parliament—as well as all citizens of Australia—that as a comparatively new institution, even though there is a well-established and well-funct-ioning alumni, the ability to obtain resources from past graduates would not be in the same league as, for example, our University of Sydney. The graduates of 1989-90 are not going to have that spare cash to donate large amounts of money to the university as the old boys club does at the University of Sydney. The likelihood of obtaining large injections of funds through this channel is limited indeed. 
I know from the start that UWS has established relations with businesses in the Greater Western Sydney region and this has been of great benefit to our university. Many partnerships have been created and, again, the member for Lindsay should check her facts before she puts her fingers to the keyboard. I note also that she argues for domestic fee paying degrees. I would be amazed if her constituents—and we share a common boundary—could dig into their savings and invest in a $100,000 degree for their children. In the meantime the government that she is a member of would spend millions of dollars on lawyers or advertising campaigns that sprout their propaganda. In the next edition of the Kelly Country, as the member for Lindsay calls it, I would like her to say to her constituents that they should be prepared to pay $100,000 for their children's degrees because the government needs to pay for the glossy brochures that go to electorate offices and because the government needs to pay for the best lawyers and barristers from the top firms, even though they have their own lawyers in the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Government Solicitor. The government needs to show all of those TV ads with Dr James Wright because people have no idea why they need medicines. And the government needs to pay for the harbourside mansion for the Prime Minister so he does not get homesick. 
I challenge the member for Lindsay, and all members sitting on the government benches, to put these facts to their electorates. They need to pay extra for their kids' degrees because taxes are required to pay for the things I have just mentioned. I know the member for Lindsay will not do that; she will not do it because her constituents will inform her in the most direct of ways—at the ballot box—what they think of that. In Western Sydney, only 10.5 per cent of adults have a university degree, compared with 20.8 per cent for the rest of Sydney. This statistic shows quite clearly that the region requires more resources, not less.
A man that I have long admired, Jim Bosnjak, in his capacity as chair of the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board, has supported the views of those who believe UWS is imperative to the economic future of our region. Mr Bosnjak focuses on the point that UWS has peculiarities that most other universities do not have to face. The major difference is that UWS is composed of six campuses, all of very similar size, all with their own requirements related to the courses taught and all having their own links to the community based upon the history of the campuses. Added to this recently, campuses were built at Blacktown and Parramatta.
I believe Mr Bosnjak is an example of a person who has worked hard for his success and is passionate about the region he lives in. Unlike some others, he has not deserted to the seaside but has rolled up his sleeves and continues to contribute and fight for the best interests of our region, Western Sydney. When Jim speaks, everyone listens out there and when Jim says that this package will create problems, that is exactly what is going to happen.
UWS, contrary to what the member for Lindsay suggests, supports reform of the tertiary education sector. In its submission to the Senate's inquiry into higher education funding and regulatory legislation, Professor Reid, on behalf of the university, made a number of points that should underpin reform of the sector. The reform package should be available equally to all universities. There should not be a division of the sector into the elite and the rest. I suppose the government is just doing there what it is imposing on society in general, creating a society of the haves and the have-nots. In essence, the tertiary sector will be split between the sandstone eight and the remaining 30 publicly funded institutions. 
There should be a determining factor in the government's funding decisions. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, on a number of occasions, expressed the government's desire to focus on the regions and address problems in terms of sustainability of universities in some areas. Hence the government has provided real increases in funding for those universities I have mentioned—CSU, Wollongong and Newcastle. So again I ask: why is UWS different? I notice that the University of New England is also different, for that matter—and I am sure the member for New England would put up a very strong case for UNE in this place. It really makes no sense, politics aside. The community want some answers; they want their children to have the opportunities that they did not have. The government makes much of these aspirant voters. This is what those voters of Western Sydney want: the ability for their children, if they are good enough, to attend university. UWS provides the opportunity with high-quality courses in their own community, in their own backyard.
UWS is also a forerunner in its programs to train teachers. From the end of their first year, undergraduates are sent out into the field to learn and practise how to teach in the classroom. When UWS pushed this practical focus it was seen as a groundbreaker, and many would-be teachers were attracted to this style of training in comparison to the overwhelmingly theoretical approach that was part and parcel of the traditional degrees. Other courses, such as law—originally offered at the Campbelltown campus—and business degrees, have also now won acclaim for the innovative approaches that have been used to teach undergraduates. No matter what critics may say, UWS is a quality institution with bright, creative, dedicated staff who have served the students well and who have trained them according to the needs of the workplace environment that they will be entering into.
These successes should count for something with this government. I would have thought that a government that preaches the virtues of the marketplace would be bending over backwards to assist and promote an institution that, more than most, prepares its students on how to work in the pressure cooker environment that is the globalised 21st century. However, this government preaches but refuses to practise what it preaches. It really is the Liberal Party from days of yore: all about contacts and elitism. Those in the know will get above and beyond, whilst the rest can please themselves.
To cap it all off, in the last fortnight the government has decided to come the heavy on the whole sector by forcing universities to change their industrial relations practices. Whilst the government has legislated for freedom of association, the reality is light years away. Freedom of association only occurs when you do not want to join a union. However, if you do want to join a union, this government will do all it can to stop you. This government is putting a gun to the heads of our universities and saying, `We will give you $404 million if you destroy the unions and put everybody on individual contracts.' This, in all my time in public life, would have to be one of the most blatant ideological pieces of public policy, designed essentially to destroy our intelligentsia in Australia. This will not wash with that sector. Already, the vice-chancellors of our universities have emphatically rejected this proposition.
Contrast the attacks on the tertiary education sector with Labor's approach. On this side of the House, we understand how crucial tertiary education is and will continue to be for this country to compete effectively in the globalised marketplace. Australia needs to create a niche for itself as a highly educated and highly skilled work force. This can only be achieved if we make education second to none as a priority of public policy. Labor will—I am pleased to say—inject $2.3 billion into the university system, destroying the spectre of the user pays system that this government envisages for the future. Importantly for universities such as UWS, we will establish a $150 million community engagement fund so as to assist in their leadership role in the local community. The Labor Party will, when elected to government, fund 25,000 full-time equivalent places which are currently funded at a marginal rate. This should alleviate, we believe, the overcrowding students experience in lectures and make sure that students who have qualifications will not be turned away from a university education. 
We have a positive approach on this side of the House to higher education and we—especially our members for Western Sydney—know how valuable our universities are to our regions. UWS was created as a beacon—a beacon of hope. It is a quality institution and it must be properly funded. The kids of Western Sydney work hard to obtain these opportunities. The Howard government should refrain from its meanness and give all of our kids a fair go—particularly the children who are part of the Western Sydney population. I am very disheartened and disgusted with these bills before the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2003-10-13,"—It always fascinates me how in this place people on different sides look at the world through a kaleidoscope and see different things. The member for Prospect challenges us to put the position of our constituents here. I have to say that the constituents from the part of the world that I represent look forward to the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003.
The initiatives contained in this whole suite of bills under the government's package Backing Australia's Future have a tremendous emphasis for rural Australia. I go back quite a few years—I am not going to say how long—to the time when I pursued tertiary education. My parents put me on a train at the age of 18 and off I went. But it was a long time—nearly 20 years—before I came back to make a commitment to rural Australia. I think about my experience then when I look at the initiatives in these bills to help regional universities to deliver particular degrees, specifically in teaching and nursing.
The two universities with campuses in my part of the world have been waiting a long time for these bills. Indeed, last year a deputation from the University of Ballarat came to Canberra and met with the minister right at the start of the major review he undertook. This particular delegation included representatives from local government and all the health services across the Wimmera region, where the University of Ballarat had been providing registered nurse division 1 Bachelor of Nursing training—but only for the first two years and not the third year. The tragedy there is that when young people do those first two years in the region and then leave it is difficult to entice them back. Getting qualified nurses is a critical issue in delivering health services across the Wimmera, to the southern end of my electorate and, indeed, all over my electorate—in fact, all over rural Australia and in city areas as well. In fact, lack of nurses is an international problem.
Let me go back to what the delegation from the University of Ballarat said. It was accompanied by the Northern Grampians Shire Council, the Buloke Shire Council, the Yarriambiack Shire Council, the West Wimmera Health Service, the Stawell Regional Health Group, the Wimmera Healthcare Group, the West Wimmera Shire Council, the Hindmarsh Shire Council, the Horsham Rural City Council, the East Wimmera Health Service, the Rural North West Health Service and the Edenhope Health Service. It advocated the need to have fully funded third-year to degree level training for nurses. 
The University of Ballarat currently conducts a first and second year training course for 20 students at the Horsham campus. The third and final year of the training course is provided at the Mt Helen campus in Ballarat. That involves up to four hours travelling each day all the way down to Ballarat from the Wimmera region, which is an intolerable burden for students to carry. Obviously, students relocate to Ballarat for that final year and, as I have said, it is difficult to entice them back. The delegation put a proposition to the minister that it was right and proper that 20 full third-year training places be provided. I am delighted to read from the minister's press release of the middle of last month in which he announced the extra places for nursing training right across Australia:
More Australian students will be able to study nursing at universities across all States from next year ...
Unfortunately, he qualified that by also saying:
... if the Government's higher education reform package is passed this year.
If the Labor Party maintains its steadfast opposition to this legislation, I can say that—contrary to what the member for Prospect was saying—the Australian people will not be enticed to consider what its proposal is to fund this very important sector.
At least one thing is somewhat satisfying: both the government and the opposition are arguing steadfastly for reform of and major funding for universities. That is a good thing to see. But the constituents whom I represent do not trust the Australian Labor Party. Labor has already declared where the amount of funding required to fund its package is going to come from: increases in fuel excise taxation. Country people, being the greater users of fuel, are not going to be enticed by that particular proposal for funding. They are more interested in the government's package.
La Trobe is another university that, through its efforts, is providing an important contribution to tertiary education across the northern end of my constituency. It has been a great thrill to see the expansion of its campus activities in the last decade in providing options for many youngsters in the Sunraysia region and the Swan Hill region, so that they do not have to do what I had to do at the age of 18—that is, leave the district. The Mildura campus of La Trobe University commenced its operations in 1996 and is collocated with the Institute of TAFE in Benetook Avenue, Mildura. It has an ever-increasing range of courses and it has made long-term commitments to the Mildura region, offering specific course development in relation to horticulture as part of its regional mission and is particularly strong in teacher training to degree level. With Mildura and Sunraysia being located at the junction of the Murray and Darling rivers, it has just established in association with the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre a $4.5 million campus facility to be involved in very important scientific work regarding the Murray and Darling rivers.
The Mildura campus in less than a decade has reached the position of being able to offer third year training for teaching. In fact, it is very much involved in a local initiative to do with teacher training, in cooperation with the principals and schools of the region. The Mildura campus of the La Trobe University has developed a very effective partnership with district primary schools in the pre-service training of primary teachers. It offers the first and the fourth year of the teaching course and it supplies district schools with a flow of qualified graduates. It is very satisfying for the schools of that region—the most far-flung region from metropolitan Melbourne. There are now over 61 graduates from La Trobe University employed in primary schools in the district. 
These are the sorts of outcomes that this suite of bills contained in the government's package Backing Australia's Future can bring about. That is why my constituents enthusiastically support the initiatives in this legislation. I do hope the opposition parties reconsider their position with regard to passing these bills. I hope they look at the big picture and do not deny my rural constituents what they have worked so hard to achieve. As I have said, my constituents have highlighted particularly the issue of nursing training—sufficient for local government agencies around the region to take it up—in support of health providers and specifically directed to meeting the need for professionals in the nursing training area. Not supporting but opposing this legislation will deny my constituents what they have worked very hard for, and I hope the opposition reconsiders its position.
I have been interested to listen to the contributions made by opposition members over the long period that this debate has been conducted. I have wondered why there is such opposition to the implementation of voluntary student unionism. Surely it is right and proper for students to make their own choice about whether or not they want to be part of the student union. When I was at university, I made a conscious choice to be part of the student union. I would have found it highly offensive if, had my union fees not been paid, I had been denied access to some university services. This clearly has to be an individual and conscious choice. I cannot understand what the opposition's case is in opposing this particular initiative.
Some say—and I have read this in my local media—when commenting on these bills: `Wouldn't voluntary student unionism have a disastrous effect on regional communities, as they would lose sporting and entertainment facilities for the entire community?' It is true that the infrastructure that a university campus provides adds to community infrastructure. Indeed, I have given some examples of how La Trobe University meets the needs of the region and the district and forms partnerships with important commercial and government supported research efforts. Some argue that student organisations can prosper through voluntary membership fees and that somehow, if contributions are not paid, the community will end up with a lack of sporting and entertainment services.
This is simply not the case in regional communities. Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, you would know that. Communities such as the ones I represent have an enormous variety of sporting facilities—for example, football ovals for all of the major codes and tennis courts. They have ample sporting and entertainment support facilities. I do not accept that there is some particular ingredient in the idea of student unionism that will mean that somehow communities will miss out on some important infrastructure.
What I see around my region where communities get together is very creative. Rather than have a multitude of facilities and services, they very carefully target their energies to put in place what is not there. I go back to quote the example of La Trobe University. It saw an opportunity with Commonwealth funding of $4.5 million. There was the need for a freshwater research facility—one was operating in Sunraysia although in rented premises which were very much inadequate for scientists to conduct their world benchmarked science in. The university sought to encourage them to join a site on the campus and so attracted another, quite substantial, avenue of Commonwealth funding. That is the initiative that I see constantly on rural campuses. It is the same with the University of Ballarat. In the short space of time since its cooperative efforts with the Wimmera TAFE facility in Horsham, it is now developing and offering full degree courses. If the opposition will only support this bill, we will see a third-year degree course there which will go very much towards meeting the demand for nurses in an important part of the world. 
Across the electorate, in the division of Mallee, there are 27 hospitals, which is the largest number of hospitals of any federal electorate in the whole parliament. There are 65 aged care facilities, ranging in bed numbers from 10 to 78, which is the largest number of aged care facilities of any constituency in this place. So you can see that the demand for nursing staff is quite sizeable. Both of these universities are right behind this bill. They have urged me to support it and to make sure also that they get their fair share for the north-west of Victoria of all of those nursing places which have been announced by the minister. I am supporting the bill enthusiastically and I am disappointed that the opposition has adopted an attitude whereby it is not. I will remind my constituents of its lack of support in providing them with the initiatives they have worked so hard to achieve.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—The debate that we are having on the government's higher education package provides a clear and distinctive choice for the Australian electorate, as the two major political parties have diametrically opposed views about the value and importance of higher education to our nation. Not surprisingly, because we have these philosophical differences, this leads to the offering of different solutions to the current crisis in that sector.
The Howard government sees higher education as conferring primarily a personal benefit to students who have that opportunity. We often hear from the Minister for Education, Science and Training comments which encapsulate that view. He is prone to say so anecdotally, to make references to people who are in the work force and to pose the question, `Why should workers who never see the inside of a university be asked to subsidise access and opportunity for those who are able to take advantage of all that tertiary education provides for them?' It is not surprising that the end point of that kind of line of reasoning that we get so often from the minister leads to an outcome where those who it is claimed receive this personal benefit are then asked to pay more for it. Put simply, it is the user pays philosophy in action. That is a common standpoint of the Howard government which we see intruding in so many areas of public policy—and here we have it again in the higher education sector.
This attitude underpins the financial response of the government and is used to rationalise reductions in public investment in and expenditure on our university system while shifting the financial burden increasingly onto students and their families. We know that since the government was elected there have been significant cuts in public investment in the university sector amounting to somewhere around the $5 billion mark. It is no wonder that the sector is in crisis. We argue that the cuts have hastened the decline in the quality of education provided. We have seen a substantial increase in staff-student ratios—an average of about 22 per cent.
At my own university the squeeze has really been on, with a 37 per cent increase in staff-student ratios since the election of the Howard government. We have seen a significant increase in the cost of education for students and their families. I want to make a particular point about that because, when your pool of students comes from a low socioeconomic electorate like Throsby, all we see under this government is the perpetuation of disadvantage very much related to location and the background of families in economic terms. With this reduction in public investment we have seen a huge unmet demand, with about 20,000 students a year being denied the chance of realising their potential. We have seen a system increasingly slanted to those who have the capacity to pay to gain entry—and I find it incredibly objectionable that, if you have the financial means, even with lower marks, you can gain access to courses. Because of the cutbacks, we have seen enormous pressure on individual institutions caused by the underfunding of approximately 25,000 university places across the nation. That is what we have had under the Howard government. 
The reason we feel passionately about this bill, and the reason why we have come to the conclusion that it should be rejected, is that the so-called reforms brought to this chamber by the minister do nothing more than give us more of the same. The package that is outlined in this bill has as its basic response only one simple solution: to shift even more of the financial burden onto students and their families. The means by which the government will achieve this outcome is the proposed deregulation of HECS fees—increasing them by up to 30 per cent or more, as it is now revealed in the fine detail of the legislation—and the setting aside of even more places for full fee paying students, with a proposal that 50 per cent of places be set aside and the suggestion that there would be nothing to prevent the introduction of new courses that would be totally full fee paying. So the government's vision for this sector is confined to the narrow parameters of the government's thinking on many social and economic policy issues.
Put simply, this bill reflects a mindless application of the user-pays principle which derives from the government's philosophical view that tertiary education confers primarily a personal benefit. Even worse, in the bill presented to us we see the user-pays philosophy now conjoined with a decidedly anti-union and anti-employee industrial relations agenda, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the core responsibilities of universities. There are serious matters of principle involved in this debate. As I said earlier, there are distinctly different values and different solutions being proposed by the Howard government and by the Labor Party, as shown by the response from the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister for education. One fundamental question is: are our public universities there to provide access and opportunities for citizens based on their academic merits or will our universities in future serve the interests of a diminishing constituency of students from  privileged backgrounds whose families have the capacity to buy a place at one of our institutions?
The developments under this government have already been alarming and have made access to university education very problematic for students from electorates like my own. The latest census data shows that the electorate of Throsby has the third-lowest rate of people with tertiary education qualifications, with a figure of less than 10 per cent. When narrowed down to university qualifications the outcome is a low 5.2 per cent. Contrast this with the minister for education's electorate of Bradfield, which has the third-highest rate of tertiary qualifications. Just over one third of his electorate have the advantage of a university qualification. So where you live and your socioeconomic background continue to be strong predictors of educational opportunities and outcomes. I believe that the cycle of perpetuating disadvantage will only be further entrenched by the measures proposed in this bill by the Howard government. Continuing to shift the financial burden onto students and their families will act as a substantial barrier to accessing the benefits of higher education for many of the people I represent. 
As I said earlier, students and their families are already paying some of the highest study costs in the world. Under this government, the average HECS fee has increased by 85 per cent. Student debt has doubled to $9 billion. As we know, many young people are now putting off buying a home or starting a family because of the debts they are carrying. Recent modelling by the University of Canberra indicates that the average age at which the HECS debt is repaid by graduates will be 33 years and eight months for men and 39 years and three months for women. That is the situation in the modelling that has been done even before the proposals contained in this bill are contemplated. One of our fundamental objections is to the deregulation of fees and the increases that will inevitably flow. It is a matter of great regret that our country now ranks about fourth on the list of OECD nations most reliant on private sources of funding. Student fees and charges now constitute 37 per cent of the income of universities—that is up from 25 per cent in 1996. So you can see the shift that has gone on since the Howard government's election, and this will be further exacerbated by the proposals contained in this bill. At the same time, public investment by way of Commonwealth funding has fallen from 57 per cent in 1996 to 44 per cent.
The government plans to deregulate fees and charge higher costs for study while at the same time making a totally inadequate provision of scholarships to help our poor and Indigenous students finance their studies. I was interested to read, just a week or so ago, comments from the President of ACOSS. He rightly pointed out that, even with the scholarships on offer, and they are at very low rates of recompense—I think it is $2,000 for students living at home and $4,000 for those living away from home—only about 17 per cent of beginning students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds, that is less than one in five, will have the opportunity to compete for these scholarships. The President of ACOSS rightly pointed out that even if students gain one of these scholarships many will continue to receive an income well below the poverty line. I make this point because the University of Wollongong, despite its wonderful achievements, has the second-lowest rate of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds of all the regional universities with a figure of 9.6 per cent of total enrolments—and I have already publicly expressed my concern over this issue. In my view, the proposals in this bill will fail to do anything constructive to redress this imbalance and, in fact, will only exacerbate this situation further. They will cement in place unequal access to the opportunities that education brings with it.
That is the government's philosophy. Our views stand in stark contrast. We see education as an investment not a cost—an investment which confers a benefit of both a private and a public nature. We argue very strongly that funding education at whatever level is a terrific investment in skills, knowledge and employment opportunities for all our citizens. That is important in building our social capital. We do not countenance the substantial reductions that have occurred in public investment under this government. We think it is a sorry state of affairs where competitor nations and comparable countries in the OECD have understood the importance of public investment to secure their economic futures in an increasingly globalised and competitive international environment while Australia's level of public investment under this government continues to decline—with a decline of about 12 per cent in a very short time frame between 1995 and 1999. You know what the outcome of this will be: our competitors will reap the social and economic rewards of their investment while we miss out. 
Our views about the public benefits of investment in education lead to substantially different strategies to deal with the current crisis. Our response is this: we want to see a wider distribution of the benefits of education by increasing access and opportunity—we do not want to see the costs of education acting as a barrier to access and participation—and we want urgent action to meet the unmet demand that continues to exist. That is why we have committed to spend $2.34 billion on our universities and TAFE sector. That is why we have committed to create an additional 20,000 new university places. That is why we will phase out current full fee paying places for undergraduates. That is why we opposed the HECS increases. That is why we will relieve the financial pressure on students by lifting the HECS repayment threshold to $35,000. That is why we will ensure our universities are properly funded, with a genuine indexation measure. And, very importantly, that is why we remain committed to ensuring it is merit not money that opens university doors.
My local institution, the University of Wollongong, would fare much better under our package. Not only would it get an additional $6 million over three years; it would have an indexation formula that is meaningful. It would see from Labor a $9 million investment for a new multimedia design and technology centre and the full funding of about 926 places at the university that are currently underfunded, and it would have access to a $150 million community engagement fund and a fund that would reward excellence in teaching and learning. On all those counts, if one looked only at the bottom line of dollars, my local tertiary institution, which does a great job, would stand to benefit far more from the money and public investment that would flow from the kind of proposals that we have foreshadowed. More fundamentally, at a philosophical level, the bill has to be rejected because it continues down the route of finding one simple solution, and that is to continue to put the financial burden onto students and their families in electorates like mine that cannot afford to continue to see that development—for if we do it will surely lead to the kind of disparities which I quoted between the statistics that are revealed in the census data for my electorate and those that we see operating in the electorate of Bradfield.
In the short time I have remaining, I want to make some general comments about the highly provocative industrial relations agenda that has been added as a condition of accessing $404 million under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. It is quite clear that the minister was rolled in cabinet on this issue, because his second reading speech made only two preconditions to access that funding. One was governance reform. The other I will quote from his speech—and I would have thought that a second reading speech by a minister had some validity. He said that the only other condition was:
... that the universities be compliant—
I underline the word `compliant'—
with the government's workplace relations policies—
and, specifically, the prerequisite that individuals be free to negotiate an AWA—namely, an individual contract.
If that was not bad enough on its own, we now see a raft of new, stupid measures that have nothing to do with the core functions of universities being introduced as a precondition to accessing the urgently needed funds that would come under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. You do not have to be a genius to understand the real agenda. What is the point of giving instructions such as `no encouragement be given to union membership by the giving out of forms during staff induction processes' or that there should be `no restrictions or limitations on the forms and mix of employment types'? What has this to do with teaching, learning and research—the core functions of our universities? It is obvious that the minister for education was rolled in cabinet by the former employment and industrial relations minister, who is now trying to reconstitute himself as the benevolent minister in charge of health. 
You do not have to believe what we are saying; you only have to look at what the vice-chancellors are saying about this stupid raft of measures, which are clearly aimed at frustrating the ability of a very fine union, the National Tertiary Education Union, and others to collectively bargain on behalf of their members. Let me quote the words of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania. He said the suggested conditions are `unworkable', `unacceptable', `ideologically driven' and `a nonsense'. Obviously they reflect no understanding of what has happened with enterprise bargaining in the universities. All they will do is inflame and create industrial disruption—as we see with the proposed stoppage this week. It is a shameful ploy on the part of the government to use desperately needed funding as a ransom to try to heavy universities into implementing the ideological obsessions of the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2003-10-13,"—These bills, the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003, provide an integrated reform package which will substantially increase funding for higher education and increase the opportunities for our universities to develop into centres of excellence in research and teaching. The increased flexibility provided by these changes will allow our universities to break free from the shackles of the current system, which threaten the sector with uniformity, inertia and mediocrity. The quality of our education system—and, in this context, the quality of the teaching and research of our higher education system—is pivotal to the innovation and productivity of our work force. This bears directly on our international competitiveness, our standards of living and our social cohesion.
These bills contain too many reforms to list here, but I do want to summarise them. The main changes involve an increase in funding, an extra $1.5 billion over the next four years. This includes an additional $404 million in base funding, up by 2.5 per cent in 2005 and 7.5 per cent in 2007; an extra $122 million to support regional campuses; an extra $121 million to support nursing and teaching practicums; and an extra $160 million for 25,000 new scholarships over the next four years. It involves converting 25,000 partly funded places to fully funded places from 2005, with 6,500 additional fully funded places from 2007. It includes $188 million to support and enhance the quality of teaching in our universities, including through the establishment of a National Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education. Importantly, it includes $22 million for a number of equity measures to provide for people with disabilities and for Indigenous students.
In addition to these extra funding measures, this package of reforms contains some other important measures. It includes raising the HECS-HELP threshold from the current $24,365 to $30,000 in the year 2005-06. It involves allowing some universities some flexibility—within very strict limits—to determine the value of their courses, and it allows universities the option of providing full fee paying places to Australian students. After the full quota of HECS subsidised places has been met, Australian students will have access to the same option that currently applies to overseas students. 
The debate on this legislation has, unfortunately, been peppered with fiction, distortions and misleading claims from the other side which have, sadly, been repeated in the media. I want to turn to my attention briefly to five of the myths that we have heard from previous speakers from the other side. The first myth is that funding to universities will be cut. That is wrong; this package includes an increase of $1.5 billion over the next four years and $6.9 billion extra over the next 10 years. It is worth pointing out that this increase is double what Labor's so-called Knowledge Nation was going to deliver. The Knowledge Nation package, about which there was such a song and dance, would have delivered only half the increase that this reform package delivers.
The second piece of fiction is that there will be fewer subsidised places. Again, that is wrong. This package provides an extra 25,000 fully funded places by converting the currently partly funded places into fully funded places over the next four years, with more beyond that. The third distortion is that only the rich will be able to afford a degree. Again, that is wrong. There will be 25,000 extra subsidised places, 25,000 scholarships for the disadvantaged over the next four years and a higher HECS repayment threshold. This does not favour the rich.
The fourth distortion we have heard from the other side is that all fees will rise. Again, that is wrong. Nursing and education courses are quarantined, and many universities, including my own, the University of Western Sydney, have said that they will not raise fees at all, not even up to the maximum allowable of 30 per cent. The fifth distortion we have heard is that full fee paying places will somehow favour the dumb but rich. Again, that is wrong. Firstly, those full fee paying places will be available only after the full quota of HECS places has been filled. Secondly, they will be available only within a pre-agreed and predetermined margin of the current entry score for HECS funded places. Thirdly—and this point is worth making—this will provide Australian students with the same access to fee-paying places as overseas students.
Let us think about the opposition's position on this. Labor are saying that they want to deprive Australian students who just miss out on a HECS funded place but are willing to take out a loan and pay for a fee-paying place of this opportunity, the same opportunity that overseas students have. Overseas students can access a full fee paying place. The Labor Party are saying, `That's okay for overseas students. That's okay for someone from Asia, South America or Africa, but it's not okay for an Australian student.' They would discriminate against Australian students in favour of overseas students, and that is outrageous.
The point is that Labor's opposition to these reforms is dishonest, misguided and simply wrong. If Labor's opposition were only ideologically driven—that is, their usual old mantra of mediocrity, uniformity, no competition and no striving for excellence, which is bad enough—it would be understandable; it would be consistent with their ideological position. That would be bad enough, but this is dishonest, cheap opportunism. The opposition know these changes are necessary, but they oppose them anyway because they think it might score them a few points. 
I want to refer to two editorials that coincidentally appeared on the same date, 20 September, in the Weekend Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald, highlighting the need for these reforms, the fairness of these reforms and the imperative for passing these reforms. The Weekend Australian said, under the heading `Uni plan will pay the best':
The higher education reforms before parliament give Australia's best universities the chance they need to grow into world-class teaching and research institutions. By ending the existing funding straitjacket, which rewards all institutions at the same rate regardless of the quality of their teaching, the Howard Government's plan provides the incentive for our best universities to compete, both against each other and internationally. And academic competition will breed intellectual excellence.
The editorial concludes by saying:
Parliament should pass Dr Nelson's legislation.
That was the editorial in the Weekend Australian on 20 September, the same day the editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald said, under the title `A bigger threat to universities':
... Labor and the minor parties risk more than further damage to their poor reputations in matters of economic management when they oppose the Government's 10-year program of higher education reforms. If, by blocking them in the Senate, the Opposition and minor parties prevent the three Higher Education Support bills from becoming law, they will have harmed, not helped, the cause of higher education and damaged, not improved, the prospects of a generation of students.
This was the Sydney Morning Herald—not always a friend of this side, I might add. It went on to say:
Reforms such as those now given shape in these bills are needed to restore financial stability to the tertiary education sector. That stability was destroyed by measures introduced by Labor in the late 1980s which saw a rapid conversion of tertiary institutions into universities. The rising costs and drift in standards which have followed have been threatening the health of the tertiary education system ever since. Without the reforms now proposed by the Education Minister, Brendan Nelson, the capacity of tertiary institutions in Australia to operate at the levels expected of them, in research and in teaching, will remain compromised.
The article in the Sydney Morning Herald concluded:
Reckless obstruction of the Nelson reforms does more harm than good.
I would like to make one other point while we are talking about funding for universities, and that is the outrageous attack by the state Labor governments on our university sector—a point that has been made before but that is often forgotten in this debate—through the payroll tax that they inflict on our universities. All the states are bad, but the New South Wales government is by far the worst in this. The New South Wales government gives a paltry $14 million a year to our universities with one hand and snatches $97 million a year in payroll tax from them with the other hand. That is just in New South Wales. That is, in New South Wales a net $83 million of what is given to the universities by the Commonwealth government and then snatched from them by the state government in New South Wales. If the Labor opposition here were serious, it would be putting pressure on the state Labor governments to stop that payroll tax grab out of the pockets of our universities.
I turn now to the situation of my own university, the University of Western Sydney. It has had a lot of media attention. Unfortunately, not all of that coverage has been accurate; it has been full—in some cases, at least—of exaggerated claims about what will or will not happen to the University of Western Sydney. I begin by making the point that I very strongly support UWS and I will continue to argue that its unique situation does require special consideration. I will return to that in a few moments. However, claims that its funding is being cut are misleading. 
The fact is that, up until now, the University of Western Sydney has been funded—like other universities—under the relative funding model, but its course composition over the years has changed so that it has been in effect receiving funding for a course structure or composition which no longer applies. It has been funded for more of the expensive courses, such as agriculture or science, which are no longer being offered in those numbers. It has been funded at that rate for cheaper-to-offer courses, such as business courses, which it is now offering in higher numbers. The net effect is that the University of Western Sydney has been receiving approximately six per cent more on average per student per course than other universities running similar courses. The new package will bring a transparent, objective and equal basis to the funding so that the university will receive a similar amount to other universities for similar courses. It will be a fair, transparent and reasonable model.
Will UWS be, as so many claim in the media, worse off? The answer is no. If those changes were to occur without compensation, yes, it would be worse off. But the government's commitment, through its transitional funding package, is that no university will be worse off. For the University of Western Sydney, that will mean in 2005, the first year of this package, an extra $5.3 million in transitional funding to make sure it is not worse off. In the next year, 2006, it will mean an extra $1.9 million in transitional funding to ensure that UWS is not worse off. And thereafter, from 2007 onwards, the University of Western Sydney will be able to access the increased funding.
In addition, a number of other measures here will be of benefit to UWS. It will benefit from changes to the partly-funded overenrolment system. Currently UWS is running at, I understand, 3.7 per cent overenrolment, funded at $2,700 per student. Under the new package, UWS will be able to extend that to five per cent and be funded at a minimum of $3,854 per student. So there is potential for an increase in funding for UWS there. It will also receive almost $2 million in extra funding through the initiatives to help fund practicums for nursing and education courses. Finally, UWS will benefit from a share of the new fully funded places which will come on line. So the University of Western Sydney will be better off under these changes.
I want to return to my first point: the University of Western Sydney deserves special consideration over and above this. Given its unique situation, it deserves to gain more from this package than is currently projected, and I will continue to argue that. The University of Western Sydney is a relatively new university growing rapidly from 9,000 fully funded full-time equivalent places in 1989 to 25,000 last year. It runs six campuses stretched across some 2,000 square kilometres of Western Sydney with the associated extra administrative costs. As a result of its location, the University of Western Sydney has less access to full fee paying overseas students and postgraduate students. It also serves a relatively poor socioeconomic demographic. For instance, according to the 2001 census: the participation rate in higher education in Western Sydney is some three per cent compared to 5.2 per cent for Sydney as a whole; and of its adult population only 10.5 per cent have a university degree compared to 21 per cent for the rest of Sydney. UWS serves the community of Western Sydney—71 per cent of its students come from Western Sydney. So the bottom line is that the University of Western Sydney plays a vital role in providing educational opportunity for the people of Western Sydney. This is critical for equality of opportunity and the continuing economic development of Western Sydney. For these reasons I will continue to argue that further consideration needs to be given to the funding requirements of the University of Western Sydney. 
But I return to the point that I made about payroll tax. Each year the New South Wales government takes from the University of Western Sydney $9.5 million to $10 million—last year it look $9.7 million—which is around five per cent of the total funding of the university. The funding last year to the University of Western Sydney by the Commonwealth government was $198 million. The Commonwealth gave UWS $198 million, but then outrageously the New South Wales state Labor government put its hand in the pocket of the University of Western Sydney and took out $9.7 million for payroll tax. The state Labor government needs to abandon its iniquitous tax regime and allow all of the Commonwealth funding for our university to stay with the university, so UWS would have the full benefit of that $198 million from the Commonwealth and not have it reduced by five per cent—or almost $10 million—by the New South Wales Labor government.
This package of reform for the higher education sector is well overdue. It is the best opportunity that universities have had for over two decades to achieve a more sustainable and transparent funding outcome—one that has the flexibility to enable them to develop as institutions of excellence. These reforms must be passed by the Senate.
I return to the conclusion of the two editorials in the Weekend Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald last month. The Australian said:
Parliament should pass Dr Nelson's legislation
The Sydney Morning Herald said:
Reckless obstruction of the Nelson reforms does more harm than good.
I challenge the Labor party. I challenge the Greens. I challenge the Democrats to give up their blind program of reckless obstruction which will do more harm than good. Get out of the way. Pass these packages so that our universities can become the centres of excellence in teaching and research that we need them to be.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2003-10-13,"—The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 seeks to implement the government's latest series of reforms to the higher education sector via new funding arrangements as announced in the 2003-04 budget. On 26 June the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee—of which my Greens colleague in the Senate Kerry Nettle is a member—received a reference for an inquiry into policy implicit in the budget higher education bills of which this is one. The terms of reference direct the committee to investigate the likely financial effect of budgetary measures on universities and students, including matters such as fee deregulation; the likely effect of expansion of full-fee places; the implications of the budget measures for research, institutional governance and autonomy; and the effect on rural universities, industrial relations and other matters.
Given the importance of the committee's investigations, I am concerned that we are debating this bill before the committee finishes its work. But this government is well known for flouting democracy in the interests of pursuing its blinkered agenda and of pushing bills through the parliament with undue haste. In the last week we have seen an apparent backdown by the education minister on some aspects of these reforms as he faces rejection from university executives and management who realise they have been dudded. He is also facing a nationwide strike by university academic and general staff, including the staff of the University of Wollongong in my electorate of Cunningham. 
Adding insult to injury, the minister is today reported in the media as stating that universities are teetering on the edge and that there is already evidence of mediocrity—according to the minister—weakening Australian higher education. Of particular concern to the minister, apparently, are increasing stories of overcrowding, inadequate teaching, diminishing quality and deserting graduate students. The minister is finally acknowledging the signs of decline, yet he refuses to acknowledge the responsibility for it lies solely in the lap of this government and that, as the minister, he is responsible for the sorry state of higher education in this country at the moment.
Who introduced major budget cuts to the university sector back in 1996-97 when the real problems began? The answer, of course, is the government. It is now clearly obvious to those in the sector and to Australians at large that, if we are to ensure a quality and egalitarian education sector into the future, this government must go. The Greens believe that the higher education sector is grossly underfunded. We believe that the government's increasingly limited funding allocations are skewed, misguided and not working in the best interests of Australian students and their families. For example, the Greens are fundamentally opposed to forcing institutions to implement an industrial relations regime by tying workplace changes to funding. The Greens join with unions and workers in rejecting the proposed higher education and workplace relations reforms—they are unwelcome and unnecessary.
The management and unions of universities have the right to continue enterprise bargaining and deal with day-to-day industrial relations matters without unwarranted intervention by government. The proposed requirements ignore the real issues that need to be addressed on campuses around the country. These relate to the quality of the university education experience. This core issue has been dealt many savage blows since 1996 as a result of the government's crude mismanagement and lack of vision when it comes to the future of quality and accessible tertiary education in this country. Universities must have the freedom and the resources to maintain their internationally competitive teaching, research and employment standards. The restrictions being placed on them by the Howard government are a direct attack on academic freedom and teaching standards.
The other major problem with this proposed legislation is the way in which universities are being allowed and encouraged to increase the costs of education for ordinary Australians, and there is no denying that increasing costs are forcing people to turn away from tertiary studies. Under the Howard government, higher education is becoming more and more a privilege than a right and an important investment in the future of this nation. The government proposes that from 2005 institutions in receipt of Commonwealth supported places will determine their own student contribution level for each course they offer, within ranges set by the Commonwealth. Currently there are three HECS bands, each with a fixed rate of student contribution. Under the current system many students are already incurring debts which are unacceptably large. From 2005 these fixed rates will be replaced by ranges. The top of these ranges will be 30 per cent higher than the projected level of HECS for each band for 2005 under current arrangements. 
In August 2003 the government finally released a damning report by DEST into factors affecting access to higher education, including the effect of HECS. The report concluded that the 1996 changes to HECS had the effect of reducing demand for higher education among school leaver applicants by around 9,000 students per year and among mature age students by around 17,000 per year. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee paper published in September 2001 by Long and Hayden entitled Paying their way: a survey of Australian undergraduate university student finances, 2000 was similarly damning. It surveyed over 34,000 students from 20 universities and provided strong evidence to support concern that students' financial circumstances are preventing them from gaining optimum value from their studies. HECS received considerable support among students as an alternative to the payment of up-front fees, but they had no alternative—it was either defer payments via HECS or miss out altogether on going to university.
Students were obviously unhappy with the reality that it would result in ongoing debt long into their working lives. It is quite clear that students would love to see HECS disappear as soon as possible. The students who were most likely to make use of the deferred HECS option were those with relatively disadvantaged financial circumstances—from poor families or with no independent resources. According to the survey more than seven in every 10 full-time students were employed during the semester in 2000, working an average of 14.4 hours a week. That is over 2 days a week. This was nearly three times the hours worked by students in 1984. The increase in paid work has undoubtedly taken its toll on studies. The survey found that nearly one in every 10 students who are employed `frequently' missed classes because of that work, and nearly two in every 10 students in paid employment say that the work adversely affects their study `a great deal'.
A 1999 survey by Richard James, entitled Socioeconomic background and higher education participation: an analysis of school students' aspirations and expectations, also indicated that concerns about costs may adversely affect participation by the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The study surveyed a targeted sample of 7,000 students in years 10 to 12 from three states—Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia—and asked these young Australians about their personal objectives and intentions with regard to post-secondary education. The study concluded:
A significant proportion of students in the study indicated the anticipated cost of higher education is a genuine concern for them. Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were the most likely to report concerns about costs. They were more likely to believe the cost of university fees may stop them attending university and that their families probably could not afford the costs of supporting them at university. Well over one-third of lower socioeconomic background students indicated they would have to support themselves financially if they went to university.
The survey indicates that almost four in every 10 senior high school students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds consider that the cost of fees may prevent them from attending university. The study also noted that the deterrent effect of cost was considerably heightened for students living in rural areas.
The problem of increasing student debt is undeniable. According to media reports yesterday, experts say that student HECS debts are set to top $13 billion in three years as low-income graduates struggle to pay off what they owe. The figures show that some students are so indebted and have such low incomes that many will die before they pay off their debts. These figures come as the minister seeks to place an even higher debt burden on the shoulders of students and their parents. This government wants to give universities the right to set fees at the level of their choosing, and it believes this is reasonable given that it will provide students with the option of taking out a $50,000 loan. 
This bill seeks to double the percentage of full fee paying students allowed to be admitted to university courses. Yet, according to yesterday's media reports, the architect of the higher education contribution charge, Professor Bruce Chapman, comprehensively rejected the idea of providing students with $50,000 loans to study, citing concerns at the massive increase in student debt. He also expressed concerns that some students who pay full fees could find that they use up their $50,000 before finishing their degrees. Also, on Friday the Group of Eight universities through their new head, Ian Chubb, stated their concerns with a provision of the proposed legislation which would allow the minister to reserve some courses exclusively for full-fee students. This is contrary to the government's earlier undertaking to limit full fee paying students to 50 per cent per course.
There are also accountability problems with this bill. It is deficient in terms of the opportunities it provides for parliamentary oversight. As it stands, the bill empowers the minister to dispense over $4 billion each year without any requirement to report on who received grants and on what basis. The funding agreements provision in the bill will give the secretary of the department an unprecedented degree of influence over the academic affairs of universities, including the types of undergraduate and postgraduate courses offered and any other conditions which he or she sees fit to attach to grants. There is no requirement for these agreements to be monitored by parliament or even to be published. There is a similar lack of accountability regarding the minister's decisions on national governance protocols and workplace relations policies. Much of the detail relating to the new funding system is not in the bill but is to be included in the various guidelines. While these guidelines are disallowable by parliament, this is a poor substitute for the parliament's power to consider and amend legislation. 
The Greens reject this bill and condemn the government for its agenda, which seeks to privatise higher education in this country and make it a privilege rather than a right. The Greens propose an alternative vision. We believe that education should be free and available equally to Australians, based on skills and talent, regardless of wealth, background or influence. Free education in this country is affordable and possible. The government just does not have the provision of accessible and quality education on its agenda. As a reflection of the Greens' alternative vision for tertiary education in this country, I will be moving the amendment circulated in my name at the conclusion of my speech.
The Australian Greens amendment to the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 is about stopping the nation from doing what it does not want or need to do. It corrects the glaring errors of the past that have indebted students to record levels and eroded the morale and resources of the higher education sector in this country. The Greens amendment is a way out for the government—a way to prove that it cares about equality, fairness and access to education based on merit, not on ability to pay. Our amendment is also a way for the opposition to redeem itself in the minds of the community by acknowledging that it was wrong to introduce the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, in much the same way that it revoked its longstanding support for the disgraceful White Australia Policy. In other words, this amendment is a lifeline of credibility for the major parties. It is also a way for our society to retain its egalitarianism and to literally provide a `fair go for all'—a term championed by all members in this chamber but given little real, tangible support by the major parties. 
This amendment will cost around $3.25 billon to implement in its entirety. That is not cheap in anyone's language. It is not cheap, but every dollar is well spent and, more importantly, must be spent if our higher education system is to remain equitable and viable. The alternative is to make universities the playgrounds of the idle rich—where those who are not dripping in dollars or downtrodden by debt shuffle past the university gates, shut out of knowledge and the opportunity to learn. This money must be spent to ensure that this country does not become the land of the haves and the have-nots—or, more precisely, the land of those who can afford to go to university and those who cannot. In any event, this amendment is affordable. It is affordable without raising taxes. That is right; this amendment is possible today—right now, in fact—without increasing taxes. All that is needed is a change in priorities.
This amendment abolishes HECS and its equally deformed offspring, the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme. It also kills off up-front fees. This has been calculated to be worth $1.374 billion; or, to look at it another way, the Greens amendment provides $1.374 billion worth of debt relief to students, graduates and their families. This is the core of the issue: debt is the pre-eminent disincentive for students to study, particularly when they are hard up, doing it tough, or living in poverty. We are all aware of the Prime Minister's sympathies for the battlers of this country. The Prime Minister would be wise to recognise that there are hundreds of thousands of battlers in Australia's universities. They are undergraduate and postgraduate students. They are the people who have HECS and PELS debts, which they are required to pay on top of their existing taxation obligations. It is clear that HECS and PELS are taxes on knowledge that must be swept aside. This amendment does just that.
The amendment also forgives all existing HECS and PELS debts, which will unshackle Australia's students and graduates in a major way and provide around $9.979 billion in tax relief for our nurses, teachers, physiotherapists, optometrists, scientists, ambulance officers and others. This will unshackle ordinary Australian workers and their families for the benefit of our community. This is not some form of middle class welfare. 
It is not just students who are suffering at the moment; the universities are also suffering. That is why this amendment increases funding grants by at least 20 per cent per annum, reflecting the actual cost of providing higher education services and providing the basis for sustainability of the sector into the future. This will go some way to ensuring that universities and TAFE institutions have enough money to provide a world-class, quality educational experience for the people of Australia.
To put it bluntly, it will ensure that university and TAFE libraries have enough money for their books and electronic resources. It will also ensure that universities are not teaching students in stairwells and that students can learn a wide range of subjects. It will provide universities with the ability to purchase the best equipment that they need. An increase in ARC grants by 80 per cent over the next three years will also give our academics the freedom to pursue knowledge in areas that have been shut away by the padlock of budgetary restraint—areas of knowledge that we have an obligation to investigate for the benefit of the nation and the planet. This amendment provides for an additional 50,000 undergraduate places in Australia over the next three years—places that are sorely needed.  
The AVCC has recently found that 63,118 eligible people did not receive an offer to attend university last year, although they were eligible to do so. This expansion of places, this increase in opportunity, is reasonable and moderate, but even it will not completely address all the current unmet demands in Australia. That is why this bill also considers the merits of establishing an Australian higher education community access commission. Its role would be to report to the parliament on an annual basis on the level of unmet demand in the higher education and TAFE sectors, along with other matters. Clearly, this information would be invaluable to the government if it were serious about ensuring that everyone who wants to go to university or TAFE and who is eligible could. 
Finally, this amendment addresses a recent proposal by the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that tied anti-union, anticollective dogma to university funding. This amendment rejects these offensive proposals and accepts the right and the value of university staff and students to be represented by the union of their choice. Moreover, it recognises that Australian workplace agreements or contracts with individual employees are not consistent with the mission of the higher education sector. Who pays for these improvements? The Greens see a potential source of revenue that can be used to ensure the Australian community is able to have a free world-class education system. The unforeseen $7.5 billion budget surplus is available. Rather than waste money on people who do not need it by giving tax cuts to the wealthy, the government should put it into education. I therefore call on the government and the opposition to support the Greens amendment and commend it to the House. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House rejects the bill and proposes instead that the Government:
(1)	abolish the current Higher Education Contri-bution Scheme (HECS), the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS) and university tuition fees;
(2)	nullify all existing HECS and PELS debts;
(3)	increase university block funding grants by at least 20% per annum and at least by an amount that reflects the actual cost of provid-ing higher education services, thereby ensur-ing the sustainability of the sector into the future.
(4)	increase Australia Research Council Grants by 80% over the next three years ;
(5)	provide for an additional 50,000 under-graduate places Australia wide  over the next three years 
(6)	Undertake a feasibility study into the establishment  of an Australian  Higher    Education Community Access Commission, whose role would be  to report to Parliament on an annual basis: 
(a)	the level of annual unmet demand in the higher education and TAFE sector;
(b)	the appropriate annual funding require-ments for Australia's higher education sector that would permit every person in Australia who is academic-ally capable to have access to a free and world class university education;
(c)	the quality levels of higher education in Australia; and 
(d)	to make other recommendations to the Parliament concerning higher education issues as it sees fit; 
(7)	not make any linkage between the funding of higher education institutions and the Higher Education Work-place Relations Require-ments (HEWRR) and National Governance Protocols (NGP); and 
(8)	recognise that Australian Workplace Agreements or contracts with individual employees are not consistent with the mission of the higher education sector. 
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! Is the amendment seconded? As the amendment has not been seconded, it cannot be entertained by the House.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2003-10-13,"—Before the interruption of this debate, we were discussing the Higher Education Support Bill 2003. I refer to the excellent speech given by the member for Macquarie extolling the virtues of the bill. I commend him on his contribution. I have taken the time to peruse the speech by the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister for education, and I note that she has got no alternative view. She spends her whole speech attacking the government's position and puts up no alternative plan except that the Labor Party will spend more money. The member for Cunningham, in his contribution, went back to the argument that university education should be free. Even my good friends opposite are not supporting that. They introduced the HECS program and they, with their big spending attitudes, will not support free university education as a future proposition. At least the member for Cunningham had the decency to indicate it would cost $3.5 billion. That is what the members opposite are putting up; they have made no constructive contribution to this debate. I notice there is a long list of speakers to attack the government's proposal, and we look forward to their final proposition that might emerge.
I compliment the minister, the Hon. Brendan Nelson, for his year-long consultations with the university sector and even the union movement. The member for Reid would understand that he has talked to the tertiary union. They have been a bit unhappy that their cosy arrangements might be upset somewhat. Again, I put on record the very extensive consultation that the minister has undertaken with all players and that he has put forward a comprehensive plan to improve universities. I would like to quote from the Financial Review—not always supportive of the government's side, but it summarised the position well. At the time that the bill was being introduced it said, under the headline `University deal is fair enough':
Australia's universities employ 80,000 people in a $10 billion-a-year sector, which is business on a grand scale.
The editorial went on to say:
The government wants to liberate cash-strapped universities from their uniform funding straitjacket, allowing them to tap more fee revenues and respond to price signals and student demand. Better and more diverse courses would result, and industrial relations would be modernised.
Who could argue with that editorial comment? The minister and the government are bringing forward a proposition to improve universities, to improve access and to improve the way in which universities operate. The editorial continued: 
With the exception of industrial relations reforms, which have been postponed, none of these is controversial.
You would be surprised, hearing some of the speeches and comments in this House. It went on:
The package offers something the government is often criticised for not having: vision. It would help universities compete in the global market for top academics and students, encourage them to compete by specialisation and excellence rather than imitation, and lower barriers to entry for poor students.
That summarises in very simple terms what these bills are about and the attitude of the minister and the government. These bills are a wonderful opportunity for this parliament to make some changes to a sector which has not been averse to making many changes over the last 30 or 40 years.
The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003—the technical names of the bills—provide education and training, which are the foundations for an individual's role in the community and help each student to reach their full potential. Nobody would argue with that. I personally have been a great supporter of education across the board.
These bills emanate from the commitment to reform higher education based on the booklet—which was circulated to all universities—about the package called Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. They contain a set of vital reforms which will systematically overhaul the higher educational system, providing changes to university funding, financing, management, governance and industrial relations. Those opposite are very disturbed about the industrial relations part and I will come to that in a minute. These bills will ensure that the higher education sector becomes viable and has a certain future. At the moment, a number of funding difficulties face the sector and the government is not a black hole of funding—although obviously the member for Cunningham thinks it is.
Education has become Australia's seventh biggest export earner—ahead of our traditional export industries of wool, wheat and beef—generating some $4.2 billion. It is quite surprising to a number of members that higher education earns such a large number of export dollars. Higher education plays a significant role in our national and regional economic, social and cultural growth. We see change occurring in regional Australia. In my own electorate, changes can be seen at Deakin University in Geelong, where the new vice-chancellor, Sally Walker, has taken over that role and provided new enthusiasm for and energy to that institution, which has campuses in Geelong, Warrnambool and Melbourne.
Overall, Australia has 38 publicly funded universities with 50 campuses. Let us contemplate that. They cover the broad range of what the higher education sector is about: 38 institutions, with their 50 diverse campuses, spread throughout capital cities and regional areas. The sector provides jobs, it educates our future work force, it drives regional areas and the economy and it provides cultural and trade links with our overseas trading partners. In 2001, the higher education sector contributed 1.5 per cent of GDP and in 2002 it employed approximately 81,000 people. They receive salaries in the higher range in the Australian work force, and so they are very important job opportunities, particularly in regional areas. 
The Howard government has been trying to provide flexibility so that those universities can attract outside income apart from the income provided from the federal budget. In 2002, total revenue to universities was $11.2 billion. This year, it is predicted to reach $11.3 billion. You can see that this is a tremendous commercial activity. There should be some commercial attitudes applied to the way in which universities run their businesses. Looking at the extra money that has been devoted to vocational education and training, we can see that the total revenue figure rises to $11.6 billion. We know that this sector is a very big operation indeed.
Looking at the sector, we can see that some changes and reforms are needed to the way in which money is allocated and to the way in which governance is undertaken. We need to develop universities so that they can build on their individual strengths and so that universities in Australia can compete in the very competitive international market in attracting students. One size fits all is not the way to go. The two major issues that we are facing here are: access to more resources, particularly in the long term; and the restructuring of universities in terms of the way in which they are regulated—either by the Commonwealth government or by state governments—in the way they are managed in terms of governance and in the way they are administered and resourced so that they can meet international benchmarks.
The Higher Education Support Bill is the new funding mechanism which was announced back in the budget, in May. The mix of funding and the changes we are providing will make sure that universities can provide better programs for students. There will be an extra $1.5 billion in public funding over the next four years and $10.6 billion over the first 10 years, of which $6.9 billion will be given directly to universities and about $3.7 billion will be used for additional support to students. Also important is that there will be an extra 31,000 fully funded HECS places over the next five years.
We can see that the government has put more money into the higher education sector. That is a far cry from what those opposite have been saying both in this place and on the public record—that is, that this government was in fact starving the universities of resources.
The other important thing in this legislation is that it provides universities with the ability to determine the value of the HECS charge levied on student courses which are undertaken. As members opposite would be aware, there are now three HECS bands, each with a fixed student rate contribution. After 2005 these fixed rates will be replaced with a band of HECS charges, which will allow individual institutions to charge a range of fees. The important thing to remember is that the HECS charges can range from nothing to 30 per cent higher than the current projected levels. That will allow universities to make a contribution commensurate with their ability to attract students. That allows students to select institutions of their choice and it sends a price signal to those institutions that might not be performing so well and which might have to adjust their academic programs.
Those opposite have argued about the costs of university courses under this new program. HECS, which was introduced by the Labor Party and supported by this side of the parliament when we were in opposition, ensures that students pay approximately 25 per cent of the cost of their higher education. It seems reasonable to me—and it ought to be reasonable to those opposite—that, if students are receiving a program that costs in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 per annum, they might make a contribution through HECS and later through the HELP scheme of approximately one quarter of the total cost of the program. 
The higher education loans program—which is called the HELP scheme—proposed by the minister is basically a loans scheme which will assist students to pay for their HECS. They will be able to receive a loan from the Commonwealth which will be subsidised and will be set at certain rates to ensure that impecunious students will be able to use the HELP scheme. I do not think those opposite could argue against that improvement to HECS. There will also be further scholarship programs to help low-income students. In fact, 25,000 scholarships will be introduced which will help students who have shown ability. That initiative will cost some $160 million.
The changes to some of the programs that the minister has been suggesting to the institutions will put an emphasis on certain areas. Nursing is a particular priority. Even those opposite would support that. If institutions receive increased funding for nursing, they will be able to conduct those courses. There is a commitment by the government to improve industrial relations at universities. Over the weekend I was having a discussion with a person who was concerned about these improvements to industrial relations. In my view, universities should be able to contract with individual staff members. They should be able to undertake an Australian workplace agreement. They should be able to undertake an enterprise agreement with a union. But there should be the alternative. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry are very supportive of these changes. In their press release of 2 June they say:
The proposed changes to workplace relations arrangements in the Higher Education sector, announced in the Federal Budget, are strongly supported by ACCI and members.
They are supportive of the changes, contrary to some of those opposite who have been arguing very strongly that the cosy arrangements between the universities and the Tertiary Education Union should not be disturbed under any circumstance.
Another important thing is that this legislation allows the universities to have a little more commercial activity and a little more capacity to attract other sources of revenue. I was interested to read an article in the Financial Review of 19 September. Under the headline `Senate battle looms over uni reforms' the article says:
Universities will be encouraged to operate more like businesses, maximising the lucrative benefits offered by the overseas student market and boosting the potential for greater private-sector collaboration because of improved transparency.
Individual institutions will also have greater opportunities to specialise in niche courses, which will allow them to improve their international standing.
If we can get more revenue into universities and manage to improve their output, what is wrong with that?
The alternative, as I understand it, is that the opposition are prepared to spend something like $2.3 billion. They have not actually costed their program carefully. It has been suggested by the Department of Finance and Administration that Labor's calculation is out by about $257 million. So much for the fiscal vigour of the opposition. They have put forward no precise proposals in relation to funding higher education, except that they will spend more money.
I will conclude my remarks by discussing Deakin University. As I mentioned, that university has a new vice-chancellor—Sally Walker. She is providing enthusiastic leadership for that university at the Waurn Ponds campus in the electorate of Corangamite, the Geelong Warrnambool campus in the electorate of Wannon, the Waterfront campus in the electorate of Corio and the campuses in Melbourne under her jurisdiction. The Deakin University has moved from strength to strength and has developed an international reputation. It attracts students from South-East Asia and its attraction for students in Victoria has increased. Last year the university won recognition for being the best university in Australia. 
So here in Geelong we have Deakin University, which has developed from fairly modest beginnings in, I think, 1960 to a university which is providing world's best practice—a development that has occurred without the prestigious backgrounds of the older universities of Melbourne and Sydney. Yet with vigorous leadership it has managed to develop a niche market in some of the international programs. With its support of the government's programs and its attracting of financial support from a range of business sectors it has been able to finance a fairly big operation and make sure that it is providing excellence in its programs.
I conclude by saying that this bill, this whole proposition put forward by the minister and the government, is a wonderful opportunity which might not come again. It provides flexibility in terms of governance, it provides flexibility in staffing, it will provide extra resources to the university sector, and it will ensure that universities and higher education meet benchmarks of international excellence. If this is rejected on crass political grounds in the Senate and by those opposite, it will be an opportunity lost for those vice-chancellors who have supported the whole proposition. I draw the attention of members opposite to this unusual set of circumstances where the vice-chancellors, over a period of months—almost a year—have supported these proposals as they have been developed. I note that they have some reservations about the industrial relations measures. Quite often bigger institutions do have such reservations, as BHP did in the early days.
I commend the legislation. I commend the foresight of the very carefully thought through legislation and the philosophy behind it. I only hope that enlightened senators might see fit to pass the legislation as a whole to provide extra funding for students, flexibility and a future for the Australian higher education sector commensurate with other higher education sectors around the world.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—In these 36 appalling words the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, distilled the Liberal Party philosophy towards the education of young Australians. He said:
However what we need is a reality check and to realise that not all of our kids are biologically or socially equipped at least during their adolescence to stay on at school to complete year 12.
What a shameful indictment it is of this parliament that we have an education minister who is prepared to identify in his mind some young Australians who are socially and biologically equipped to complete year 12 and to fulfil their aspirations for a higher education, and others whom he considers are not. It is a disgrace to this parliament, a disgrace to the minister and a disgrace to this country that we have such an education minister. It staggers me that he could make those statements in the first instance, but the fact that he has stood by them for so long speaks volumes about his philosophy and the philosophy of the Howard government and the Liberal Party of Australia.
He made that statement on radio 5AA in Adelaide on 28 November last year and has never recanted. Why would he? This is a statement from the heart of the education minister and from the Liberal heart. If there was ever any question as to the importance of the next election to the direction that Australia will go then that question has been resolved with this statement by this disgraceful minister. There is so much at stake at the next election: the very essence of this country—the essence of a fair go for all Australians, irrespective of the wealth of their parents and their own personal circumstances. Surely Australians want a country where the talents of young Australians are brought to the fore and where the talent of young people is allowed to flourish rather than the wealth of their parents determining their opportunities in life and, indeed, whether or not they will get a flying start in life at all. 
I mentioned the 36 disgraceful words of this education minister because 36 is a highly relevant number. Thirty-six per cent of young Australians went on to year 12 when the Hawke Labor government was elected—only a little more than one in three young Australians had the opportunity to complete high school. The Labor government doubled that figure so that more than two in three young Australians would go on, complete high school and give themselves the great opportunity of further training and higher education. That is a marvellous achievement of a Labor government, right in the Labor mould of a fair go for all and the Labor mould of rewarding talent and initiative rather than the Liberal philosophy of entrenching privilege and denying opportunity to those talented young Australians who do not have the financial capacity to pay extraordinarily expensive university fees.
Like many of my colleagues on this side of the parliament, I am a child of the Whitlam era. There is no doubt that I would not be in this parliament if it were not for the visionary policies of the Whitlam Labor government. That is true of many of my colleagues; we talk about it often. But we are just a small part of the great success of the Whitlam Labor government, which ensured that it was in fact the talents of young Australians and their desire to succeed that prevailed and allowed them to go on to university, and not the wealth of their parents. Previous Liberal governments had rewarded and entrenched privilege and had entrenched underprivilege. It was a visionary Labor government, led by Gough Whitlam, which broke open the mould of privilege being the sole determinant of whether young people could go on to university. It was the Hawke and Keating governments which carried forward that great tradition and that great set of Labor values.
We fundamentally believe that every young Australian, irrespective of their financial circumstances or the financial capacity of their parents, should have the opportunity of a good, decent education in this country. That is not the Liberal philosophy. This last budget was a true-blue Liberal budget. It encapsulated everything there is to know about the Liberal Party in this country. This last budget brought down a plan to destroy our public health system, to destroy Medicare—to remove from ordinary Australians, those who do not have the financial capacity, the right to a high-quality health care system. The same budget also covered the base in relation to higher education. It set out a plan, which we are debating here in the parliament, to deny opportunity to young Australians of talent. The Higher Education Support Bill 2003 is a disgraceful bill, and Labor will be opposing it with every capacity we have here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate because it fundamentally changes the course of this country. This bill fundamentally challenges the values of this country built up over more than 200 years of European settlement. We have prided ourselves on the notion of a fair go, the notion of equality of opportunity regardless of financial capacity or any other aspect of a young person's background. 
This higher education bill takes forward in leaps and bounds the privatisation of Australia's higher education system. It is a return to the pre-Whitlam era where privilege and not talent determined whether a young Australian had the opportunity to gain a university education. The bill gives full expression to Liberal values. It is a true-blue Liberal bill. It gives full expression to John Howard's values, because he is a true-blue Liberal. His values are that private is good and public is bad, that privilege is good and underprivilege is the fault of the individual. This bill suffers philosophically and it suffers in every aspect of its detail. The fundamental problem is that the Howard government is not funding enough university places and it wants to charge too much for those places that it will fund. The government's bill allows the charging of full fees for too many places. I point out that every year 20,000 qualified Australians miss out on studying at university. So 20,000 talented Australians who want to be better educated cannot be because of the straitjacket imposed upon them by this government.
Many of those young Australians who are missing out each year on a university place want to be teachers or nurses. What do we know about teachers and nurses? We know that we have acute shortages of teachers and nurses. The average age of teachers in this country, I am advised, is around 49—similar to that of nurses. Yet we have a former workplace relations minister, now the Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Warringah, saying recently that in his view rural nurses should be paid less than city nurses. Rural Australia has enough difficulty in attracting nurses without their being paid less. This is the mad right-wing ideological dogma of this government—it believes that rural nurses should be paid less. On this matter the former workplace relations minister is on a unity ticket with the Treasurer, because the Treasurer believes that everyone in rural Australia should be paid less; he said so a few years ago. That is their philosophy: pay less. When the Minister for Health and Ageing was asked how he would handle his negotiations with the doctors given that they are unionised, he said that he would deal with doctors because they are professional people. What is he saying? Is he saying that nurses are not professional people? Is he saying that teachers are not professional people? Is he saying that academics in the higher education sector are not professional people, and therefore he will not deal with them but rather tell them what to do and attach strings to any funding that might be made available to the higher education sector? That is a matter to which I will return very shortly.
Another of the fatal flaws of this bill is that the government wants to increase HECS fees by 30 per cent. There are already record numbers of students who will be burdened with HECS debts until the day they die. HECS fees have almost doubled under the Howard government, and students are graduating with debts of up to $50,000. Since 1998, people who can afford to pay full fees—such as $144,000 for a veterinary science degree at the University of Queensland—can buy a place at university ahead of people with higher marks. Doesn't that say it all? That is what this bill is all about: it says that if you have $144,000 then you can jump the talent queue; you can leapfrog someone whose talents have been expressed in their year 12 results and take their university place from them. This is a disgraceful bill. It is a bill that is designed to reward wealth, to entrench privilege and to act against the interests of those young Australians who do not have $144,000 to do a veterinary science degree at the University of Queensland or $100,000 to pay for any number of other degrees around this country where such fees are applied. Now the Howard government wants to increase the number of full fee paying places so that almost half of all university places could be bought. This is totally unacceptable to Labor. It is completely hostile to Labor philosophy, but it is in complete harmony with Liberal philosophy. The government is seeking a return to privilege, not talent, as the determinant of whether a young Australian will get a university education. We make this commitment: Labor will abolish full fees for Australian undergraduates. 
Fundamentally, what is going on in this country is that the Liberal government—the Howard government—wants to take most Australians along the low road to low skills and low wages. We know that productivity growth is the key to the future. Today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. Productivity growth has been good over the last decade, but it is not sustainable without an investment in the new, modern sources of productivity growth. The last decade's productivity growth was a direct harvest of the investment that Labor made through the 1980s and early 1990s in making the Australian economy more competitive, but we cannot keep doing that over and over. We made many of the structural changes that were necessary, but the new sources of productivity growth—and this is confirmed by growth theorists and practical experience around the world—are investment in skills formation and new ideas. But this government does not want to invest in skills formation, unless it is for those who have $100,000 to go on to a university education. In fact, the Productivity Commission chairman, Gary Banks, has observed:
... there appears to have been no significant acceleration in workforce skills in the 1990s.
We have Liberal speaker after Liberal speaker saying, `What a great government we are.' If there is one fundamental test of whether a government is a good government, it is surely whether the skills of this nation have been improved during the term of the government—and the Productivity Commission chairman said that there was no significant acceleration in work force skills in the 1990s. That is a big fat fail for this government. It is a failure to invest in the talents of the young people of this country and in lifelong learning in this country, and it is a complete failure of leadership and vision.
After rising dramatically—more than doubling—during the Labor period, year 12 retention rates have stagnated under the Howard government, and over the 10 years to 2001-02 government spending on education fell from 4.3 per cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent. A small rise in private spending on education was insufficient to prevent a national reduction in overall investment on education. So at the very time that it was critical that there be a wise and quantum new investment in skills formation in this country, public investment in education as a share of GDP actually fell. This is a national disgrace. It is a mortgaging of Australia's future, because this government knew at that time, and still know, that investment in skills in this country is the source of future productivity growth and that it is the right and decent thing to do. But they declare $7½ billion budget surpluses and say, `We haven't got enough money to invest in the skills of this country and in the talents of young Australians.'
That is why Labor say that we must take the high road to high skills and high wages. We must withdraw young Australians from this race to the bottom of low skills and low wages, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia, most particularly China. It requires a commitment from the cradle all the way through—a  commitment to lifelong learning and early intervention. From the very first days, even in prenatal care, it requires an investment by the state to ensure that when infants are born they have the right environment within which to learn, that parents read to young children and prepare them socially for school, that we provide the highest quality school education that we possibly can and that we provide these opportunities to go on to a higher education. That is the high road to high skills and high wages. We should never have entered this low road, and it is a race to the bottom that we should never want to win. Labor will withdraw young, vulnerable Australians from this race to the bottom, competing on wage costs with the countries of East Asia. Labor will embrace a modern economic reform agenda of investing in the sources of productivity growth—innovation and skills formation. 
Griffith University is in my electorate. The current funding and student place shortages in universities are the saddest evidence of the damage that this government has done, and is determined to continue to do, to our higher education system. The Logan campus of Griffith University borders my electorate of Rankin and has many students from my electorate. Griffith University has an innovative marketing and expansion program, and much of its projected growth is focused on Logan campus. But under the Howard government, staff-student ratios at Griffith University have increased by 25 per cent. Under Labor, Griffith University would receive an extra $12 million a year, which would support its future growth and innovation goals. Under the Howard government, such plans would be stifled. Griffith University's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Glyn Davis, has said:
The university sector can't survive in this current form without a significant improvement in public funding.
This legislation is unfair and fundamentally flawed. Its industrial relations provisions are simply a reflection of the bovver boy, bully boy tactics of the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, who has now been put in charge of destroying Medicare—and he will do that. He will fulfil the Prime Minister's 1987 commitment to take a scalpel to Medicare and pull it right apart. Meanwhile, the new workplace relations minister has gone quiet. We have not heard a squeak from him. Will he be the mouse that roars when he does finally come out? This legislation is appalling. It is ideological, it gives full expression to Liberal Party values and it is a disaster for this country. Labor will oppose it with every breath in our bodies. Labor will give a decent opportunity to all young Australians to go on to a higher education. We will reject this legislation in the Senate, because it is a national disgrace.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-10-13,"—Aged care services in Western Sydney are under severe strain. There is an unacceptably long waiting period for local community services such as community nursing, personal care, respite care, house-work, lawn-mowing and community transport. One of the difficulties in this area is that a number of these programs are frag-mented, funded by both the state and federal governments, and inadequate records are kept concerning waiting lists. For example, home care, which is incorporated into the NSW Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care, does not keep waiting list records, although anecdotal evidence supplied by community workers indicates there is at least a six-month waiting list for these services. 
Adding the additional burden of extra record keeping will detract from service delivery. However, without record keeping service delivery is not as efficient as it could be. In the Blacktown local government area the aged population is set to increase at a much faster rate than the younger age group. Some 75 per cent of people over 55 do not participate in the paid work force. This decreases the ability of older people to purchase community services on the open market, as happens in other more affluent areas. There is an urgent need to make one government totally responsible for certain aspects of aged care to avoid cost-shifting arguments and make each government accept their particular responsibility for the ageing community's welfare.
Information supplied by the Western Sydney Area Health Service indicates that there is a waiting time of between four to six weeks for community nursing in Blacktown. There is no HACC funding for generalist community nursing positions. There are also no occupational therapist or physiotherapist positions for HACC clients in the area. The lack of occupational therapists impacts upon home modification services, which first require an OT assessment. The lack of physiotherapists impacts upon fall prevention and gentle exercise programs, which have been shown to maintain mobility for the elderly. This lack of aged care services also causes concern and distress to workers in the field who are regularly required to advise older frail people that there are no community services available to assist them.
The situation is reaching crisis point in the broader Western Sydney region and requires urgent rationalisation to establish the real need in this area and target funds in the most needy areas. The positive aspect of good community aged care is that it encourages older people to maintain their independence in their own homes and avoids the need for residential care, as well as enabling older people to contribute to the welfare of the general community in volunteering capacities.
I would like to take this opportunity to publicly praise the efforts of all the volunteers who work tirelessly for our community, particularly through the Blacktown Meals on Wheels program. Twelve months ago the Riverstone, Mount Druitt and Blacktown Meals on Wheels programs merged to better provide for our community. Val Huddleston now coordinates over 100 volunteers delivering 60,000 meals each year to the disadvantaged in the Blacktown area.
A few weeks ago I was privileged to participate in national Meals on Wheels Day as a volunteer deliverer, and it really opened my eyes to the situation of many of the less fortunate in our society. The people we visited were happy to see us; for many, the Meals on Wheels program is their main contact with other people. There is, unfortunately, a great deal of loneliness and isolation within our community, and the Meals on Wheels volunteers help in a small way to alleviate some of that. The Blacktown Meals on Wheels program do more than simply deliver meals, as important as that is. They own a minibus and often take several of their socially isolated clients out to picnics and barbecues. It really is an all-round service. So to Val and the rest of the team I say: `Thank you. Please keep up the good work; you're doing an absolutely marvelous job.'
In June 2003 a national community care summit was held in Canberra in response to the growing call for reform of community care. Sponsored by Aged and Community Services Australia and the Myer Foundation, the summit was a resounding success. The summit acknowledged that the federal government is currently consulting on community care reform proposals but emphatically concluded that these proposals do not go far enough in addressing the underlying issues that community care faces. The main message from the summit is that governments must act now and act boldly. The united view is that the need for reform in the community care sector leaves no room for delay or political grandstanding.
