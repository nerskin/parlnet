Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2018 strengthens the current legislative framework in relation to visa refusals and cancellations on character grounds. This bill ensures that noncitizens who have been convicted of serious offences and who pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation. The bill presents a clear message to all noncitizens that the Australian community has no tolerance for foreign nationals who have been convicted of such crimes. This bill is in line with community expectations.


Australia is an accessible and attractive destination to visit, to do business and to live. We are a welcoming, multicultural, open and cohesive society. At the same time, we need to always ensure that we remain safe and secure. The government will not tolerate criminal behaviour of noncitizens. Entry and stay in Australia by noncitizens is a privilege, not a right, and the Australian community expects that the Australian government can and should refuse entry to noncitizens, or cancel their visas, if they do not abide by the rule of law. Those who choose to break the law and fail to uphold the standards of behaviour expected by the Australian community should expect to lose that privilege.


Following 115 public submissions, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration's report on migrant settlement outcomes, titled No one teaches you to become an Australian, noted that strengthening the character provisions will make Australians feel safe and be safer. Currently, a noncitizen would need to be sentenced to a minimum of 12 months in order for mandatory cancellation or refusal of their visa. However, this threshold is not capturing all those found guilty of serious criminality, including those who may not serve any custodial sentence and who may pose a continued risk to the safety of the community. This bill proposes that noncitizens who have been convicted of certain designated crimes be considered for discretionary cancellation or refusal regardless of the custodial sentence imposed.


Strengthening the character test in this way provides a clear and objective ground for which to consider the cancelling the visa of or refusing to grant a visa to a noncitizen who has been convicted of offences that involve violence against a person, including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, assault, aggravated burglary and the threat of violence, nonconsensual conduct of a sexual nature, using or possessing a weapon or breaching an order made by a court or tribunal for the personal protection of another person.


It is important to note that the amendments provide for a discretionary power only. It allows consideration of cancellation or refusal of a visa if a person is convicted of a designated offence. In making a decision to refuse or cancel a visa on this ground, a wide range of factors contained within a binding ministerial direction will need to be taken into account, including the protection of the Australian community from criminal or other serious conduct, the best interests of minors in Australia, the expectations of the Australian community, Australia's international obligations, the impact on victims and the nature and extent of the person's ties to Australia.


This bill sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community that entry or stay in Australia is a privilege granted only to those of good character. Like the Australian community, the government has no tolerance for noncitizens who are found to have committed these serious crimes. We make no apologies for protecting the Australian community and will ensure our migration program is one of integrity and available only to those who will make a positive temporary or permanent contribution to our nation. I commend this bill to the House.

 (Mitchell—Special Minister of State) (09:36):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Fit-out of leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office at 6-20 Gladstone Street, Moonee Ponds, Victoria.


The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake a refurbishment of the fit-out at its premises at 6-20 Gladstone Street, Moonee Ponds, Victoria. The proposed fit-out will provide the Australian Taxation Office with considerable advantages in terms of design and operating efficiencies, and proposes to provide contemporary, agile and cost-effective accommodation. The proposed fit-out includes modular work points, collaborative spaces, an updated security system, a computer room, a generator for improved power back-up for computer and security equipment, enhanced conference training and video-conference facilities, bike racks and staff lockers.


The estimated cost of the project is $35.5 million excluding GST. This includes management design fees, construction costs, information and communications technology, furniture, fittings, equipment, contingencies and a provision for escalation. The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants and contractors. Subject to parliamentary approval, the project is anticipated to commence in early 2019 and to be completed committed by 2020. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed replacement of the wharf crane and mooring systems at Christmas Island.


The Australian government, represented by the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities, is responsible for the provision, management and operation of port facilities on Christmas Island. Port facilities on Christmas Island support the social and economic wellbeing of the community and support Australia's strategic interests in the Indian Ocean region. Technical investigations and ongoing consultations with major users of the port facilities have identified a range of concerns regarding the safety, capability and adequacy of key elements of the existing port infrastructure.


The proposed replacement of the wharf crane and mooring systems at the three locations on Christmas Island will address safety and operational risks as well as ensure the adequacy and reliability of critical infrastructure and support for Australia's strategic interests. The proposed works will promote the physical wellbeing, the social welfare and the economic stability of the Christmas Island community.


In the 2018-19 budget measure 'Indian Ocean Territories—essential infrastructure and air services', the government provided $51.6 million over four years, from 2018-18, to upgrade Commonwealth infrastructure and underwrite essential air services in the Indian Ocean Territories. The measure included $26.2 million over three years, from 2018-19, in capital funding for the project on Christmas Island. This includes the construction costs, the management and design fees, locality allowance and contingencies and escalation allowance. Net operating costs arising after completion of the project are expected to decrease due to the new infrastructure and the removal of the redundant and inoperable infrastructure. Subject to parliamentary approval of the proposed work, construction is planned to commence in mid-April 2019, with staged completion of facilities between mid-April 2020 and mid-February 2021. I commend the motion to the House.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (09:41):  Labor supports this bill, and we support the bills which are to follow: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. My colleague, the member for Barton, will speak to the latter two bills. I'm proposing to address some comments to the first of these bills. I think it's useful for the parliament, in considering these bills, to put them in their historical context, which really does start with the Mabo judgement—a landmark decision of the High Court of Australia handed down on 3 June 1992, which, of course, as we all know, overturned the long-held assumption of Australia's settlement, that the land belonged to no-one, and recognised the continuing title of First Nations people to land. The judgement recognised in Australian common law that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's traditional title to land, or native title, had survived the British settlement of the continent, and the judgement found that native title had been extinguished by many of the titles granted to other Australians by successive Australian governments.


Shortly after the Mabo judgements were handed down, the federal government, led by Prime Minister Keating, sought to codify native title in legislation through a process of negotiation with Indigenous leaders. The first part of the settlement was the Native Title Act 1993, which passed through this parliament in December 1993. The Native Title Act codifies the definition of native title and establishes a process for its recognition where there has not been extinguishment.


The land fund, now officially known as the Land Account, was the second part of the settlement with the First Nations people of this continent. At the time, government and Indigenous leaders were conscious that many Indigenous Australians had seen their traditional country overlay with the land titles of other Australians. The Land Account therefore provides a mechanism for some compensation for the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples since 1788. The Land Account was established with legislated appropriations over 10 years to build a capital base, after which the account's own income would support the operations of a new statutory authority created at the same time as the Land Account, the Indigenous Land Corporation.


Since that time, the ILC has used the land account to purchase property for the use and enjoyment of the Indigenous Australians whose native title has been extinguished. After 20 years, the ILC began to initiate a review into its functions. From early July to the beginning of September 2017 the ILC undertook a series of consultations to gain community feedback on legislative changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005, the ATSI Act, on two key issues—the first being the financial sustainability of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment land account and the second being the ILC's remit to include fresh and salt water based activities. Sixteen consultations took place around the country involving more than 75 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations.


According to the report that was produced on the consultation, 75 per cent of the consultation sessions provided consensus support for both areas of proposed reform. More than 85 per cent of sessions provided consensus support to the reform of management and governance arrangements for the land account. There was unanimous support for reform to the investment mandate of the land account expressed in the written submissions that dealt with that issue and, of the 17 submissions that addressed both issues, 77 per cent gave support to both with only eight per cent indicating they did not support the reform relating to water.


On 28 March 2018 the government introduced two substantive pieces of legislation, and one piece of consequential legislation, to alter the functions and governance of the Indigenous Land Corporation, the ILC, and the Indigenous land account. As I've said, my colleague the member for Barton will be addressing the latter two bills. I'm addressing the first bill, which deals with the Indigenous Land Corporation. What this bill does is to enable the ILC to perform functions in relation to waters, including ground and surface water, where the Commonwealth or the states and territories have sovereign rights—that is, in water or waters within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone of Australia, including internal waters of Australia.


The bill amends the ATSI Act to give the ILC functions in relation to water related rights. These additional functions are to be consistent with the ILC's functions in relation to land. They include: the acquisition of water related rights and divestment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations; the provision of assistance in the form of grants, loans or loan guarantees to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations to acquire water based rights; the carrying on of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters; and the provision of assistance grants, loans or loan guarantees for the purpose of carrying on management activities in relation to Indigenous waters. The bill does not create any new rights and does not authorise the ILC to exercise its functions in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights and interests of other persons or international law such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The bill alters the name of the ILC to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to reflect the expansion of the ILC's functions to water. As I've said, Labor supports this bill. It's an appropriate response to the consultation that was conducted by the ILC. I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-10-25,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (09:48):  I'd like to begin by thanking the member for Isaacs for his brevity. It is always good to get his views on the record, particularly on a matter as important as this. In my former role, I spent time working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, including my good friend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda, particularly around the challenges facing the use of land under native title for economic development. Having convened round tables in Broome and Sydney on some of the challenges that are faced in this space to realise the economic potential of land, this bill is very welcome because not just prescribed body corporates but also Indigenous land corporations play an important part of the infrastructure that sits around the use of native title lands and the legacy of the Mabo decision—and, of course, state based regimes as well as the particular issues around title in the Northern Territory.


What we actually want is an environment where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are able to fully realise their ambitions and their dreams based on the assets that are available to them. And what we have in some of the ILCs is an acquisition program of land of up to $2 billion which enables it to be used for an effective purpose to advance the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who live with the consequences and injustice of displacement that came as a consequence of European settlement. We cannot undo the legacy of the past. What we can do is choose a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But, more critically, it doesn't actually matter what we, being the people who are in this place right now in this chamber or in the Senate, think, because the pathway for success for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is not for what we can impose on them or do to them. The pathway to success for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is what we can do to empower and support them to realise their own ambitions and their own dreams.


What we want, I would have thought, is for more people to take ownership, for people to feel like they are in control of their future and for them to be able to take that control—that sense of ownership—and translate it into better outcomes not just for themselves but also for generations yet to come. I say that because, when it comes to generations yet to come, what we have to do is break the cycle of what has occurred in the past—where many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have felt that this country has not served them and where this country has simply, in its modern form, sought to alienate, isolate or displace their traditions, their culture, their language and, of course, their land.


Yesterday I spoke in this place on another bill related to some of the housing measures that this government is investing in as part of a framework working with the states. I made the point at the time that, despite how we sometimes think about the transactional nature of housing—and it's an important part of it; we have a market in housing that needs to be supported and a private market that works successfully for the most part but doesn't meet everybody's needs because of people's economic circumstances and sometimes the constraints we place on it which make it beyond the reach of many people who would otherwise seek to rely upon it—without a house, but more critically without a home, as the bedrock of stability in people's lives, there are huge consequences for how people then go on to live their lives. It's a truism and a statement of the bleeding obvious, but in practice we take it for granted. If people don't have that bedrock of their life—that foundational stone of a home—they can't then go on and achieve so much of what is frankly the habit of life.


We all have lived experience when we come into this parliament. It's not reserved for me, those on the other side, those on this side or even yourself, Mr Speaker. It is the lived experience. Part of the reason why we stand here is because we have succeeded in harnessing the potential that's available to us, and that's off the back of routine and stability and then the capacity to use that to leverage to a more successful life, including, frankly, the confidence to put yourself out into the public and have your ideas, your values and your confidence tested against a community and, ultimately, the scrutiny of the Australian people. The story is no different for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. When you sever a connection between a people and the place they call home, particularly when the connection is more than just a transactional relationship around what is owned at a time but a relationship around what is seen as being an enduring custodianship as connected directly to a place, a home, a culture and a language that in people's mindsets brings them a sense of safety, the consequences are quite severe.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are not alone in this. There are many other cultures around the world who have similar journeys and similar challenges and countries that continue to face the consequences of that. That's why taking simple and practical measures to redress the legacy of that severed connection is so critical as part of rebuilding that sense of place.


As I said, this bill is designed to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' land account, which funds the ILCs, to be used for as constructive a purpose as possible, because—while we might capitalise the basis of that ownership and that heritage in financial resources, to be able to go on and do things into the future—we have to make sure that it's sustainable and that no money is wasted. So part of the very pragmatic reform of this government is to recognise that the place for such funds is with the Future Fund—not because we wish to control it but simply because of the capacity to deliver returns—so as to provide that basis for a sustainable future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the ILCs, so they are able to secure the funding that they need.


We've done exactly the same thing—and this is where I think it's important to draw the parallel—for superannuation liabilities for public servants under the Future Fund, for this place and this modern structure. In doing so, we're setting a standard against which we're able to hold ourselves but also others. The ambition now for the Future Fund should be not just to hold the capital that's available to them—to be able to do what is right and meet the expectations and obligations set out in their charter and their course—but also to generate income and potential so that we can help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people thrive.


It's on that basis—a very simple, pragmatic basis—that I support this piece of legislation. It follows, as the Attorney-General and shadow Attorney-General have outlined, a long process of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, so that we are working with them and designing laws and regulations that meet their needs; but, more critically, so that there is a trust being built between those who are custodians of this wealth and, of course, the people who seek to govern it, so that we may have a better future and a shared future together.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (09:57):  I acknowledge those who have already spoken in this debate. Clearly Labor is supporting this bill, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018, and the subsequent piece of legislation which will be before us shortly, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018. My contribution will be short, but I do want to go back to the origins of the land fund and the debates and discussions that took place post Mabo and the Native Title Act. I was part of the discussions and the deliberations of this parliament, and I remember distinctly the land fund and its establishment. The purpose for its establishment was to try and give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country an opportunity to purchase back some of their own estate. Initially, there was a great effort by the land fund to purchase pastoral leases in different parts of remote Australia. Giving people a land base was seen to be very important. The fund has changed its expenditure profile over the decades since. But, importantly, it was an absolute recognition of the need to address the alienation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from their country. From that perspective, it was, truly, really very, very important.


A trifecta of things were to happen: first, the native title legislation; second, the establishment of the land fund; third, a social justice package, which, sadly, has never been implemented. I suspect we wouldn't be now discussing issues around housing and poverty in remote parts of Australia, and the lack of educational or employment opportunities all over Australia, had we had that social justice package developed and implemented at that time.


But the Keating government got defeated; the Howard government got elected; and they were just disregarded. The land fund had been set up, so it was tolerated, but, of course, one of the subsequent things that the Howard government did was abolish ATSIC, so there was a sort of distancing of the federal government from the views expressed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country.


You'll remember the absurd and dreadful statements of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, over the Wik claim. I'm not sure if you recall it, but I do. The High Court made a decision about the Wik peoples' claim. The then Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, pilloried the High Court for acknowledging the right of the Wik people.


We'd come from where the Mabo decision, a High Court decision, had led to the native title legislation—a very difficult piece of legislation to get passed through the parliament, I might say. We had then had some sort of unifying with the passage of that legislation, the setting up of the land fund and the recognition that the absurd notion of terra nullius had been expunged. We then had the Howard government crawling its way, clawing its way, trying to take back the rights that Aboriginal people had been provided. We saw that absurd and very dreadful and insulting behaviour by the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. Nevertheless, we're not here to talk about him today, thank goodness.


What we are here to do is recognise that this is an advance. The land fund has been in existence and has been operating successfully. Obviously, there is debate in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community about the priorities of the fund from time to time. But this bill is important because it acknowledges that there ought to be a capacity for the land fund to deal with matters to do with seas and water. If we understand the implications of that, it may mean the oceans, but it may also mean purchasing water rights for properties, for example. The additional functions that have been proposed in this legislation are to be consistent with the ILC's functions in relation to land and include the acquisition of water related rights and divestment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, which is important.


The acquisition of these rights is not for the land fund or the ILC but for the purpose and use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in this case on their land. These rights should be divested. These are not property rights which should be retained by the ILC. The properties which are purchased by the ILC are for the benefit and use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and should be divested to them, and that's what this proposes.


The provision of assistance, grants, loans or loan guarantees to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations to acquire water based rights is a very welcome proposal. The carrying on of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters and the provision of assistance, grants, loans or loan guarantees for the purpose of carrying on management activities in relation to those Indigenous waters are important.


We've now no longer, thankfully, got the hideousness of the sorts of attitudes, at least in this parliament, that I've seen—sorry, I should say there might be a small segment in the other place that might actually mirror the statements which were made by that hideous person who was then the Deputy Prime Minister. Nevertheless, I think we have advanced a great deal so that native title is no longer in conjecture. We recognise that the rights and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need to be properly addressed and the way to address them. This piece of legislation advances us by ensuring that we can look after the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to water rights, and that is most welcome. This is an important piece of legislation, and I'm happy to be able to support it.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck—Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (10:05):  I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018. This bill represents a significant step forward in Australia's land rights journey. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established as part of the government's response to the High Court decision in Mabo No. 2 in recognition that many Indigenous people would be unable to benefit under the Native Title Act 1993. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to acquire land and to manage Indigenous held land so as to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 


Land is not defined within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005. On a plain language interpretation, this means the Indigenous Land Corporation cannot support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to conduct activity in freshwater and sea country. For example, it cannot support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to strengthen their connection with culture and communities through activities in freshwater and sea country; manage freshwater and sea country to keep culturally significant plant and animals healthy; or establish fishing businesses. This is inconsistent with the understanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have of country. This is also inconsistent with developments in case law recognising that native title rights can extend to freshwater and sea country. In some cases, these rights include rights to take and use water for a variety of purposes and to take resources from certain waters. The law now acknowledges that, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, land and water are inseparable parts of country. It is now time for the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to reflect this. 


These reforms follow extensive consultations with Indigenous stakeholders. A clear majority of stakeholders supported changes to expand the remit of the Indigenous Land Corporation to include freshwater and sea country. The government has listed and is now enabling the Indigenous Land Corporation to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to care for, manage and benefit from freshwater and sea country. In its report on the bill, the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee recommended that the bill be amended to ensure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 gives the Indigenous Land Corporation the function to manage water or waters in which the Indigenous Land Corporation has water related rights. Amendments agreed to in this House respond to the committee's recommendation. These amendments will mean the Indigenous Land Corporation's water management functions are consistent with its land management functions. 


The bill will also rename the Indigenous Land Corporation the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to reflect the expansion of its remit to include water. Expanding the remit will enable the Indigenous Land Corporation to reflect the understanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have of country. It will also enable the Indigenous Land Corporation to support the full range of opportunities for Indigenous economic development in sectors such as fisheries, agriculture and tourism. 


These reforms represent a significant step in Australia's land rights journey. By expanding the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to rights in relation to water, this government is realising its commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr WYATT:
  I move government amendments (1) and (2), as circulated, together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 9), omit ""or waters"", substitute "", or waters,"".

(cb) to carry on, or arrange for the carrying on of, management activities in relation to water, or waters, in relation to which the Indigenous Land Corporation holds water-related rights;


The government moves two amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018. This bill amends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 to extend the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to rights in relation to water and for related purposes.


As introduced, the bill does not enable the Indigenous Land Corporation to perform management functions in relation to water, or waters, in which the Indigenous Land Corporation has water related rights. This is a gap in the bill which means the Indigenous Land Corporation's water management functions would not correspond to its land management functions. The Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee's report of its inquiry into the bill recommended it be amended to address this gap.


The main amendment to the bill addresses this gap and gives the Indigenous Land Corporation management functions in relation to water, or waters, in which the Indigenous Land Corporation has water related rights. The Indigenous Land Corporation's new functions provided for in the bill include management activities in relation to Indigenous waters. As defined in the bill, 'Indigenous waters' includes waters in relation to which certain entities or persons have water related rights.


The second amendment is a technical amendment that updates the drafting of the definition of Indigenous waters in item 1 of schedule 1 to the bill. This amendment is done for consistency with the main amendment that I've just outlined. I commend the amendments to the House.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (09:41):  Labor supports this bill, and we support the bills which are to follow: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. My colleague, the member for Barton, will speak to the latter two bills. I'm proposing to address some comments to the first of these bills. I think it's useful for the parliament, in considering these bills, to put them in their historical context, which really does start with the Mabo judgement—a landmark decision of the High Court of Australia handed down on 3 June 1992, which, of course, as we all know, overturned the long-held assumption of Australia's settlement, that the land belonged to no-one, and recognised the continuing title of First Nations people to land. The judgement recognised in Australian common law that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's traditional title to land, or native title, had survived the British settlement of the continent, and the judgement found that native title had been extinguished by many of the titles granted to other Australians by successive Australian governments.


Shortly after the Mabo judgements were handed down, the federal government, led by Prime Minister Keating, sought to codify native title in legislation through a process of negotiation with Indigenous leaders. The first part of the settlement was the Native Title Act 1993, which passed through this parliament in December 1993. The Native Title Act codifies the definition of native title and establishes a process for its recognition where there has not been extinguishment.


The land fund, now officially known as the Land Account, was the second part of the settlement with the First Nations people of this continent. At the time, government and Indigenous leaders were conscious that many Indigenous Australians had seen their traditional country overlay with the land titles of other Australians. The Land Account therefore provides a mechanism for some compensation for the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples since 1788. The Land Account was established with legislated appropriations over 10 years to build a capital base, after which the account's own income would support the operations of a new statutory authority created at the same time as the Land Account, the Indigenous Land Corporation.


Since that time, the ILC has used the land account to purchase property for the use and enjoyment of the Indigenous Australians whose native title has been extinguished. After 20 years, the ILC began to initiate a review into its functions. From early July to the beginning of September 2017 the ILC undertook a series of consultations to gain community feedback on legislative changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005, the ATSI Act, on two key issues—the first being the financial sustainability of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment land account and the second being the ILC's remit to include fresh and salt water based activities. Sixteen consultations took place around the country involving more than 75 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations.


According to the report that was produced on the consultation, 75 per cent of the consultation sessions provided consensus support for both areas of proposed reform. More than 85 per cent of sessions provided consensus support to the reform of management and governance arrangements for the land account. There was unanimous support for reform to the investment mandate of the land account expressed in the written submissions that dealt with that issue and, of the 17 submissions that addressed both issues, 77 per cent gave support to both with only eight per cent indicating they did not support the reform relating to water.


On 28 March 2018 the government introduced two substantive pieces of legislation, and one piece of consequential legislation, to alter the functions and governance of the Indigenous Land Corporation, the ILC, and the Indigenous land account. As I've said, my colleague the member for Barton will be addressing the latter two bills. I'm addressing the first bill, which deals with the Indigenous Land Corporation. What this bill does is to enable the ILC to perform functions in relation to waters, including ground and surface water, where the Commonwealth or the states and territories have sovereign rights—that is, in water or waters within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone of Australia, including internal waters of Australia.


The bill amends the ATSI Act to give the ILC functions in relation to water related rights. These additional functions are to be consistent with the ILC's functions in relation to land. They include: the acquisition of water related rights and divestment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations; the provision of assistance in the form of grants, loans or loan guarantees to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations to acquire water based rights; the carrying on of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters; and the provision of assistance grants, loans or loan guarantees for the purpose of carrying on management activities in relation to Indigenous waters. The bill does not create any new rights and does not authorise the ILC to exercise its functions in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights and interests of other persons or international law such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The bill alters the name of the ILC to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to reflect the expansion of the ILC's functions to water. As I've said, Labor supports this bill. It's an appropriate response to the consultation that was conducted by the ILC. I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-10-25,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (09:48):  I'd like to begin by thanking the member for Isaacs for his brevity. It is always good to get his views on the record, particularly on a matter as important as this. In my former role, I spent time working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, including my good friend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda, particularly around the challenges facing the use of land under native title for economic development. Having convened round tables in Broome and Sydney on some of the challenges that are faced in this space to realise the economic potential of land, this bill is very welcome because not just prescribed body corporates but also Indigenous land corporations play an important part of the infrastructure that sits around the use of native title lands and the legacy of the Mabo decision—and, of course, state based regimes as well as the particular issues around title in the Northern Territory.


What we actually want is an environment where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are able to fully realise their ambitions and their dreams based on the assets that are available to them. And what we have in some of the ILCs is an acquisition program of land of up to $2 billion which enables it to be used for an effective purpose to advance the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who live with the consequences and injustice of displacement that came as a consequence of European settlement. We cannot undo the legacy of the past. What we can do is choose a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But, more critically, it doesn't actually matter what we, being the people who are in this place right now in this chamber or in the Senate, think, because the pathway for success for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is not for what we can impose on them or do to them. The pathway to success for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is what we can do to empower and support them to realise their own ambitions and their own dreams.


What we want, I would have thought, is for more people to take ownership, for people to feel like they are in control of their future and for them to be able to take that control—that sense of ownership—and translate it into better outcomes not just for themselves but also for generations yet to come. I say that because, when it comes to generations yet to come, what we have to do is break the cycle of what has occurred in the past—where many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have felt that this country has not served them and where this country has simply, in its modern form, sought to alienate, isolate or displace their traditions, their culture, their language and, of course, their land.


Yesterday I spoke in this place on another bill related to some of the housing measures that this government is investing in as part of a framework working with the states. I made the point at the time that, despite how we sometimes think about the transactional nature of housing—and it's an important part of it; we have a market in housing that needs to be supported and a private market that works successfully for the most part but doesn't meet everybody's needs because of people's economic circumstances and sometimes the constraints we place on it which make it beyond the reach of many people who would otherwise seek to rely upon it—without a house, but more critically without a home, as the bedrock of stability in people's lives, there are huge consequences for how people then go on to live their lives. It's a truism and a statement of the bleeding obvious, but in practice we take it for granted. If people don't have that bedrock of their life—that foundational stone of a home—they can't then go on and achieve so much of what is frankly the habit of life.


We all have lived experience when we come into this parliament. It's not reserved for me, those on the other side, those on this side or even yourself, Mr Speaker. It is the lived experience. Part of the reason why we stand here is because we have succeeded in harnessing the potential that's available to us, and that's off the back of routine and stability and then the capacity to use that to leverage to a more successful life, including, frankly, the confidence to put yourself out into the public and have your ideas, your values and your confidence tested against a community and, ultimately, the scrutiny of the Australian people. The story is no different for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. When you sever a connection between a people and the place they call home, particularly when the connection is more than just a transactional relationship around what is owned at a time but a relationship around what is seen as being an enduring custodianship as connected directly to a place, a home, a culture and a language that in people's mindsets brings them a sense of safety, the consequences are quite severe.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are not alone in this. There are many other cultures around the world who have similar journeys and similar challenges and countries that continue to face the consequences of that. That's why taking simple and practical measures to redress the legacy of that severed connection is so critical as part of rebuilding that sense of place.


As I said, this bill is designed to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' land account, which funds the ILCs, to be used for as constructive a purpose as possible, because—while we might capitalise the basis of that ownership and that heritage in financial resources, to be able to go on and do things into the future—we have to make sure that it's sustainable and that no money is wasted. So part of the very pragmatic reform of this government is to recognise that the place for such funds is with the Future Fund—not because we wish to control it but simply because of the capacity to deliver returns—so as to provide that basis for a sustainable future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the ILCs, so they are able to secure the funding that they need.


We've done exactly the same thing—and this is where I think it's important to draw the parallel—for superannuation liabilities for public servants under the Future Fund, for this place and this modern structure. In doing so, we're setting a standard against which we're able to hold ourselves but also others. The ambition now for the Future Fund should be not just to hold the capital that's available to them—to be able to do what is right and meet the expectations and obligations set out in their charter and their course—but also to generate income and potential so that we can help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people thrive.


It's on that basis—a very simple, pragmatic basis—that I support this piece of legislation. It follows, as the Attorney-General and shadow Attorney-General have outlined, a long process of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, so that we are working with them and designing laws and regulations that meet their needs; but, more critically, so that there is a trust being built between those who are custodians of this wealth and, of course, the people who seek to govern it, so that we may have a better future and a shared future together.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (09:57):  I acknowledge those who have already spoken in this debate. Clearly Labor is supporting this bill, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018, and the subsequent piece of legislation which will be before us shortly, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018. My contribution will be short, but I do want to go back to the origins of the land fund and the debates and discussions that took place post Mabo and the Native Title Act. I was part of the discussions and the deliberations of this parliament, and I remember distinctly the land fund and its establishment. The purpose for its establishment was to try and give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country an opportunity to purchase back some of their own estate. Initially, there was a great effort by the land fund to purchase pastoral leases in different parts of remote Australia. Giving people a land base was seen to be very important. The fund has changed its expenditure profile over the decades since. But, importantly, it was an absolute recognition of the need to address the alienation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from their country. From that perspective, it was, truly, really very, very important.


A trifecta of things were to happen: first, the native title legislation; second, the establishment of the land fund; third, a social justice package, which, sadly, has never been implemented. I suspect we wouldn't be now discussing issues around housing and poverty in remote parts of Australia, and the lack of educational or employment opportunities all over Australia, had we had that social justice package developed and implemented at that time.


But the Keating government got defeated; the Howard government got elected; and they were just disregarded. The land fund had been set up, so it was tolerated, but, of course, one of the subsequent things that the Howard government did was abolish ATSIC, so there was a sort of distancing of the federal government from the views expressed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country.


You'll remember the absurd and dreadful statements of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, over the Wik claim. I'm not sure if you recall it, but I do. The High Court made a decision about the Wik peoples' claim. The then Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, pilloried the High Court for acknowledging the right of the Wik people.


We'd come from where the Mabo decision, a High Court decision, had led to the native title legislation—a very difficult piece of legislation to get passed through the parliament, I might say. We had then had some sort of unifying with the passage of that legislation, the setting up of the land fund and the recognition that the absurd notion of terra nullius had been expunged. We then had the Howard government crawling its way, clawing its way, trying to take back the rights that Aboriginal people had been provided. We saw that absurd and very dreadful and insulting behaviour by the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. Nevertheless, we're not here to talk about him today, thank goodness.


What we are here to do is recognise that this is an advance. The land fund has been in existence and has been operating successfully. Obviously, there is debate in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community about the priorities of the fund from time to time. But this bill is important because it acknowledges that there ought to be a capacity for the land fund to deal with matters to do with seas and water. If we understand the implications of that, it may mean the oceans, but it may also mean purchasing water rights for properties, for example. The additional functions that have been proposed in this legislation are to be consistent with the ILC's functions in relation to land and include the acquisition of water related rights and divestment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, which is important.


The acquisition of these rights is not for the land fund or the ILC but for the purpose and use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in this case on their land. These rights should be divested. These are not property rights which should be retained by the ILC. The properties which are purchased by the ILC are for the benefit and use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and should be divested to them, and that's what this proposes.


The provision of assistance, grants, loans or loan guarantees to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations to acquire water based rights is a very welcome proposal. The carrying on of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters and the provision of assistance, grants, loans or loan guarantees for the purpose of carrying on management activities in relation to those Indigenous waters are important.


We've now no longer, thankfully, got the hideousness of the sorts of attitudes, at least in this parliament, that I've seen—sorry, I should say there might be a small segment in the other place that might actually mirror the statements which were made by that hideous person who was then the Deputy Prime Minister. Nevertheless, I think we have advanced a great deal so that native title is no longer in conjecture. We recognise that the rights and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need to be properly addressed and the way to address them. This piece of legislation advances us by ensuring that we can look after the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to water rights, and that is most welcome. This is an important piece of legislation, and I'm happy to be able to support it.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck—Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (10:05):  I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018. This bill represents a significant step forward in Australia's land rights journey. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established as part of the government's response to the High Court decision in Mabo No. 2 in recognition that many Indigenous people would be unable to benefit under the Native Title Act 1993. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to acquire land and to manage Indigenous held land so as to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 


Land is not defined within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005. On a plain language interpretation, this means the Indigenous Land Corporation cannot support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to conduct activity in freshwater and sea country. For example, it cannot support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to strengthen their connection with culture and communities through activities in freshwater and sea country; manage freshwater and sea country to keep culturally significant plant and animals healthy; or establish fishing businesses. This is inconsistent with the understanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have of country. This is also inconsistent with developments in case law recognising that native title rights can extend to freshwater and sea country. In some cases, these rights include rights to take and use water for a variety of purposes and to take resources from certain waters. The law now acknowledges that, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, land and water are inseparable parts of country. It is now time for the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to reflect this. 


These reforms follow extensive consultations with Indigenous stakeholders. A clear majority of stakeholders supported changes to expand the remit of the Indigenous Land Corporation to include freshwater and sea country. The government has listed and is now enabling the Indigenous Land Corporation to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to care for, manage and benefit from freshwater and sea country. In its report on the bill, the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee recommended that the bill be amended to ensure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 gives the Indigenous Land Corporation the function to manage water or waters in which the Indigenous Land Corporation has water related rights. Amendments agreed to in this House respond to the committee's recommendation. These amendments will mean the Indigenous Land Corporation's water management functions are consistent with its land management functions. 


The bill will also rename the Indigenous Land Corporation the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to reflect the expansion of its remit to include water. Expanding the remit will enable the Indigenous Land Corporation to reflect the understanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have of country. It will also enable the Indigenous Land Corporation to support the full range of opportunities for Indigenous economic development in sectors such as fisheries, agriculture and tourism. 


These reforms represent a significant step in Australia's land rights journey. By expanding the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to rights in relation to water, this government is realising its commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Werriwa) (13:30):  Champion legend, victor, hero—all these words are splashed across the media every day to describe those playing professional sport. These descriptions are often cliches and don't really reflect the effort of the individual in the spotlight. That can't be said, though, of the athletes currently competing in the Invictus Games in Sydney. Invictus means 'unconquerable' in Latin. That is certainly the spirit on display this week. 'Invictus' embodies the fighting spirit of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel taking part. Founded by Prince Harry and first held in 2014, the Sydney games have 500 competitors from 18 nations and 11 sports. Recently, I had the honour of meeting Andrew Wilkinson, who lives in the electorate of Werriwa. Andrew was in peak training for this week's Invictus Games and I appreciate the time he spent explaining his events and the path that led him to wanting to compete. I'm pleased to advise the House that Andrew has so far competed in road cycling and swimming and has won three silver and three gold medals. All these athletes are inspiring for their support of each other and their willingness to succeed. I add my congratulations to them and to Andrew for such a wonderful Games.

 (Cook—Prime Minister) (14:02):  What the government has done is initiated two processes. The government has made no decisions on these policies. The government has done two things. Apart from voting no in the General Assembly of the United Nations, together with the United States and Israel, on the matter before the General Assembly last week, I indicated last week that we would initiate two processes. The first was to review without prejudice the Iran nuclear deal. That process is now underway, and that is chaired by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. On the other matter, we dared ask the question and we dared consider that Australia might have a different position on this issue, and we are initiating a process on that matter as well which will fully consult all those who would need to be consulted before a final decision is made.


The Leader of the Labor Party may not think it's okay for governments to consult with each other and dare ask a question—




Mr Shorten:
  My point of order is on direct relevance. I was asking about the timing of this rushed decision and whether it was correct that he told the media before he informed his colleagues or indeed spoke to his own departmental or Defence officials.




Mr MORRISON:
  I consulted with all the ministers of the National Security Committee before I indicated one simple thing, and that is that I found the arguments of the Liberal candidate for Wentworth, the former Ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma, who had put forward a very, I think, convincing proposition that in advancing a two-state solution we could also consider the possibility of recognising the capital of Israel being Jerusalem persuasive. I don't resolve from that. All I know is that the Australian people know where we stand on these issues and, as always, they have not the faintest idea about where the Labor Party stands. As far as I know, they all think Israel is a rogue state, just like the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party.

The SPEAKER
 (15:13):  Members may recall that last Thursday I provided the House with an update on the installation of the electronic access control system to members' suites and indicated I would provide a further update to members this week on the status of the broader security upgrade works at Parliament House.


Since the 2014 review of security arrangements at Parliament House, the Department of Parliamentary Services has undertaken a large program of works aimed at improving the security of the building, including strengthening entry points, the building fabric and security infrastructure. A large amount of this work has been finished. Work on the perimeter fence is complete. Planting of the landscape barrier along the fences is now underway. The process of upgrading and installing new CCTV security cameras has now been completed. This project formed part of the overall electronic security upgrade works, which are expected to conclude in late November.


As I advised the House last Thursday, installation of the electronic access control system to members' suites has been completed. The system is now being progressively activated. Hardening of the windows in the House of Representatives wing was finished in August. Work on the Great Hall skylight is now finished, with all skylight upgrades expected to be complete in November. The canopy and scaffolding have been removed from the roof. Replacement of grass on the roof and the southern ramp is now underway.


Whilst there's been a great deal of progress, members should also be aware that a lot of work remains to be done. Work's continuing on the Senate and House of Representatives slip-road exit and entry gates. The gates won't be used until the necessary policies and procedures are in place. The new gates and turnstiles on each side will be finalised and commissioned once the new entry work is finished.


Construction work on the doors on level 1 between the public and private areas of the building is due to be completed during November. Window works to the front facade, including the gift shop, Queen's Terrace and Visitor Services, are scheduled to commence during November. Work on the second public entrance is expected to be completed in this financial year. Installation of the ceremonial doors at the front of the building is due to conclude by the end of April next year.


However, I do have to say that work on the House of Representatives and Senate entrances is the subject of some major delays, which are beyond our control. A revised schedule is being developed by the contractor to ensure these works are concluded as soon as possible. In the meantime, the temporary entrances will remain in place until early 2019 at the very earliest—let me stress: at the very earliest. This is complex and time-consuming work. I'm mindful of the inconvenience it has caused to members and the staff, but, as you know, the current program of building improvements is critical.


The patience and goodwill of members and their staff have been appreciated during the undertaking of these challenging but important works. I thank the House.

Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (15:16):  I'm faced today with a pretty monumental task, trying to condense five years of government failures on Medicare into a single 10-minute speech. I could very easily spend 10 minutes just on their disastrous six-year Medicare freeze, which has ripped billions of dollars out of Medicare and forced up the cost of health care for all Australians, a freeze that continues in part today. I could spend 10 minutes on the infamous 2014 budget, where they sought to run a wrecking ball through our universal health insurance scheme by making everyone pay more to see the doctor, or on their attempts to dismantle bulk-billing incentives or to privatise the Medicare payments system. And that's not even to mention their overblown claims about daily PBS listings or their savage ongoing cuts to hospitals, including their new retrospective cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars for public hospitals. I could definitely spend 10 minutes just talking about their five years of failure when it comes to Medicare-licensed MRI machines. Yes, they've finally acted on that now, after pretty much copying Labor's policy. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Minister, so thank you very much.


Alas, I don't actually have an hour; I have just 10 minutes, so I'll do my best. Labor, as everyone knows, is the party of Medicare. We invented it, and we will always protect it. It is the heart and soul of our healthcare system, and it is the envy of countries around the world. More than 20 million Australians access Medicare services every year. It is without doubt one of the most important programs that the Commonwealth government delivers. It's fundamental not just to our health system but to our economy and the very fabric of our modern society. It took two Labor governments more than two decades to shape and embed the Medicare that we know today.


Many Australians take Medicare for granted, and I wish they could take it for granted, because, in the Labor Party, we believe Australians should be able to rely on Medicare wherever they need it, without worry, without a second thought. But the Australian people cannot take Medicare for granted, because, every single time the conservatives get into power, they start to look at creative ways to dismantle it. Remember the $7 co-payment from just a few years ago? That was an unprecedented attack on the universality and accessibility of Medicare, effectively ending bulk-billing. It was a policy that would have forced up the cost of seeing a GP and the cost of hospital pathology and X-rays.


The minister likes to pretend that all things just started with him. You've got history in the party on the government benches in what you've done to Medicare, so you need, in your address, to actually address what you've done since 2014: cut after cut after cut. The co-payment that was in that budget wasn't just targeted at the wealthy or well off; it was everyone, including children and pensioners, the chronically ill and the poorest, most disadvantaged people in our nation. The Liberals wanted to use this co-payment as a price signal to deter going to the doctor. That is what they said was exactly what they wanted to do. Can you believe it? Their health policy at the time revolved around deterring people from actually seeking health care.


Of course, we know that the people who don't go to the doctor typically get sicker and sicker and end up costing the health system more. So the conservative prescription was to make people sicker and end up spending more on the health system in the long run—absolute genius. It was Labor, it was the parliament and it was the Australian people who ultimately stopped this government going down that road. As is so often the case, we helped save the government from themselves, but the plan revealed what was actually in their hearts. And when they couldn't get that plan through, they resorted to extending the freeze on Medicare rebates. Again, under intense pressure from Labor, doctors and the public, the minister announced a gradual thaw in the six-year freeze in May 2017, but he still hasn't actually lifted it all today. Many elements will still remain up until 2020. That is six years of slugging doctors and ultimately patients, simply because they won't want to access our health care.


I recently visited the Gold Coast and met with Professor John Corbett. After providing bulk-billed specialist EEG services for over 20 years, John Corbett has recently been forced to cease providing these services because of the government's ongoing freeze. That means higher costs for patients, and this sort of thing is happening all over the country. The rebate freeze has ripped $3 billion out of Medicare, and the Liberals are still banking savings from those cuts today. That's $3 billion ripped out of the pockets of patients.


A couple of months ago, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare finally laid bare the full extent of the health affordability crisis in Australia—a crisis inflicted by this government. The report showed that Australians are spending nearly $30 billion on out-of-pocket health expenses a year. That includes $3 billion a year on nonhospital Medicare-subsidised services. Half of all patients have incurred out-of-pocket costs to see a GP or a specialist or have blood tests, X-rays or other scans. Seventy per cent of patients seeing specialists made some out-of-pocket payment, and more than a million people spent $600 or more on medical gap fees. As a result of these costs, 1.3 million people are either delaying or skipping seeing a doctor or getting a test when they need it, putting their wellbeing and their lives at risk.


The AIHW report also exposed this minister's claims about bulk-billing. The data shows that only 66 per cent of patients are bulk-billed by their GP, a far cry from the 86 per cent figure the minister trots out on a daily basis. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association confirmed that the figures cited by the minister are in fact misleading. That's a nice way of saying they're a complete con job and totally meaningless. You cannot trust this minister. Malcolm Turnbull couldn't trust this minister. This minister lined up in this place to profess support for the former Prime Minister, all the way working with the member for Dickson to tear him down. And how well did that work out for the minister? Remind me—is the member for Dickson the Prime Minister? And how many votes did the minister actually get for the deputy job? I think it was 16. His colleagues can't trust him and neither can the Australian people.


It's the same when it comes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Every other day the minister tries to trumpet this government's record when it comes to listing new medicines. It's basically all that he talks about nowadays, probably because their achievements elsewhere in the health portfolio are so evidently lacking. But, when he does, he so conveniently forgets to mention that it was his government, in fact, that tried to increase the co-payment, which would have forced up the cost of PBS medicines by up to $5, including for vulnerable pensioners.


Despite all the government's cuts and failures, they still make the remarkable claim that Medicare has never been stronger and that their commitment is rock solid. But you can't judge them on what they say. You have to, of course, judge them on what they do, and their record is an appalling one. In Senate estimates earlier this year, officials said that the government's 2018 budget—and this is the government officials—was trying to bend the cost curve of Medicare. That's the government's fancy new way of saying 'a cut'. The government also wants to bend the Medicare cost curve until it actually breaks.


The government has also now broken an election promise—another one. In the election campaign they gave an unequivocal commitment that every element of Medicare services would continue to be delivered by the government. That is the commitment the then Prime Minister gave. They gave that commitment after they got the scare of their lives as we were fighting so hard against their privatisation agenda—the agenda to privatise the Medicare payments system, which is what you were doing. You are now trying to do it by stealth. We understand, as exposed by the member for Chifley, that 12 contract staff are set to administer Medicare payments for the first time in Hobart. It is the start, again, of the privatisation of Medicare—the privatisation of the Medicare payments system, bringing in contractors for the first time.


You bet we're going to absolutely highlight your hypocrisy. You're trying to do it absolutely again. This is a government that has fought and hated Medicare every single step of the way. They dream of an Americanised health care system where every man, woman and child should care for themselves, where people die or suffer for years because they cannot afford a doctor and cannot afford to go to a hospital. This is their vision for Medicare, a two tiered system—opposed all the way, every day, by Labor.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2018-10-25,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (15:26):  I am delighted to speak today because I've got a simple message: you cannot trust Labor to list medicines because you can't trust Labor to run the economy. How do we know this? Last time they were in government they blew the budget and the economy, and they stopped listing medicines. Seven medicines were deferred by the then assistant Treasurer, the now Leader of the Opposition—and the would-be next Labor Prime Minister—on the basis that, due to fiscal circumstances, the government would 'defer medicines until fiscal circumstances permit'.


Let me translate that budget paper to what it means for ordinary Australians. It meant that Australians were unable to get a medicine approved by the PBAC, approved by the medical experts, because of a decision by government to stop listing medicines for conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, endometriosis, schizophrenia and for women engaged with IVF. These were conditions for which the previous government, with the same people in charge as now—a Leader of the Opposition who was the assistant Treasurer, a Deputy Leader of the Opposition who was a health minister under that government and a member for Ballarat who had a certain history with regional issues and now wants to administer a $100 billion health budget—wanted to stop listing medicines. That is the reality.


You can't trust Labor to list your medicines because you can't trust them with the economy. Their track record proves this. They deliberately and consciously overrode the advice of the medical experts and hoped that it would never be realised that they were denying Australians vital medicines—after they had reached agreement on price with the companies in question. That is extraordinary and something which should never be repeated in Australia.


Let me turn to Medicare. I'm really proud of what we've done in our time, on our watch, in relation to new items being listed on the Medicare schedule. More than 200,000 Australian women a year will have access to 3D mammogram screening, there will be new MRI tests for prostate cancer and there will be better access for renal dialysis in remote and rural Australia, with a particular focus on Indigenous communities. What does that translate to? Over the current four-year period we go from $25 billion to $26 billion to $27 billion to $29 billion of investment in Medicare per year. Each year, it will travel by more than a billion dollars—a $4.8 billion increase at the last budget alone.


Listening to Labor you would think, 'Gosh, they must have had a higher figure.' No. When I looked at the figures for Labor in 2012-13, their last full year, it was a budget of $19.5 billion for Medicare. By the time this forward estimates period is over it will be $29 billion, almost a $10 billion increase in outlays on Medicare. Each year, every year, there is record investment and record increases. What we're seeing is each year, every year, a record investment in and record figures for Medicare.


What is very interesting is they did mention the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. I do actually happen to have a report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It's their 2016-17 review of health expenditure. There was something I hadn't quite realised, and I apologise for not having picked this up earlier. But I'm enjoying my research, as the member of Ballarat encouraged me to do, looking to the past. I was looking at some of Labor's figures. I have been encouraged by the member for Ballarat to look back at the recent history. What did the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare say in relation to table 3.3 on total health expenditure in 2012-13? It was $64 billion. That's a reasonable figure. The growth in that year, for Labor's last full-year budget, was minus 2.6 per cent. So they cut health in their final budget dramatically. In their last full year, it was minus 2.6 per cent—a $1.7 billion cut. That was their watch, their time and their responsibility. Of all of the topics they could have picked to talk about, to have a 2.6 per cent cut to the overall health budget in their last full year in government, is a classic Labor con. They talk about a belief in Medicare and, yet, the health budget in their last full year was down by $1.7 billion. It was down by 2.6 per cent. That's not our figures. It's from the Institute of Health and Welfare to which they referred themselves.


That brings me perfectly to the question of bulk-billing. The bulk-billing rates are up. Not only are they up; they are up significantly and dramatically. Where are they now? They were at 82.2 per cent under Labor. They're at 86.1 per cent now. What does that mean? It means, for every 100 visits to the general practitioner, 86 per cent of them are completely free to the patient. They pay no outgoings whatsoever. Every 100 visits, 86.1 per cent are free. For some reason the member for Ballarat seems to dispute these figures. I also did a little bit of history. I looked at the last time there was Labor commentary from a Labor minister using exactly the same methodology and exactly the same processes. That was on 13 May 2013. The then Minister for Health, the current member for Sydney, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, crowed about bulk-billing rates for GP services reaching a new record high of 82 per cent in the March quarter—the highest rate in Australia's history, at the time. And, yet, this is using exactly the same figures and exactly the same comparator. I haven't heard the member for Ballarat say that it was all a fraud when Labor was in government. It's the same figures and same methodology, unchanged through Medicare and unchanged through the assessments. So what we see is that we've gone from 82 per cent under Labor to 86 per cent under the coalition. That's the reality. Bulk-billing rates are up almost four per cent under this government.


What that means is that fewer patients are having to pay to go to the doctor. Fewer patients are having to pay. But, even for those who are, right now we're embarking on a reform that's never occurred in Australia. The Chief Medical Officer is bringing together the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, physicians, the AMA, GPs and others to ensure that we have a transparency model for out-of-pockets, which has never occurred in this country on this scale. That's something that we initiated. It's something that I requested the Chief Medical Officer to commence and it's something which will have, I believe, an important and critical impact and will be a historic step forward in transparency.


Then we go to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I couldn't be more delighted to discuss this topic. Bizarrely, Labor has started to question whether or not listings have actually occurred. I just want to take you to one of the more embarrassing interchanges last night, when Senator Watt tried to deal with this in estimates and Senator Dean Smith asked the departmental people exactly how many listings there were. He said, 'Did I hear, Ms Shakespeare,' the deputy secretary of the department, 'in your evidence, that there have been 1,900 new or amended listings that have taken place since 2013?' Ms Shakespeare said, 'I'll just check that number for you.' And I do apologise to the House; I haven't been completely correct—I had been saying 1,900. The evidence from Deputy Secretary Shakespeare was, '1,920 new and amended listings.' Dean Smith said, '1,920 new or amended listings have taken place since 2013; that's correct?' 'Yes, October 2013.' Dean Smith said: 'That's very specific—October 2013. So that could translate—and maths was never my strength—but that could translate to one per day?' Deputy Secretary Shakespeare from the department said, 'That's new and amended listings, averaging 31 per month, approximately one per day.' Even when they are trying to make it up, they can't get it right. So what we see is that, yesterday, we had new medicines which will help 4½ thousand patients with macular degeneration and with issues such as blood clots in the eyes. This is about giving 4½ thousand patients access to medicines that will transform their lives. In the end, we're transforming lives, we're investing in Medicare and we're giving Australians security for their health future.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:36):  Once again we heard the Minister for Health spending much of his time speaking about the listing of new medicines. The listing of new medicines is nothing new. It has been going on as part of government policy regardless of who is in government for decades. But the minister of course didn't talk about the delays of the listing of the new medicines that he refers to. More importantly, the minister spent his time speaking about the listing of new medicines in order to deflect from his government's failures and his personal failures in managing the health system of Australia—the failure to adequately fund our hospitals, with a $2.8 billion cut between 2019 and 2025; a $715 million cut over this three-year cycle; a failure to adequately fund our health professionals, and that refers directly to the six-year Medicare freeze, which is still going; and a failure to adequately fund medical professionals, such as doctors who do after-hours visits and, in particular, how that affects the residential aged-care facilities of this country. Indeed, the out-of-pocket costs to Australians wanting to see their doctor are increasing. Medicine scripts are not being filled or are being delayed, as are GP visits and doctors visits more broadly. For dentists—and I haven't got time to go into the details—the out-of-pocket costs reached $240 per person last year. In Australia's most disadvantaged communities, over one-quarter of people delay seeing or do not see their dentist. Today we heard of the government wanting to use labour hire staff in Medicare offices—again, a step towards privatising Medicare. 


Cuts to public health are intended to do two things: (1) to push people into private health insurance and (2) to push the responsibility onto the public health system of the state governments by sending people to the hospitals. But what we've seen happen with respect to both of those matters is that, with private health insurance, costs have increased to over a thousand dollars more per year per person. We're seeing people dropping their policies because of that. We've also seen the government now delay by one year the introduction of its gold, silver, bronze new private health insurance system because the government knows that proposal will increase the costs and reduce the services that people get from that cover, and it didn't want to introduce that policy just before the next federal election. It wouldn't have been a good look for them to do that. 


What we've also seen is elective surgery waiting lists blowing out. In particular in my state—and I understand it's happening in other states as well—we're seeing ambulance ramping. It's happening because people are avoiding going to their doctor and using the state system as an alternative, and it's happening because doctors will not go to residential aged-care facilities, and they've made that clear. Residents of those facilities are then being transferred to the hospitals. I have heard that from people that work directly in the system.


Nowhere are these cuts hurting more than in country Australia, where country people have fewer GPs, less choice, fewer doctors who bulk-bill and higher co-payment rates—not to mention the travel costs they incur. There are seven million people who live in country Australia. We know the chronic disease burden is much greater there and we know that, for them, getting the healthcare they need is much more difficult. Martin Laverty, the CEO of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, talks about the mental health crisis in country Australia—and, again, time does not allow me to talk about that in detail.


Only last night, the member for Macarthur and I, at a function held by the Lung Cancer Foundation, spoke with a person from Mackay, who, over the years, has had multiple surgeries. Her family has had to spend a million dollars for her healthcare needs. When she goes to her GP, each visit costs her about $100 because there is no bulk-billing provided—not to mention the travel costs this person incurs to go to Brisbane every time she needs to get the serious treatment she needs. That is typical of the hardship being faced by country people when it comes to the health services provided by this nation. The facts speak for themselves. Out-of-pocket costs for remote Australians went up to $60.20 in 2017 and, for very remote Australians, to $64.25. That's the government own report figures. For specialists, the out-of-pocket cost for remote Australians is now $81. The figures don't lie. This comes from the government's own Medicare report.


The fact is that a healthy nation is a productive nation. Health care comes at the top of what matters to people most, and the Morrison government, and this minister in particular, have failed to adequately manage Australia's healthcare system.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2018-10-25,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (15:41):  I love it when the opposition bring up these MPIs on health and make these outrageous claims. There are black-and-white budgetary figures that show that most of what has been said in the last two speeches from the other side is absolute rubbish. First of all, Medicare funding has gone up exponentially. There's another $4.8 billion going into Medicare over the next four years. Bulk-billing rates have gone from 82 per cent up to 86 per cent. That is not a reduction in Medicare billing. There is $10 billion more annually since 2013 going into Medicare billing than there was in the last final year of the ALP being in charge of health. It is unbelievable that they have the temerity to say that we've cut things in Medicare. We've established the Medicare guarantee legislation, which means that the first funds out of the budget go into Medicare funding and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme funding, and it's topped up by income tax. So there is a legislated guaranteed allocation of funds and appropriation for health first up.


On hospital funding, my goodness, there has been so much more money go into state and territory hospital funding than you could realistically expect. In fact, one would say we have taken over more responsibility than any other government since Federation. Hospital funding to all the states has increased by 70 per cent since 2013. And the new hospital agreement that has just been signed up to go from 2020-21 out to the 2024-25 budgetary year will increase funding by another $30.2 billion. The states must be so pleased that they have got all these extra funds. Just so you know that I can count: $13.3 billion from the federal government in 2013 and this year it's $22.7 billion. That is a massive increase.


I will go to some of the other pillars of our health system—for example, health insurance. We have reformed health insurance and we've changed what can be claimed on health insurance for people in regional and rural Australia. We've given a discount to young people in order to get more young people to take up private health insurance early. You will be able to claim a travel allowance under the new scheme if you are using your private health insurance.


Regarding one of the other pillars, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, we've just heard the most up-to-date figures. There are 1,900 new or amended listings. There is $10 billion a year going into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, of which $2.4 billion has been for new listings. Whether it is for asthma, cystic fibrosis or cancers like leukaemia, lymphoma, ovarian cancer or melanoma—you name it—there are new drugs there that will give hope to people who have been afflicted by serious cancers. Whether you have heart failure or hepatitis C, there are new, amazing drugs that are now on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that weren't there before. They have been listed because we have had the economic management in place to secure the funds for these vital services. We have grown the pie. We are cutting taxes. We have done so much to secure the essential services that everyone in Australia relies on.


We have given another 30 MRI licences. That's another bonus to the state hospitals, because some of these MRI licences will be in public hospitals. Medicare is subsidising cutting-edge radiology in state and territory public hospitals. There's another 20 MRI licences that can be tendered for. That's a 17 per cent increase. As for what we've done in mental health, there have been extra funds for mental health in the bush. Mr Laverty, the CEO of Royal Flying Doctor Service, came to us when I was in the health portfolio and said, 'We need more money for mental health.' And what did we get in the last budget? We got extra millions and millions of dollars for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. We've expanded end-to-end medical school training in regional Australia. The Medical Research Future Fund has kicked the funding into biomedical translation funds and for blue sky development of new research ideas. (Time expired)

"Freelander, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (15:46):  This government has a five-year record of failures on Medicare. I just don't have enough time to describe this government's failures on health. There was the My Health Record, the hugely increased gap payments for Medicare visits, the failure in imaging, the failure in pathology and the failure in providing services to rural and regional areas. It is an absolute tragedy. I'll just remind the minister that it was the Labor Party who introduced the bipartisan PBS in 1948, and it has been bipartisan since then. His false claims of new listings—particularly including generics, which we all know are not really new drugs—is just absurd.


Those opposite have been in power now for five whole years. I can't emphasise this point enough. In the Federation Chamber yesterday, I highlighted this lazy government's modus operandi, whereby whenever they are criticised for one of their failures they do their utmost to blame the issues of today on a long past Labor government. I suspect we'll see and hear more of this today in the MPI. We've known for some time that those opposite have given up on governing. This is made even more obvious whenever the current Prime Minister speaks. He is obsessed with us and our fight for fairness. Rather than positively contributing to policy debate, he and his entire team merely try to smear us when things don't go their own way. After the 2016 election, those opposite—despite emerging victorious—could be heard day in and day out, crying and whining like toddlers, about a campaign about health they couldn't understand.


During my allotted time, I think it will become quite apparent to all those who listen that the opposition is right to publicly fight for and defend the integrity of our beloved Medicare system, which was introduced by the Labor Party. It's apposite that we mention the name of Professor John Deeble, who died recently. He was one of the fathers of Medicare, with Dr Dick Scotton. All present here know that it was under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government that the Medicare freeze has been extended for over five years. It was their horrid 2014 budget which saw this freeze continue and, indeed, it continues on today. This has resulted in $3 billion being ripped out of Medicare. They also wanted a Medicare co-payment which would damage and prevent health care for the most disadvantaged.


I'm a doctor. I still do a volunteer clinic at my local hospital, and I have many friends who presently practise in their respective medical fields. So I would suggest that those opposite listen closely to what I'm saying. They might learn a thing or two.


Those opposite have sat on the treasury bench, and whilst they've done that we've seen gap costs for specialists absolutely skyrocket. For example, seeing a cardiologist now can cost patients almost $500 out of pocket. There's been a collapse of the public hospital outpatient system. And the policies of those opposite have resulted in Australian patients having to front higher and higher out-of-pocket expenses, including things like pregnancy ultrasounds, which I've seen patients avoid because they couldn't afford the gap payment. People are having to pay more for GP visits, blood tests, X-rays and other consultations. Australians are forgoing undertaking the medical treatment they require, because they cannot afford it.


This is Australia. It's not the United States. However, we are very rapidly developing a two-tiered system. I might mention IVF therapies. IVF therapies are now out of the range of most lower income Australians. This is a two-tiered system. Imaging is another field which sees patients paying higher and higher gap costs. There exists a massive divide between those in metropolitan areas and those who reside in rural and regional areas. Those who live in country towns and in the bush have had their access to high-quality health care restricted by costs, and medical treatment is simply becoming unobtainable for some people. Those opposite do not seem to grasp the importance of this.


In almost every aspect of health care you can look at, the Liberal and National government are failing. They come in here and they self-promote about listing medications, without really understanding the fact that we are now developing a two-tiered medical system in Australia. It is an evolving tragedy. If they do not understand it, they need to take a few lessons.


Yet another example of this government's failure is the blowout we've seen in waiting lists, in particular in the public hospital system. I hold the Prime Minister responsible for a cut of well over $3 million to my hospital in my electorate of Macarthur. Prime Minister, I'd like that funding back because it is desperately needed.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:51):  Deary me, it's Thursday afternoon, and we know what it's like. It's the end of a sitting period—two weeks. The call goes out from the whip's office or the Leader of the Opposition, saying, 'Can somebody come up with a subject that this opposition can talk about that's a matter of public interest?' They scratch around, looking under every surface, speaking to every shadow minister, who is visionless with any possible policy. They turn around to the shadow minister who has to deal with housing and say, 'Could we do a matter of public importance on housing?' Then someone says, 'Actually, we can't do that, because we're actually proposing a policy that would lead to 42,000 fewer homes being built and housing becoming a shortfall.' Then they scratch around and they say, 'What about if we take concern for senior Australians?' Then they go: 'No, actually we've got another problem. We're going around and raiding people's full tax refunds.' So they can't do that.


Eventually they get to the member for Ballarat, our favourite shadow minister, the shadow minister for health. She says: 'I know. I've got a brilliant idea. Let's do a matter of public importance on this government's five-year record on Medicare.' And they think it's genius, because they start by saying we should be afraid of the campaign they ran at the last election. We all know that at the last election the opposition lied. They lied big time. The opposition lied. And what we have—

Mr Champion:
  Deputy Speaker, the member for Goldstein used an unparliamentary term, and I'd ask him to withdraw it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Yes, I concur. I ask the member for Goldstein to withdraw.




Mr Zimmerman:
  On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the member for Goldstein was not referring to any individual member of parliament. He was referring to an organisation, and I don't think it's unparliamentary to use that language unless it's specifically directed against one of our parliamentary colleagues.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I take the member for North Sydney's point, but I ask the member for Goldstein to withdraw.




Mr TIM WILSON:
  I shall withdraw and say that the opposition perpetuated mistruths, misinformation, to mislead the Australian people—if that would be a satisfactory answer. That is at the heart of everything they're doing in this matter of public importance and everywhere else.


We know the record over the past five years of this government. The record is quite clear. We have record rates of Medicare bulk-billing. More Australians than ever before are accessing bulk-billing. If that's a record of failure to those opposite, I'd hate to see what a record of success is.


What this opposition has done is misled the Australian people at every point. We know there is more federal funding for public hospitals under this government—up from $13.3 billion to $22.7 billion nationwide. We know that the GP bulk-billing rate has gone up to 86.1 per cent, from 82.2 per cent in Labor's last year in government. Apparently, that was a success that they were prepared to own. But, when you increase it and deliver more for the Australian people, they declare it a failure somehow. They have the most appalling metrics. 


But as the previous speaker, the member for Macarthur, mentioned—and I know within his heart he means well. Unfortunately, he has to sit on the other side of this parliament and parrot the lines that were given to him by the member for Ballarat. He has to repeat the narrative, even if it is baseless. I know he wrestles with the fact that, under this government, there have been 1,900 medicines listed on the PBS, which equates to one new medicine every day, because I know in his heart he actually does care. 


But it isn't just about the past; it's also about the future, while we watch the comedy that rolls out in front of us. We have 30 new MRI licences to support more than—

  What this government is also doing is issuing new MRI licences so that people in communities can get the support and assistance that they need. They will benefit more than 400,000 patients.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (15:57):  I rise today in support of the matter of public importance before this House, and I do so because Labor, on this side, believes in investing in health care so that all Australians can access services of the best possible quality. In this matter of public importance, it is important to highlight the failures of the government. All we have to do is look back at the 2013 federal election, when the then leader, the member for Warringah, said publicly, on TV, a few nights before the election, 'There will be no cuts to health,' and he pledged to continue Labor's fifty-fifty hospital funding arrangement. But in his government's first budget—the very first budget—they tore up Labor's agreement, ripped it to shreds, not honouring the promise that he had made a few months earlier, and reverted to the previous, failed funding system—the failed formula that resulted in a $57 billion cut to hospitals across Australia. You cannot take $57 billion out and expect the hospital and healthcare system to operate in a way that provides good, proper health care to Australians. 


As we've heard from colleagues, Labor believe in a universal health system. We were the ones that invented it. We were the ones that brought it to parliament on two occasions. On the first occasion, it was ripped down by the Fraser government. When Hawke came back as Prime Minister, a Labor government reintroduced it—and again the now government opposed it. They voted against it that time as well. We know it's in the government's DNA. It's in their DNA to rip down Medicare if they can. We certainly know this. 


In the last federal election, if we hadn't spoken out, if we hadn't challenged them, they would have privatised Medicare. The only reason they haven't done it so far is that we on this side have defended it year after year after year. It's been defended by us because we believe in it. You don't believe in it. That's the difference. The reality is that, after the 2013 election, you tried to water it down by bringing in the co-payment for GPs. It didn't work, so you went through the back door. The back door was to put a freeze on doctor's payments. So you had already sown the seeds in 2014 for people not to trust you when it came to Medicare, for the Australian public not to trust this Liberal government. And nor should they, when they look at your track record.


We heard the member for Ballarat talk about the PBS. Those opposite wanted to bring in a co-payment where pensioners would be expected to pay $5 more for their medicines. Not only that; today we saw a report in the paper that said they actually are privatising parts of Medicare by bringing in contract workers to work in Medicare offices. It might not be a direct privatisation but it is creeping in, and they would love to creep it in all the way and privatise it. Their agenda has been to privatise Medicare from back in the Whitlam days, when they abolished it, and the Hawke days, when they opposed it. Every change that we bring in to better it, they oppose it.


There's much more I could go on with. For example, we know that the government ripped down the 50-50 hospital funding agreement—they tore up Labor's agreement—and made a further $10.4 billion in cuts to Medicare and other health programs, including the dental care program that Labor brought in. They ripped that up and threw it away immediately. They tried to bring in a $7 GP co-payment. It is in this government's DNA to water Medicare down, to bring it down, to do everything they can not to have a good, universal system.


We on this side of the chamber believe in a universal system. We believe that everyone should have access to good health care. We also believe that everyone can visit their GP if they're not feeling well and want tests. Those on that side of the chamber want us to present our credit card, not our Medicare card. It's quite obvious.


The reforms that this side of politics, the Labor Party, fought for throughout the seventies and eighties to ensure we have a system in place that looks after everyone—they are what we on this side are defending. That's what we defended in the 2016 election campaign, and we'll continue to do so in this place, because Australians deserve a good healthcare system.

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (16:02):  Before I commence my contribution to the discussion on this matter of public importance, can I acknowledge the contributions of the member for Lyne and the member for Macarthur in their private lives. I think it is important to recognise the dedication they have had to the health system, as specialists, and to all those people out there who are less fortunate, who are ill and need assistance. To the member for Macarthur, in particular: as a parent who's spent plenty of time with sick children in the rooms of a local paediatrician, I acknowledge that it's a very difficult role and I congratulate you on the work that you have done over your lifetime.


But we are here for a political debate, obviously, and unfortunately those opposite are looking to make mileage out of things that are untrue. We know that in the 2016 campaign, the 'Mediscare' campaign, they quite simply made it up. They thought they could go into an election campaign and take an opportunity to scare people who were vulnerable—seniors or others concerned about their health—on something that was completely untrue. In fact, my wife got a text message on her mobile, on the day of the election, saying that we were making massive changes to Medicare.


What's happened? Has that happened? It has not. In fact, we've legislated the Medicare Guarantee Act, so those opposite know there has been a piece of legislation put through this House which will guarantee Medicare—guarantee it! Yet still they sit on that side and say that there are cuts. They must be Edward Scissorhands over there—everything I hear is 'cut, cut, cut'. The reality is that that is just not the case. We have increased federal funding for public hospitals from $13.3 billion in 2013-14 to $22.7 billion in 2020-21. That's a 70 per cent increase.



A government member interjecting—




Mr PITT:
  I'll take that interjection—it's a reverse cut. I'm fairly confident that 70 per cent is bigger than 10 per cent, bigger than 20 per cent, bigger than 50 per cent. It's even bigger than 60 per cent. I know there are some over there who have education outside of being union organisers and all those types of things. They know that a 70 per cent increase is an increase. It's not a cut, it's not a decrease; it is an increase in funding. So we have guaranteed Medicare through the Medicare Guarantee Act and we have increased federal funding to the health system for public hospital services. But there are some challenges out there. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that I'm a passionate Queenslander and, unfortunately, Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Labor Premier of Queensland, is refusing to sign up to the national partnership agreement. Not only that but, in my electorate, in the area of Wide Bay—I have Hinkler and my next door neighbour is Wide Bay, but the area is generically known as Wide Bay—state Labor cut nearly $4 million in the last year alone, 2016-17 to 2017-18, and, at the time, our contribution increased by $25 million.


So we have a state government in Queensland that are cutting funding to health services. We are trying to increase funding to health services. Across the board, it is a 70 per cent increase, and yet we have a state Labor government that will not sign up to the national partnership agreement; they just will not. There are billions of dollars that can help our people, the people we represent, just like those opposite. I say to those opposite from state Labor in Queensland: get in there, convince Palaszczuk to sign the national partnership agreement. It is in all of our interests. We are ready to provide that funding. It is much better for us; it is much better for our constituents.


We hear all the noise around Medicare. I've got to say, in my electorate of Hinkler in 2012-13 our local GP bulk-billing data showed there were 768,076 individual services bulk-billed. In 2017-18, that is now 944,174. That is a substantial increase in the number of services provided to the people in my electorate. In fact, it is up by 167,098. So I say to those opposite: stop trying to make political mileage out of things that don't exist; stop making up numbers; stop suggesting to those vulnerable people who are concerned about health services that there are cuts when they are not. We know that the Labor state Premier in Queensland is not signing the agreement. We know that they've taken money out of my electorate and others across the state. On this side, we will continue to deliver. Those on the opposite side will not.

Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (16:07):  In my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, health care really matters. One in five of us is aged under 15 and one in five of us is aged over 65. The youngest and the oldest in our community have the biggest need for affordable health care, and this government has let them down. Vulnerable people in our community—the old and the young—have been let down by this government. This month, Mental Health Awareness Month, I stand here as a pharmacist who worked in the mental health in-patient units at my local hospital in Wyong for almost 10 years. The strain on patients, the strain on carers and the strain on families because of the lack of mental health services in regional and remote communities is growing. It's at crisis point.


On headspace Day, I heard from young people at the Gravity Youth Centre in Gorokan who spoke of their personal struggles to access care for themselves and for others due to the lack of local services. For young people in crisis in regional and remote Australia, help can't wait. One young person told me:


Why would I want to go and get help when too often the system fails?


This was from a young person in my community on headspace Day.


As a pharmacist, I would like to turn to the health minister's claims about PBS listings. The PBS was established by Labor. The principles that underpin the PBS are about universal access to medicines. Medicines matter. Access should be affordable and access should be fair. The minister should stop politicalising the PBS. The government tried to increase the cost of prescription medicines—



Mr Tim Wilson interjecting—




Ms McBRIDE:
  for all Australians, including children and pensioners. It was blocked by Labor.



Mr Tim Wilson interjecting—




Ms McBRIDE:
  The government's five-year record of failure on health care, particularly Medicare, began with the 2014 budget. The Liberals were elected in 2013 after promising—



Mr Tim Wilson interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein is warned!




Ms McBRIDE:
  no cuts to health and pledging to continue with Labor's 50-50 hospital funding agreement. Do you know what the Liberal state government tried to do in New South Wales? They tried to privatise five public hospitals, including mine, at Wyong, on the New South Wales Central Coast—an area of need. Luckily, the community stood up and fought, so those public hospitals are still in the community's hands. In their first budget, they tore up Labor's agreement and reverted to the previous failed funding formula, resulting in a $57 billion cut to hospitals—$57 billion!


I worked in public hospitals in New South Wales for almost 10 years. I have so much regard for the dedicated, trained, expert staff who work there, who are working under enormous strain because of these cuts at a state and federal level. It has to be changed. Health can't wait in regional and remote communities.


In their first budget, the government tore up that agreement. They then made a further $10.4 billion in cuts to Medicare and other health programs, including to preventive health care.


What else did they try? The infamous $7 GP co-payment. On the one hand, the minister is spruiking listing things on the PBS; on the other hand, the government tried to increase the co-payment for medicines. You can't have it both ways. The PBS is about affordable medicines. The PBS is about universal access to medicines. It's outrageous!


In 2014, the budget also included the Medicare rebate freeze—which was later expanded, and persists to this day—ripping $3 billion out of Medicare. It also began the process of inviting the private sector to take control of the Medicare payment system, a plan Labor campaigned strongly against in 2016. In the wake of the public backlash against the 2014 budget, the Liberals abandoned some, but not all, of these measures.


Since then, Australians have had to endure endless cuts to health and hospitals. They particularly affect vulnerable people, particularly the young and the old in our community, those living with mental health problems and those in crisis. This government's shameless cuts to health and hospitals, at the same time as spruiking the PBS listing of medicines, is outrageous. It has to stop.


The only answer is a change of government. We need a change in attitude to health care in Australia, and the only answer is a change in government at both state and federal level. I'm standing here today as a health worker and as someone who is a former mental health worker. For the people of my community, we need a change and we need it now.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-10-25,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:12):  From this debate, we can identify a commonality on the importance of mental health. But, at this point, when you reach the end of a sitting week and you have yet another health and hospital debate driven by the Labor Party, absolutely determined to pillory private health provision—recognising about half of the entire Australian health system—it's really, really disappointing that there can't be bipartisan agreement on private and public delivery.


Secondly, of course, the best way to identify whether a party that is in opposition would do an even better job than the government is to have a look at how the Labor Party is performing in states where they do control the hospital system. And it's not a pretty picture in Queensland. I'd like to devote a little bit of time to what is happening in the great state of Queensland, where we'd be hoping that ramping wouldn't be happening and that people with mental health issues would be getting the care they need, where it's actually in the hands of the Labor Party to fix it.


There's no news more recent than the news right today on page 4 of the Courier Mail that recognises some of the areas in Queensland with appalling waits, appalling ramping, loss of hospitals beds and an inability to even meet national benchmarks for hospital performance. I think that the remaining people in the gallery would concur; they would probably say that the performance of their local hospital system, wherever they live around this great nation, doesn't change much between Liberal and Labor. They don't notice any particular difference between one party that trumpets that they invented the PBS in 1948 and a party that trumpets that they invented Medicare in the mid-seventies. We're not disputing health history. We're not disputing the actions of Menzies and those who came before him. It's about whether the people in the chamber can get the help they need.


In Queensland, of course, we've got a health minister with a PhD—and that's promising! The PhD is in 'union renewal'. And if you look up the Wikipedia page for the state health minister of Queensland, there is just one simple sentence, and I think I could distil it onto a postage stamp. It says, 'Steven Miles ran campaigns to improve rights at work' as his grounds for being a health minister. And his entire pre-political career is a single line in Wikipedia saying that he used to run campaigns to save penalty rates—a job he did so well they gave it to the Fair Work Commission to do after he left! That is the sum total of the experience of the person running Queensland's health system. So it's no wonder that, when we look at the kids' hospital in Queensland, we see the Queensland state Labor government ripping funding out of the kids' hospital.


What do they do with the funding? You'd like to know how they'd run the health system. They tear down the name 'Lady Cilento' from the children's hospital, spending half a million dollars on rebranding, taking off this great woman's name from the hospital on the pretext having a female's name on the hospital might make you think it's private, and that causes confusion to ambulances. Only a kilometre away you've got the Princess Alexandra Hospital. How on earth is that causing confusion that the hospital may not be a public hospital? They spent half a million dollars on this ultimate insult to Lady Cilento. Nodding over there on the other side is the member for Macarthur, extension 2311, and the member for Dobell—I respect a pharmacist in this place; a doctor never wants to get a pharmacist offside, does he? The problem is they don't listen to either of you. They ignore you in making policy on the Labor side. If they listened, we'd be in a far better place. 


So we've got a Queenslander unable to run a hospital, unable to resist ripping a name off the kid's hospital, out of a political vendetta against a woman who fought for family planning, who recognised the role of vitamin D, but, no—she is not good enough for her name to stay on the hospital. It is a complete insult to rip her name off a hospital after she's been bipartisanly recognised as a great contributor. She is from Adelaide. She studied and trained in South Australia, but she is not good enough to have her name on the hospital. 


This is a consistent pattern. In MRI, they are happy to dribble out the MRI licences for political need. When Redcliffe hospital needs an MRI licence, all they have to do is fill out an application form. Is Labor going to do it? No way. Why? They would rather take the Labor commitment of an MRI than actually apply for it through the normal channels. You've got the Redcliffe state hospital held to ransom, saying, 'Vote Labor, or you'll get no MRI, because we as the state government aren't going to apply for it.' This is the annoying—no, disappointing—conduct of a state government that can't even run the system. 


I'm not going to talk to you about funding, because those on the other side do not even understand numbers. They don't understand that $23 billion is bigger than $13 billion. There's no point reading numbers to that side of parliament. What's true is that you can't run a great health system without a great economy that funds the needs of a growing ageing population and a more technologically based health system. You will always get, on this side, an absolute guarantee to increase health funding and to list drugs when they are approved and not when you feel like that. That's why people trust us in health care.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:20):  We are currently facing a housing crisis in this country. The cost of living is rising, and wages have not been this stagnant since the release of Jurassic Park in 1998. This government's solution is to tell low-income earners that, if they ever want to be able to afford housing, they need to stop eating smashed avocado. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017 outlines the government's perception that there is a need to create a system for the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. This scheme will be applied to public- and community-housing tenants who rely on income support or family assistance payments. This government is victimising individuals and families who are already struggling with this government's out-of-touch attacks on low-income earners.


I bet the people who are behind this bill have never gone to the letterbox and felt their stomach turn, never experienced the fear or the dread of opening that bill for fear that they won't be able to make the rent on time from having to pay something that lands unexpectedly. They've never had to make the choice between eating and paying rent. I use the word 'choice' because it is a human right that these people are attempting to take away from people who are affected by the outcomes of this bill. The basic dignity of being able to decide if you can pay your bills, buy groceries or replace school shoes is something that people who need income support value.


This bill would introduce the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. Under the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme, everyone who receives an income support payment or family tax benefit and lives in public or community housing could have their payment withheld by Centrelink and paid directly to their housing provider. What concerns me, though, is the ability for people to choose to manage their own already limited finances and make decisions that potentially impact their day-to-day lives. This bill will allow states, territories and community housing providers to withhold a portion of the tenants' income support payments and use those funds to directly pay the rent, utilities and other costs relating to the dwelling on behalf of those tenants. It will enable providers to do this with family tax benefits also.


This bill makes changes also to the administration of the National Rental Affordability Scheme by removing the ambiguity in relation to the calculation of below-market rents in a given year, providing flexibility in the way that maximum periods of vacancy are prescribed, and authorising the variation of conditions to allocation and the transfer of allocations to low-rent dwellings.


When we were last in government, we tried to introduce an automatic rent deduction scheme. The purpose of that, though, was to protect vulnerable individuals who were at risk of homelessness, and it was targeted in its scope. The government's scheme, on the other hand, according to the National Social Security Rights Network, proposes a very broad management scheme for social housing which ignores the very complex nature and causes of homelessness. I have incredibly serious concerns about how this government's plans will affect social-housing tenants.


I also have concerns about how this will affect victims of domestic violence. Seventy-two thousand women sought homelessness services in the 2016-17 financial year due to family violence. This alone should paint a worrying picture about the very real and tangible risk of further pushing women into housing stress and poverty.


Many people ask me: is housing a women's issue? The trends indicate that women are retiring more and more frequently into housing stress. Of women over 55 in the low- to middle-income group, more than 640,000 women, 15 per cent are already in housing stress and over half a million are likely to come into housing stress moving forward. For those women who are accessing homelessness services, those in the over-55 category have increased by four per cent, and women over 65 have increased by 11 per cent. This is four times the general housing population. Gendered housing analysis shows that there are two key areas: firstly, housing access needs of older women—affordable housing close to transport and/or medical services—and, secondly, women exiting houses where there is violence, who may leave with children.



Filthy Rich and Homeless, which aired on ABC on 14 August as part of a three-part series, told a story of too many Australians being pushed to the fringes and finding themselves in need of housing assistance. They followed the case of Selvi, a woman who lives in Kingswood in my electorate. She's a single mum to three small children. She found herself homeless after separating from her partner and has been living in temporary accommodation in transitional housing. Domestic violence is the lead cause of homelessness for women in Australia, and the reforms we have seen in my state of New South Wales do nothing whatsoever to address what we already know is happening In her part of the documentary, Selvi spoke of her struggle to find a permanent place for her family to call home and of approaching the private market and getting knockback after knockback because she's a single mum. Moreover, it's because affordability of private rentals is a pathetic one per cent. One per cent of private rental homes are affordable for those on low incomes. Selvi spoke of the agonising multi-year wait and multi-year waiting times for emergency housing from the Department of Housing.


We know the best place for children and young people is in a stable home. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has ignored those on the fringes. It's now been five years. They have turned their back on so many vulnerable people in Lindsay and in communities right across Australia, doing nothing other than demonising those who can't find a home. I can't imagine what it would be like to be in Selvi's position. I'm a mum and I have three kids my own. But raising three children in temporary accommodation must be absolutely heart-wrenching for her as a mum. She's doing the best she can and she's incredible. Her determination to get out of that situation is commended.


Those on the other side think that this isn't a real issue. They often make light of it. I can't remember—and I don't care to remember—which one of them it was, because it is a reflection on all of them over there. They are making light of the situation we find our country in. They are telling people they can afford a house if they get rich parents, stop eating smashed avocado or simply get a better job. How can this government look at people like Selvi and her three children and call that a solution? They were out of touch under Turnbull—who didn't even live in the Prime Minister's residence because his own home was too plumb—they were out of touch under Abbott and they are still out of touch now.


Between 2011 and 2016 the number of people experiencing homelessness in New South Wales increased by 37 per cent. In the city of Sydney, it increased by 48 per cent, which is far higher than the nationwide increase of 14 per cent. This increase is due to the lack of affordable housing. There are 60,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list in New South Wales and less than one per cent of private rentals are affordable for them. There's a need to identify specialist housing services to support women who are exiting violence. Housing organisations have expressed concerns about the arbitrary nature of the scheme that is proposed to be introduced by this bill depriving tenants of the flexibility to respond to upcoming financial obligations.


Labor's scheme would have exempted deductions for compensation made for damage caused by others, including as a result of domestic or family violence. The government's bill, as it stands, could mean that a tenant experiencing family or domestic violence could be liable for the damage caused by the perpetrator. We do not support a mandatory automatic rent deduction scheme for all public and social housing tenants; only when we are aiming to prevent homelessness should we apply automatic rent deductions. We will keep this Liberal government accountable, and we will ensure that we move amendments in the Senate to make sure that those who are most vulnerable, those individuals who are in arrears, are not at risk of being left on the street without a place to live—left behind by this government. We'll move an amendment to cap the maximum deduction to prevent the scheme from forcing people into housing distress and to make sure people have money to meet other needs and pay other bills as they arise.


Labor will move amendments to require that compulsory deductions can be made for rent and utilities and not property damage. This is to protect people from being unfairly held responsible for somebody else's actions in the case of domestic and family violence. Currently 86 per cent of public and social housing tenants use the rent deduction scheme. At the moment, some social housing tenants are also income support recipients and they can choose to have the Department of Human Services withhold a portion of their fortnightly payment and pay it directly to their housing provider to cover rent and some bills.


It's an absolute shame to see young people in this country being locked out of the housing market under this government. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government can't be trusted to deliver housing reform, let alone something like we need to see in this sector. The government needs to have a clear focus and focus their energy on clawing back the income that oversees investors are taking from our nation and the housing market.

The government's scheme, on the other hand, according to the National Social Security Rights Network, proposes a very broad management scheme for social housing which ignores the very complex nature and causes of homelessness. I have incredibly serious concerns about how this government's plans will affect social-housing tenants.


I also have concerns about how this will affect victims of domestic violence. Seventy-two thousand women sought homelessness services in the 2016-17 financial year due to family violence. This alone should paint a worrying picture about the very real and tangible risk of further pushing women into housing stress and poverty.


Many people ask me: is housing a women's issue? The trends indicate that women are retiring more and more frequently into housing stress. Of women over 55 in the low- to middle-income group, more than 640,000 women, 15 per cent are already in housing stress and over half a million are likely to come into housing stress moving forward. For those women who are accessing homelessness services, those in the over-55 category have increased by four per cent, and women over 65 have increased by 11 per cent. This is four times the general housing population. Gendered housing analysis shows that there are two key areas: firstly, housing access needs of older women—affordable housing close to transport and/or medical services—and, secondly, women exiting houses where there is violence, who may leave with children.



Filthy Rich and Homeless, which aired on ABC on 14 August as part of a three-part series, told a story of too many Australians being pushed to the fringes and finding themselves in need of housing assistance. They followed the case of Selvi, a woman who lives in Kingswood in my electorate. She's a single mum to three small children. She found herself homeless after separating from her partner and has been living in temporary accommodation in transitional housing. Domestic violence is the lead cause of homelessness for women in Australia, and the reforms we have seen in my state of New South Wales do nothing whatsoever to address what we already know is happening In her part of the documentary, Selvi spoke of her struggle to find a permanent place for her family to call home and of approaching the private market and getting knockback after knockback because she's a single mum. Moreover, it's because affordability of private rentals is a pathetic one per cent. One per cent of private rental homes are affordable for those on low incomes. Selvi spoke of the agonising multi-year wait and multi-year waiting times for emergency housing from the Department of Housing.


We know the best place for children and young people is in a stable home. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has ignored those on the fringes. It's now been five years. They have turned their back on so many vulnerable people in Lindsay and in communities right across Australia, doing nothing other than demonising those who can't find a home. I can't imagine what it would be like to be in Selvi's position. I'm a mum and I have three kids my own. But raising three children in temporary accommodation must be absolutely heart-wrenching for her as a mum. She's doing the best she can and she's incredible. Her determination to get out of that situation is commended.


Those on the other side think that this isn't a real issue. They often make light of it. I can't remember—and I don't care to remember—which one of them it was, because it is a reflection on all of them over there. They are making light of the situation we find our country in. They are telling people they can afford a house if they get rich parents, stop eating smashed avocado or simply get a better job. How can this government look at people like Selvi and her three children and call that a solution? They were out of touch under Turnbull—who didn't even live in the Prime Minister's residence because his own home was too plumb—they were out of touch under Abbott and they are still out of touch now.


Between 2011 and 2016 the number of people experiencing homelessness in New South Wales increased by 37 per cent. In the city of Sydney, it increased by 48 per cent, which is far higher than the nationwide increase of 14 per cent. This increase is due to the lack of affordable housing. There are 60,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list in New South Wales and less than one per cent of private rentals are affordable for them. There's a need to identify specialist housing services to support women who are exiting violence. Housing organisations have expressed concerns about the arbitrary nature of the scheme that is proposed to be introduced by this bill depriving tenants of the flexibility to respond to upcoming financial obligations.


Labor's scheme would have exempted deductions for compensation made for damage caused by others, including as a result of domestic or family violence. The government's bill, as it stands, could mean that a tenant experiencing family or domestic violence could be liable for the damage caused by the perpetrator. We do not support a mandatory automatic rent deduction scheme for all public and social housing tenants; only when we are aiming to prevent homelessness should we apply automatic rent deductions. We will keep this Liberal government accountable, and we will ensure that we move amendments in the Senate to make sure that those who are most vulnerable, those individuals who are in arrears, are not at risk of being left on the street without a place to live—left behind by this government. We'll move an amendment to cap the maximum deduction to prevent the scheme from forcing people into housing distress and to make sure people have money to meet other needs and pay other bills as they arise.


Labor will move amendments to require that compulsory deductions can be made for rent and utilities and not property damage. This is to protect people from being unfairly held responsible for somebody else's actions in the case of domestic and family violence. Currently 86 per cent of public and social housing tenants use the rent deduction scheme. At the moment, some social housing tenants are also income support recipients and they can choose to have the Department of Human Services withhold a portion of their fortnightly payment and pay it directly to their housing provider to cover rent and some bills.


It's an absolute shame to see young people in this country being locked out of the housing market under this government. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government can't be trusted to deliver housing reform, let alone something like we need to see in this sector. The government needs to have a clear focus and focus their energy on clawing back the income that oversees investors are taking from our nation and the housing market.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:30):  This year we are celebrating 30 years of this new Parliament House and the last sittings in what was always intended to be the provisional Parliament House, which we now know as Old Parliament House. So it is fitting that we recognise the service, now more than 30 years, of the only member of this parliament who also served in the old Parliament House, the Hon. Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari. Warren was first elected as the member for the Northern Territory—the Territory only had one seat back then—in 1983. In his first speech, Warren said he would be 'strident' in his efforts to represent the interests of all Territorians—and he has fulfilled his promise.


In his first speech, Warren thanked his partner Elizabeth for her support. Elizabeth had in fact given birth to their first child, Frances, during that election campaign. Warren and Elizabeth now have four children, Frankie, Tom, Tess and Jack. Warren's family knows better than most people the sacrifices that he and they have made with him representing the Northern Territory and now the seat of Lingiari for 30 years.


Warren also said in his first speech that he would work for the formal recognition of Aboriginal Australians and for compensation for their lands stolen and the disruptions to their society and culture. He has worked tirelessly in this place and in his own electorate to ensure that First Nations people are better represented and that the broad disadvantage experienced by First Nations people around the country is confronted and improved. He has worked to ensure that all governments in this place do not forget that we still have a long way to go in this area.


Warren's parliamentary record demonstrates his breadth of interests, his hard work in many policy areas, and his achievements as a parliamentary secretary and minister in a range of portfolios—Transport and Communications; Employment, Education and Training; Environment, Sport and Territories; Defence Science and Personnel;    Indigenous Health and Rural and Regional Health; and Veterans Affairs, including the Centenary of Anzac. Warren did much of the planning for that great representation of our deep thanks for the sacrifices of those Australians in the First World War. 


Warren's parliamentary record is a great one, but it's his record as a champion for the Territory and the Northern Territory's people that I want to emphasise here. Warren represents Lingiari, a huge electorate—almost twice the size of New South Wales. The sheer size of this electorate means that it is not like representing constituents in any seat, really, except for save a couple. The travel and commitment this representation takes is admirable.


As a person, Waz is passionate. He's a fierce advocate for those who don't have a voice and a good mate to so many, including myself. He's also a person of great empathy. He understands that people are at the centre of everything we do here. This is so important for the design of meaningful policies and it's why Warren has made such great contributions throughout his career.


Throughout his 30 years of parliamentary service, Warren has given voice to Australians in the most remote parts of our nation on so many issues and given voice to the oldest continuous culture on earth and to some of the most disadvantaged people in our country. Within the Parliament, Waz has been a team player, putting the interests of his friends and colleagues before himself. In this way, he has always embodied the Labor ideals of equity and fairness. Warren has been a mentor to me and has taught me a great deal about serving the people of Darwin and Palmerston, learning about their needs and helping them. We now work together to deliver for Palmerston—some suburbs of which have been added to Warren's electorate—and together we work for the Northern Territory.


There's still plenty that Warren is working on and is so passionate about, including the Indigenous health plan implementation, northern regional development and veterans' affairs. That's always been important to him as the son of a World War II veteran. It's a privilege for me to recognise Warren's 30 years of service to the electorate of Lingiari, the Northern Territory and also our nation. In closing, I just want to say thank you to the member for Lingiari. Thank you, Wazza.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (10:00):  Youth Off The Streets does outstanding work in my local community, and right around the country, helping vulnerable young people turn their lives around. The young people that Father Chris Riley's charity helps have to overcome tremendous challenges, whether it be personal trauma or neglect or physical, psychological and emotional abuse the likes of which many in this place couldn't fathom. I want to acknowledge the work in my community, in Logan City, of Beny Bol and his team, a team that I spend a lot of time with and I have a lot of regard for.


And given the charity's outstanding contribution, a funding announcement from the education minister on Tuesday afternoon should have been a cause for celebration. But what the minister's media release failed to mention was that it was his own government that had jeopardised the charity's future in the first place. As the Daily Telegraph had exposed that morning, the Liberals wanted to slash the charity's funding by $1.3 million a year. And worse than that, if you can believe it, they ordered the charity to repay $630,000 it had already received, money that had already been provisioned towards helping disadvantaged kids, including, importantly in our area, for a new school.


Now this has to be, in a competitive field, one of the most despicable acts of this arrogant and out-of-touch government, even by its own abysmal standards. Of course we welcome the government's backflip, but those opposite shouldn't pretend it was anything but that: a humiliating backflip in the face of overwhelming community outrage. They didn't back down because what they had announced and proposed was wrong. They backed down because it was on the front of the Daily Telegraph.


With a number of my colleagues from the Labor side, I joined Father Riley and some of his school principals and his team from Youth Off The Streets, and we met with the shadow education minister, the member for Sydney. What really came through in that meeting was the devastating impact that the cuts proposed by the Liberal Party would have on the important work that Youth Off The Streets does. And I think any objective assessment of that work and the impact of that cut is that it would have been devastating for that charity and especially, and most importantly, for the vulnerable people that Youth Off The Streets helps.


The cruel cut and the badly motivated backflip that followed really do go to the heart of the twisted priorities of this out-of-touch government. If you're at the top end of town, you get showered with largesse, you get handed generous tax breaks. But if you're a charity trying to help the most vulnerable kids in our community, you get a kick in the guts. That's the difference between this side and that side: we will always support vulnerable people right around the country.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (10:31):  This month I was privileged to attend the annual No. 22 Squadron dinner that's held in honour of Flight Lieutenant William (Bill) Newton VC at the Richmond RAAF base. This is a night that brings together many of the current serving members and retired members of No. 22 Squadron to remember the bravery of Bill Newton, who went missing in action in March 1943, having completed 52 operational sorties in New Guinea in World War II. Bill's story as an airman—his passion for flying and his skill—is worth hearing. The presence of his family members at the dinner, including young grand-nephew Will, who shares his name and birthday, makes it a very special event. It was a wonderful night, and I congratulate all those involved in making it happen and thank New South Wales Governor, David Hurley, for his thoughtful and powerful speech. What I walk away with from these evenings is the reinforcement that the people who choose to serve this country in the military have particular qualities that set them apart. Every conversation I have with members of the Defence Force and veterans reinforces for me that the choices they make to serve are ones that make them different from civilians and that they need a special set of supports from this parliament.


While we rightly focus on the needs of veterans—their medical and mental welfare needs as well as the more practical part of transitioning to the civilian world—we also need to focus on their families more. I find myself often in conversation with partners of serving and former defence members, who share with me some of the extra challenges of having a partner who will move every couple of years into a new role in a new town in a new state. This is why I believe it's right that we develop a military covenant to make sure our serving men and women and their families know how much we value their service and remain committed to looking after them. Labor has made a commitment to do this, and I was pleased to hear the Minister for Defence say that he's also exploring the idea. I do hope that we can work collaboratively on this so that it's an issue that binds rather than divides us.


We are of course in awe of the determination, strength and skill that's currently on display in the Invictus Games. I've read many of the interviews with athletes, and the recognition of the transformational effect from their involvement in these games, after being injured or nearly killed in an incident, is clear. So many of the athletes have talked about having a purpose, having a reason to get moving, having a challenge—all the things we know can help make life worth the effort it must be in coming to terms with a changed physical ability.


In the Blue Mountains, we are particularly proud of Springwood resident Craig McGrath, who won Australia's first gold medal of the games, in the sailing, and also a silver medal in a driving event not officially part of the games, but he was pretty pleased to be presented with his medal by Meghan, who he said was very nice. Like so many competitors, Craig has enjoyed the experience of the Invictus Games and his close encounter with the royals. Craig was serving in Afghanistan in 2012 when he and members of his unit walked into a booby trapped mud wall compound. Five metres from where the bomb exploded, he sustained shrapnel wounds to his ankle, hip, knee and shoulder, a broken leg and burst eardrums. I met Craig in his home a few weeks before the games. We talked about his work in Afghanistan; his recovery; the impact on his family, including on his young sons, of both his service and his accident; and the decisions and choices that he's had to make. I'm absolutely thrilled for his success. We don't have a lot of champion sailors in the Blue Mountains, but the large group of Blue Mountains family and friends cheering him on were very proud of him, and we all know how proud we are of his achievements.


Our willingness to invest to support people like Craig and others who have come to me to talk about transitioning shows me that we have work to do and we must continue doing it. That's why Labor has announced a veterans employment program. If we're elected, this program will ensure that veterans' skills are not lost in translation. It will encourage businesses to get the benefits of employing these highly valuable people. There are four key elements to our program.


The first is about businesses, providing training grants of up to $5,000 to address any specific short-term skills gaps that a potential employee may have which might be the barrier to their employment. I have talked to veterans who have missed out on interviews, and often this is about businesses simply saying, 'Look, you've got nearly everything, but there's one bit missing.' These grants will help address some of those issues.


The second part of it is to better inform employers about the skill set that former ADF members have. I think the five days I spent at Amberley on the base last year showed me the extraordinary breadth of skills, be they organisational, management or specific trade skills, that members of the ADF accrue in their very many roles over the course of their time with the ADF. We will be providing $30 million to an industry advisory committee to fund and develop a national campaign to make sure that this extraordinary skill set is better understood.


The third thing is to establish an employment and transition service for anyone transitioning out of Defence. This will provide greater individualised and tailored support to veterans over a longer period of time. It will work with individual veterans to identify career goals, audit the skills they have acquired over the course of their career and make sure that they obtain civilian recognition for those skills. The service will also work with veterans to identify other potential barriers to employment—things like health, housing and community support that they may need to make sure that they can find fulfilling employment. I think we all know that a first job doesn't always work out, so we think that this service should be available to veterans so they can return to it over a five-year period after they have left the ADF, just in case they need some extra advice or guidance as they go on that journey into the civilian world. We also want to see the qualifying period for extra education and training assistance brought down from the current requirement of 12 years to five years, and the top level of assistance down from 18 years to 15 years. Given our understanding that, on average, members serve for 7½ years, the change would mean the majority of those who leave the ADF would be able to access the assistance.


The fourth part of our employment and transition plan is to work with the states and territories and peak industry bodies to identify opportunities for greater automatic recognition of skills that veterans have. We think these things will help the transition which is so important to take people from the career that they have so successfully had in the Defence Force to being successful in a civilian world.


When an individual serves, in many ways their families are serving too. As I have said, they have to pack up and move frequently. When Defence Force personnel move into civilian life, their families are also faced with a very big change. Again, this is an area where we need to work more closely with families so that their voices are heard in this process.


I think the other area that has come up for me time and time again is recognition of the things we need to do to support the mental health of serving Defence personnel as they leave the service. The Senate inquiry into veteran suicide showed us many things. The Mental Health Commission report into suicide and self-harm and the ANAO report provided really clear recommendations on how we can do better. I welcome the government's commitment to implementing many of the recommendations, but I note we're also waiting for the Productivity Commission's review. While it is important to wait for those final recommendations, I would urge the government not to stall on these things. There are things the government could do immediately such as lifting the Medicare rebate freeze, because right now that's impacting on the day-to-day medical needs of people.


Finally, I'd like to speak about Remembrance Day on 11 November. This year we mark the centenary of armistice and, like many others, I'll be marking this one in one of the RSL-organised ceremonies in my electorate of Macquarie. I'd like to encourage the community to take part and share a minute's silence to recognise the guns falling silent on the Western Front after more than four years of continuous warfare. We'll remember those in that war who sacrificed so much—in my case, both my grandfathers served on the Western Front, and they made it home but not without their scars. We'll remember those who served in World War I and subsequent conflicts and have paid that ultimate price. It's important that we do take the time to remember and reflect, and as we do we should thank our ex-service organisations for giving us the opportunity to do that at these commemorative services.


I thank all current serving men and women of the Defence Force and their families for what they do in serving our nation.

Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (10:41):  It's pleasing to be able to speak for a second year running on the annual ministerial statement on veterans and their families. Representing Brisbane in the federal parliament, with the Enoggera Barracks on the edge of that electorate means I have the absolute privilege of spending a lot of time with serving Defence personnel as well as the many veterans across our community in Brisbane. As I noted last year when the inaugural statement was made, these ministerial statements are opportunities for governments to measure their efforts, their progress and their progress in policy and administration. They're intended, I think, quite deliberately to be a frank, warts-and-all type of assessment of how we're doing here in Australia—the good and the bad—and they should act as a yardstick over time for how government's performance is measured and viewed.


I see this deliberate approach by governments in more and more areas of critical policy. When these critical and complex issues are finally canvassed in the community, when problems are finally brought out from under the carpet, enter the national conversation and get the recognition that important issues deserve, it naturally follows that governments provide more resources, more focus, more efforts and more funding. But it's about more than that. These ministerial statements and the work behind them are about making a really conscious effort to try new things to succeed and to fail fast if some attempts, experiments or initiatives are indeed going to fail, but, when things work, to quickly ramp up on those successes. Further, these ministerial statements can accept and respond to the fact that all people are unique. Their needs and their experiences will be different. There's often no magic bullet or any one-size-fits-all policy. In other words, these annual ministerial statements are a very deliberate commitment to a process that will guide us to keep doing better.


In this year's annual ministerial statement, delivered yesterday, the minister mentioned a number of priorities where the government is addressing some serious DVA service problems, overhauling the systems of the DVA and getting them into the digital age—new online capabilities and services—leading to faster claims processing and also moving to that single point of telephone contact, 1800 VETERAN. The minister also mentioned continuing good work in areas like employment initiatives and transition-to-work programs. The minister also mentioned a number of independent experts and reviewers looking in their work at different ways to make the next round of big improvement. This includes work by the Productivity Commission into rehabilitation and compensation systems, studies into advocacy and support systems, and more.


There were a number of new initiatives and trials that were outlined in this year's statement, and a few of them in particular caught my eye and I thought would be particularly relevant given some of the stories and experiences that I hear around my electorate of Brisbane when I talk to serving personnel and veterans. The ones that caught my eye included a new annual comprehensive health assessment by a GP for all separating ADF members; a new family support initiative, so providing extra child care and counselling services for the children and families of veterans who have undertaken warlike service; a new payment to support financially vulnerable veterans and their families while they await decisions on a claim they've made for mental health conditions, and early access to rehabilitation services; a new 24/7 counselling service for veterans and their families called Open Arms, which was launched by the minister recently; and, interestingly I thought, a trial using assistance dogs, which will be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. Those were some really interesting new initiatives and trials that had been announced and brought together in this year's ministerial annual statement. There were many others listed in the statement, but I won't repeat them all now.


On a related topic, the minister also mentioned in the statement the Invictus Games, currently underway in Sydney. It would be remiss of me not to mention a local Brisbane hero at the Invictus Games, Emma Kadziolka, who on Monday won a gold medal and a silver medal for indoor rowing. One for endurance and one for sprint. Emma was actually the co-captain of the Australian Invictus Games team last year, and so it seems Emma is really continuing to go from strength to strength this year. Congratulations to Emma, she's making her city and her country so very proud. We know that 'invictus' means 'unconquered', and all of our athletes, I believe, at the Invictus Games truly embody that spirit.


On another related topic, I want to mention how pleased I was just a few weeks ago to take the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, to a special fundraising lunch in Brisbane being run by a local community group called 42 for 42. The name 42 for 42 comes about because of their mission, which is to commemorate the 41 Australian service personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, and the 42nd represents all of those who have come back, and those who have lost their lives to mental health and suicide. They have a very special mission; they are hoping to build a memorial in Brisbane in an incredibly iconic location, in a beautiful memorial garden right next to the Suncorp Stadium. The lunch they held in Brisbane the other week was to raise awareness of their quest, but also to raise much-needed funds. It was so pleasing to see so much of the local community come together to support their fundraising and awareness efforts, including the Former Origin Greats, Kev Walters and all sorts of other people from around the community, including Rupert McCall, a poet who made a fantastic and emotional contribution to the lunch.


In conclusion, to all ADF service personnel, to all our veterans, to their children, to their families in Brisbane and right around the nation: thank you for your service and for your sacrifices. Australians should be proud of the many ways we do serve and care for our veterans and their families, but we strive, as we should, to do more and to do better. This year's annual ministerial statement on veterans and their families has been a useful marker for our progress, and it also serves as a road map and a guide for our next steps. I'm determined, as I'm sure is every member of this parliament, that we do not fail. We owe it to the many men and women who've served our country, and to their families. Thank you.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (10:48):  Townsville is a very proud garrison city, and as the elected representative for our community, it gives me great pride to stand here and speak to the veterans ministerial statement. I believe the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said it best when he said, 'As a nation, we are better at honouring the memory of our dead than looking after the living.' These words are echoingly true when it comes to our Australian veterans. We can never fully repay our debt to our veterans, but we can give them our long-term gratitude, respect and support.


For many veterans, the freedoms that we experience in our nation are important enough for them to endure long separations from their families, miss the births of their children, freeze in subzero conditions, bake in the deserts and lose limbs. Far too often, sadly, lives were lost. Military spouses have had to endure career interruptions, frequent changes of address and a disproportionate share of parental responsibilities. The children often have had to deal with changes in schools, separation from friends and, hardest of all, the uncertainty of whether their mum or dad would return from their tour. 


Warriors need advocates in parliament, and I am passionately one of the strongest advocates for veterans in this place. We are here to serve veterans, their families and our communities. Veterans need each other, but, more importantly, our country needs our veterans. Those who defend us must be supported. Whether their service was in Afghanistan or Vietnam, we need to serve veterans as well as they serve us. Veterans don't ask for much. They do not want to be a special class, but benefits are a mere drop in the bucket compared to the financial and human cost of war. While not all veterans see war, all who have served in the military have expressed a willingness to fight if called to do so.


Homelessness is another issue that affects veterans disproportionately. Too often today's tattered citizen on the street was yesterday's toast of the town in a crisp uniform, supporting a row of shiny medals. This is hardly the thanks of a grateful nation. We can do better and we must do better. We need to acknowledge their work, their sacrifice and its significance. Can any CEO or chairman of a bank truly claim to have more responsibility than a 21-year-old corporal walking on patrol in Afghanistan?


Veterans have given us freedom and security. It is impossible to put a price on freedom and security, but it is necessary to ensure that our support is readily available when needed. We must remember them and we must appreciate them, and that is partly what the annual statement on veterans provides. Every year the government provides a statement or an update in relation to our veterans. In preparing for my speech today I looked back on the speech I made last year regarding the veterans statement. It saddened me to see that in a year the issues are still pretty much the same: unemployment is still incredibly high in the veteran community; suicide is still occurring; and families are still suffering distress. These are not issues that will be rectified overnight, but the annual veterans statement holds the government accountable and responsible to those who have served this country. It's a chance for us to look back and reflect on the last year and genuinely ask: have we in this place done enough? 


I have supported all of the government's veterans policies where the policies do make a positive difference, but I do not believe that their commitments go far enough to show our veterans that we are grateful for their sacrifice and service to this nation. However, I do believe that Labor's announcement to establish Australia's first military covenant does go further than just an annual statement. The annual statement is needed, but a legislated military covenant is critical. The military covenant will ensure that our serving men and women know, in no uncertain terms, that we value their service and remain committed to looking after them. A commitment to a military covenant builds on previous announcements that Labor have made, such as our $121 million veterans employment package. 


Finding and maintaining employment after serving is very important to veterans for many reasons. It's not just about financial security. The dignity of work provides structure, community and a sense of purpose and belonging. It is a reason to get out of bed each day, and that is something that many ex-Defence personnel say they miss when they leave the ADF. Many veterans do not immediately find a meaningful career post their time with the ADF. These are highly skilled and desirable employees who would make a valuable addition to any workplace, but the statistics show us that these skills are not necessarily acknowledged or valued by civil society because many of these skills are lost in translation.


If we want veterans to know that we value the sacrifice that they have made then we must do better. We must ensure that veterans are best positioned to move into employment post service and that businesses understand the many benefits of employing a veteran. The government has developed the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program, and I support this program. We can absolutely do better in this space. Labor's veterans employment program does just that. Labor is the party of jobs and employment, because it's in our DNA. We understand the employment issues that veterans face and, more importantly, we are committed to addressing these issues.


There are roadblocks because veterans' skills are lost in translation from military life to civilian life, roadblocks because veterans are discounted before reaching the interview stage because they don't meet the tick-and-flick process and roadblocks because employers ultimately fail to recognise the many skills that our ADF members have.


It is for this reason that Labor has announced a veterans employment program. This program will ensure that veteran skills are not lost in translation and will encourage businesses to benefit from employing these highly valuable young men and women. There are four key elements to our program. The first targets businesses by providing a $5,000 grant to address specific short-term skills gaps which may otherwise act as a barrier to the veteran's suitability. I have heard from veterans who have applied for hundreds of jobs and in some cases have never gotten an interview. The process is demoralising and doesn't value the many skills and experiences of our ADF members. While there could be many reasons for this, one reason could be that the veteran is simply one unit shy of a qualification or fails to meet the two years previous experience criteria but would otherwise be suitable. These grants will go a long way to ensuring that these gaps can be addressed and that there will be an incentive to remove those barriers and roadblocks.


In addition we have announced that we will provide $30 million to an industry advisory committee to fund the development of a national campaign which will highlight the many skills of former ADF members to employers. We will also establish an employment and transition service for transitioning members, which will provide greater individualised and tailored support to veterans over a longer period of time. This service will also work with veterans to identify other potential barriers to employment, such as housing, health and community support, that they may need in order to ensure they can also find fulfilling employment.


From speaking with veterans, I know that many leave with very clear goals in mind about what work they want to do after they leave the ADF, but sadly it doesn't always work out. Labor is promising that this service would remain available to veterans to return to over a five-year period after they have left the ADF, just in case advice, services or support are needed. We will bring the qualifying period for extra education and training assistance down from the current 12 years to five years, and the top level of assistance down from 18 years to 15 years. On average, members serve for 7.5 years. This change would mean that the majority of those who leave the ADF would be to access the assistance, and that is a very crucial point. In addition, Labor's plan increases the amount of funding available to individuals and allows greater flexibility in the way transitioning members can use this funding, such as in obtaining multiple qualifications that are required for employment.


In noting the importance of the service of our veterans, we must also acknowledge the family sacrifices and commitment. Serving families are routinely faced with the choice of packing up their lives and moving or spending significant time apart a loved one. Post-service lives are changed again as individuals and their loved ones reorientate their lives. As the mental health commissioner has identified, this strategy will give families a voice and provide a national blueprint to include engagement of the departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence with military families. As the Centenary of Anzac draws to a close it is important that we consider how we keep alive the memories of men and women who have served and who have died. While we no longer have the benefit of any of our World War I diggers with us, it is crucial that we remember their experiences. I believe that Labor's commitments to our veterans and their families show a clear plan and reflect the gratefulness and thanks we have for our returning soldiers. I conclude by congratulating the nine athletes from Townsville that are competing in the Invictus Games. They have won numerous awards.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:59):  I acknowledge the contribution by the member for Herbert, who has a close association with the large serving and veteran community, and say how well she represents their interests here in this place. I also acknowledge the contributions made during speeches yesterday by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon Darren Chester, the member for Gippsland, and the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, for demonstrating very clearly to those who were listening or may have been present in chamber that there is strong bipartisan support for veterans and our serving personnel.


I, like them, want to start by thanking those men and women who wear a uniform in service to our country, both those who are veterans and have served previously and those who are currently serving. And like the member for Herbert, who spoke in her final comments about competitors in the Invictus Games, I think all of Australia is inspired by what they're seeing at the Invictus Games, seeing people who have been, in some way, damaged by their service, wounded. They have found an expression, through their performances and through their love for one another at these games, of how we should view ourselves in working with our veterans' communities.


On 11 November next month, we will see the 100th anniversary of the Armistice. That will complete, in many ways, four years of commemoration activity, both here in Australia and overseas. Importantly, I think it has provided the opportunity for all Australians to acknowledge and understand the contribution, the sacrifice and the loss that happened as a result of so many Australians serving, firstly, and then losing their lives in the First World War. It has reminded us to think about all of those who have worn a uniform for us and made the ultimate sacrifice. But, as we've heard, it's not only those who make the ultimate sacrifice that we should be concerned about; it's the many tens of thousands of people who have served our country and come home from conflict with no apparent physical harm but, over time, developed what might be seen as issues to do with mental health as a result of their service. We are now alive to those things in a way which wasn't the case previously. After the First World War and even the Second World War, the standard of services available to our serving personnel once they'd come home were not what they are today. Thankfully, we have shifted in our mindset. We understand the issues people now confront and have confronted when they return from service and we are doing our very best to work with them and ensure their needs are properly met.


I want to commend the contribution yesterday of the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, and for her outlining of the initiatives she has developed in partnership with the Labor team around addressing issues to do with current veterans. I applaud them. I'm not going to articulate them again—the member for Herbert went through them—but I just do want to make a point that I'm really pleased that we're accepting the transition space is where we've got to do a lot of work. We've got to really understand also that there are some people who have transitioned or will transition into the future, who, when they're leaving the uniformed life behind, don't want anything to do with those uniforms or the organisations to which they belong and so they escape visibility and they escape connection, and it's those people that I am particularly concerned about. I know it's difficult because you can't interfere in people's choices but we've got to have some way that we can maintain a connection with all of the people who serve so that if and when—and we know this is happening regularly—their comes a time when their service impacts on their health, whether through some physical disability or mental health issue, they are able to get access to the services they need to address those issues. It's particularly important for those people with mental health issues. 


I've expressed it before in this place that those of us who haven't worn a uniform in conflict cannot know what it's like. We can hear from people, we can talk to people, but we haven't the lived experience. We've had almost constant conflict in the Middle East for a damn long time, and we've had serving personnel, particularly Special Forces soldiers, on the front line on a continuing basis, effectively, doing six, seven, eight, nine and 10 tours of duty. The compounding impacts of those tours of duty over time are going to have an effect. We've got to make sure that the support structures are in place, both whilst they're in service and when they're not. 


We know from the work which has been done by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence that whilst those people are in service they have the psychological supports and are strong. If you remove those supports when people depart, it's no surprise that some people will find it difficult. The impact of their compounding service affects them. What we've got to do is find mechanisms—and this is what is happening through the proposals which have been put in place by the shadow minister—that will help address their needs.


We can't have the prospect that, because someone has served their country, whether it is for five, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 40 years, on leaving the uniform they're not able to find a job—should not. We've got to find the capacity to make sure that every person who leaves the Defence Force, on transition, knows that they have the support they will need to get extra training and an employment opportunity. That's an obligation that we, as a nation, need to accept. I know that both the minister and the shadow minister understand that. 


I have been of the view for a long time that, as soon as someone walks through the gates at Wagga on their recruit training, they have an identifier which says: 'You are now part of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Commonwealth, have an obligation to look after you and your interests until you're dead.' Indeed, post service, veterans need to have full knowledge that their families are going to be looked after. We've got to inculcate this view in people so that they know it's normal to get access to services. I know the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the people who work within it are endeavouring to do their utmost to make sure that this is the case. I want to thank those people who work over there in the Department of Defence, who strive every day to do the best they possibly can for our serving personnel, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs for our veterans. They need our support.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-10-25,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray—Nationals Whip) (11:08):  I want to acknowledge the contribution from the member for Lingiari on this issue and also acknowledge the statement that the minister gave to the House yesterday on this government's commitment to veterans. It certainly is an incredibly important part of our culture that we continuously acknowledge the various conflicts which this nation has been a part of. We acknowledge that not one of those conflicts which have been a part of have ever been for personal gain for Australia; effectively we have always sent our troops overseas to maintain what we would call the status quo, to quell the invaders, to make sure that we could assist these countries to effectively stop people from invading other lands. One could have a debate about whether we were invading Turkey in relation to Gallipoli, or whether we were trying to stop the German army's invasions throughout Europe. But I think it's very fair and very reasonable and true to say that Australia has never effectively sent our troops away so that we could improve the amount of land that we were to rule over. So our history is rich and our history is honourable when it comes to our conflicts. In the space of that, or using that as a basis, we can be very, very proud of our troops for the work that they have carried out right around the globe.


It's also true that when many of our troops come back from service, they effectively don't want to be involved with the RSL. Many of them think that's for members from other conflicts, from other generations, to be a part of. But at various stages in their lives, in many instances, they do find their way back to the RSL. Sometimes it's in search of comradeship, other times it's in search of support and assistance that they need to get on with their daily lives. There's myriad of ways we are helping our veterans. As the minister stipulated yesterday, there's an $11 billion commitment from this government to our veterans. Over 280,000 veterans throughout Australia, along with their families, are currently being supported by the government. It's a very significant community and it's a very, very significant contribution from this government and the Australian taxpayer to assist with the work that we are doing to support our veterans.


As I've said a few times in the chamber in the last week and a half, I was lucky enough to spend a week with our deployed servicemen in Afghanistan recently. It's an amazing experience, and in a short space of time it gives you a firsthand understanding of the calibre of our troops, the most amazing men and women I've ever met, and certainly their discipline, their commitment to the detail, their humility and their understanding of their place in the world. They understand the dangers that are associated with Afghanistan becoming totally lawless. They understand the horrible loss of life that happens in Afghanistan every day. They understand the importance of the elections that took place last week. The coalition forces over there must assist in helping the Afghan government reform after this election in a credible manner so that we can have a government over there that has credibility amongst the people of Afghanistan and is then able to plot a future that involves education and health services—a couple of key elements in the Afghani dynamic at the moment that are sadly lacking.


We face this incredibly complex situation in Afghanistan, with ISIS and all of its various forms popping up all over the place, and with the Taliban's constant lust for power and ability to drive down anybody—whether it be the local police force, the local army, a school, a council, or anybody that dare poke their head up and try and offer the people of Afghanistan some sense of a proper programmed life. They will be effectively under the threat of losing their life through the Taliban. So there's this very complex situation over there.


Our troops are toing an amazing job trying to normalise the daily lives of the Afghani people. And it's when you have these relationships with these people—albeit from a very safe area of the compounds, where we were looked after incredibly well—you can see in the eyes of what they call the guardian angels, these incredibly trained Australian troops, that they are on constant alert. They thrive on this pressure, they thrive on their responsibility to keep all those around them safe, they thrive on the fact that they are trained to within an inch of their lives. They are incredible specimens of troops, of military personnel. Their capabilities are phenomenal. However, you can see the stress that they are under. If you offered them an opportunity to leave, they would not leave. If they weren't in that deployment, they would be desperate to be in that deployment. So, whilst they love the situation they find themselves in, there is no doubt that they are under extreme pressure to be able to, at a later date, transition back into mainstream life here in Australia and pick up all of the long-term responsibilities that come with that—reuniting with their families, with their children that they haven't spent a lot of time with, with a partner who they've been away from for a long time. When you talk to them, you can understand the pressures that they are under. Many of these amazing troops are young and married with children. 


I think the Defence Forces have been very wise in setting the time that they deploy our troops for—around six to seven months is the deployment time for most of our people. There is a cost in doing that, because the relationships that our troops forge with the Afghani army and the various office holders within the Afghani structure are critically important. Seven months is not a long time for our officers to forge those relationships and take their army forward. Ultimately, the entire operation over there is about our ability to take the Afghani army forward. So, we do pay a price for these shorter deployments than what would otherwise be optimal, but we do this solely with the health interests of our troops at heart. 


I commend the structure that we currently have in place with our troops. They are desperate to go over there and test themselves in these conditions, but we all understand that it does place these young men and women under incredible stress. Therefore, when they do return, even people who may not be affected by any form of post-traumatic stress are still going to face this incredibly tough challenge and task of being able to assimilate back into family life and of being able to go and work in a workplace environment where discipline and structure is not necessarily the order of the day, where there can be a few loudmouths and larrikins floating around the workplace who may not respect the other people working in that environment. Moving into that environment is also very, very challenging for our troops. 


We need to make sure that we are there to offer them support. As the previous speaker, the member for Lingiari, said: from the moment they turn up at Kapooka or Wagga or other training centres, we should be thinking about their interests—yes, let's use these brilliant young men and women in our Defence Force, but how do we help them after they have served their country? How do we help them for the rest of their lives? I think we've got a fair bit of it right, but there is also so much more continued work that we can do to assist our troops in their transition and in and out of mainstream work. The government is keeping this as a main priority, as a serious priority, but there is always more work to be done. The statement from the minister yesterday was very, very welcome. We understand that it's our troops who are doing us incredibly proud, each and every day. Many of us need to make sure that we continually thank our troops.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (11:18):  In a few weeks' time we celebrate the centenary of Armistice in the First World War. Almost 62,000 Australians died in that war fighting for our freedom and in service of our nation. On the centenary of Armistice, we'll take this opportunity to remember some of those from the Illawarra and the Southern Highlands, in my electorate, who gave their lives for us. One of those was James David Pope, who was a corporal in the 1st Australian Machine Gun Company. James was just 18 years of age when he enlisted in January 1915. He was with his mate, Bert Stokes. They had previously worked as a stonemasons with his father, who operated the trachyte quarries on Mount Gibraltar—and if you know Mt Gibraltar, it overlooks Bowral in the Southern Highlands. On 20 July, just four days after his 20th birthday, James was killed during heavy shelling and gas attacks at the Somme. James' name appears on the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux, one of 11,000 Australians commemorated there who died in France and have no known grave.


We also remember William Alexander Beach, who was born in Dapto to a famous family and attended Dapto Public School. He was one of 12 children and the son of a world champion sculler, who gives his name to an aged-care facility and to a district in Dapto today. William, a labourer, enlisted in 1914 at the age of 33. After arriving in Egypt, William was sent on to Gallipoli, landed on 25 April and was wounded in action on 22 July 1916 sometime later at Pozieres. William returned to Australia in October 1917 and was discharged medically unfit on 11 January 1918 as a result of his wounds.


We also remember Fredrick Crisp from Bowral. Fred was a corporal in the 1st Australian Light House Brigade—again, another famous brigade—and was among the first men in the Southern Highlands to enlist. He was just 19 when he signed up on 25 August 1914 and he landed at Gallipoli some months later. Fred was mentioned in despatches for his bravery, including his daring rescue of a wounded mate, Trooper Donovan. At Quinn's Post, considered the most dangerous place on ANZAC Cove, Fred volunteered to go out under heavy machine gun fire to within 20 yards of enemy trenches to carry his wounded mate to safety. Fred was one of 11 Southern Highland boys killed during the fierce Battle of Lone Pine in August 1915. These were very small communities 100 years ago. To have 11 boys killed in the same place on the same day was a devastating blow to these communities. In June 1916, Fred was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for conspicuous gallantry in the rescue of Trooper Donovan. I'd like to thank Linda Emery at the Story Centre at Berrima District Museum for her assistance in compiling some of these stories. They are some of many hundreds of stories that are available to visitors to the museum, which does a great job of keeping the stories of the district alive.


It is a great duty and an honour to attend services and events to remember those like James, Fred and William—those brave boys who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. I am also very pleased to say that in later years locals have taken up the stories of the women who were enlisted in the medical corps—nurses, assistants and other women—who travelled to these war zones, many of whom did not come back, who died of injury or disease and who did not receive until late the recognition that they deserve. Their stories and the stories of everyone else who suffered the consequences of this horrific war never fail to move us. We walk in their shoes, on the same streets and on the same soil, but our lives in 2018 are so different to those 100 years ago. We often take for granted the freedoms that were fought so hard to defend.


Shortly our focus will turn to commemoration of the Centenary of Armistice. Commemoration is just one of the ways way that we ensure our appreciation of the service and sacrifice made by all of those from this date until today, from those days and until today, the men and women of our armed service continues. I am pleased to have provided some support to the commemorative efforts of the Berrimah District Historical and Family History Society, for example, for their recent poppy seed project as a part of the Armistice commemorations.


In January 1920, Joseph Maiden, the director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, received a parcel from France, sent by Ettie Rout, who was the secretary of the New Zealand Volunteer Sisterhood. The box contained poppy seeds gathered in the Somme Valley by school children of Villers-Bretonneux and came with a request that the seed be distributed to the relatives of Australian and New Zealand soldiers who had fallen on the battlefields and given their lives for France, so far from their native land. Joseph Maiden published a letter in TheSydney Morning Herald offering a small packet of the seed to relatives who had lost a loved one. Volunteers from the Berrimah District Historical and Family History Society have indexed the 1,077 names from the registers and have so far identified more than half of the soldiers for whom the seed was obtained and planted. Funding from their Armistice grant will go towards publishing a book which will tell some of the moving stories uncovered by the society's volunteers. The book will be widely available in Australia and at the Sir John Monash Centre at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux, providing another tangible link to the town that is so significant in the commemoration of the Anzacs in France. The society will also encourage local schools to plant poppy seeds, and descendants of soldiers to plant those poppies as well.


The horrors of World War I ended a hundred years ago. Each year, we have done what we can to hold commemorations to ensure that their sacrifice is not lost. We stop for a minute's silence and remember them. We remember those who have died in service of their country. We remember those whose service changed them forever. We remember the parents who lost children and the children who lost parents. On 11 November, we'll mark the Centenary of Armistice. Many will take part in the one-minute silence to recognise the guns falling silent on the western front after more than four years of continuous warfare. It's important that we do what we can to take time to remember and reflect.


Earlier this week, I was very pleased to visit the Australian War Memorial to see the field of knitted poppies that have been gathered in a remarkable display to remember the fallen. I was pleased to learn that some of these, in fact several hundred of them, were knitted in nursing homes throughout the Southern Highlands and gathered by Brendan Nelson, who is a resident of my electorate and leads the War Memorial, so that they could be transported and planted amongst that display. The visual impact of these goes some way to help us comprehend how many gave their lives.


Since Federation, almost two million Australian service men and women have served our nation. We thank them and their families for their courage, their service and their sacrifice. As a member of parliament, it's a great honour and privilege to represent the people of the electorate of Whitlam and to seek to be worthy of the ideals of those who sacrificed so much for us. Our democracy, while far from perfect, is the expression of that freedom that they fought for.

Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (11:28):  Since Federation, nearly two million Australian service men and women have served our nation. I've always been a proud and strong supporter of our veterans, not only in my electorate but across Victoria and across our nation. I will always be grateful to the courage and the sacrifice of the brave men and women who have put on their uniform to defend our nation. And I understand this personally as well, being the great-grandson of a veteran from World War I, the grandson of a grandfather who served in the Navy at HMAS Ceberus, and the son of a father who served for a period of time in the Army, based at Balcombe in Mount Martha on the Mornington Peninsula.


In a few weeks time on 11 November we as a country of many will commemorate the centenary of the First World War Armistice. It is a day to reflect and to respect those who have served on our behalf. The Anzac centenary has given us strengthened national awareness and increased knowledge of Australia's military history and the service and sacrifice of earlier and current generations of Australian servicemen and servicewomen. Just this July I had the opportunity to visit France, go to Villers-Bretonneux and see the new Sir John Monash Centre there as well as the Naours caves on whose walls are the inscriptions of those who served during World War I and in other conflicts. I must thank the representative of the Somme region, Jean-Claude Leclabart, for the opportunity to go with him and see a number of these sites that commemorate of the service not only of our veterans but also of other veterans who served in those conflicts.


I have also seen this awareness reinvigorated locally in Dunkley, with four community organisations and schools recently receiving grants under the armistice centenary grants program to appropriately commemorate the anniversary, drawing on our local heritage and the recognition across the community of the significance of the sacrifices made. Those who have received these grants are: the Seaford RSL sub-branch, who have received funds to expand their cenotaph area; the Mornington & District Historical Society, who have received funds to display their memorabilia from the First World War, which includes photos of soldiers, medals and old coins; Frankston RSL, who have received funds towards the new Frankston War Memorial and the commemorations that will be held there this coming November; and, lastly, Elisabeth Murdoch College in Langwarrin, who have received funds to display memorabilia from the First World War and to install flags at the school associated with the remembrance of those who have served.


I also recently announced BEST funding of nearly $23,000 to Mornington Peninsula Legacy House at Mt Eliza within my electorate, who do so much for the families of our veterans past and present. I know personally the work of Legacy. I mentioned my great-grandfather before, who served in World War I. He passed away from the effects of mustard gas poisoning several years after that conflict. As a result my grandmother, Patricia Wright, as an only child, was put through school by Legacy when her father passed away at just the age of 48. At the time she was 11 years old. Without the help of Legacy, I know my grandmother's mother would have struggled to get by and to have supported my grandmother.


Our government is also committed to ensuring that the sacrifice of our servicemen and servicewomen is appropriately commemorated and remembered by both current and future generations of Australians. It is encouraging to see so much engagement around the centenary. Earlier this week, on the day of the National Apology to Victims and Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse, I was joined in parliament here by a local constituent of mine, who experienced abuse as a 15-year-old cadet within the Defence Force. The Prime Minister later specifically mentioned these victims in parliament during question time and acknowledged those who had been impacted. As we know, those who serve in our conflicts both past and present go through a lot, but there are also those who have been affected by our not operating things as they really should have been operated.


The last thing I will note is that this government is committed to caring for the men and women who defend our country: our veterans past, current and future. We must continue to ensure that we look after veterans when they return from conflict and that we prevent situations arising by taking immediate action to help them straightaway and to connect them back into the community. While there is always more to be done, the government will continue to strive towards better meeting the needs of our veterans and their families. Of the almost two million people who have served in defence of Australia, more than 102,000 have made the ultimate sacrifice. To all ADF personnel, the veteran community and those who support them, thank you for all your service, lest we forget.

Ms STANLEY
 (Werriwa) (11:34):  I rise today to add my support to the statements of the shadow minister and the minister in pressing the need to keep veterans and their families at the forefront of our nation's conscience. These are individuals for whom the notion of service has existed as a defining value for themselves, their families, their careers and their citizenship of this country. I say to these individuals: thank you for your service. These thanks must be given at multiple levels. Thank you for embodying your citizenship of this country through a commitment to protecting our interests at an international level. I say thank you for choosing a career of service above a career of comfort—a career where you gave of yourself beyond what most professions ask. I say thank you to your families—families who have gone without mothers and fathers for weeks while they've served overseas, families who've endured the uncertainty that comes with a loved one performing national service, families who've supported our veterans in their transition back into the civilian world and families who are often on the frontline of the treatment and care for PTSD, injury and other illnesses our veterans suffer when they come back from service.


Words are not enough, because our actions speak louder than our words and it is largely through our actions that veterans will feel the gratitude that we are expressing in this place today. It is our hope that, through Labor's military covenant, we will uphold these sentiments of gratitude within the concrete policy initiatives.


It takes a significant level of courage to dedicate oneself to national service in Australia's armed forces. As a country, Australia does well at acknowledging our veterans in public life. We speak often about sacrifice, honour and dedication to protecting the Australian values at the heart of our democracy. But, away from this public conversation, the parades, the ceremony and the public acknowledgement, our veterans frequently pay the personal price for their commitment to their country.


Our commitment to their gratitude must go deeper. We must do better to ensure our veterans are able to find supportive channels of meaning and service in the civilian world. The electorate I represent has an incredible military history. The suburb of Lurnea, in which I've lived all my life, was originally a soldiers' settlement developed in order for veterans to build life, family, work and community after the Second World War. Former soldiers were provided with parcels of land to begin market gardens and ease back into society. These beginnings are still evident in Lurnea today. It's a suburb that thrives on family, community and the values of a good day's work. We are a bright example of the incredible things that come from giving our veterans a solid start back into the civilian world.


Labor has a very strong commitment to veterans' employment. We want our veterans to find valuable, meaningful career pathways upon discharge from national service. This is why we have announced a $121 commitment to veterans' employment and transition. This commitment is about far more than employment and transitions; it's about our veterans feeling valued in our society. Much of this value can come from a good day's work with a supportive employer. We recognise that this needs to be in partnership that government is in the position to help facilitate.


Labor will provide funding to bridge skills gaps and assist industry with meeting the needs of returning veterans. It is also crucial that our veterans are able to access comprehensive treatment and ongoing care for the trauma they suffered in the course of their service. We must continue to support them through open conversation, supportive environments and resources they need to recover. Mental illness amongst our service personnel is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of strength that they have demonstrated in stepping up and serving their country.


All of this is about ensuring that veterans feel like the valued and supported members of civilian society we know they are. We want them to know they are not alone and continue to have a very special place in our society. This must be at the forefront of our sentiments when we say, 'Thank you for your service.' Lest we forget.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (11:39):  This debate, bipartisan as it is, and will always remain, is important to recognise the service of those who leave the comfort and the familiarity of Australia to fight for values we share. The observations of Kenneth Minogue, and more recently Svend Brinkmann, have looked at identifying what, as a nation, we stand for? What are the values that we're not going to keep trading away; we're actually going to stand firm and defend? That's an important question for young Australians educated in an age of moral relativism. Increasingly, we need to be able to identify clearly what is something that is a non-negotiable element in a civil and peaceful democracy that allows us to have elections in a peaceful way, to respect the pen and the word rather than the sword.


I want to make five observations in this opportunity I have been given today. The first one is to note it's not just conventional military service that we recognise in this motion; we recognise all Australians who served either here or overseas, not only in a military capacity but also in a peace-keeping capacity. As I will say later, even in a Kiap capacity through the police constabulary that served in Papua New Guinea. All these need to be recognised as part of this motion.


I had the privilege of serving in Afghanistan as a landmine-clearing medic and physician with English landmine clearers post the first Gulf War. I lost two of my three closest friends in a landmine-clearing accident in 1992, shortly after I had departed. But they had, as close friends of mine, written back to their families about what drove them to continue to serve even after they had resigned their commissions from the first Gulf War. Tim Goggs, Tim Porter, Julian Gregson: one of them went home to their relatives; the other two were trapped in a landmine-clearing tank after a dreadful accident in Afghanistan. That point is marked by a can of rocks and a small sign that recognises the work they did just to try to rekindle democracy in Afghanistan. That was in 1992. How long have we been struggling, and how many civilisations prior to 1992 were trying to do the exact thing? It's a fight we won't give up on for Julian and for Tim. Both of them were recognised with the highest civilian award for bravery by their own country—a point I'll be coming to later—but they were serving in an unconventional way in the farthest corners of the world for the same thing.


Closer to home, my dad was a Kiap. He trained as a civilian to serve as a patrol officer in Papua New Guinea. His unusual duty, in 1970, was to disarm the last coast watcher in Bougainville, who had been serving in Bougainville since World War II and was still in possession of his military allocation of both weapons and other equipment from World War II. I remember my dad said to me: 'I had to go and see this gentleman at the plantation and say, ""The time has come. The emerging independent country of Papua New Guinea has asked you be disarmed.""' While every military item was offered to my dad, he only took what he had to take by law, and that was the weapon. We need to remember those Kiaps now; many of them are passing away. We are yet, in this capital city of Canberra, to recognise Kiaps with a formal location where we can go and recognise the service of Kiaps. Though they served in peacetime, it was not always safe. Papua New Guinea was a very challenging environment for those Kiaps.


Bereavement and being recognised in the armed service is incredibly important. We can all remember the embarrassment of the 'mother's medal' up until World War II. Many of us have forgotten that those who lost a loved one in war were sent a letter to go and pick up a medal, a medallion, from their local post office. That is inconceivable today, but let us not judge previous eras by today's standard. We can now do it properly. I think that everyone in Australia who has lost a first-degree relative, a family member, in service to this great nation should be able to wear that proudly on the left breast with the medal array that they have from their relative. But we still can't do that. While we welcome every person who served and their family to march on Anzac Day, I think it's appropriate that we recognise that element of losing a loved one in this service. And that's quite easy to do through a medal that's awarded directly to the next of kin that is noted on those enrolment papers.


That's yet to occur, but what has occurred with each of the three of our armed forces is a bereavement pin, an element that had been lost to history until 2010, when the former member for Herbert Peter Lindsay retired from the parliament without it having been secured. We made it a coalition policy in 2010. It was forgotten in 2013, but all three wings of the armed forces have gladly gone ahead with a bereavement pin that can be worn proudly by the next of kin who've lost a loved one serving this nation.


In my own area of Bowman, a particular form of service that is almost forgotten now is the Women's Land Army. Hard as it is to imagine if you took away the equivalent of half a million young people to serve and, self-evidently, only 10 or 15 per cent of them were women, and you had a huge economy that you needed to be run by the women who stayed behind—but the Women's Land Army did that in World War II. Four hundred women at Victoria Point would go out and regularly tend to the fields in the food bowl of my electorate every minute of every hour of everyday, under the sun, doing a role they hadn't been doing up until then and thinking about whether their loved ones would be coming home. The way they thought about it was actually rolling up their sleeves and farming. It's an incredible story. They received a minor royal visit when a countess popped by in a limousine to see the Women's Land Army in my electorate. She didn't get out of the car, apparently, because it was spotting with rain and she didn't want to upset her bonnet, but all of the young women came up and offered her strawberries. What an era that must have been. And what an incredible and now forgotten service. Many of those women had to take their kids with them while they farmed. 


Lastly, and very importantly, we are now just starting to recognise the breadth and dimension of service by moving of the year when the Vietnam War began. It's now officially 1962. It wasn't always 1962, because we were officially not at war. But I want to say today that Australians were serving then and Australians were dying. The first casualty in the Vietnam War was a gentlemen by the name of Kevin Conway from Wellington Point in my electorate. At the moment, we are reapplying for his bravery to be recognised. I would like to read into the Hansard the importance of his gentleman's service. Sergeant and Temporary Warrant Officer Class 2 Kevin Conway was killed in action in 1964 in the Battle of Nam Dong. As a member of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, he was placed on his own to work with American consultants in building the capacity of the South Vietnamese to defend themselves. He was the first Australian, as I've said, to die in that war. 


He left school at 15 years of age and attempted to enlist in 1943 but was too young for the Second World War. So he joined what was called the postwar army. It is unclear whether he was able to serve in Korea, but he did serve in Malaysia and was awarded the appropriate clasp. He was an efficient and conscientious soldier. He had a practical, common sense approach to problems. He was the kind of Aussie you would want to send to the front line. He was the kind of Australian who could work shoulder to shoulder with the Americans and do our nation proud, which is precisely what he did in an incredibly remote part of Vietnam, close to the Laotian border. What we didn't realise at the time was that up to a quarter of the South Vietnamese that he was helping to train were actually Vietcong. The very men who the Australians and Americans were trying to assist to build their nation and get their nation on its feet and be able to defend from what they saw as a northern threat had already technically deserted but remained to ambush these serving personnel when the time was right. When a bullet was heard and shot in anger, these South Vietnamese were instructed to pull their shirt off, identify as Vietcong and slit the throat or shoot at point blank the Australian or the American they were standing next to. Imagine serving in that context! 


Conway was recommended the Victoria Cross by the AATTV and by Colonel Ted Serong in particular for not only running towards a mortar trench but urging others around him to organise themselves and defend. The US officer next to Conway, Captain Donlon, became the first recipient of the Medal of Honour in the Vietnam War for his actions alongside him. Several other Americans also received an award. But Conway only received the highest bravery award that Vietnam can offer and nothing from Australia. 


When Colonel Serong visited the scene of the battle, he said Conway and a US Master Sergeant fought their way through the Vietcong just to get to a mortar pit where they began their assignment of firing illumination flares so they could see the enemy. When another Vietcong assault brought the attackers to within grenade-throwing distance of the trench, Conway had two choices: pull out his firearm and defend himself or continue operating the mortar. He chose the latter. We have been through the archives in the last month looking for a previous recommendation for a Victoria Cross for this gentleman. Archives have confirmed that they cannot find it. On those grounds, we are now applying directly to the ministry of defence to ensure that the valour of Kevin Conway is recognised.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (11:49):  It's a great privilege and honour to speak on this ministerial statement on veterans and their families. I'm all too aware of the dedication, commitment and sacrifices made by our veterans and current serving members. I want to start by acknowledging the longstanding commitment to bipartisanship in this place on Veterans' Affairs and defence. I pledge to continue working in this spirit for the benefit of our Defence Force, veterans and country. I'm proud to have spoken on this topic many times before in the parliament. Today I again place on the record my unwavering support for and gratitude to the brave men and women who have served our nation, for their service and contribution to the Australian way of life, and to the families of our veterans, who have also made tremendous sacrifices for the betterment of our nation. 


I have had the great privilege while serving in this parliament to meet elected members who have also served our nation in the ADF. I acknowledge in the chamber today the service of the member for Solomon, Luke Gosling OAM; Andrew Hastie, the member for Canning; and Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro. It has been such a privilege to get to know them, to listen to their stories and to understand the service that they delivered for our nation. They continue to serve our nation in this parliament as well.


I have not served in the ADF, but I do come from a military family. My father served in the Navy during the Second World War. He was a signalman onboard HMAS Ararat. He enlisted at the age of only 20. He served in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force until Allied victory in the Pacific. I listened to the member for Bowman talk about pins. My grandmother wore a pin every day that my father served in the war. She slept with that pin because she was afraid to take the pin off—if something happened to that pin, something might happen to her eldest son.


The Ararat was an Australian warship positioned in the newly captured Allied territory of Cape Gloucester near Britain. Whilst my father was not one to tell many stories from the time he served, I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that life onboard the Ararat was not easy. This is reflective of the experience of many of our service men and women and veterans today. They gave up and have given up so much so that we can enjoy freedom today.


There are currently almost 2,000 veterans and a further 1,000 current serving members of the Defence Force who now call my electorate of Oxley home. I'm proud to know many of them personally. I enjoy working alongside our local RSL sub-branches to help improve services for members. Every electorate in Australia has RSL sub-branches, but today I want to place on record in the parliament the following that I work closely with and to acknowledge the service, understanding and care they give to veterans: the Centenary Suburbs RSL Sub-branch, the Forest Lake RSL Sub-branch, the Dara and District RSL Sub-branch, the Goodna RSL Sub-branch, the Redbank RSL Sub-branch and the Redbank Plains RSL Sub-branch.


Listening and talking to the executive, the liaison officers and the community people who support and attend meetings has given me a better understanding of what veterans require, what support services they need. I do believe that it's important that we as parliamentarians take the time to listen to their stories, their concerns and their challenges—whether it be better access to medicine or more support for mental health services. It could just be lending an ear for a friendly conversation. It's important that we continue to build relationships with veterans in our community.


I've also been fortunate to work alongside our future service men and women and see firsthand the next generation of cadets coming through the ranks. This includes in my electorate the Australian Air League Forest Lake air squadron. Most recently I visited their women in aviation event and met with some inspiring and amazing young female cadets, who are in training now for a career in our Defence Force. This was in contrast clearly to those who have gone before them and who joined us at the event. They paved the way for our younger generation to learn the values of the Defence Force and to become role models for others. Next month we will see our young cadets line up alongside our veterans. 


As we've heard in this debate in this parliament and as we've witnessed, we will be seeing the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, when the guns fell silent on the Western Front and, after more than four years of unimaginable bloodshed and destruction, the war was finally over. Earlier this week, I was really privileged to join with a number of my colleagues and with the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and the shadow minister for defence, Richard Marles, when we visited the Australian War Memorial with the director, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson AO, and saw the 62,000 poppies made by Australians from all walks of life to commemorate the fallen during World War I.


A little earlier this year I visited the YMCA headquarters in Brisbane, located in Fortitude Valley. The YMCA at Lutwyche also has undertaken a similar poppy project, with 80,000 poppies from around Queensland and Australia, under the leadership of one of their dedicated staff, Meg Woolf. I've spoken about this in the chamber before. I didn't know the reason we wear poppies until I visited the YMCA. Two days before the Armistice was signed, a person who was attending the 25th conference of the overseas YMCA war secretaries decided to pin a poppy to her collar. It's claimed it was Moina Michael, who was working at the 25th conference of the overseas YMCA war secretaries, who decided to do that. To think that one person began what the whole world now knows as a symbol for honouring the fallen is an amazing story. As Labor's shadow minister for veterans' affairs said yesterday:


As the Centenary of Anzac draws to a close, it is important that we consider how we keep alive the memories of men and women who have served and who have died. While we no longer have the benefit of any of our World War I diggers with us, it is critical that we remember their experiences and their sacrifice.


That's why I am really pleased that a conversation has begun and that the opposition has proposed establishing the Western Front Fellowship. This fellowship, based on the successful Canadian program, is proposing to support eight post-secondary students a year to work at the Sir John Monash Centre, acting as tour guides, presenting some of Australia's most important history to visitors. This is just one of many new initiatives proposed that include, obviously, the recent announcement by the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition about the military covenant, signed by the Chief of the Defence Force and the Prime Minister of the day, that will be accompanied by legislation that will ensure regular reporting to the parliament on how we are meeting our commitment to those who have served. I recognise that the government has also made comments that they're exploring the idea of a military covenant. I'm really pleased that in the true spirit of bipartisanship we will work together, hopefully, to see this progress. Alongside a whole range of announcements that have come forward, particularly around veterans' employment programs, I know that it is critically important that we don't lose the skills of the veterans, that they're not lost, that they're encouraged to enter business and that they're assisted with their work in the community post a career in the ADF.


In closing I also want to acknowledge the bipartisan ADF Parliamentary Program, which many members, including myself, have attended. It gives us a glimpse—a very small glimpse, as the member for Braddon and I supported and visited Afghanistan—and we're able to better understand some of those huge sacrifices our men and women are delivering for this nation. It's amazing to be able to talk to them in country and to understand the challenges of being separated from family and loved ones, and I encourage all my fellow parliamentarians to participate so that, together, we can develop a better understanding and an even greater appreciation of our men and women serving overseas.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (11:59):  I welcome the opportunity today to note the ministerial statement made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Chester, in regard to veterans and their families and also the accompanying statement made by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston. There are many veterans who live in Rockingham and Kwinana, across my electorate of Brand in Western Australia. There are many women and men serving on HMAS Stirling on Garden Island, the Royal Australian Navy base located in my electorate. Families of serving women and men offer critical support for those who do enlist to commit an important part of their lives to our nation. Soon HMAS Ballarat will depart from its berth at HMAS Stirling to participate in Operation Manitou in the Middle East. It's a very long way from home, a very long way from the beautiful surrounds of Garden Island and Rockingham. In my capacity as the member for Brand, I've had the very great honour of being at one of these farewell ceremonies as one of our Anzac class frigates goes off to participate in Operation Manitou. I don't have family on board these ships but, as a local member of parliament and as a human, it is nonetheless a very heart-wrenching experience to witness a large ship like that, with its large complement of women and men serving our country, drift off from its berth to go and do its great work in the service of this nation. And when HMAS Ballarat does depart, I will be there and I will witness that sadness of families waving goodbye to their loved ones. Their loved ones, the ones serving on the ship, are doing their duty. Equally, the families themselves do their duty and get on with their lives, as they must. It is important that we as parliamentarians and also the community as a whole continue to support those families that have to get on with their lives while one of their family is away serving this nation.


As outlined yesterday by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and my friend, the member for Kingston, Labor has proposed a military covenant to be signed by the Prime Minister and Chief of Defence Force and support it through legislation so regular reports can be issued to parliament to make sure we're meeting our commitment to those who have served. I know the government is looking at this as well and I welcome action so that we can do better to help serving men and women once they have left the service of our nation. As has been noted, it won't be dissimilar to the United Kingdom's Armed Forces covenant.


It's also very important, as we know, to support veterans in their post-service employment opportunities. It can be a very difficult time for veterans and their families as they leave the service of the Australian Defence Force. Labor's been very supportive of developing a national family engagement and support strategy for the benefit and wellbeing of the families of those serving. It is particularly important to make sure all families are helped through any distress and post-service injury that their loved one has suffered. We look forward to being able to work with all members of parliament, whether it is this year or in future years or with future terms of whichever government, to make sure we serve our nation's veterans well.


I would like to note my local associations that serve veterans and their families: Rockingham RSL sub-branch, which my father was a member of for many years before he died a number of years ago; Kwinana RSL sub-branch; the Port Kennedy RSL sub-branch, a fantastic organisation—each of these are fantastic organisations; and also the Totally and Partially Disabled Veterans Association of Western Australia located in Baldivis. I look forward very much to attending the 100th Anniversary of the Armistice ball that is being organised by the Safety Bay Ex-Services and Community Club in Rockingham on 10 November. It will be a remarkable commemoration of 100 years since the end of World War I. Other support organisations in my community that support veterans and their families I would like to acknowledge include the Marilla House Community Centre on Point Peron Rd at the Naval Club and also the Veterans and Veterans' Families Counselling Service. They always do great work for the families of serving women and men when they are away, and I thank them for all the work they do.


November 11 2018 will be the 100th Anniversary of the Armistice that brought to an end the four brutal years of conflict that was World War I, a war that devastated Europe and, of course, had ramifications for Australia. Australia was a nation with quite a small population at the time and it's fair to say it lost a generation of men and that affected this country's development for a number of years. 


In World War I, which was called the Great War, nine million combatants died and seven million civilians perished, so all in all it's estimated that 16 million souls were lost to that very brutal and devastating conflict. On the anniversary of Armistice Day, we'll stop on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month to remember the Great War. In 2018 we'll remember a hundred years since that devastation came to its end. My grandfather, Major George Morris, was a royal marine in World War I, and he's part of that generation that lived to also serve in and survive World War II, having been provost marshal in Alexandria. We can barely understand the catastrophe that was Europe in the first half of the 20th century from the very safe and secure lives that we live here in Australia. People like my grandfather and my grandmother certainly lived that, as did many, many others. They were lucky to survive, living as they did in England but nonetheless serving that cause at that time. My father, John Morris, was also a veteran of World War II, having been a radar operator on ships that participated in the Arctic convoys during the last couple of years of the war. He would tell us many stories, often; I can't remember them all. It was a terrifying time for a young man, quite frankly, in the swells of the northern oceans on the way to protect merchant navy vessels trying to supply Russia so that they might survive the last days of World War II.


This 11 November, coming up soon, will be our opportunity to reflect on this catastrophe and the part Australians played in it as well as to reflect on the devastation and the deaths that were caused by that brutality. There have been ceremonies across Europe since 1918 to reflect on the Armistice. I once went to an Armistice Day ceremony in Benouville in France, a village near the Pegasus Bridge, which was a World War II landmark for some of the British forces; Benouville was one of the first towns in that part of France they retook in World War II. I went with my mum and dad and my husband Jamie. We were travelling and wanted to be in France on 11 November, and that's the town we rocked up to at that hour. We participated in a very simple, very dignified ceremony to remember the Armistice. We were welcomed by the French people in that village and by some British people who were also there at the time. In fact, the young mayor of the village at the time invited us into the local town hall and shared a kir royale—a type of sparkling champagne. They were very kind, and they recognised at that ceremony, in an impromptu fashion, the contribution of the Australian soldiers to both the conflicts, World War I and World War II, which that part of the world had to participate in just by virtue of their geography. That was a long time ago, maybe about 15 years ago, but I remember it fondly and I remember the French and their kindness to us when we visited.


On 11 November we will remember all those lost in conflict, beyond World War I and World War II—all those who still serve in conflicts and put their lives on the line to protect the ideals of this nation and of Western liberal democracies. I, and all parliamentarians along with me, acknowledge the commitment of the personnel of the Australian defence forces. We must do better to help our serving women and men when they finish that time in service. We must recommit to them, this day and into the future, to make sure we do the right thing and help them as best we can to have a future beyond their service. I want to encourage as many people as I can, if they can, to make the effort to get along to an Armistice Day or Remembrance Day ceremony on 11 November. They're very moving. They're quite simple. They remember a particularly brutal war that we must always remember, never forget, and make sure we don't repeat. Even though we still continue to engage in conflict around the world, maybe one day that will end. But, in the meantime, lest we forget.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (12:09):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. It's a great privilege to serve our country both in the forces and in this parliament. I think one of our biggest responsibilities in this parliament is to make sure that we not only send those representing us overseas with the best possible support and for the best possible reasons but also give them the best possible support on their return.


I just want to acknowledge the minister's statement of yesterday, and, of course, also the member for Kingston and her statement. What I really love about the member for Kingston and her work—there are many things—is the focus on families. I also acknowledge that the minister spoke also about the families. We can't underestimate the importance of the families and the burdens that they carry. In my electorate in particular, but not only my electorate, serving people and veterans are often a long distance away from their families. They may have a nuclear family with them—their partner and perhaps children—but often the military and their colleagues become their family. We want to, in all possible ways, support them with as much family-like support as we can in our communities, because often, as I said, they're quite some distance from their actual extended families.


As I was listening to my good friend the member for Brand and her familial history, I was reflecting on a very stupid thing that I did back at the time when my mother had two sons in Darwin about to deploy into East Timor in the INTERFET mission back in 1999. We're coming up to the 20th anniversary of that INTERFET mission next year, which will be something really significant for us to remember. It's already 20 years. I was in Perth doing some Indonesian language training with the Army, and I was on the phone to my mother, saying, 'Mum, Dan and Xavier will be going to Timor soon, and I'm really hoping it's not too long until I can join them.' It wasn't until much later that I understood why my mother went silent and went, 'Oh, that's great, Luke.' Three sons.


As it turned out, I didn't get over to Timor with the Army for another couple of years after that, but I remember reflecting on it later on. My mother grew up not really seeing her grandfather because he was shell shocked from the First World War and had taken off up into the bush. He lived up in the bush because he'd been gassed as well, and the air up in the mountains was cleaner and crisper and was more gentle on his lungs, but also because he just couldn't handle noise, the city and being around people. Then Mum married my father. They were engaged while Dad was over in the jungles of Vietnam. So her experience as a young mother was with Dad and Dad's mates as they tried to adjust back to life afterwards. And then, of course, her eldest son, me, joined the military. So on the eve of INTERFET, she wasn't over the moon about all her sons going off, but she understood that it was for a good reason. She obviously just wanted her sons to be well.


In my electorate there are many, many partners and many, many children of the members of our armed forces who wait, hoping that they won't get the knock on the door while their loved ones are overseas. Sometimes it's husbands whose wives are overseas. They hope that they don't get the call. What I'm really focused on is making sure that we've got more support for them in Darwin and Palmerston, in my electorate.


I'm really pleased that we've committed to—and it was pleasing to hear the minister say that the government is also looking at—this concept that we've put forward around the military covenant, which is an undertaking that we will ensure that the nation's armed forces are fully supported during and after their service and that we'll legislate regular reporting to parliament on how Australia is supporting our military personnel. I've heard some say that a covenant is just words, but it's the undertaking, the commitment to that and the accountability for that that is so important. I welcome that and thank those working on those policies to make that real.


I'm also proud that we've got a really good employment package. We're going to commit $121 million to a comprehensive veterans' employment policy, which will provide greater support to our defence personnel as they transition to civilian life. The family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans will provide greater support and resources to military families, focusing on what we know to be the stress points, including that transition for defence members into civilian life. Such a strategy was a key recommendation that came out of the National Mental Health Commission's review last year, and that was a very important initiative.


In the time remaining, I just want to talk a little bit about the importance of the things that were mentioned by both the minister and the shadow minister, in terms of dedicated services for our current and ex-serving personnel. In Darwin, I am committed to establishing a support centre not only for current and ex-serving defence personnel but also for first responders and their families. At present, there is a lack of services, there is a lack of coordination of support and there is a lack of this greater family outside of the base. Whilst on base, there are some support services, but I think both current and former members of our defence forces and first responders who serve our community need support services that are away from their place of work. That's what we're going to establish. It's going to help ex-services—and I use that as the broad service definition, including first responders. It will not only assist them to access the support that they need—whether it be mental health support or support transitioning or somewhere for their families to go and seek support—but also provide a hub of connectivity that not only will connect them to other members of those services and other agencies but also will provide a connection point with the broader community, which I think is really important.


What a lot of the studies are saying is extremely important in aiding their return into the community is to never lose that connection point with community in the first place. So we'll look at the provision of mental health services and counselling. It'll be a place for professional workshops, physical training, wellbeing courses, men's shed type of facilities, movie nights, barbecues and events that the community can access at times so that that connection with the community occurs. I think it's really important. I think it's overdue. We're committed to it. We're committed to a covenant and better services for our serving people, because they deserve no less.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-10-25,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:19):  Our ADF personnel put their lives on hold in service of our country. They take risks, they make sacrifices and they commit their lives and wellbeing to the protection of this country. Upon return, the scars these men and women wear and bear are not always visible. But the message we on this side of the chamber want to send today and which also was sent by our shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, yesterday is that Labor stands by our ADF personnel and stands by their families. That point couldn't be made clearer than by taking a close look at the policies that have been announced by Labor's shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston.


The member for Kingston has announced a range of initiatives to underscore Labor's commitment to veterans. These include a veterans' employment policy, a family engagement and support strategy and, most recently, Australia's first military covenant.


Veterans' unemployment has been cited as sitting at 30 per cent, which is significant. For those who did not medically discharge, there is an estimated 11 per cent unemployment rate, which is more than double the national rate. This is simply unacceptable, which is why the member for Kingston has developed a comprehensive veterans' employment policy that will provide greater support for our Defence personnel as they transition to civilian life. The policy focuses on helping businesses to train veterans. It focuses on a new veterans' employment service. It focuses on expanding access to additional education and civilian training and translating the experience of veterans.


Our veterans', as ADF personnel, are incredibly well trained. We've got a lean and mean Australian Defence Force. As a result of that, those ADF personnel are incredibly well trained across a broad range of areas. Unfortunately, all that training, all that investment that is made in the highly skilled and professional Australian Defence Force is not translating into civilian life. I can't understand why when they are so highly trained. This is why focusing on that transition as this policy does is so vitally important. It ensures that we get the best translation of those skills and that training that they have in the Australian Defence Force into the civilian area. In areas like recognition of prior learning, it is vitally important for the skills and training that the ADF personnel have. There is recognition of prior learning in the academic setting, ensuring that that translates into units and credits. There is a range of other areas.


I've spoken many times on this employment policy that was announced a few months ago by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, and once again I commend all those listening to read the policy to gain an understanding of it. Again, I commend the member for developing the policy.


I also want to commend our shadow minister for veterans' affairs for the announcement that a Labor government will put in place a formal agreement—a military covenant—to ensure the nation's armed forces are fully supported during and after their service. We will legislate regular reporting to parliament of developments in that area, particularly on how we are supporting our ADF personnel. This policy will change the lives of veterans. It's a policy that has been modelled on what's actually happened in the United Kingdom, I understand. It's something that the community has been calling for for some time, and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs has listened to the community, has responded to the community and has come up with this suggestion and commitment that, should Labor win government, we will put in place a formal agreement under the auspices of a military covenant.


In terms of families, we all know the ADF put their lives on hold in service of our country, and in many ways so too do those families that are supporting our ADF personnel: constantly moving around the country, constantly changing schools, constantly changing jobs, constantly there to support ADF personnel in difficult circumstances, particularly when they're deployed. It's vitally important that our support is provided not only to our ADF personnel and our veterans but also to our ADF families, who play a pivotal role in supporting our current serving ADF men and women and our veterans. These men, women and children are the unsung heroes of our defence forces, and greater support for our military families is greater support for our serving and ex-serving personnel.


Our family engagement and support strategy is one of the key recommendations from the National Mental Health Commission's Review into the suicide and self-harm prevention services available to current and former serving ADF members and their families. The review highlighted that there is currently a lack of emphasis on the critical role that families play in the lives of current and former serving members. We know that families play an especially unique role within military life and service, themselves making many sacrifices. Our ADF personnel and veterans look to their families for support while in service, in transition and in civilian life. There's no doubt that families also play a critical role in providing support to our serving and ex-serving personnel suffering from mental health issues. Labor is committed to developing this family engagement and support strategy, which will be co-designed with Defence and veteran's families and communities to focus on known stress points for families, including transition for Defence members into civilian life. You can imagine how stressful it is going from that very particular environment into civilian life. That's why we need to provide those supports through the exit process and then through the transition process.


I also mention that, as we know, there are so many support groups out there for veterans. One of them is here in Canberra, and I just want to do a shout-out to them. It's the ACT Veterans Rugby Club. It's a bit like a men's shed. It's an inclusive environment for men from all walks of life who just want to run around and have some fun, but it's more than that. I acknowledge the importance that this organisation has to our service and ex-service personnel and their families. ACT Veterans Rugby consists of men aged over 35 who have a love for rugby. They compete against a variety of Defence Force teams like the Navy Old Salts, the RAAF Mirages, the RASigs, RMC staff and cadets and the crew of the HMAS Canberra in charity matches. ACT Vets Rugby has raised almost $240,000 for charities based in the ACT since they've been holding these fundraising events and matches. Thank you so much for the work you do. Apart from keeping veterans on the rugby field—husband, take note: this is not a suggestion that you should put the boots back on; you are banned from getting involved in rugby again.



An honourable member:  Is he watching?




Ms BRODTMANN:
  I don't know whether he's watching, but just in case he gets a glimmer in his eye and a rush of blood about scoring the final try for Australia. Thank you to ACT Vets Rugby for everything you've done in keeping our veterans healthy and engaged in sport and also for raising funds for the community.


Finally, in closing I acknowledge one Canberra veteran who has been involved in the Vietnam Veterans Association for many years and in many ways is the brains behind the logistics of the Long Tan ceremony that we hold here each year down at the Vietnam veterans memorial. His name is Peter Ryan. He was involved in the Vietnam War. Peter earned an Order of Australia Medal for his 20-year dedication to helping veterans. He was the ACT president of the Vietnam Veterans Association from 2003 to 2013 and was also national vice-president for two of those years. He has been very actively involved in the Vietnam veterans community for many years. Unfortunately last year Peter passed away after a long battle with cancer, but he did get to see that final Long Tan anniversary service. Vale Peter Ryan. Thank you for your service to our Vietnam vets.


Debate adjourned.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (12:30):  On Friday night I joined 650 locals, including all of my federal and state colleagues and many of my local government colleagues, at a fantastic local event. It was the Illawarra Business Chamber awards night. 'A little taste of Paris' was the theme for this year. It was a great event. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate some people who organised and put on this event. They do it every year. It's always a huge event on our calendar in the Wollongong area. I also want to acknowledge some fabulous businesses who did well. Many will go on to the state competition and awards as well. 


Congratulations should certainly be given to the executive director of the Illawarra Business Chamber and Illawarra First, Adam Zarth, for the organisation of the awards. They are comprehensively organised and judged. The great faith in the integrity of the system is reflected in how many businesses participate. I also extend my congratulations to the judging team. A very large number of locals volunteered to be judges. It takes a lot of time. They were led by Professor Paul Wellings CBE, who is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong, and Warwick Shanks, who is the managing partner at KPMG Wollongong. I thank and congratulate also Janine Cullen and Terry Wetherall from the boards of the business chambers that hosted the event.


What I love about this is that the business chamber also uses this as an opportunity to showcase other local businesses. Adam and his team sourced and showcased some amazing local restaurants. There was a specially designed menu to fit in with the Parisian soiree theme. The entree was from Caveau in Wollongong. It is the only restaurant in the region to win a Good Food Guide hat for 14 consecutive years. The main was from Cupitt in the hills of Milton on the South Coast. Head chef Russell Chinn and his team are dedicated to providing the best wine and food experience on the New South Wales South Coast. The dessert was from Stones Patisserie in Berrima. They brought a delicious slice of Paris to the awards.


There were 20 awards. I hope my colleagues here will bear with me, because I want to recognise each of the businesses. The Illawarra Business of the Year was Itree. This is a very innovative internet security business, which I was very pleased to be able to support with some funding when we had the BlueScope downtown in 2011. They've gone from strength to strength. They're a great local company based at the Innovation Campus in Wollongong. I congratulate them.


The outstanding business leader was Kylie Moffitt from PhysioHealth & Sports Injury Clinic. That is something I might need if I try to do too much exercise. Good work, Kylie. The outstanding employer of choice was also Itree. They have a fantastic ethos and culture in their organisation. The outstanding young employee was Andrew Jackson from Itree. His is a great story as well. The outstanding young entrepreneur was Sarah Nolen from Birdblack Design. She was inspiring with her energy and enthusiasm.


The business award went to IOH Injury and Occupational Health. It is a great local business. The customer service winner was PhysioHealth & Sports Injury Clinic. The export business winner was Internetrix. That's another business that I've had a lot to do with. They were also supported with a grant under the innovation program at the time of the BlueScope downturn. They've also gone from strength to strength. I'm really proud of them. The innovation award went to Warrigal, an aged-care service provider who does great work. It's an Illawarra business that is now national. They do good work there. The retail and hospitality winner was Uncle Joe's Brew. I highly recommend them. The small business winner was Boab Services. The social enterprise winner was Green Connect Illawarra, a great local organisation that grows a big market garden, in effect, that employs a lot of local refugees. It's a really good initiative.


The local chamber of commerce, the amazing Corrimal Chamber of Commerce, won the local chamber award. They have been doing amazing things in Corrimal. The sustainability award went to Symbio Wild Life Park. Get onto them on Twitter; they've got the most amazing Twitter feed. I have been really pleased to support them for a long time. The tourism winner was Cupitt's winery. The workplace inclusion winner was the amazing Green Acres Disability Services. The start-up superstar was molenaar+mcneice. The Wollongong city centre business was Breakout Bar & Escape Rooms.


My congratulations to all 68 finalists, as well as those award category winners. You do us proud in the region. Thank you particularly to the Illawarra Business Chamber and the whole team for putting on such a great evening.
