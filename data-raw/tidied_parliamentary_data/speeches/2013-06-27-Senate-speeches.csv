Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (09:36):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I present the explanatory memorandum.


I have great pleasure in introducing the Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill 2013.


This bill has a simple aim of safeguarding the safety standards in Australia’s marine industry and address deficiencies in the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Amendment Bill 2013. Under normal circumstances matters of this detail are dealt with by regulation rather than by legislation. But due to three significant mistakes by Labor, it is imperative that we now act to prevent the lowering of regulatory safety training and certification standards for marine engineers in Australia. That is the big risk here. Without the passage of this bill, there is a real risk that regulatory safety training and certification standards for Australia's marine engineers will be lowered—and that is the last thing we want.


The first mistake under this government is that the regulator, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, has become so politicised that there is real doubt as to whether it can produce impartial safety regulations on merit. This is a major problem for our seafaring industry and has to be addressed. Unfortunately, we can see again the influence that the unions are having on Labor policy. And we saw it again last night when another Prime Minister was deposed. This is now par for the course for Labor—governing for the unions and their own self-interest, not for the Australian people.


Returning to the Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill and the reasons it must pass, the second significant mistake is that, due to political interference by non-engineer interests, AMSA abandoned on 22 October 2009 the considered engineering reforms they had agreed to with the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. Instead, there has been the attack on the marine engineering safety training and certification standards that I have just referred to.


The third mistake is that, as a result of the poor drafting of Minister Albanese's shipping reform bills and acts, vessels currently covered by the Navigation Act 1912 standards will instead default to a lower standard under the Maritime Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012, or the national law as it is known. Let us look at this in more detail. AMSA has attacked engineer standards of training and certification throughout the entire Marine Order 3. I asked many questions at Senate Estimates on this issue. I continually question them on the processes, for which there are genuine concerns that accountability is being downgraded.


I will list where these deficiencies lie. Engineering standards of training and certification are being attacked through MO3 in the following ways: by counting sea service as a rating as engineering qualifying sea service, which clearly it is not; by deleting tables used for assessing workshop service; by deleting a table showing the framework of state and federal issue marine engineer certificates and how they relate to each other; by deleting the three-year duration of training for an engineer cadet. That is amazing. How are you going to train a cadet in less than three years? Look at our apprenticeships around Australia. And the final ways in which the engineering standards of training and certification are being attacked are by deleting the requirement that engineers not be certified unless they pass an examination by an AMSA examiner and by allowing AMSA to foist the audit of the college course onto a third party.


And that is just the start. AMSA drafted successive changes to Marine Order 3 from the point of view of desk officers and of ratings—that is, relatively unskilled seamen. Because of all the requirements, that adversely impacts on engineer officers. What are these adverse effects? Firstly, last time, AMSA's proposed changes incorrectly required engineers to meet the eyesight standards for the desk, which would have ended the career of hundreds of engineers. And this government talks about protecting Australian jobs! The time before that, AMSA's proposed changes would have refused to issue an engineer a certificate unless the candidate had passed the deck subject for radar training and for radio operator training. Neither of these is relevant for engineers—more red tape. This time, AMSA has incorrectly deleted the recognition of separate engineer certificates for steamships and for motor ships. This mistake is clearly unsafe and ridiculous. An engineer who is qualified for only motor ships cannot safely operate steamships, and vice versa. This is the downgrade in standards that I have been referring to. This time AMSA was too busy putting in new certificates for ships cooks to provide certificates for ships electrical officers.


AMSA also proposed changes which would have prevented hundreds of engineers from renewing the periodic validity of their certificates. And now we start to work out what this is all about. What is really behind the drop in these standards? The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has allowed the interests of other parties, such as the Maritime Union of Australia, to press them to reduce engineer training standards. The MUA is a union that our new Deputy Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, is aligned with. I say 'new' Deputy Prime Minister because we do not know how long he and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will remain in their jobs. The frequency of turnover would suggest it will not be long before the knives are out again. Such political interference is easy to justify when a change to ratings regulations simultaneously changes engineers regulations. These examples could have been prevented if AMSA would revert to a separate marine audit just for marine engineer qualifications, as previously existed. This bill seeks to make that a mandatory requirement. Let us get the politics out of this and keep the standards high.


Turning to the second of these government mistakes, AMSA, apparently due to political interference from Minister Albanese and his factional colleagues the MUA, have abandoned the considered engineering reforms they had on 22 October 2009 agreed to with the Australian Institute of Marine and Power engineers. Here we go—flip flop again. Those reforms included an agreement that the new Marine Order must require AMSA to not just turn away applicants who had the wrong trade to be an engineer but must instead require case-by-case evaluation of post-trade experience to help make up workshop efficiency and to evaluate alternative trades. Those reforms also included a breakthrough undertaking that would assess the maintenance experience of class 3 state certified engineers as a substitute for the possession of an approved engineering trade and thereby allow them access to AMSA certification.


These case-by-case assessments would require decisions about marine engineering qualifications to be made not by non-engineering managers but only by suitably qualified AMSA engineer examiners—and this too has been agreed to by the AMSA chief executive officer. But after political interference with AMSA, the authority suddenly changed its mind. It walked away from the agreement with the marine engineers, who were holding discussions in good faith, once suspicions were aroused as to why this was so—but walk away it did. The result is hundreds of Australians with not quite the right trade are turned away from a highly skilled future career now that engineering reforms have not been progressed. This bill addresses this and requires AMSA to implement what it agreed to.


I said at the outset this legislation seeks to address three government mistakes. This is the third. It has enormously reduced applications of Marine Orders part 3 as a result of the repeal of the Navigation Act 1912. The Navigation Act 1912 covered all Australian ships that traded internationally or between the states. Astonishingly, its replacement, the Navigation Act 2012, applies only to ships that trade internationally. Why is that so? Let me elaborate. Vessels that trade between the states are now covered by the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012, which sets much lower safety training and certification standards. In fact, this new act further reduces standards compared to those applicable under the state laws this new act replaces. That is why the Marine Engineer Qualifications Bill 2013 is necessary to mitigate in some small way both these reductions in marine engineer standards.


If passed by parliament, the Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill 2013 would require regulations issued pursuant to the Navigation Act 2012, to the extent they deal with marine engineering training certification matters, to implement and give effect to the 15 standards set out in the bill. The same would apply with respect to the regulation issued pursuant to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012, which deals with vessels of at least 3,000-kilowatt propulsion power or 500 gross registered tons. The redraft of the Navigation Act 1912 was necessary because the Navigation Act 1912 only applied to trading vessels during the time they were on an interstate or overseas voyage. That definition does not include an oil and gas industry vessel, which, of course, had not been contemplated in 1912.


In relation to Australia's substantial oil and gas industry, parliament tried to resolve this with a later amendment whereby section 283G attempted to be deem a foreign registered offshore industry vessel to be covered by the provisions of the Navigation Act 1912 as if it were registered in Australia and not registered in any other country. But AMSA's view, based on Crown law advice, was that the deficiencies of a section 2 application of the act—that is, only covered trading vessels—could not be overcome by parliament's deeming provision. So Minister Albanese, now Deputy Prime Minister Albanese, dealt with these deficiencies in the Navigation Act 1912 by having it completely redrafted. As a result, does the new Navigation Act 2012 cover commercial vessels engaged in Australia's offshore oil and gas industry in our claimed Exclusive Economic Zone? The answer to that question is: no, it clearly does not. Even Australian based companies like Farstad Shipping in Melbourne and Swire Pacific in Perth, which actually own their offshore vessels, find it much cheaper to not register or flag them in Australia, so the Navigation Act 2012 has little application. I will use an analogy: if you wanted to run a trucking business from Melbourne to Brisbane, you would have to register your truck in Australia and comply with Australian regulations. That is obvious; that is the law. But there is nothing in the Navigation Act 2012 or the national law that requires anyone to register their ships in Australia to conduct a commercial shipping business from Melbourne to Brisbane. I will repeat that because we are now getting to the crux of this whole debate. The much vaunted Navigation Act 2012 does not require anyone to register their ships in Australia to conduct a commercial shipping business from Melbourne to Brisbane. But wait, there is more. Nothing in the Navigation Act 2012 or the national law will require anyone to register their ships in Australia to operate commercial oil and gas vessels in our oilfields in our claimed Exclusive Economic Zone.


The Navigation Act 2012 expressly only covers ships that trade from Australia to international destinations. How many would that cover, you ask. Would it cover 50, 100 or 150 perhaps? No, there are only seven such ships in Australia, just seven—that is all. The Navigation Act 2012, AMSA claims, will cover more vessels than this but it just is not so. All the other ships that were covered by the Navigation Act 1912 will now fall through to a lesser safety regulatory standard under our state based regulatory system under the new national law.


The effect of section 9 of the Navigation Act 2012 will be that the offences and penalties of the legislation only apply to a foreign vessel while it is in an Australian port or entering or leaving an Australian port or internal waters such as rivers, lakes or a territorial sea other than in the course of innocent passage but not when that vessel is out in the Australian oilfields in our claimed Exclusive Economic Zone.


Absurdly, even if Farstad or Swires chose to reregister their oil and gas vessels in Australia, the default position is that they would not be covered by the Navigation Act 2012 because it only covers Australian registered ships while they are proceeding on an overseas voyage. Instead, the default position is that the Australian registered offshore oil and gas vessel would be covered by the national law and the lesser safety training certification standards it now introduces. That is what this legislation is trying to address. There is an ability to voluntarily opt-in to be regulated by the Navigation Act 2012. In other words, it is your choice. Isn't that like telling a motorist that the speed limit is 100 kilometres per hour and he can choose to drive to that limit if he wants to? This is clearly a flaw. 


Federal and complementary state legislation has been passed by parliament to empower AMSA as the nation's single maritime jurisdiction for commercial vessels, and it was intended that the lower-safety-standard states be brought up to the standard of the better regulated states in a new national law. If that had happened we would not be here talking about it today. But that is not the scenario in front of us. Instead of every state adopting best practice, AMSA has taken the best states down to the lowest common denominator—that is, the hands-off, self-regulatory Queensland model, where the vessel owner, not the independent regulator, decides the manning and certificate requirements and decides whether his vessel is seaworthy. That is some regulation?—it is not.


Under the existing state system the lower safety standards of the states are replaced by the higher standards of the Navigation Act 1912 whenever a vessel crosses a state border, and that is consistent with international practice, where a ship voyage of more than 1,000 kilometres would normally cross a national border and trigger equivalent safety standards.


However, the new national law will no longer do this. From 1 July 2013 a vessel will be able to sail out of Port Phillip Bay, turn left and sail all the way around Australia on a voyage of more than 60,000 kilometres before returning to Melbourne, without triggering the higher Marine Order 3 standards that would currently apply once it crossed a state boundary. Such a voyage is the equivalent of three around-the-world voyages, yet AMSA will no longer apply the higher safety training/certification standards. Safety on commercial vessels will be reduced as a consequence.


Examples of how the national law standards are less than those under the Navigation Act 2012 and MO3 include that the national law counts only half the defined propulsion power in determining the level of training and certification required for a given vessel. It no longer triggers Navigation Act standards when a vessel exits state waters, does not mandate the three-year training requirement for a marine engineer watchkeeper, does not mandate AMSA oral examinations, does not ensure AMSA directly audits college course providers, and does not maintain the academic entry standards of engineer cadets.


Today I have attempted to give you an overview of what the Marine Engineer Qualification Bill seeks to address. It is about retraining, safety standards and certifications. It is about reducing union interference in our shipping industry. It is about jobs for Australians and proper regulation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2013-06-27,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:55):  I rise to oppose the Marine Engineers Qualification Bill 2013. I must say that this is one of the more bizarre contributions I have heard from Senator Williams, and I have heard some bizarre contributions from Senator Williams in my time in the Senate. Here we have—and I say this with great affection, Senator Williams—a cow cocky from Inverell pontificating about maritime safety. I do not think Senator Williams saw the sea or a boat until he was about 24 years old, but now he is an expert on maritime safety.


On one hand he is arguing that this is about union power and union interference, and on the other hand he is arguing the speaking-note points from the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. What is going on? There is a whale in the bay, somewhere, Senator Williams, and I am sure we will find it.


I am not sure if they have opened a port in Inverell! Maybe this is one of the National Party's great ideas: 'We're going to open up the north.' Maybe they are going to build a canal from Sydney Harbour up to Inverell, and Senator Williams will be the expert on marine safety! Give us a break!


This is even more bizarre. Here we have the so-called coalition, who talk about getting rid of union influence and union power, standing here running the speaking notes for the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. I have no problem with that. That is fine, but do not be a hypocrite. Do not bring hypocrisy into this.


I really do not know why you have introduced this bill, to be honest. There is already a bill in the lower house, still to be discussed. We are still to see the details, and yet here we have a bill being introduced by the cow cocky from Inverell on behalf of the maritime industry in Australia. What is going on? There is a whale in the bay here; there is no risk about that, Senator Williams. We will find out what it is about. We will search out what this is about.


But let's go to the serious points on this. I would be one of the few senators in this place who have 'served their time', in the old colloquialism. I served my time as a fitter and engineer in Scotland. And I was a time-served tradesperson.



An opposition senator interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Richardson—I am sorry, that should have been 'Senator Ronaldson'—you were lucky to get me here, bringing my talents and my skills here—




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Cameron referred to Senator Ronaldson as Senator Richardson. Senator Richardson was the one on their side who used to be here counting numbers like they have been doing in the last couple of days—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  That is not a point of order. Senator Cameron did correct himself.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Ronaldson, I profusely apologise. I think it was because I was watching a lot of the former Senator Richardson last night. So I think you could understand and forgive me for that indiscretion. But let's get back to the sheep shearer from Inverell.


As I said, I am one of the few in this place who have actually served an apprenticeship. I was a union organiser, up to the nation secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. In that time, I went through the whole process of helping to move Australian industry from the old time-served approach that I worked under to a competency based standard where if you could demonstrate your competencies you could access payment for your skills. I do not want people to have to go to back to what I had to do, which was serve 4½ years as an apprentice—and when I started off, my apprenticeship was five years, but it went to 4½ years during my apprenticeship. After four years, I was doing the work that tradesmen were doing in the place that I was serving my time but being paid a fifth-year apprentice's rate of pay. But I had the competencies; I had the skills. I had been there for four years. What Senator Williams is trying to do with this bill—and I am not sure that this is all he is trying to do—is say to people, 'If you've got the skills, you shouldn't be paid for them.' As a strong trade unionist, I believe that if you have the skills and the ability and the qualifications you should be paid for them.


What is going on here—and you heard Senator Williams start off—is not about skills and training. Rather, it is a pretty blatant attack on the government. I am okay about attacks on the government. I think that I can look after myself in this place and I will continue to do that.



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  So Senator Cash is now an expert on the maritime industry? Senator Cash, you should take one of those pills. Then you might feel a bit better. You are always a bit agitated when you are in here. You should really get that anger stuff under control.


What we need to do here is look at the facts. We have a National Party member supporting a small union. It is a good union; I do not have a problem with that union—it is trying to safeguard what it sees as an issue for its members. I think that it is wrong in this issue, because we should move to competency based standards. It is what is happening around the rest of the world and all over Australia. I will tell you, Senator Williams, that you know as well as I do that, if you support the principle of this bill and that is coalition policy, then what you will be doing as a coalition—on the basis of a lack of understanding about how competency based standards work—is threatening the capacity of this country to train young Australians for the jobs of the future. And you nodded, Senator Williams, so you agree. We find out a little about why you move this bill.


What would happen if this passed would be more 457 visas. Your bill would mean that there would be little or no flexibility in the training system in the maritime area. If there was any technological change—and technological change is a feature of industries including the maritime industry—then we would have to come to parliament and get an act of parliament passed to allow the training system to reflect the technological change that has taken place in the industry. How dumb is that? How old-fashioned is that? Why would the coalition be supporting that type of approach? It just does not make sense. If this bill went through, one of the other implications would be that every engineer in the country working in the maritime sector would have to be retrained. They would have to have their certificates assured. That would mean a huge a cost to the industry and could bring the industry to a halt. What is this about?


Normally, if a bill is to be brought to the Senate, we have a process in which there is some discussion about the bill so that we can work out the rules of engagement, if you like, learn what the bill is about, come to understand where the issues are and then engage on those issues. This has not been done in that way. This bill has been brought in here without any consultation or discussion and put on the table by the coalition. It is a bill that is not in the interests of individual engineers or workers in the industry or the industry generally. And it is a bill that is not in the national interest. What is going on? I have never seen a bill come here that would have such bad effects on the productive performance and safety of an industry and on the capacity for workers in the industry to work their way up in that industry.


This bill is about a blockage on workers progressing through and increasing their skills. I have been there as a fitter. I have seen engineers trying to block fitters from getting access to skills and access to wider work on the job. Anyway, I have always thought that an engineer is simply a fitter with a huge ego. I have worked with them, Senator Williams. The people who do the work on the job are the fitters. The engineers ponce around there from time to time while the fitters get out and do the job. I am biased on that, because I am a fitter.


Anyway, I want to get back to this issue about safety, because I will not come in here and be accused of not dealing with the issue of safety. This government is a government that has actually taken safety seriously. We have consulted on every aspect of safety with industry and with unions—something those on the other side of the chamber have never done. You hear them—and I will not be lectured by the coalition on safety—and they have suddenly discovered asbestos, now that there is an issue with Telstra. They have suddenly discovered that asbestos is a problem. Yet when I was national secretary of the AMWU we were trying to get asbestos banned for years and the coalition would not ban asbestos. It was one of the worst killers of working people in this country, inflicting people with horrible deadly diseases, and they would not ban it. When I was the national secretary of the union, the coalition would not call a ban on asbestos. They wanted consultation after consultation after consultation. So do not come in here, Senator Williams, lecturing me or the government on the issue of safety. Look back at the record of the coalition on safety.


I do not know what is going on here, but obviously somehow or other you got AIMPE's speakers notes on this bill. And are you have faithfully and very competently read those speakers notes to the chamber. So, when you ring AIMPE or they ring you, you will get the tick. But I do not accept the proposition that you are putting up about being a member of the MUA—and I think this is what it is all about. Senator Williams, the MUA are here to stay; just get that through your head. The MUA are here. They represent workers in the maritime industry and do a great job representing workers in the maritime industry. We know the coalition despises the MUA because they look after workers. We know the coalition put the dogs on the docks. We know the coalition put the security guards, with their headgear on, on the docks and threw workers off the job. That is your concern for the maritime industry—nothing but a blatant attack on working people in this country. So don't come in here saying you are concerned about safety standards in the maritime industry, that you are concerned about workers having an opportunity to actually gain a trade or have time-served standards. Time-served standards are a thing of the past—like the National Party, which is a bigger thing of the past in its own right.


Anyway, you have to understand what you are talking about, Senator Williams. I spent years as the national secretary of the AMWU, working through competency based standards for workers in the manufacturing industry. That has been a boon to individual workers and to the industry. It was the right thing to do, and we must, in my view, ensure that the national standards that are being put in place are the correct standards, that there is proper overview of those standards and that the standards meet the needs of workers and industry to have a productive and effective industry with basic skills and to have high skills available to all workers. When I think about what the issue is, it is that you do not like the MUA, so we should not spend any time on these issues. An MUA member who is a cook on an oil rig getting proper skills to make sure the oil rig does not close down because the cook has poisoned the crew—don't do that, that's not on! The cook is MUA, so don't let the cook get on with getting some classification skills or some competency standards! There are other workers at oil rigs and on ships in this country, and they do have the capacity, in my view—and should have the capacity, if they have picked up skills over the years—to have those skills recognised. It is called RPL, recognition of prior learning, which is recognised all over in competency based standards. What this bill would do is stop ordinary Australians getting access to those skills so that jobs could be performed. It is saying: put skilled jobs in the maritime industry on the shortage-of-skills list and let's bring in more 457 workers from overseas.


I think that is what is really at the bottom of this; I think that is what it is. It is about trying to restrict the skills in this country so that we need to bring more workers in from overseas. Well, I am not xenophobic. Why would I be xenophobic? I have been lucky enough to come here from Scotland. In case anyone didn't recognise it, I do not quite have a full Aussie accent. I am getting there—fair dinkum, I am. But this is about the coalition's position. This is about what they want. They want 457 workers. They say they want the skilled migration system in this country to be based on 457 workers. So what do you do? You get some 457 worker, you bring them in and the boss says, 'If you play up, join the union or demand more than I'm prepared to give you, then you're on the next boat or the next plane out of here.' That is what this mob wants. And this bill will reinforce it, because it will restrict the achievement of skills of workers in the industry, and we should oppose it—and we are opposing it.


So Senator Williams, I do not think the Sydney to Inverell canal is going to be built very quickly. If we were ever unlucky enough to have a coalition government in this place, maybe you would muscle up on Mr Abbott and say, 'We've got to build the Sydney to Inverell canal, because I want you to set me up as the guru for training for the maritime industry! I'm only a broken down shearer, but I want to be the guru on maritime industry training!' Mate, you hadn't seen a ship until you were 24 years old. Give us a break! And that is when you went for a trip on the ferry on Sydney Harbour, no doubt wearing a hat with the corks on it. I saw that photo of you on your first trip on Sydney Harbour—a 24-year-old, cow cocky sheep shearer, but not a maritime engineer. He is a good bloke, 'Wacka', but he is a bit wacko on some things, especially this! Mate, you should stick to your knitting. You just do not understand it. (Time expired)

"Thorp, Sen Lin",ALP,2013-06-27,"



Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (10:23):  As an educationalist, I find it disturbing that this place is being used to consider quite a retrograde step in educational history. There is a movement in education that has been going on since the late eighties, with a move from prescriptive assessment to descriptive assessment, and from time based learning to competency based learning. It is recognising what learning is. It is recognising that individuals learn at different paces and in different methods to come to the same place, which is a level of competency in a particular area. Time based learning is going back to the past. Time based learning presumes that you have a group of students—whether they be young school students or people who are studying, in this case, to be engineers—who are all in the same room, at the same time, with the same teacher, and, at the end of that particular period of time, they are all qualified to do a particular task. That is not the way education works today. Education works today on the acquiring of skills. It does not matter whether it be about learning how to be a barista or how to be a neurosurgeon. I, for one, would prefer, if I were to be under the knife in a serious operation, to know that that particular individual had not just served time at university for a number of years but had reached the level of competency that they deserve. This is what this is all about.


Going along with the analogy of medical training, in a different job I worked for the medical school of Tasmania. My task was to review the curriculum of the six-year course for all students doing a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Medical Science. What became very clear during that exercise was that so much of that training was time based and it needed to move. Over the years, more and more had been added to the curriculum, based simply on facts and figures, rote learning, if you like, and it needed in to be brought up to the end of the 20th century, as it was then—this was back in the 1990s. It was a culling of the unnecessary rote learning by medical students of thousands and thousands of unnecessary facts and a move to a teaching model that meant that those students were learning skills that would fit them to make decisions into the future.


Another thing that became disturbingly obvious during that time was that there can be a tendency amongst some professions—and the medical fraternity can be accused of this on occasion, and I strongly suspect that the group behind this particular legislation are of a similar mind—that a closed shop can suit some people. It can suit to have the group of people who have those skills kept quite small because then they can determine their price in the marketplace. It is a very retrograde step to introduce these kinds of out-of-date standards. It is contrary to modern training practices, and it is very inconsistent with global practices. It is contrary to moves that have been made to current Australian government policy reform directions, because the Australian government is committed to introducing competency based progression in Australian apprenticeships and traineeships. There is a global recognition in the educational fraternity that competency based learning is the way to go.


The same kinds of changes have been made in the areas of assessment. There was a time when assessment was purely and simply on a pass/fail. We do not do that anymore. We do not just pass/fail kids. We look at describing what they have achieved over a period of time and describing that achievement on their assessment. That assessment then stops being something that can cruel the life opportunities of a student and actually becomes a tool for teaching. It means that the teacher has a clear description of the abilities and competencies of their students. They can also clearly identify where those gaps are and teach specifically to them. Gone are the days where we simply say, 'For you to be in high school, you just go for six years, and we move you on to high school after you have done your time.' In Tasmania now, a much more modern method of teaching and assessment occurs, whereby students are assessed against the competencies they have achieved. So, within the same age group of students, you can have real recognition of the variety and richness of the achievement of students in those areas.


Those general points about competency based learning as opposed to time serving can be applied generally across all areas of education. But we are talking here, specifically, about how it applies in the area of marine education. Members here may not know that Tasmania is home to the Australian Maritime College. The Maritime College is based in Launceston, a city in the north of the state, and it was due to the efforts of a very well-respected Labor politician, Lance Barnard, that that particular institution came to Tasmania. It has served not just Tasmania but also the broader educational community well for many years now. In fact, it boasts some of the most modern teaching techniques in the world. It is a place that people spend a lot of time and effort trying to get into, such as people from India, from all over South-East Asia and from the United States. They go there because they know they are going to get the very, very best maritime education.


It is globally recognised as a centre of excellence, it has a multimillion-dollar suite of specialist teaching, learning and research facilities and, as I have said, it is internationally acclaimed. It is utilised by government bodies and maritime related businesses worldwide. What is really important is that the staff of the Australian Maritime College are very highly experienced, very highly respected and have very, very strong industry links. They know what they are doing at the Australian Maritime College, and they do not need a draconian piece of legislation to tell them how to teach. I think they would be aghast to know that the college is being hijacked for the quite narrow set of needs of one particular group in the community.


The AMC has two campuses. The main campus is in Newnham, which is a suburb of Launceston. I have had the privilege of visiting that institution on many occasions. If senators ever get the opportunity to visit the Australian Maritime College, I think they would be very impressed by the very high standard of education that that place provides. Amongst other things on the campus is an enormous pool area, which would be almost as tall as this chamber, and would have about the same floor area. The whole area can be darkened and then can be turned into a storm at sea. Waves can be whipped up; the sounds of the wind and the terror of being at sea can be conjured up in this setting. Lifeboats are then thrown in and man overboard procedures can be practised. It is quite phenomenal to see. The college does the most amazing research on wave generation with their equipment. I do not pretend to be technologically up with all of it but, believe me, it is extremely impressive.


They have some of the world's best and most innovative ship simulators available. One can virtually stand on the deck of a ship and have the complete experience of controlling that ship. There are a variety of vessel types and sizes to choose from. They can also simulate the entry into some of the world's biggest and most important ports. For instance, you could take a multithousand-tonne ship into a big harbour, like New York Harbor. It is an extraordinary experience. The college produces some of the best qualified people in a whole variety of maritime based industries, including maritime engineers.


The other campus is at Beauty Point, which is a few kilometres up the western side of the Tamar River. Once you have travelled through all the beautiful wine areas, you reach the lovely area of Beauty Point, and that is where the field based activities of the Australian Maritime College occur.


At the college, through these two campuses, students are provided with very flexible course options. I will stress the word 'flexible' as being not time based, or rigid, or old-fashioned learning, but flexible course options with opportunities for full-time, part-time and even online distance study. Study can be about captaining a vessel, safeguarding the marine environment, designing advanced ocean engineering structures, farming seafood or keeping the world's goods moving. These courses are all provided through the Australian Maritime College.


I am quite confident that, if we were able to have any of the staff of the Australian Maritime College here today, they would be aghast to think that people who know very, very little about the subject are actually dictating to the teachers, to the college, to the professionals, to the experts, what they should teach. Why for the life of me we would try to dictate teaching styles through a piece of legislation is beyond me. To think that at any one point in time you would dictate what the education of a particular profession should be I find quite astonishing, because education moves all the time. We have constant innovation, not only in the actual direction and delivery of education but also in the matter that needs to be covered. Teachers and the industry itself need to be the ones that determine what goes on. This is true of the Australian Maritime College as it delivers the maritime engineering courses.


The Australian Maritime College also introduces vocational certificates at many levels, bachelor degrees and diplomas, and postgraduate certificates and degrees, including doctorates. The college has an emphasis on small class sizes and very direct learning. Consequently, the graduates of the Australian Maritime College are sought after worldwide. There are alumni across 56 different countries. This is a centre of excellence that everyone here can be proud of.


We know that the sectors of offshore marine and maritime are exciting new frontiers, not just for Australia but for the whole world. We must not be using this place to try to compromise the adaptability and effectiveness of the regulatory regime for maritime safety as has been established by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The passage of this bill would mean that Australia would be inconsistent with the International Maritime Organization's training standards, to which we are a signatory. The most serious and immediate effect of the Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill 2013 without amendment is the potential impact on all existing qualification certificates. Due to the complex interaction with other legislation and the absence of transitional provisions, I am told that about 23,000 current qualifications would be rendered invalid. I am sure it is not the intention of my honourable colleagues opposite to render the marine industry qualifications of 23,000 people null and void. What do we have here to ensure that unqualified persons will be able to serve as seafarers? The bill does not set minimum standards and it does not prevent any reduction in those standards; it only enacts a time served approach to maritime engineering qualifications. It increases the amount of regulation on the industry, overrides the effect of three other Commonwealth acts passed unanimously by the parliament and serves to increase the costs for shipping in Australia. Why would anyone want to do this?


The core of it comes down to what we were talking about previously: a very small group—approximately 11 per cent of the maritime engineer industry—wanting to have a stranglehold on the people they think are fit to be part of their group. How many times have you heard conversations about how different royal colleges restrict numbers, whether it be in ophthalmology, obstetrics, gynaecology or general surgery? It makes it very difficult for people to enter and be one of their rank. They do it for a very clear reason, in my opinion, and that is to have a closed shop that they can manipulate for their own purposes. This is not supported by educationalists, it is not supported by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and it is not supported by fair-minded people who recognise that educational practice has changed. It is draconian, backward and narrow.


Here we are on the second last day of the sitting of the Senate, with many important pieces of legislation we should be dealing with, and yet the valuable time of the Senate is being used in a cynical and manipulative way by members opposite. I can only say I am extremely disappointed that that is the case. We should not have to be doing this at this time. I understood that there were, in fact, other pieces of legislation to be discussed today. There has been a lot of fuss and noise in this place about guillotining debate and proper process not being followed, and yet when we do have a process agreed to, when we do have agreement amongst all people in this place that particular legislation will be debated, at the last minute a change is made, not because the legislation is considered to be extremely important, not because members opposite genuinely believe that the best interests of this country are going to be served by the passing of this legislation—no; it is cynical and, quite frankly, beneath the dignity of this place. I would not like to see this place being party to a turning back of the educational clock for any particular area, whether that is for apprentices, university graduates, teachers, doctors or anybody else. We have to move forward progressively in education in this country, not backwards. For that reason, I will not be supporting the legislation.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2013-06-27,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (10:42):  I too wish to make my contribution to the Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill 2013. I would like to follow on from my colleague Senator Thorp's comments. I too looked at the Order of Business this morning and saw that there were a couple of bills mentioned for general business today—one about migration and one about Fair Work—which I think will attract a lot of conversation, and a lot of conversation should be had at this stage of the parliamentary cycle. We should be talking about the migration amendment and Fair Work, but I find that all of a sudden this bill has popped up out of nowhere. It has been in the other House. I believe it was introduced by the member for Denison, Mr Wilkie. I have no doubt that to Mr Wilkie it was a matter of extreme importance, and no-one would argue that, but there must be some cunning plan from those opposite that this was not on the agenda for today and somehow now it is. Mr Wilkie's motives are more than honourable, but unfortunately some unforeseen circumstances would come out of this bill, should this bill pass as it is, without amendment.


As with all bills, it is most important that we have a moment of thought about the history of one of Australia's greatest industries. I never played a direct role in shipping—I am proudly a boat owner, but that does not rate anywhere amongst Australia's maritime industry, seafarers and waterside workers. Of course, marine engineers play a very important role. I would like to think about this for a moment and share with the Senate some thoughts I have about just how important shipping is to this great nation. It is a no-brainer that we know we are an island and without shipping we would not be in the fantastic position we are in. Shipping not only imports numerous items that we take for granted, such as clothing, white goods and certain cars—although I wish more were made here in Australia, but unfortunately that is not the case—but also there are our exports.


We all know, particularly those of us who come from the great state of Western Australia, the importance of the mining industry to Australia's future and present and also to our productivity and our economy. But it does not matter how great our materials or commodities are or how good and efficient we are at getting them out of the ground and moving them to the ports if we do not have efficient ports. We are succeeding at that particularly under this government and under the guidance of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Anthony Albanese. He honestly and truly gets the importance of efficient ports. We have to get the materials onto the ships to disperse them around the world. It does not take a lot to work out that, without shipping, we certainly would be in the dark ages.


We have to have a safe and sustainable shipping industry. Unfortunately, shipping has attracted a lot of attention for the wrong reasons over the years. Over the years we have heard about the well-known shame and scam of flags of convenience. There is absolutely no argument that a lot of places in the world do not have a seafaring industry as respectable and reputable as Australia's. The consequences that this bill without amendment could have for our shipping industry could be devastating. They could be devastating not only to lives but to our environment. Particularly those of us who are on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, which I proudly chair, know that there are numerous examples around this country of what happens when our shipping industry is somehow not as safe as it could be. For a lot of people the first thought that comes to their mind, after loss of life, is the environmental damage along the Great Barrier Reef. It would be absolutely frightening to think what could happen if we were to see any more major catastrophes in shipping.


I want to talk about something close to my heart. For those of you who do not know, Carnarvon is a wonderful diverse little town some 970 kilometres north of Perth. I would give you the exact kilometres but I cannot remember through the haze of looking at the speedo every week on my way to Carnarvon, through Carnarvon and past Carnarvon coming back from Darwin. But, trust me, it is around 970 kilometres. Just north of Carnarvon there is a small operation, Lake MacLeod. It is a salt mine. Fortunately it is still a viable salt mine. It has been a salt mine for a number of years. I would not want to guess how long, but it has been well over 25 years. They export salt to all ports around the world. We had a seafaring accident north of Carnarvon and Lake MacLeod. This was only in the early 1990s. It was not carrying salt, but a ship ran up on the rocks and the massive oil spill that followed actually woke a lot of us up to the devastating effects on our environment. When these massive ships hit rock and run aground it is quite frightening.


But, sadly, we are still seeing maritime disasters, with none more vivid in our minds or our children's minds than that of the cruise liner just off Italy recently. I know that disaster was not created by a drop in the standards of maritime engineers, but the truth of the matter is that one simple mistake in shipping can have a disastrous outcome for the environment and life.


I am sure Mr Wilkie's thoughts on this are pure. There is no doubt about that. But we must amend the bill. We must amend the bill to deliver on its intent—and that is to protect the integrity of our marine engineers and their qualifications. As Senator Thorp touched on, some 23,000 qualifications could be made null and void—if that is the correct terminology—if this bill were to pass without amendment.


Let us look further back into our proud maritime history. Let us not forget that our history is closely related to the global story of people crossing oceans. The first people to engineer ocean-going vessels capable of travelling thousands of kilometres were Pacific Island mariners. They were the first truly maritime people. Like the Torres Strait Islanders, the Pacific mariners used double outrigger canoes and a sail to cross oceans with strong currents. Several thousand years later, the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Spanish and other westerners from England and Europe made similar journeys around the globe to the southern hemisphere. From 1600 onwards—and possibly earlier—Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders traded with fishermen from Makassar, Indonesia, who harvested trepang from Australia's northern coastlines, selling them to the Chinese.


I remember not all that long ago, around 2005 or 2006, the Indonesians were still harvesting trepang, but they were harvesting them in Australian waters. If I remember rightly, I was sitting on that side of the chamber and the minister at the time was none other than Senator Ian Macdonald from Queensland. It created enormous dramas. It created massive dramas, particularly in Western Australia. Those poor fishermen were trying to survive, but they were harvesting trepang in our waters. Anyway, to cut a long story short, some changes were made to Australia's offshore rules. We had more planes out there. Then Senator Macdonald was relegated to the backbench. I just want to remind the Senate that the harvesting of trepang by Indonesian fishermen is still recent in our history.


Until 1950 Australia's history with trade, colonisation and settlement was dependent upon maritime sailing voyages. We all know that there is an abundance of diversity in Australia's maritime history. There were the early Dutch mariners, such as Dirk Hartog. We know what happened to poor Dirk off the coast of Western Australia, but there is an island that still bears his name. It is a wonderful island. Of course, there was Abel Tasman and the English navigators, like James Cook and Matthew Flinders, mapping the Australian coastline through to the commercial sealers, whalers and pearlers. And there were explorers like Douglas Mawson. So it is imperative for Australia to never forget the importance of the maritime industry to our trade. We need to have a safe and sustainable maritime industry.


One proud thing that Labor governments have hung their hat on for years and will always hang their hat on is that they are about improving standards in the workforce. We are a party that are proud of the fact that, for the 100-odd years that we have been around, we have stood for the virtues of training and qualifications that provide safe and healthy work areas so that members of the workforce can bid their family farewell in the morning and go to work knowing darn well that they will be back that evening because of the fantastic effort put into occupational health and safety. Occupational health and safety standards are not limited just to the shop floor or to a vehicle; they apply to our ships.


I would like to take the opportunity to remind those who may be listening that the opposition earlier tried to bring this debate to an end so we could not talk about this, but I am proud that I have got my opportunity. Going back to the nineties, and a previous life, I remember that one of the hats I wore was that of chairman of the road division of the Western Australian transport training council and the transport industry training council. I was also on the board. It was made up of employers in the road transport industry; representation from the unions, which was me; and of course educators. Those industry training councils and industry training boards were there so that both arms of the industrial sphere—employers and employees—could work together to deliver training outcomes that would deliver qualifications and trained personnel in the areas of road transport, warehousing and the like. I may be digressing a little bit, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens; would you please bear with me? We were an integral part of the maritime industry because we wanted safe warehouses and safe transport workers—safe forkies and truckies who got the freight to and from the wharf.


In 1999 or 2000 the then Prime Minister, John Howard—before he got full control of the Senate—could not wait. He had spent years deviously conniving on delivering shortcuts to his mates in big business—shortcuts around training, which was seen as a cost, not as an investment. As a father, I stand here proudly saying that I will always want my kids, your kids—all our kids into the future—to be trained. I want them to know that they can successfully use the machinery that they are in charge of or the machinery that is around them so that they have every opportunity to come home with all fingers and toes still in place. But it was John Howard who delivered on some slimy promise made in the backrooms or the boardrooms to his mates in big business. He said that, if any industry training council or industry training board had the audacity to have union representation on their committee or their board, he and his mates on that side of the chamber—a lot of them who are here now were not here then, but there are still quite a few—would deliver the hammer down on the top of those industry training councils and industry training boards. Their funding would then be ceased unless they removed the union representation. And here we go again.


Whenever there is a blue or an argument about decency and safety in workplaces, it is the workers who work with their employers. I will talk about the employers. The majority of employers are decent hardworking human beings who have taken a big punt in life. Whether they are employers in shipping or delicatessens or wherever they may be, part of employers' working family—it is not only the family structure at home—is their employees. I proudly say that the majority of employers that I have met would be welcome in my home.


It is an insult to working men and women, whether they be the business owner, the production manager, the operations manager, the supervisors or the boys and girls out on the floor or wherever, to think that they are not grown up enough to want to work together to have the safest work environment. Their employer, who had the intestinal fortitude years and years earlier to put everything they owned on the line—let us face it, most employers are not born with the gift of being given a fantastic enterprise—has gone out and done the hard yards. They have taken the big chance. They have put the family home on the line. They are the ones who have had the entrepreneurship to want to do better. They are also fantastic people who treat their workers as part of the family. But that Prime Minister thought it was just fantastic to insult these businesspeople, these business leaders, and union representatives, who were working together to do everything they could to have the safest working environment, by removing funding from the boards unless the union people were removed.


When I was with the industry training council in Western Australia it was headed by a wonderful woman named Debra Goostrey. I see Debra once a year now. Debra is with the Urban Development Institute of Australia. Good luck to them, because they have snaffled a fantastic person. Debra stood on her digs and said very clearly to me and to the employer representation from—what were they called then? They are now the Western Australian Road Transport Association; they had another name, which escapes me at the moment—Transport Forum WA. She said that they would not, and she would not, entertain the thought of losing her chair, which was me, on the road freight division, because of the insult. She would rather cop the loss in funding and she would go out of her way to find funding elsewhere. I can happily say that I was ably supported and abetted by the transport employer body, because they thought it was an absolute insult, a disgraceful episode. Fortunately, that part has been corrected. That ship that was on its side has been righted. We as a nation are now grown up enough—I hope we are grown up enough—to say that if we are going to fix it we are going to fix it together.


So, on that, when it comes to this bill, as I say: Mr Wilkie, it is good of heart—but it cannot go through without amendments. We have to do everything we can to ensure that Australia's maritime industry keeps its absolutely brilliant, high-quality record. We have to work with the union that represents the maritime engineers, and we have to put a few amendments through so that we do not have the unforeseen circumstances that this bill will deliver.


It would be a retrograde step for Australia to introduce outdated standards contrary to modern training practices and inconsistent with global standards. Time-served progression is contrary to current Australian government policy reform directions. The Australian government has committed to introducing competency based progression in Australian apprenticeships and traineeships—something that we hold to very proudly—and there is no embarrassment for me to say, as a Labor senator: the sooner we pump out more Australian trainees and Australian apprentices the better. As a nation we have found, over the years, that sometimes, sadly, it has been easier for employers to go overseas to seek to fill certain job descriptions. I have absolutely no dramas with a Western Australian senator saying that this nation was built on migration and that, sadly, we lack some of the skills we need. But I go one step further. We lack those skills because of the likes of John Howard's attitude to training and, unfortunately, some of those in industries in Australia who think that it is just so much easier to go overseas, rather than to create a training scheme and think: 'In four or five years time, I want Australian kids in those jobs; I want Australian trainees; I want Australian apprentices. I want to give Australian kids every opportunity to seek employment in their land.' And then there is no embarrassment in topping up with foreign workers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2013-06-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:02):  I rise to speak on the Marine Engineers Qualifications Bill 2013. The Australian Greens are pleased that this bill is before the Senate today. This is a bill which we supported in the House of Representatives, where it was introduced as a private member's bill, debated and recommended for a vote. Unfortunately, even though there is only one sitting day left in the House, the government has not brought the bill on for a vote there, even though the list of speakers was exhausted and, indeed, the House's selection committee recommended this bill for a vote back on 5 June. We look forward to this fully-debated bill going to a vote here in the Senate today.


Before I come to the particular provisions of this bill, I would just like to take this opportunity to reflect, at nearly the end of the 43rd Parliament, that there have been some excellent outcomes from this minority parliament and that those outcomes have been very good for the people of Australia. I think that, among all the recent media activity and debate, it has sometimes been easy to lose sight of that. Because of this minority parliament, we have seen $13 billion put into clean and renewable energy, which is an extremely important step for Australia in this very challenging 21st century. We have also seen that the tax-free threshold will be lifted to $18,200 for many, many people from the start of next year. I am also proud to say that the Greens have been able to negotiate that, from 1 January 2014, parents will be able to take their kids to the dentist and use their Medicare card to get free dental treatment. Just yesterday, through the hard work of the minority parliament, we saw the Gonski school funding reforms pass this Senate, providing the framework for needs-based funding of schools in Australia—a long-overdue and transformative change to the schools funding system in Australia of which I think all those involved can be justly proud. We have also seen a lifting in the standard of protection offered to firefighters around this country. Because of the minority parliament and the Greens' bill in the House of Representatives, we have been able to increase the protections for and compensation available to those firefighters. And now we have the opportunity to do more for the Australian community and lock in some further protections for people right across this country.


The Greens have been approached by members of the Maritime Union of Australia who have said that their long-running campaign for a national stevedoring code of practice, to ensure safety on the docks, was threatened to be stymied at the last minute and now may not happen at all as a result of the intervention of some large employers. One thing that we, here, could do right now is to enshrine the standards for our marine engineers.


First of all, I would just like to indicate what the basis of this bill is. This is a bill designed to prevent a reduction in marine engineering training and certification standards in Australia. This bill will do this by requiring that any marine regulations, such as marine orders, must be amended by the issuing authority so as to comply with and give effect to the existing Australian standards for engineering training and certification. This bill also implements the engineering improvements which were agreed to on 22 October 2009 between the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the AMSA, and the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, the AIMPE, and which include, among other things, the establishment of separate regulatory requirements and ratings to assist with regulatory certainty.


Importantly, with the passage of the Navigation Act 2012, existing Australian standards will no longer apply to a vessel in Australia's merchant trading fleet if the vessel does not trade internationally. However, only seven of the approximately 20 merchant ships left in the Australian fleet actually trade internationally, so the Navigation Act 2012 does not apply to the remainder of the Australian trading fleet. The Navigation Act 2012 also does not apply to the more than 150 commercial vessels which are currently engaged in the Australian oil and gas industry or to other relevant operations. So there is a problem.


The Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012, which I will refer to as the national law, has given rise to lower training and certification standards than those required by the Navigation Act. The national law sets lower standards. It counts only half the defined propulsion power in certifying the level of training and certification required for a given vessel. It no longer triggers Navigation Act standards when a vessel exits state waters. It does not mandate the three-year training requirement for a marine engineer watch-keeper. It does not mandate the AMSA oral examinations. It does not ensure that the AMSA directly audits college course providers. It does not maintain the academic entry standards for engineer cadets.


To ensure this reduction in training and certification requirements does not progress, the bill we are debating today proposes that, in addition to the seven vessels covered by the Navigation Act 2012, where a commercial vessel is either 500 or more gross registered tonnes or has propulsion power of 3,000 kilowatts or more the engineer on the vessel shall also be required to meet the marine engineer training and certification standards set out in this bill.


It is reassuring to know that this bill has been scrutinised, as is the requirement for all proposed legislation and regulations, by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a proud member. The committee and the statement of compatibility in relation to the bill noted that the bill engages with some important human rights. The bill engages with and recognises the right to enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work, as described in article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Article 7(b) makes particular mention of safe and healthy working conditions. This bill helps to ensure that all persons have the right to safe and healthy conditions at work by ensuring a minimum competency standard. Maritime working environments have the potential, of course, to be hazardous, and the competency of maritime workers can directly affect the health and safety of others. The bill was found to be compatible with human rights.


We have a good shipping industry in this country. It faces its challenges, as do shipping industries around the world. In Australia that is in part because successive governments have not understood the importance to our trade and to our defence, let alone our economy, of having a good Australian owned shipping industry. We have a safe shipping industry. It is safe for the people who work on the ships. It is safe for the people who are out at sea. And it has to be, and generally is, safe for our environment.


One of the reasons for that safety is the high standards and level of qualifications and professionalism of our marine and power engineers. We have a good track record. Unfortunately our good safety regime and track record has to be defended against attacks and undermining. We have seen some of those attacks in recent years with the attempt to reduce the minimum time of study required to become an engineer from three years to one year. We have been able to stop that. One thing that is worth noting, though, is that the attempt to reduce the time from three years to one year was, in essence, reneging on an agreement that had been reached with the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers.


The Greens have had the privilege of working closely with a range of workers and their unions, as well as with a range of organisations that might be described as craft unions. These are often smaller unions, organisations and professional institutes. They are often non-political and non-partisan in the sense that they do not necessarily hitch their wagon to a particular star but are prepared to work with those who will understand, listen to and advance their interests. When an organisation comes knocking on your door and says, 'There is a real concern about safety and we need you to stand up in parliament and fix it,' the Australian Greens are very happy to work with them. It is a fundamental responsibility of all of us in the parliament to be looking at what needs to occur in the national interest and to give a voice to those interests in the Australian community who look to us for leadership and look to us to rectify threats to safety.


There is a continuing move to erode protections and minimum standards, and we must always be vigilant in Australia. This is not about enshrining a closed shop. If anyone who is a member of another union, or not, wants to come in and work as an engineer they should be able to. But that should not come at the expense of reducing minimum standards, which are important for health, safety and the environment. The minimum standards should be the minimum standards, and whoever meets them can then go and get a job.


There are a number of things we are still waiting for from the government, but this legislation is something that we can implement right now. On behalf of the Australian Greens I commend this bill to the Senate and congratulate all members of the AIMPE on their advocacy.

The speech read as follows—



FAIR TRADE (AUSTRALIAN STANDARDS) BILL 2013


Today I introduce the Fair Trade (Australian Standards) Bill 2013.


Last week I introduced the first of a series of Fair Trade Bills that I hope will bring us closer to that mythical 'level playing field' we hear so much about with regards to our international trade agreements.


The Fair Trade (Workers' Rights) Bill was introduced with the hope that by addressing the pitiful situation of workers' rights in many of the countries with which we trade, Australia will be able to effect some manner of improvement in their conditions, while helping our own industries to become more competitive in our own domestic market.


Today I am pleased to be introducing the second of these Fair Trade Bills.


Just as the rights of workers in so many countries are sub-standard by Australian standards so too we find that many of the products being exported from countries we trade with fail to meet Australian Standards. Under current regulations the import of these products is permitted provided they are brought up to the necessary standard level before being used or on sold within Australia. 


As we know there is little policing of these regulations and as a result sub-standard and dangerous products are regularly released into the Australian workplaces and marketplaces, often with tragic results. The immediate finger of blame can be pointed at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC); but while policing of these regulations does fall to their department; can we honestly expect them to examine every article that enters the country without vastly increasing their administrative budget and workforce ?


I could give example after example of cases where workplace injuries have occurred as a result of sub-standard products being released into the Australian market without having been examined by the ACCC. However, this Bill is not an exercise in berating the ACCC for failing to act or of criticising the government for not dramatically increasing their workforce. This Bill is directed at the Trade negotiations we hold with other countries and the conditions we are prepared to bargain away.


As I said when introducing the Fair Trade (Workers' Rights) Bill, many will say this Bill cannot work because we cannot legislate for countries other than Australia. Again I remind Senators that, while that statement is essentially true, that is not what this Bill seeks to do. After all, unless we have given up all control of our borders, we can legislate on which products we accept into this country and the circumstances under which we will accept them.


The intent of this Bill is simply to ensure that every step possible is taken to comply with the necessary Australian Standards before a product is released onto the Australian marketplace or workplace. Likewise, if an Australian company exports goods to another country, that company should be required to meet local product standards.


At present there are very few requirements for an overseas company to comply with Australian Standards when exporting their products to our shores. Once the product leaves their country their obligations generally cease and it becomes the responsibility of the Australian importer to comply with the regulations to bring the product up to the necessary standards.


Time and again we see importers who fail to meet those requirements and who, once their faulty products are detected, fold up leaving little or no recourse for the Australian consumer. Shortly after another, similar importer sets up business, importing similar or identical goods, and the process starts up again.


The lack of policing leaves workers and consumers at the mercy of shonky operators who import substandard goods and, having decided that a quick profit makes more sense than a safe marketplace, they put lives and livelihoods at risk.


And let's not forget the thousands of genuine businesses across our country who are trying to comply with all necessary regulations and who are committed to selling only those products that meet Australian Standards. How much do they suffer because their business can't compete with these irresponsible importers?


Substandard products do not only injure Australian workers and consumers, they also injure Australian businesses who are trying to compete against all odds in what is ridiculously referred to as a level playing field.


Surely at some point the manufacturer, the overseas exporter, must be held accountable. To produce a product that is acceptable in their own country is their own business; but to produce a product that is acceptable in our country is both our and their business. Ensuring their products are imported by reputable businesses and are on sold only after they have complied with local regulations is simply good business.


The Fair Trade (Australian Standards) Bill 2013 calls for all future trade agreements to include a binding requirement (binding on all parties involved) that goods sold to a purchaser located in one country by a company or entity located in the other country, must comply with all applicable product standards that apply in the purchasers country or if they do not comply – the company or entity selling the products must ensure that the goods are improved to standards that comply with all applicable product standards.


In other words, any product imported to Australia from a country we have a signed agreement with must be guaranteed by the exporting country, to comply with Australian Standards before being used or on sold in Australia. For our part Australia will agree to do the same with regards products we export to their country.


It is hoped that with this requirement in place, companies exporting to Australia will see the benefit in trading only with reputable importers who will bring their products up to standard or will improve their procedures to ensure the goods are up to standard before reaching our shores.


While it is understood that it is difficult to force an overseas company to comply with many of our domestic regulations, the fact that this would be a binding arrangement in a trade agreement means that by not complying with these requirements the exporting company could lose lucrative contracts to competitors who are prepared to abide by the regulations.


Likewise, with pressure on exporting companies to use reputable importers to guarantee long term compliance with the regulations rather than using disreputable importers whose desire for quick profits will damage the standing of the exporter by leading to a breach in the regulations; local importers will have less competition from the 'shonky' operators and will be better able to compete in the local marketplace.


Mr President, again I say there is no level playing field. We know it and the Australian people know it. And what's worse our international competitors know it and are only too glad to exploit it.


Today, instead of raising the standards of imported goods to the levels of quality equal to that of Australian manufacturers, we are expecting Australian producers to compete against low quality goods that are exported by overseas companies with little or no obligation for the final standard of that product. This position is untenable and grossly unfair to Australian consumers, Australian workers and Australian businesses. 


While this Bill cannot deal with all the problems we face from cheap imports and under policing, I am hopeful it can go some way towards improving the situation and at least move us towards a more competitive position in our own country.

The speech read as follows—



RESERVE BANK AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD) BILL 2013


Rural and regional Australia is struggling. We have heard over and over again the challenges communities are facing, and how they are trying to survive. In recent years, they have borne the brunt of extreme weather events, a high Australian dollar, and a lack of support from State, Territory and Federal Governments.


This bill, which mirrors that introduced in the House by the Member for Kennedy, the Hon. Bob Katter MP, seeks to establish a specific board under the umbrella of the Reserve Bank. The aim of this board is to aid reconstruction and development in rural and regional areas.


In a sense, the proposed board is similar to the Commonwealth Development Bank, which was established in 1960. Its aim was to provide loans to individuals and businesses in the primary and secondary industry sectors, where that support would lead to an increase in productivity and wasn't otherwise available to the applicants.


Rural and regional areas are, in many ways, the lifeblood of our country. Certainly, our farmers play an incredibly important role both in our economy and our national security. Without their produce, we are all at risk.


People living in rural and regional areas face challenges on almost every front. In terms of healthcare, of education, of aged care, and of employment, they have to fight to be counted.


If rural and regional communities do not receive the support they so desperately need, the impact on the rest of Australia will be significant, in both economic and cultural terms.


It is time to overhaul our attitude in this area. Government grants and programs are no longer enough. Instead, we need to establish a body that has the power to make a real, long term difference, such as the board proposed in this bill.


We cannot ignore this problem any longer. Australians living in rural and regional communities deserve better. They deserve security, and they deserve to know the Government is taking meaningful steps to fix this problem.


The measures in this bill will bring about real and long lasting change. And that change will not only benefit rural and regional communities, but the rest of Australia as those communities flourish.


This bill is in the best interests of us all.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:49):  I rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. This bill seeks to bring in to effect the government's changes to the baby bonus announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2012-13. The bill also makes a number of other amendments to family assistance and social security payments. I intend to focus my remarks on the baby bonus.


The baby bonus is something that has been under attack by this government for some time. The government has repeatedly slashed the baby bonus in an attempt to find savings. In the 2009-10 federal budget, Labor paused the indexation of the upper income limit of the baby bonus at $75,000. In the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook of 2011-12, the government paused the indexation of the baby bonus payment until 2014-15 and reduced the rate of payment from $5,437 to $5,000. In the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the government announced its intention to reduce the baby bonus from $5,000 to $3,000 effective from 1 July 2013. However, as we all know, since then government has been engulfed by yet another budget emergency of its own making and has decided to abolish the baby bonus to save $1.1 billion over the forward estimates. In its place from 1 March 2014, families who are eligible for family tax benefit part A and who are not accessing parental leave will receive an additional loading on their payment. The extra family tax benefit part A payment will provide $2,000 for a family's first child and for each child in a multiple birth and $1,000 for second and subsequent children.


It is pretty clear that Australian families are losing out because of this government's complete and utter incapacity to manage the budget of the Commonwealth. The government is ripping money away from Australian families, in effect, to attempt to cover part of the cost of this reckless spending. The baby bonus was introduced for very important public policy reasons. That is pretty straightforward. Australia needs to maintain a high fertility rate. That is critical to our long-term prosperity.


The reality was reflected in the Intergenerational report, which was such an important, seminal document when it was first released. That report identified that there were three things that Australia needed to do to ensure its future prosperity. It needed to ensure the population continued to grow, that participation in the Australian economy was there for as many people as possible, and that productivity was increased in Australia. Those were what are often referred to as the three p's: population, participation and productivity. That really was at the heart of the motivation behind the baby bonus. The baby bonus had quite a significant effect in lifting the fertility rate of Australia. That is important, because once a nation's fertility rate declines it is very hard to elevate it again. So the baby bonus was quite successful.


If the coalition were in government we would have a different starting point today, compared to where the current government is, because we would have taken different decisions over the course of that period in government. The abolition of the baby bonus is not a decision that we would have taken if we were in government because, as I said, we would have managed the budget differently and had a different starting point. We recognise that the government has completely and utterly trashed the Commonwealth's budget, and for that reason the coalition—although in government we would not be making this decision—will not be opposing this bill.

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2013-06-27,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (12:54):  I wish to speak against this bill in order to record my opposition to yet further erosion of assistance to families. The cuts to the baby bonus are uncalled for. Also, the payment of the baby bonus at a lower level for second and subsequent babies perpetuates the myth that children are cheaper by the dozen. The reality is that the birth of the second and subsequent children brings about additional financial pressure on families. They face increased costs in child care, housing and transport.


For over 30 years, governments of both persuasions have departed from the concept of horizontal equity for families and they have reduced families to welfare recipients. I still believe that families are the basic units of society. They make a huge contribution, not just in raising their own children but in forming the citizens of tomorrow. Unfortunately, this is no longer seen as an important social function. Having children is viewed as a private decision. If it is a private decision then you are entirely responsible for funding it.


The reduction of the baby bonus in this bill demonstrates that the government no longer believes that children are an investment in the nation's future. Children have been reduced to a commodity for which the user pays. 'If you cannot afford them do not have them; we don't care.' That is the message that this bill gives to families.


All families ought to receive some financial recognition for their contribution to society in raising tomorrow's citizens. And low-income families ought to receive additional financial assistance because no child ought to be raised in poverty. Investment in children is an investment in the future, and all parents deserve tax recognition for this important role. Wage earners are now treated as independent individuals with no dependants—a triumph of rampant individualism. Having children makes you an economic basket case.


Until the 1970s the tax system took into account the number of dependants that the wage earner provided for before taxing them. The government recognised that supporting families was an investment in the future—not any more. Families are no longer seen as productive social units but as drains on the public purse and as recipients of welfare. The fact that assistance to families is subject to strict income tests means that only low-income families receive financial assistance. It is demeaning for some families to be singled out—by being reduced to welfare recipients—as unable to support their dependants. I believe our economy is best served by looking after families and communities first. Unfortunately, this is not the message that this bill gives families. As such, I will be voting against the bill.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2013-06-27,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (12:57):  This legislation is, yet again, one of those efforts this government have made to desperately try to come up with a surplus, which they had promised over and over and never delivered. They finally had to admit, under former Treasurer Swan, in November last year, that they were incapable of doing that.


I think we only need to look at the reports that were produced by the Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs when this bill was given to them to assess, to understand how poorly this government has gone about its job. We have a report from the government and a dissenting report from the coalition on this subject. The government report says that NATSEM researcher 'Bob Phillips' had been reported as considering that the baby bonus was significantly higher than the up-front costs of having a baby and was therefore not well targeted.


For a start, I would point out to the government and Greens members of that committee that the NATSEM researcher involved was not Bob Phillips but Ben Phillips. His research, which is not quoted directly but was quoted second-hand from a story in the Australian newspaper in February this year, demonstrates again how little time the secretariats, the government, the opposition—anybody here—has to assess this government's legislation and performance. But the main problem with this government's attempt to reduce the baby bonus for second and subsequent children from $5,000 to $3,000 is that the government does not understand the purpose of the baby bonus.


A baby bonus assists families in paying for the costs of a child. But it was instigated by Treasurer Peter Costello in the Howard government to boost population, to boost replacement levels in Australia of young people. We still face the situation that Treasurer Costello was the first to identify of a massive number of baby boomers and an ever-decreasing number of taxpayers to support those baby boomers. The superannuation system will assist here but it will not fix it. We need to continue to develop taxpayers. While we can and do import taxpayers, we need also to grow taxpayers. The baby bonus was very successful initially at encouraging the birth rate to rise. But, given that the government has fiddled with this again and again, we anticipate that that is not going to happen any longer.


To suggest that somehow because a second or subsequent child might—and I emphasise the word 'might'—be cheaper than the first child is irrelevant. It is interesting to look at some of the material provided by Family Voice, who made the point that you might have to buy a second cot because, unless the space between your children is fairly large, the oldest will not be ready to move into a bed before the second child is born. And I do not really think that it is up to the government to start social engineering in terms of when you provide the money and when you do not.


But the point is that it is not really about paying for the cost of a baby. I cannot believe any suggestions from literature that the upfront costs of having a baby are not more than $5,000. They are more than $5,000. The only people who would not have to fork out more than $5,000 for their first child and close to $5,000 for their second and third children would be people who are lucky enough to have family to pay for some of the products that you need to buy when you have a child. When you look at the list of things that you need for a child, it does not take long to reach $5,000. But this is not the reason that this is happening.


If you look at the material from Mr Ben Phillips, he makes the point that the cost of having a child overall is massive. He points out that for a lower income family with two children the overall cost of raising those children is $474,000. For middle income families it is $812,000. For higher income families, it is $1,097,000. Here we have the ridiculous situation of this government thinking that whether a child is the first or second or subsequent child is somehow relevant to the cost of raising them. It is not. There is absolutely nothing there to suggest that.


The coalition members of the community affairs committee were very concerned about the potential economic impact of Labor's ongoing cuts to the baby bonus. In their submission to the committee, Family Voice Australia highlighted data from the ABS identifying the percentage of women who were having three or more children as a key driver for our below-replacement-level total fertility rate. The fertility rate in Australia has declined from 54 per cent in 1976 to 32.6 per cent in 2006. We are currently having 1.8 babies per woman, which is well below the replacement fertility rate that we need of 2.1. As I said, migration can assist with building our population. But it cannot do it by itself. If you go back to the first Intergenerational report commissioned by Treasurer Peter Costello in 2000, you will see that we would have to have a migration rate in the millions to build the sort of population that we really need to support elderly Australians as that boom develops. This needs to happen through a balance between migration and local Australian-born children.


The removal of this incentive to have two or more children will have a very detrimental impact on our economic development. The whole point of the baby bonus was to boost fertility rates. Yes, it assisted people with the cost of children. But it was about boosting fertility rates; that is what it was there for. And that is what it succeeded in doing. Labor has tried to rationalise these cuts by arguing that the costs associated with second and subsequent children are less than for firstborn children. This goes against the practical experience, as I said, of many Australian families. By seeking to argue that the costs of second and subsequent children are reduced because items of clothing and equipment can be handed down, Labor demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the financial pressures faced by parents and of the practical realities of raising children. As I said, many families will end up with two cots, not just one. One thing in the report that the coalition did agree with was that most people would like to have more children than they end up raising and that one of the most important considerations when people are planning children is being able to afford to raise the child. Whilst a $2,000 cut in the baby bonus for a child might be something this government can get away with in political terms, it is yet another example of its very poor ability to manage Australia's policies, to manage Australia's future and to understand our future.


I want to continue to make that point about the fertility rate. In the late 1970s the decline in our fertility rate started to slow down, until it reached 1.73 babies per woman in 2001. From 2002, when Treasurer Costello introduced the baby bonus, the total fertility rate increased, reaching 1.96 babies per woman in 2008—the highest recorded since 1977. It has since decreased from 1.96 to 1.89 babies per woman in 2010. I would suggest that much of that is around the fiddling that this government has done in all areas of assisting families. The fiddling with the family assistance material has been appalling. Firstly, in 2008-09 Labor introduced a means test so that families who earned more than $75,000 in the six months after the birth or adoption did not receive the funds. And of course, in typical form, this was introduced less than nine months after it was announced, so people who had actually planned on using the baby bonus were unable to, because it cut out when they got to six months. The government went on to index it, paused the indexation and then cut the rate again for younger children. It is part of an appalling record in terms of supporting those who need it most in Australia, and I think we need to consider this carefully.

I ask: what changes, if any, to the policies of the Gillard government has the new Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, put forward to justify his return to the prime ministership?

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:05):  Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the minister has advanced no policy reasons for the removal of the Prime Minister, will she indicate whether yesterday's leadership coup was therefore all about trying to save the jobs of Labor MPs and had nothing to do whatsoever with advancing the true welfare of the people of Australia?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:01):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate for that question. I have to say that what it demonstrates again is the tendency that Senator Abetz and a number of his colleagues have to personalise debate in this chamber. Regarding the decisions that individuals elected to this parliament make, all of us in this chamber on all sides of politics, with the exception perhaps of Senator Xenophon, at times have had to make decisions about who leads our party. They are decisions all of us weigh up. I put my reasons on the public record.


When it comes to issues of policy, however, I remind the Senate that the policy I am asked about is important. I would like to debate policy. I would like us to talk about how it is we can continue to create jobs in this country—having a Labor government that has delivered 960,000 jobs since it was elected. Policy is important when it comes to economic management and, of course, this government has delivered growth in the economy such that we are 14 per cent bigger as an economy than we were in 2007.


And, of course, there are other policies for a fairer Australia: the delivery through both houses of parliament of DisabilityCare. Only a Labor government would ever have delivered it. It would never have been delivered by the coalition. They had the opportunity, as Australians know.


So I am very happy, as are all in the Labor Party, to talk about policy and our plans for a stronger and brighter future for Australians—an Australia that is fairer and more— (Time expired)

  I was talking about Labor values and the importance of putting forward policies that spread opportunity across this great land of ours. I was talking about Labor values and the importance of ensuring fairness in our society. I was talking about Labor values and the importance of ensuring decent wages and conditions for working Australians and of ensuring more superannuation and a more secure and dignified retirement for Australians, which is something the coalition have always opposed. Let us never forget that those opposite have never supported compulsory superannuation. These are Labor values and Labor priorities— (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:06):  It is interesting, isn't it, that the only time we get questions from the opposition about jobs is when it is in relation to political jobs? They never ask us questions about jobs for Australians. They never ask questions about how it is we can create more jobs in our economy. They never ask questions about how it is we can ensure that our economy grows, because, of course, if your economy grows you can ensure there is greater income and there will be more jobs. It is interesting that a coalition that professes to be interested in Australians never talks about employment-generating policies or growth-generating policies. They come in here day after day and all they can continue with is relentless negativity over and over again. That is the form card of this opposition, both in this place and in the other place.




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. At the very dying stages of the answer, could I remind the minister of the requirement to be directly relevant. The issue was in relation to any policy rationale whatsoever for the change of the prime ministership of our nation yesterday.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr President, on the point of order, Senator Wong is being directly relevant to the question. She has gone directly to the point, and the point is—at risk of debating the point—she is pointing out that the alternative situation is something that does not go anywhere near policy, and the only time you mention policy is in the context of leadership.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (14:56):  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer to the interview Mr Rudd had with Kerry O'Brien on the 7.30 Report on 12 May 2010 in which he blamed failure at Copenhagen on his decision to axe the proposed carbon tax. He said:


Now it might be easy for you to sit in 7:30 Report land and say that was easy to do. Let me tell you mate, it wasn't. … That is why we've announced a decision that we would not seek to reintroduce this legislation until … global action has been adequate …


Given that any adoption of a new international climate change agreement has been deferred until 2015 and will not take effect until 2020, will Mr Rudd stay true to his 2010 statement and now axe Ms Gillard's carbon tax until global action has been adequate and there is a new international agreement in place?

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Senator Macdonald is demonstrating the hubris for which he has become so loved on his side. If he could see their heads drop whenever he talks, he would know with what regard he is not held. Anyway, I digress. I thank the senator for what I understand will be his last question in this place. I think there are a couple of propositions to which I should respond. The first one is the principle of a carbon price. I do recall that Senator Humphries was at one time among those senators who understood the importance of pricing carbon—and the importance of carbon pricing was of course clearly understood by Prime Minister Howard. Our party has been very clear in our continued advocacy and delivery of a price on carbon—at times in very difficult political circumstances because of the partisanship that was demonstrated by those opposite.


The second point on the question is the proposition in relation to international action. This is a sort of Liberal version of the National Party saying that we do not want any foreign investment; we do not want to pretend there is any global economy out there that we are part of. The facts are that action is being taken in many countries around the world. I make the point and am happy to come back to this: we are seeing action in California and nine other US states; Korea has legislated its national emissions trading scheme; Japan introduced a carbon price, carbon taxes; and new regional emissions trading schemes have commenced in Canada— (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (15:00):  Dismissing bilateral or unilateral action is not the approach the coalition take when it comes to trade. So one wonders why they suddenly say in relation to climate policy: 'We are going to ignore what China is doing, what the United States is doing, what Korea is doing, what Japan is doing. We are going to ignore that.' That, again, is an example of the economic irrationality of those opposite.




Senator Humphries:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. My question was about whether the government would allow a five per cent hike in the carbon tax next week. It is only a few days away. Can the minister in enlighten the Senate on that question?



The PRESIDENT:  I believe the minister is addressing the question. The minister still has 35 seconds remaining.




Senator WONG:
  Thank you, Mr President. The second part of the question dealt with the issue the senator raised in his point of order. I would make that point. I think the proposition that is being asserted by the opposition again today, as well as yesterday, is that the government should say that what is being passed through this parliament—through this chamber and the other place—what is the law of the land, should somehow be unilaterally waived by the government of the day. I suspect in relation to any legislation, if that were the proposition that the government put in place, you could hear the howls from those opposite already. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2013-06-27,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Abetz and Brandis today relating to recent changes in the Government.


Division, seething hatreds and revenge are the new paradigm in this dysfunctional Labor government. Honour, integrity and loyalty are foreign concepts without any use in their internal treachery. When specifically asked today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate could not tell us why for any policy reason the Prime Minister was removed. And of course the Deputy Prime Minister was removed and the Leader of the Government in the Senate was removed. The three highest positions in the land were all removed last night. When asked what was the policy reason for this manoeuvre, no answer was provided, no rationale was proffered whatsoever. I wonder why that might be. It is a pretty simple answer because there is no answer. There is no policy rationale for the wholesale slaughter of the leadership and cabinet members last night.


Those changes last night had nothing whatsoever to do with the welfare of the Australian people. Those changes last night had nothing to do with a new policy direction for this nation. The changes last night were all about Labor desperately trying to preserve themselves. Of itself, Labor's turmoil is irrelevant other than Labor is supposed to be the government of our great nation. Labor's new team's approach is revenge on those within and attack on Mr Abbott without—personalised, non-stop, ugly negativity.


They have no first-term agenda or record to run on. Why? Because they sacked their first-term Prime Minister, remember. So let us turn to the second term. Well, they sacked their second-term Prime Minister as well. So what is their policy going to be as they lead in, asking the Australian people to endorse them for a third term? Well, we have the first-term Prime Minister that we sacked for incompetence returning to you to deliver a third-term government, a third-term government solely built on revenge on those within and attack on Mr Abbott. I simply say to the Australian people, there is an alternative, it is a genuine alternative—it is a 50-page plan of real solutions for the problems being faced by the Australian people.


Might I also say that with this change of the deckchairs comes the real risk of the destruction of documents, on which Mr Rudd has form from whilst he was with the Queensland government. So I table a letter written by myself to the Prime Minister requesting a guarantee that certain documents deliberately withheld by the former Prime Minister and Mr Shorten will be preserved, especially given the Australian Information Commissioner's preliminary view that the documents appear to be official documents despite the Prime Minister's office trying to assert to the contrary—documents that go to ministerial integrity for the former Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. We will be watching the actions of this government very carefully in that particular space.


But the Australian people simply deserve better. Seven cabinet ministers were destroyed last night.



An opposition senator:  Eight, now.




Senator ABETZ:
  Eight, now. The tally goes up. Before that, Minister Ferguson was destroyed and Senator Kim Carr was destroyed. The list goes on. This is a dysfunctional government, more interested in itself—more interested in the internecine warfare within the Labor Party—than in delivering good government to the Australian people.


The Australian people are entitled to expect better from their government. Simply recycling the first-term failure as the front man for the third-term attempt will not cut the mustard, nor should it. Until the Labor Party can explain the policy rationale for the change, it is obvious there is no real, genuine change. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, do you wish to seek leave to table that document?




Senator ABETZ:
  Yes, I do, thank you. It has been circulated.


Leave granted.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (15:08):  What was noteworthy not only in the questions asked by Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis but in all opposition questions in question time today was the absence of this opposition's use of question time—today is the last available question time—to present any sensible alternative. Instead, we saw the slurs and the innuendo of which we are accused.


Let me give you a few examples from some of the commentary in question time today. It was said that we on this side are motivated solely by our own self-interest and that we have no values. There were derogatory references to the word 'mate'. I wonder sometimes whether senators on the other side of the chamber understand how their commentary looks. I really do wonder if they see how their presentation appears to everyday people that deserve better from both a government and an opposition.


Certainly there has been division in the Labor Party. There is no question about that. And that has now been settled. The issue of the leadership of the Labor Party has been settled, will remain settled and will remain clear. We will now be solely focused on the needs of Australians, unlike those on the other side who carp and carry on. 



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Abetz just highlighted, 'It's all about revenge and knives and axe attacks,' but he holds up a glossy, vacuous 50-page document. Mr Abbott has been holding it up for months. What is more notable about that document is not so much what it says but what it does not say. And there are countless policy areas that we could go through in that regard. 


Instead, we know what the Labor government says. We know what we can do better. Senator Abetz claims that we could not talk about what policy needs to be changed or what would be different. What we do know very clearly is that we can and do need to make a clearer message. We need to develop policy and promote it better. We understand that that is something that we can do in the interests of Australians as we focus on their needs so that we can better deliver what has already been delivered in terms of a strong economy—a triple-A rating of our economy—and protecting jobs in ways this opposition never would have. 


We have promoted education and achieved consensus in disability care and generally in education as well. We have improved superannuation for Australians. These are things this opposition would never do. We will confront this election with a very stark difference. The vacuum of policy from those on the other side—the failure to present an alternative government—was demonstrated in question time today. There was no alternative government presented from the other side. They are incapable of doing it. They could not even receive a compliment for a departing senator without interrupting it. They have problems amongst their own colleagues which I was very sorry to see.


The policy position from this opposition is not just about the fact that Mr Abbott continues to say no. It is about the failure to develop sensible, reasonable positions that will preserve the needs and the interests of the Australian people. That is where as a government we have a clear track record. We can acknowledge the global circumstances we have been in. We can protect Australians jobs and the Australian economy. We can improve our education system. We can improve the treatment of people with disability in this country in a way in which our resources show we should. These are all things that we can do, and we can do them in a way which achieves consensus amongst the Australian people to improve things we know we can do better.


There is no question that in a range of policy areas we can, and do, need to improve how we reach people. We need to improve the message we give Australian people about our values and why we are the Australian Labor Party.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:13):  For those who are students of history, the events of the last 24 hours—extraordinary and spectacular events—constitute the greatest political collapse of a government in Australian federal political history. There have been times of turbulence on both sides of politics because that is in the nature of politics, but never before, in 112 years, has an incumbent government so comprehensibly collapsed. 


With the announcement about half an hour ago of Mr Stephen Smith that he would not be recontesting the election and would be leaving the cabinet, we have had in the last 24 hours the resignation from the cabinet of no fewer than eight of the 22 members of cabinet—more than a third. That has never happened on either side of Australian politics before. That fact alone tells you how unprecedented is the turmoil that has beset the Australian government.


The sad reality is—and it is an ugly sight on display for all Australians to see on their television news and current affairs shows—that the political party that constitutes the government of Australia at the moment, the Australian Labor Party, is deeply riven by the most poisonous personal hatreds and antagonisms that we have ever seen on either side of Australian politics. And that is not just me saying that; that is what they say about themselves.


We have lost eight of the 22 cabinet ministers overnight. But what I want to know—and this was the point of the questions that I and my colleagues asked of Senator Wong—is: what of some of those who are saying and who have in the past expressed their contempt for and lack of confidence in Kevin Rudd, starting with Senator Penny Wong herself, who said that she did not consider that he was the right person or had the right temperament to be the Prime Minister of Australia? Yet not only does she continue to sit in his cabinet but she has been one of the beneficiaries of this political upheaval, because she has become the Leader of the Government in the Senate.


What about Mr Gary Gray, the Minister for Resources and Energy? This is what Mr Gary Gray said about Kevin Rudd only last week: 


He doesn't have the courage and the strength that's required to do this job. What he can do is spread confusion.


How can you have a government when one of the senior members of it, who continues to sit in the cabinet, not six days ago described the new Prime Minister as a man without the courage and the strength that is required for the job of Prime Minister? 


What about Mr Tony Burke, who continues to sit in the cabinet and who last year described the first period of the Rudd government in these words:


The stories that were around of the chaos, of the temperament, of the inability to have decisions made—they are not stories.


That is what Mr Tony Burke said about Mr Kevin Rudd. Yet Mr Tony Burke continues to sit in his cabinet.


Then there is Mr Brendan O'Connor, who last year said this about the 2010 election campaign, speaking about Mr Kevin Rudd:


… there had been 'unbelievable' leaks during the 2010 election campaign against Ms Gillard and hence the Labor party.


That is unprecedented in Labor's history, that we would have leaks coming out of cabinet to target the then-prime minister during an election campaign, to aid and abet Tony Abbott to win the 2010 election. That destabilisation, that treachery has gone on now for varying degrees for the last 18 months.


And he was talking about Mr Kevin Rudd.


Eight of the 22 members of the cabinet have resigned and refused to serve. They would rather sit on the backbench or go into retirement than serve with Kevin Rudd. And there are at least another four who do not have the moral courage to do what the others did and resign, and who are on the record saying that they have no trust or confidence in this man.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:18):  Senator Brandis says that he is an historian of politics. Let me go through some history. Problems in either the Labor Party or the coalition are not new. Leadership challenges are not new. I can go back to 1980 or further than that. There was Fraser versus Snedden in 1975. In 1982, there was Fraser versus Peacock. In 1983, there was Peacock versus Howard. In 1985, there was Howard versus Carlton. In 1987, there was Howard versus Peacock. In 1989, there was Peacock versus Howard. Then we had a doozey in 1990: Hewson versus Reith versus Webster. Then in 1993 it was Hewson versus Howard. In 1994, it was Downer versus Hewson. If we move on to 2007, it was Nelson versus Turnbull. In 2008, it was Turnbull versus Nelson. In 2009, it was Abbott versus Turnbull.


If you want to have some analysis of challenges in politics, it is a bit hypocritical for the coalition to come in here and argue that the Labor Party is the only party that has issues with leadership. Leadership is always an issue in the coalition. It always has been and it always will be.


And it is not just fights over leadership. Let me tell you about the big fight within the coalition. It was a fight between the guy who thought he was a great Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the Prime Minister, John Howard. We had a period in which Peter Costello did not have the guts or the backbone to stand up to John Howard and did not have the guts or backbone to stand up for this nation. He allowed John Howard to throw good money after bad on tax cuts, which meant that we could not invest in infrastructure in this country, in children's education or in a national disability insurance scheme. We could do none of those things because there was absolute turmoil during the whole period of the Howard government between John Howard and Peter Costello. And who won that battle? It was John Howard—much to the regret of those who wanted to try to build this country.


But don't take my word for it. Go back to one of our most eminent political commentators: Peter Hartcher, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 April 2009, said:


At the heart of the Howard government's management of the economy was a raging, unending argument.


And the reason was simple: according to Peter Costello, the Prime Minister believed the public would be grateful to the government for new spending and would vote accordingly. So it was one big bribe from the coalition—no economic position, no building for the future, no spending on public schools; public schools were diminished under the Howard government, health was diminished under the Howard government. So I will not accept for one minute any lectures about instability or any lectures about economic credibility from those economic incompetents across the aisle. I will not accept that for one minute.


Even Senator Sinodinos: what did he say? This is Howard's former chief of staff, now a senator here. He said there was:


""a lucky dip feel"", as officials and ministers scrambled to formalise tax cut options and decide which ones would get the go-ahead.


Well, we do not do that. What we do is invest in health, invest in education, invest in infrastructure, invest in the NBN. We make sure the issues we take up are building this economy and building this nation, not like the economic incompetents across the chamber.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:23):  Welcome to the house of Atreus! It is the most bizarre place. I always wanted to know what it was like to live in a Greek tragedy and here we are in the middle of one. It is bizarre; it is the most internecine, crazy place. I now know the Labor Party's policy: you get two for the price of one. If you vote for one Prime Minister, you are bound to get two of them, in every term. Instead of the fortunes of the house of Atreus it is the fortunes of the house of Rudd, the fortunes of the Labor Party.


And now we see all the manifestations of that rather bizarre prototype of a Prime Minister revisiting us. We knew it was getting ugly when we saw Mr Rudd parading through the airport with his sleeping bag. He was obviously a little bit tired—he was going to nod off—so he was parading through the airport with his sleeping bag, just to let you know that he was going to the sleep-out. We all carry our sleeping bags through the airport! I can't get through Canberra Airport without my sleeping bag under my arm! Then, of course, when you are at the sleep-out you must have a media contingent there for when you wake up; it is extremely important. When you wake up and you are putting your teddy bear aside—it is time for Noddy to wake up—you have to have the media there, just to know that, thank the Lord, you are awake! And we are back to the slow walks through the car park, the prophetic glimpses, the sideways looks, the walking with the camera—here comes the bride in the big fluffy white dress!—walking with the camera, walking out the door, walking to the car park, walking to the car. This is the new world—this mad, mad, mad world—that we have returned to. And we are back to 'zipping'. We are zipping here, we are zipping there, we are 'rocking' around the country.


It is not surprising that we not only have a new Prime Minister but that, because of this insanity, as well as losing a Prime Minister, we have also lost a Deputy Prime Minister and a Leader of the Senate—that is the highest office holder, the second-highest office holder and the third-highest office holder, all in one night. That is like the left bower, the right bower and the joker, all gone. And we also lost the defence minister, the minister for agriculture, the minister for communications and the Treasurer. And do we say that this is sanity? Is this what we are offering to the Australian people? 'Buy this product; this one will work.' If you went to your accountancy practice and walked in the door and asked, 'Who are you people?' and they said, 'We just decided last night to change everybody' you would say: 'Give me all the books back. See you later.' If you went into your dentist and all of a sudden there was this manic confusion and change of staff as they pulled out the drill to stick it in your mouth, you would get out of there toute de suite. But these people are not your dentists, these people are not your accountants; they are actually running the country—well, actually we do not know who is running the country. Maybe Lord Howes is running the country. Who would know?


The next thing, of course, is: when is the election? Have we noted that Mr Zip Zip has decided that he is not quite zipping to an election? No, he is going to wait a little while. I can see that happening, because he wants to go back to the Lodge. It is merely weeks, and he wants to go back there; he is moving the furniture back in. But don't worry: he will be sustained on a regular diet of airline food as he goes to every sundry country in the world twice before the election, just to make sure that we have the people of Lesotho onside, just to make sure we are moving the dynamics of things in the Laotian jungles, just to make sure peace reigns in Cyprus. We will have the Prime Minister of Australia, for these last few weeks, in every far-flung corner of the world, giving us press conferences telling us about the importance of the things he is doing. Meanwhile, back in Australia, we head towards $370 billion in gross debt, unemployment rises and we have the crash in the cattle market. Meanwhile back in Australia, chaos reigns.

Determinations



For the information of Senators I present the General Principles for the radio broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. These general principles have been adopted by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings and are being tabled in both Houses, pursuant to the requirements of the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act.


The General Principles set out in this report determine that the allocation of broadcasts between the two Houses should be approximately equal and that Question Time in the House not being broadcast live should be rebroadcast later that day.


These General Principles are essentially the same as those currently in force and detailed at the back of the Standing Orders, but have been written in a more contemporary style.


To come into force, the General Principles must be adopted by both Houses. I expect a motion to that end in the near future as part of a broader redrafting of the resolutions concerning the broadcasting of proceedings.


The General Principles are complimented by Standing Determinations which provide more detailed advice to the ABC for the radio broadcasts.


I encourage Senators to look at the report and I thank the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings for drafting both the General Principles and the Standing Determinations.


I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:45):  I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition in a somewhat truncated debate in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill 2013. The coalition are pleased to support this bill. We are always keen to support legislation that eases the regulatory burden on small business. We believe that in this case the government are a little late coming to the party, but they have at least turned up, finally. They are not bearing a gift that is necessarily remarkable, but they have brought something that is of some value to the small business community. What they have presented is this legislation and, while I have said that it is a bit late, we believe it is a positive piece of legislation as it cuts the regulatory burden for restaurant and cafe owners in the hospitality industry without adversely affecting the customer's right to pricing integrity and information.


We should all make sure in this place that we do all we can to support the small business community, and there are many reasons for this. Families run small businesses and small business people are often leaders in our communities. When you walk around our towns, cities and suburbs, and when you look around the suburban football ground, or around the local netball fields or soccer fields, you do not see names, necessarily, of larger companies. What you often see are the names of the local newsagent, the local panel beater or the local pharmacy. These small businesses are not just the economic driver for our community; they are so often the glue that makes our communities the places we want to live, bring up a family and share times with friends and family.


Often the leaders of our local community organisations or also small business people. Again, they can be the local pharmacist who runs the CFA, the local newsagent or the local parent, who might be a mechanic, who runs the school P&C and supports the local football club, or is the coach for the school footy or netball team. These are the things that are not always taken into account by economic statistics, but they are so important to the communities that we live in. When I say that small business people are the glue of our communities, I do not mean to disregard those who might work for other companies. I have worked for one of the world's largest companies.


One of the benefits and privileges of a parliamentary role is the ability to see so many different parts of Australia. Whether I am travelling around my home state of Victoria, through my home city of Melbourne, or through regional Australia and other states, I see that the role small business people play is very important to every community that I visit. It is important in the good times when things are going well, when local footy clubs and netball teams are winning flags, and it is also particularly important in the tough times. Australia has seen too many tough times with natural disasters in the last few years. In my home state of Victoria we had the tragedy of the Black Saturday bushfires and in Queensland we had the tragedy of the great floods. In both cases, when you looked at the local SES, you saw that it was the people that ran or worked in small businesses who were often the first to put up their hands to do something.


This bill particularly impacts the 38,000 restaurants and cafes in Australia that generate about $29 billion per year in turnover. That is not an insignificant amount. Restaurants and cafes have another critical role, often, in providing first jobs for people. How many people got their first job as a waiter or washing dishes? Whether you were a uni student or still at high school you might have got a job at a local cafe, restaurant, reception centre or something like that. The hospitality sector is so important for that entry point into the labour market. Sometimes, in the grand scheme of things in this place and with all the policy apparatus that politicians and government have at their fingertips, we often forget really basic and important points. Someone's first job is not usually their last, and the point at which someone enters the labour market is not always where they stay as they usually climb up the ladder fairly quickly, but you have to provide those entry points. That is also true for re-entry points for those who may have been unemployed for a period of time.


The hospitality sector is relatively unique in that it is overwhelmingly a small-business sector. These are businesses, often not even companies, that do not have different departments. Their legal, compliance, advertising and human resources departments are on various parts of the kitchen table at home on various nights of the week. They are mum-and-dad businesses, who put up their own capital and often risk their own home. They wear multiple hats and they do everything for the business. They might be the person who acts as the cook, or the person who acts as the cleaner, and they are often the person who does both. They go to the markets to buy supplies, they meet with the accountant, they do the tax form, they fill out the BAS and they have to take care of employing people. As I said, it is these local businesses that support our local sporting clubs and community organisations.


This bill addresses an issue that I will turn to in a minute, but it specifically addresses a burden of the law that is substantial in this sector of the small business community—the hospitality sector. That is why the coalition support this particular legislation. For the context of the problem that this legislation deals with we have to go back to 2009 to understand the purpose of this bill. In 2009 a detailed provision was added to what used to be called the Trade Practices Act and is now the Competition and Consumer Act—but I will probably make the mistake of calling it the Trade Practices Act again, as many do. The 2009 change added a so-called component pricing provision which introduced a requirement for restaurants and cafes to detail any additional surcharges into the actual prices listed on menus. This ensured that costs linked to weekends, after hours or public holidays, usually labour rates and penalty rates, were made clear to customers. To some it seemed reasonable at the time. The problem, however, was again with this government's implementation of this regulation. A cafe was not allowed to put an asterisk or a statement at the bottom of a menu that indicated a surcharge for an extra cost, for example, on a weekend or on public holidays. Restaurants were not regarded as compliant if they had explanations of additional costs on the menus. The requirements were so detailed that, in order to comply, restaurants and cafes had to design, produce, print and maintain additional menus that outlined all the extra surcharge costs that were included in their pricing arrangements. To comply with this, not only would the menus have to be replaced—if it were, for example, a Sunday surcharge—but, if there were a blackboard upon which someone wrote the specials, it would have to have a sheet hung over it or it would have to be rewritten every day that there was going to be a surcharge.


There was, not surprisingly, much debate and furore over this new regulation and its implementation. The restaurant and cafe owners, often families who run small businesses around the country, were already dealing with supply chain issues, staffing rosters, changes to workplace relations, tax, accounts and cash flow at the same time as trying to increase job opportunities and grow their businesses. This new impost that required them to print and maintain multiple menus, in some cases for businesses that were already levying a surcharge, was just a step too far.


The costs, while they might sound insignificant, were actually not. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Association of Australia estimated they averaged between $8,000 and $10,000 for each restaurant. That is, $8,000 or $10,000 straight off the bottom line that a restaurant has to spend to comply with this new rule if they already applied a public holiday or weekend surcharge or, in fact, if they wished to. Anyone who knows this sector knows that it operates on very slim margins. When we look at the cost pressures that this sector has faced due to the changes—in many cases, due to this government; for example, the carbon tax forcing up energy costs, which is a significant input for restaurants and catering small businesses—we can see that this is not a trivial amount of money.


In 2010, the Productivity Commission's Annual review of regulatory burdens on business: business and consumer services recommended that the government amend what was then the Trade Practices Act to have restaurant and cafe menu surcharges for specific days placed outside the scope of the pricing provisions of the legislation. This would mean that cafes and restaurants would no longer be required to detail surcharges for specific days in the same way—with a separate menu, by rubbing out the specials board or by hanging a sheet over it on the day they had a surcharge. The Productivity Commission's Annual review of regulatory burdens on business 2010 recommended:


The Australian Government should amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to have restaurant and café menu surcharges for specific days placed outside the scope of the component pricing provision of that legislation.


The Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill 2013 directly addresses the issue. It puts into law this Productivity Commission recommendation. It recommends the now Competition and Consumer Act 2010 has a regulation-making power inserted to enable the government to make regulations to exempt certain representations from the component pricing requirement in Australian consumer law. This exemption will ensure restaurants and cafes no longer need to provide a separate menu for days when they apply a surcharge. However, I will note that we do not yet have the specifics regarding the requirements that restaurants, cafes and the catering industry will need to fulfil. The government has said that this will come in the future with regulation. Again, the parliament is being asked to take this government at trust. We support the legislation. We have learnt to not necessarily trust the government's implementation of it.


With those concerns noted, this bill has been well received by all in the industry sector who have been affected. Industry groups such as the Australian Hotels Association, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland, Clubs Australia and the National Tourism Alliance have all endorsed this piece of legislation. We will, to this extent, trust that a good balance for consumers and a good balance for business will be reached when the government promulgates the regulation to put this into effect. We hope that the government will learn this lesson and provide a solution that carefully weighs up consumer interests with the costs of doing business.


At this point, the bill amends the relatively recently passed Competition and Consumer Act. This raises a number of issues that the opposition has highlighted. We believe strongly that competition law has an important role to play in achieving positive outcomes for consumers and businesses. Competition is the essence of our market system. Competition is the essence to a productive and efficient economy. In fact, over the last 30 to 40 years, this country has implemented a form of competition policy that, I would suggest with respect—more than anything the government claims credit for—protected Australia from the global economic recession by ensuring our economy was more responsive and more efficient. However, it has been more than 20 years since Professor Hilmer undertook his landmark work that examined our competition framework and recommended a range of legislative and policy reforms that underpin today's competition laws, procedures and philosophy. Much has happened in the Australian economy since the Hilmer review.


I will give a few examples that will be familiar to most in the community. There has been a significant consolidation in our financial sector. What were once four banks, two insurance houses, plus a great number of regional and state banks is now effectively a four-bank, four-pillar system. In the supermarket and food retailing industry, we have seen quite significant growth of the two major supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles. We have also seen consolidation with the loss of a player like Franklins and, since the days when I was pushing trolleys around an independent supermarket in Essendon, we have seen the consolidation of a number of state based independent wholesalers into Metcash. Only in the last few years we have seen the entry of more globally based competition, such as through Aldi, which in only a few short years has managed to open about 300 stores, I understand.


It is important to note that there have been swings and roundabouts in these two developments. In some cases, consumers have demonstrably benefited and in other cases a case can be put that the competition benefits have not flown strongly through to the consumer, at least in an immediately obvious way. Some markets—and I will use an example here: the pricing of credit cards—are stickier. By 'stickier' I mean that you do not often see significant price changes. People do not tend to move products that often. Health insurance is another example, as are markets such as credit cards, where competition is defined by things other than price. In that case, you will have the interest rate, the price of money, and the competition might be defined by things like interest-free days, Frequent Flyer points or the lack of surcharges at certain places. So, while there is competition, the transparency of it is not as immediately obvious to the consumer.


There are areas in supermarkets where there has been a demonstrable benefit to consumers. Food price deflation over the last couple of years has, unarguably, left consumers better off, because greater competition in the market between the two major chains has led to food price deflation.


However, we do also know that there have been significant changes in the way larger corporations operate. So we have the issue of land development. We have had the issue of how to move customers of one particular channel into another channel. The classic case is supermarkets using discounts from supermarket cash registers to drive people to buy petrol. But effectively the aim is to drive people through the supermarket cash registers.


The coalition is well aware of the difficulties smaller retailers face competing against larger businesses in the retail market and how smaller businesses do not necessarily have meaningful access to all the legal rights that the Competition and Consumer Act might on paper grant them. The coalition, as part of its commitment to a root-and-branch review of competition law, wants such a review to look at the changes in the economy since the Hilmer review and to look at how the eternal values of competition need to respond to changing market circumstances.


I will give the most extreme example. Twenty years ago the internet was something that a few people at Melbourne uni probably logged onto to look at a black screen where they could punch a few keys a minute. The internet was not a meaningful presence in people's lives 15 years ago. In many ways it was not that meaningful in commerce even a decade ago. But it is clearly now becoming a much more important competitive aspect, including, I might add, in areas where people did not expect it, like supermarkets. I know people who now order things online. They do not walk into a supermarket but, at seven o'clock on a Thursday night, boxes turn up at their home.


Another important aspect of this that the opposition highlighted is the issue of unfair contracts. Consumers have access to unfair contract provisions under the Competition and Consumer Act. The opposition made a commitment at the last election—and we will make that commitment again—to enabling small business access to unfair contract provisions when they are dealing with big businesses. The reason this is so important is that a law is not a very good law if it is not enforceable. The opportunity for a mum-and-dad partnership that might run a cafe or a small retail store to take meaningful legal action against a larger player is, in reality, very limited. I know that a standard significant case that might be brought under the Competition and Consumer Act on abuse of market power or unconscionable conduct can cost in the millions. That is not a meaningful way for smaller businesses to access the competition law and the protections which they are currently legally entitled to. So the opposition believes that unfair contract provisions give small business that meaningful access to the law that underpins and protects competition in Australian markets.


The associated issue of compliance with competition law is something to consider as well. If it is costing millions and millions of dollars to take court action, is there something about the law that means it is too complex? This is a new area of law. It is not centuries-old property law or contract law. It is an evolving area of law. But we cannot sit by while millions and millions of dollars are spent on legal costs, ensuring that smaller businesses cannot access the provisions in the act that are meant to protect them.


So our root-and-branch review will focus on all these aspects of competition law in order to ensure that it meets the goals that were set in 1990 when Professor Hilmer published his report and which underpinned those reforms but was conscious of the fact that the world has changed. We have the internet, we have privatised utilities in many states, we have larger financial institutions and we have larger retail institutions. We need to make sure that the law responds to that changed environment, just as it did in 1990.


I will cease my comments there. The coalition supports the bill. We hope that the government takes note of its previous errors when it promulgates this regulation. We hope it does it quickly in order to give small businesses this flexibility they do not currently have and to respond to the rising costs in some cases that this government has imposed on them and make their businesses more viable, but we will be supporting the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,26,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-06-27,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:04):  I thank Senator Ryan for finishing early. I want to say quite a number of things about this piece of legislation. I am aware that there are many others who would like to debate this particular bill but unfortunately, because of the guillotine imposed by the Labor Party, with the support of their political allies the Greens, we are constrained to a very short period of time to debate this important bill.


In relation to the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill, I say: one down, 19,899 to go. Madam Deputy President, you will recall that the Labor Party promised some time ago that for every new regulation they introduced they would repeal one. We know that since the Labor Party have been in power they have introduced some 21,000 new or amended regulations. I will just repeat that: since the Labor Party have been in power, they have introduced 21,000 new or amended regulations which small business and business generally have to comply with. No wonder the cost of doing business has gone up so much in Australia. No wonder Australian manufacturing businesses are closing down daily and exporting the manufacturing jobs that used to be in Australia to China, India and other places. It is all because the Labor Party continue to impose costs like the carbon tax and the mining tax on small business. They have imposed on small business, as I said, 21,000 new or amended regulations since they have been in power.


Perhaps I will digress here. Why would anyone, particularly me, believe any promise the Labor Party made after the most famous misstatement of all time—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Perhaps that statement has turned out to be true, because Ms Gillard is no longer leading a government that clearly has introduced the carbon tax. It will be interesting to see what Mr Rudd does in relation to the commitment never to introduce a carbon tax that was made by the Australian Labor Party before the last election.


But I digress. Getting back to their promise that for every regulation they introduced they would repeal one, I might say that they have not repealed 21,000, although to their credit they have repealed 1,100. That is why I say of this piece of legislation, 'One down and a mere 19,899 to go,' if the Labor Party are to discharge the promise they made to repeal one regulation for every one they introduced. Having said that, I congratulate the Gillard government for reducing at least one piece of regulation with this bill.


As my colleague Senator Ryan has very clearly explained, this is a regulation about pricing in restaurants and cafes. It has taken over 12 months of consultation to get to this day. Three state governments have had to agree. It has been through a tortuous path just to get here. And you wonder why Australia is going down the gurgler. You wonder why Australian jobs are going overseas. It is because the Gillard, and before that the Rudd, Labor government just imposed taxes, costs and regulation on business, so that it is no longer possible for Australians to have a manufacturing industry or, indeed, many industries at all.


This process, which we hope will be finished today, will at least address the issue of the way in which you can advertise the weekend surcharge on a restaurant menu or on a board outside a restaurant or cafe. I am sure that those listening to this debate will not believe that we have had to go through this tortuous process just do that. But that is what happens when you have Labor governments. They are interested only in telling everybody how they should act. They do not believe that people are capable of making their own decisions. Labor governments always think that they know better; Big Brother in Canberra knows better than individuals. They will tell you what you can do with your life and your business.


This regulation is simply another impost on small business. The Liberal Party and the National Party are the parties of small business. Why? Because we recognise that they are the engine room of our economy. We also recognise that it is business—small business, medium business—that creates jobs in Australia. It is not governments that create jobs, unless they create artificial jobs in the bureaucracy—and heaven knows that they have done that. I forget the actual figure, but I think that since the Labor Party have been in power we have employed—what is it?—22,000 additional public servants. I take it back—




Senator Thorp:
  We have created 900,000 new jobs.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The government has created 900,000 new jobs? I do not know that there are 900,000 new public servants, because those are the only jobs that governments can actually create. Small business and medium-sized business and big business are the ones that create jobs. The jobs that the government creates are the 22,000 additional public servants, most of them in this lovely city. Those are the jobs the Labor government have created. We in the coalition understand that real job creation comes from small and medium-sized business. That is why you cannot keep creating real jobs, as opposed to Public Service jobs, while you keep imposing costs and regulations on small business.


I repeat: good luck to the Gillard government for removing one regulation. I am not sure when the next election is going to be these days. Ms Gillard said it was going to be on 14 September. There is press speculation and a lot of rumours around members of the Labor Party that it is now not going to be on that date, but of course the parliament has not been brought into those discussions. Those of us who, in our democracy, are supposed to be running the country will of course, as is usual with the Labor Party, be the last to know. If the election is to be held on 14 September, and if the Labor Party are to discharge the promise they made about repealing 21,000 pieces of regulation in their term, they have a lot of work to do in the next few weeks. We know of course that that will not happen.


The regulation being removed, as my colleague has said, enables regulations to be made to exempt certain representations from component-pricing requirements in the Australian Consumer Law. The amendment will allow regulations to be made to place restaurant and cafe menu surcharges for specific days outside the component-pricing requirements, which put simply means that you can have a different menu or a different pricing explanation on different days. That seems very sensible.


It is brought about because there are substantial penalties for those who work on weekends and at odd hours, and that is appropriate in many cases. It does not, of course, take into account that many people, particularly university students who study during the week, often want to get their jobs on the weekend. They look forward to employment on the weekend, because that is when they can earn a bit of cash to pay for whatever they need money for. Regrettably, with the legislation and regulations that have been around over many years, the numbers of jobs available on weekends is simply not what it used to be. So all of those jobs that used to be available for university students, and others who find that working on the weekend really suits them, are no longer as plentiful as they used to be.


Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, you and I and many others have been to many seaside towns and tourist resorts where, when you walk along the main street on a Sunday, every second cafe is shut. Why? Because the small-business owners can simply not afford the staff to open them up. I was in Hervey Bay the other day with Keith Pitt, the excellent LNP candidate for Hinkler who will replace the long-serving Paul Neville—those are big shoes for Keith Pitt to fill, but I am sure he will do it—and we were talking to small-business men along the esplanade in Hervey Bay, and every second shop was shut down on the weekend, simply because they could not afford to open up on those days. So those jobs that used to be available to people who wanted to work on weekends in Hervey Bay are no longer available. That, I regret to say, is probably one of the reasons why there is unemployment in the Hervey Bay area. There should not be. Hervey Bay is a great place. It is the whale-watching capital of the world, with a great climate and great activities, and near Fraser Island; it is a magnificent place for people to go. But small business there, as it is everywhere in Australia, is struggling because of the regulation and cost of the things introduced by, first of all, the Rudd Labor government in 2007 and, more recently, the Gillard government.


Talking about competition and consumer affairs reminds me that small businesses are also very concerned with the duopoly of Coles and Woolworths. Coles and Woolworths obviously conduct legitimate businesses, and customers like using them. But they have an inordinate market power which producers, suppliers and wholesalers will tell you is not always appropriately used. That is why I am delighted that the coalition, as one of its core promises in the upcoming election campaign, is to conduct that root-and-branch review of the competition laws in Australia, to see what can be done to make it fairer for producers, farmers and small businesses to compete with Coles and Woolworths.


We now have a government led by Mr Rudd who will, no doubt, continue to promise to look after small business and reduce regulations. We all know, and Australians know, that Mr Rudd can be believed no more than Ms Gillard could be. We all remember Mr Rudd promising to end the blame game on health and hospitals, but what have we heard, consistently, on health and education and anything else that goes wrong under this dysfunctional government? It is all the fault of the states—they are the ones who do all the things for which the poor old Gillard and Rudd governments have been blamed! Well, everybody knows that that is a joke. Mr Rudd will continue to blame everybody else for his own failures as Prime Minister and then as a minister in Ms Gillard's government.


We know Mr Rudd well from Queensland. We remember when he, as a public servant, ran the Premier's office in Queensland. And you talk about dysfunctional governments there; you talk about how staff were always leaving the Department of the Premier and Cabinet in Queensland. It was because of the way Mr Rudd ran that office when he was in Queensland. It is easy to understand why one of Mr Rudd's colleagues, Mr Steve Gibbons, said, 'He is a psychopath with a giant ego.' It is very easy to understand that. It is very easy to understand why former minister Mr Craig Emerson, another Queenslander, who has known Mr Rudd not only in this parliament but when he was wielding the power in Queensland as the chief public servant in the Premier's office, said of Mr Rudd:


There has been attack on the Prime Minister—


that is, Gillard—


going back to the last election. There was destabilisation and leaking then; it's been going on since. … So if we're talking about attacking sitting prime ministers and destabilisation, I think Kevin—


and I think he meant Kevin Rudd—


should look in his own backyard because this has been going on for too long …


You will be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, perhaps better than I, of how people who have worked with Mr Rudd have always been very critical of any promises he has made, of the way he runs his office and the way he has run his government. That is not my criticism, I hasten to add; it is criticism by people who have worked with Mr Rudd in his cabinet, next door to him, and continue doing so. So promises that Mr Rudd might make, like this promise to abolish one regulation for every new one created, the Australian people will no longer believe. It is time that this country got a government it can believe and trust. I look forward to the next election, whenever it is, so that Australia can get a decent, honest government again. But praise where praise is due—one regulation is gone with this bill. I support this bill, but there are 19,899 regulations to be abolished in the next few weeks. I will believe that when I see it.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-06-27,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:23):  As this is one of the last bills that I will see in the Senate, it is very important that I speak on it. One of the reasons I came to this chamber was to support small business, and the issues I spoke about in my maiden speech are in a minor way addressed in this bill. This is a generic amendment. It is a statement of the bleeding obvious—that we cannot have small restaurants having to produce two menus. It is excessive bureaucracy. We have to get out of the way of small business. A restaurant on the High Street should not have excessive costs put on them. We have to make sure we create flexibility for people in the restaurant industry.


We have to realise that the restaurant industry is a great employer of people. As has been alluded to by Senator Ryan—he might not have thought I was listening to him, but I was listening to him diligently from my office whilst lying on my couch—there are around 38,000 restaurants in Australia and they generate around $29 billion a year. Many restaurants are family businesses, and they are the epitome of what I believe in in small business. This allows families to grow up knowing their children. To me and many in the National Party, it is a social statement—the capacity to live and grow with your children. I suppose we are influenced by how we grew up. I grew up on a farm. I saw my mother and father all the time because the business we worked in was where we lived. This is something that should be available to many people.


Restaurants are a feature of small business. How often do you go into a small cafe and see mum and dad and one of the sons all working together. In Chinese restaurants you see the whole family pitching in and working together and knowing each other and growing up as a tight family unit. So the ethos of small business is intertwined with the ethos of the family. It is a crucial part of the dynamic of where I have sat philosophically, and it is probably why I sit on this side of the chamber.


A key part of that also is that we must make sure that we do not create a bureaucracy that makes small business impossible. I have seen this even in areas such as the insurance industry, where small operators keep being loaded down with regulation for regulation's sake. This is generally to the benefit of large providers, who can deal with the overheads of excessive regulation whereas a small businesses cannot. The occupational health and safety officer is a classic example. Large organisations such as the one I used to work for, ConAgra, can employ an occupational health and safety officer; they have the capacity to do that by reason of the size of their operation. But smaller feedlots cannot because they do not have the volume to be able to support that.


A lot of the regulatory burden is state laws. One of the most insidious laws that came into the farming sector was the tree-clearing guidelines. It determined that an asset that was owned by an individual would overnight be divested from that individual and invested in the state. Many of my own colleagues on the conservative side of the fence started making excuses for it—'it had to be right', 'the community is right to steal an asset from an individual'. But it is not the community's right to steal an asset from an individual. Excessive regulation steals an opportunity from the individual because it creates a mechanism whereby it is virtually impossible for the individual to progress through small business.


If we are going to get out of the current circumstances we are in financially, we have to rely on the economic powerhouse of small business. We can either be forced into this position down the track or we can move into this position of our own volition by genuinely going into the area and recognising that there is always a risk-return trade-off. But at the moment we are too risk averse and the return is that we are putting unnecessary pressures on small business that will in the future impede an economy that has had the benefit in the past of a mining boom that has generated great wealth in the economy. But that boom will taper off because all commodities are cyclical. That is not some sort of Cassandra-like principle; it is a statement of the obvious. As the commodity sector peels off, you are going to have to rely on other sectors of the economy to take up the burden of supplying the return to the nation to cover our bills, to cover our debt and to cover the social services that we in here demand every day in passing legislation. That return needs to match what we lose from areas such as the manufacturing industry.


If you are going to use the argument of GDP, we must start removing regulation from small business. I hope this is a statement of firsts. I fully support the root-and-branch review of the Competition and Consumer Act. That is going to be an absolute statement of our belief in small business, our core constituency. Where we go with that is a reflection of who we are as a political force.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:45):  I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition in a somewhat truncated debate in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill 2013. The coalition are pleased to support this bill. We are always keen to support legislation that eases the regulatory burden on small business. We believe that in this case the government are a little late coming to the party, but they have at least turned up, finally. They are not bearing a gift that is necessarily remarkable, but they have brought something that is of some value to the small business community. What they have presented is this legislation and, while I have said that it is a bit late, we believe it is a positive piece of legislation as it cuts the regulatory burden for restaurant and cafe owners in the hospitality industry without adversely affecting the customer's right to pricing integrity and information.


We should all make sure in this place that we do all we can to support the small business community, and there are many reasons for this. Families run small businesses and small business people are often leaders in our communities. When you walk around our towns, cities and suburbs, and when you look around the suburban football ground, or around the local netball fields or soccer fields, you do not see names, necessarily, of larger companies. What you often see are the names of the local newsagent, the local panel beater or the local pharmacy. These small businesses are not just the economic driver for our community; they are so often the glue that makes our communities the places we want to live, bring up a family and share times with friends and family.


Often the leaders of our local community organisations or also small business people. Again, they can be the local pharmacist who runs the CFA, the local newsagent or the local parent, who might be a mechanic, who runs the school P&C and supports the local football club, or is the coach for the school footy or netball team. These are the things that are not always taken into account by economic statistics, but they are so important to the communities that we live in. When I say that small business people are the glue of our communities, I do not mean to disregard those who might work for other companies. I have worked for one of the world's largest companies.


One of the benefits and privileges of a parliamentary role is the ability to see so many different parts of Australia. Whether I am travelling around my home state of Victoria, through my home city of Melbourne, or through regional Australia and other states, I see that the role small business people play is very important to every community that I visit. It is important in the good times when things are going well, when local footy clubs and netball teams are winning flags, and it is also particularly important in the tough times. Australia has seen too many tough times with natural disasters in the last few years. In my home state of Victoria we had the tragedy of the Black Saturday bushfires and in Queensland we had the tragedy of the great floods. In both cases, when you looked at the local SES, you saw that it was the people that ran or worked in small businesses who were often the first to put up their hands to do something.


This bill particularly impacts the 38,000 restaurants and cafes in Australia that generate about $29 billion per year in turnover. That is not an insignificant amount. Restaurants and cafes have another critical role, often, in providing first jobs for people. How many people got their first job as a waiter or washing dishes? Whether you were a uni student or still at high school you might have got a job at a local cafe, restaurant, reception centre or something like that. The hospitality sector is so important for that entry point into the labour market. Sometimes, in the grand scheme of things in this place and with all the policy apparatus that politicians and government have at their fingertips, we often forget really basic and important points. Someone's first job is not usually their last, and the point at which someone enters the labour market is not always where they stay as they usually climb up the ladder fairly quickly, but you have to provide those entry points. That is also true for re-entry points for those who may have been unemployed for a period of time.


The hospitality sector is relatively unique in that it is overwhelmingly a small-business sector. These are businesses, often not even companies, that do not have different departments. Their legal, compliance, advertising and human resources departments are on various parts of the kitchen table at home on various nights of the week. They are mum-and-dad businesses, who put up their own capital and often risk their own home. They wear multiple hats and they do everything for the business. They might be the person who acts as the cook, or the person who acts as the cleaner, and they are often the person who does both. They go to the markets to buy supplies, they meet with the accountant, they do the tax form, they fill out the BAS and they have to take care of employing people. As I said, it is these local businesses that support our local sporting clubs and community organisations.


This bill addresses an issue that I will turn to in a minute, but it specifically addresses a burden of the law that is substantial in this sector of the small business community—the hospitality sector. That is why the coalition support this particular legislation. For the context of the problem that this legislation deals with we have to go back to 2009 to understand the purpose of this bill. In 2009 a detailed provision was added to what used to be called the Trade Practices Act and is now the Competition and Consumer Act—but I will probably make the mistake of calling it the Trade Practices Act again, as many do. The 2009 change added a so-called component pricing provision which introduced a requirement for restaurants and cafes to detail any additional surcharges into the actual prices listed on menus. This ensured that costs linked to weekends, after hours or public holidays, usually labour rates and penalty rates, were made clear to customers. To some it seemed reasonable at the time. The problem, however, was again with this government's implementation of this regulation. A cafe was not allowed to put an asterisk or a statement at the bottom of a menu that indicated a surcharge for an extra cost, for example, on a weekend or on public holidays. Restaurants were not regarded as compliant if they had explanations of additional costs on the menus. The requirements were so detailed that, in order to comply, restaurants and cafes had to design, produce, print and maintain additional menus that outlined all the extra surcharge costs that were included in their pricing arrangements. To comply with this, not only would the menus have to be replaced—if it were, for example, a Sunday surcharge—but, if there were a blackboard upon which someone wrote the specials, it would have to have a sheet hung over it or it would have to be rewritten every day that there was going to be a surcharge.


There was, not surprisingly, much debate and furore over this new regulation and its implementation. The restaurant and cafe owners, often families who run small businesses around the country, were already dealing with supply chain issues, staffing rosters, changes to workplace relations, tax, accounts and cash flow at the same time as trying to increase job opportunities and grow their businesses. This new impost that required them to print and maintain multiple menus, in some cases for businesses that were already levying a surcharge, was just a step too far.


The costs, while they might sound insignificant, were actually not. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Association of Australia estimated they averaged between $8,000 and $10,000 for each restaurant. That is, $8,000 or $10,000 straight off the bottom line that a restaurant has to spend to comply with this new rule if they already applied a public holiday or weekend surcharge or, in fact, if they wished to. Anyone who knows this sector knows that it operates on very slim margins. When we look at the cost pressures that this sector has faced due to the changes—in many cases, due to this government; for example, the carbon tax forcing up energy costs, which is a significant input for restaurants and catering small businesses—we can see that this is not a trivial amount of money.


In 2010, the Productivity Commission's Annual review of regulatory burdens on business: business and consumer services recommended that the government amend what was then the Trade Practices Act to have restaurant and cafe menu surcharges for specific days placed outside the scope of the pricing provisions of the legislation. This would mean that cafes and restaurants would no longer be required to detail surcharges for specific days in the same way—with a separate menu, by rubbing out the specials board or by hanging a sheet over it on the day they had a surcharge. The Productivity Commission's Annual review of regulatory burdens on business 2010 recommended:


The Australian Government should amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to have restaurant and café menu surcharges for specific days placed outside the scope of the component pricing provision of that legislation.


The Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill 2013 directly addresses the issue. It puts into law this Productivity Commission recommendation. It recommends the now Competition and Consumer Act 2010 has a regulation-making power inserted to enable the government to make regulations to exempt certain representations from the component pricing requirement in Australian consumer law. This exemption will ensure restaurants and cafes no longer need to provide a separate menu for days when they apply a surcharge. However, I will note that we do not yet have the specifics regarding the requirements that restaurants, cafes and the catering industry will need to fulfil. The government has said that this will come in the future with regulation. Again, the parliament is being asked to take this government at trust. We support the legislation. We have learnt to not necessarily trust the government's implementation of it.


With those concerns noted, this bill has been well received by all in the industry sector who have been affected. Industry groups such as the Australian Hotels Association, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland, Clubs Australia and the National Tourism Alliance have all endorsed this piece of legislation. We will, to this extent, trust that a good balance for consumers and a good balance for business will be reached when the government promulgates the regulation to put this into effect. We hope that the government will learn this lesson and provide a solution that carefully weighs up consumer interests with the costs of doing business.


At this point, the bill amends the relatively recently passed Competition and Consumer Act. This raises a number of issues that the opposition has highlighted. We believe strongly that competition law has an important role to play in achieving positive outcomes for consumers and businesses. Competition is the essence of our market system. Competition is the essence to a productive and efficient economy. In fact, over the last 30 to 40 years, this country has implemented a form of competition policy that, I would suggest with respect—more than anything the government claims credit for—protected Australia from the global economic recession by ensuring our economy was more responsive and more efficient. However, it has been more than 20 years since Professor Hilmer undertook his landmark work that examined our competition framework and recommended a range of legislative and policy reforms that underpin today's competition laws, procedures and philosophy. Much has happened in the Australian economy since the Hilmer review.


I will give a few examples that will be familiar to most in the community. There has been a significant consolidation in our financial sector. What were once four banks, two insurance houses, plus a great number of regional and state banks is now effectively a four-bank, four-pillar system. In the supermarket and food retailing industry, we have seen quite significant growth of the two major supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles. We have also seen consolidation with the loss of a player like Franklins and, since the days when I was pushing trolleys around an independent supermarket in Essendon, we have seen the consolidation of a number of state based independent wholesalers into Metcash. Only in the last few years we have seen the entry of more globally based competition, such as through Aldi, which in only a few short years has managed to open about 300 stores, I understand.


It is important to note that there have been swings and roundabouts in these two developments. In some cases, consumers have demonstrably benefited and in other cases a case can be put that the competition benefits have not flown strongly through to the consumer, at least in an immediately obvious way. Some markets—and I will use an example here: the pricing of credit cards—are stickier. By 'stickier' I mean that you do not often see significant price changes. People do not tend to move products that often. Health insurance is another example, as are markets such as credit cards, where competition is defined by things other than price. In that case, you will have the interest rate, the price of money, and the competition might be defined by things like interest-free days, Frequent Flyer points or the lack of surcharges at certain places. So, while there is competition, the transparency of it is not as immediately obvious to the consumer.


There are areas in supermarkets where there has been a demonstrable benefit to consumers. Food price deflation over the last couple of years has, unarguably, left consumers better off, because greater competition in the market between the two major chains has led to food price deflation.


However, we do also know that there have been significant changes in the way larger corporations operate. So we have the issue of land development. We have had the issue of how to move customers of one particular channel into another channel. The classic case is supermarkets using discounts from supermarket cash registers to drive people to buy petrol. But effectively the aim is to drive people through the supermarket cash registers.


The coalition is well aware of the difficulties smaller retailers face competing against larger businesses in the retail market and how smaller businesses do not necessarily have meaningful access to all the legal rights that the Competition and Consumer Act might on paper grant them. The coalition, as part of its commitment to a root-and-branch review of competition law, wants such a review to look at the changes in the economy since the Hilmer review and to look at how the eternal values of competition need to respond to changing market circumstances.


I will give the most extreme example. Twenty years ago the internet was something that a few people at Melbourne uni probably logged onto to look at a black screen where they could punch a few keys a minute. The internet was not a meaningful presence in people's lives 15 years ago. In many ways it was not that meaningful in commerce even a decade ago. But it is clearly now becoming a much more important competitive aspect, including, I might add, in areas where people did not expect it, like supermarkets. I know people who now order things online. They do not walk into a supermarket but, at seven o'clock on a Thursday night, boxes turn up at their home.


Another important aspect of this that the opposition highlighted is the issue of unfair contracts. Consumers have access to unfair contract provisions under the Competition and Consumer Act. The opposition made a commitment at the last election—and we will make that commitment again—to enabling small business access to unfair contract provisions when they are dealing with big businesses. The reason this is so important is that a law is not a very good law if it is not enforceable. The opportunity for a mum-and-dad partnership that might run a cafe or a small retail store to take meaningful legal action against a larger player is, in reality, very limited. I know that a standard significant case that might be brought under the Competition and Consumer Act on abuse of market power or unconscionable conduct can cost in the millions. That is not a meaningful way for smaller businesses to access the competition law and the protections which they are currently legally entitled to. So the opposition believes that unfair contract provisions give small business that meaningful access to the law that underpins and protects competition in Australian markets.


The associated issue of compliance with competition law is something to consider as well. If it is costing millions and millions of dollars to take court action, is there something about the law that means it is too complex? This is a new area of law. It is not centuries-old property law or contract law. It is an evolving area of law. But we cannot sit by while millions and millions of dollars are spent on legal costs, ensuring that smaller businesses cannot access the provisions in the act that are meant to protect them.


So our root-and-branch review will focus on all these aspects of competition law in order to ensure that it meets the goals that were set in 1990 when Professor Hilmer published his report and which underpinned those reforms but was conscious of the fact that the world has changed. We have the internet, we have privatised utilities in many states, we have larger financial institutions and we have larger retail institutions. We need to make sure that the law responds to that changed environment, just as it did in 1990.


I will cease my comments there. The coalition supports the bill. We hope that the government takes note of its previous errors when it promulgates this regulation. We hope it does it quickly in order to give small businesses this flexibility they do not currently have and to respond to the rising costs in some cases that this government has imposed on them and make their businesses more viable, but we will be supporting the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,2,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-06-27,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:04):  I thank Senator Ryan for finishing early. I want to say quite a number of things about this piece of legislation. I am aware that there are many others who would like to debate this particular bill but unfortunately, because of the guillotine imposed by the Labor Party, with the support of their political allies the Greens, we are constrained to a very short period of time to debate this important bill.


In relation to the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill, I say: one down, 19,899 to go. Madam Deputy President, you will recall that the Labor Party promised some time ago that for every new regulation they introduced they would repeal one. We know that since the Labor Party have been in power they have introduced some 21,000 new or amended regulations. I will just repeat that: since the Labor Party have been in power, they have introduced 21,000 new or amended regulations which small business and business generally have to comply with. No wonder the cost of doing business has gone up so much in Australia. No wonder Australian manufacturing businesses are closing down daily and exporting the manufacturing jobs that used to be in Australia to China, India and other places. It is all because the Labor Party continue to impose costs like the carbon tax and the mining tax on small business. They have imposed on small business, as I said, 21,000 new or amended regulations since they have been in power.


Perhaps I will digress here. Why would anyone, particularly me, believe any promise the Labor Party made after the most famous misstatement of all time—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Perhaps that statement has turned out to be true, because Ms Gillard is no longer leading a government that clearly has introduced the carbon tax. It will be interesting to see what Mr Rudd does in relation to the commitment never to introduce a carbon tax that was made by the Australian Labor Party before the last election.


But I digress. Getting back to their promise that for every regulation they introduced they would repeal one, I might say that they have not repealed 21,000, although to their credit they have repealed 1,100. That is why I say of this piece of legislation, 'One down and a mere 19,899 to go,' if the Labor Party are to discharge the promise they made to repeal one regulation for every one they introduced. Having said that, I congratulate the Gillard government for reducing at least one piece of regulation with this bill.


As my colleague Senator Ryan has very clearly explained, this is a regulation about pricing in restaurants and cafes. It has taken over 12 months of consultation to get to this day. Three state governments have had to agree. It has been through a tortuous path just to get here. And you wonder why Australia is going down the gurgler. You wonder why Australian jobs are going overseas. It is because the Gillard, and before that the Rudd, Labor government just imposed taxes, costs and regulation on business, so that it is no longer possible for Australians to have a manufacturing industry or, indeed, many industries at all.


This process, which we hope will be finished today, will at least address the issue of the way in which you can advertise the weekend surcharge on a restaurant menu or on a board outside a restaurant or cafe. I am sure that those listening to this debate will not believe that we have had to go through this tortuous process just do that. But that is what happens when you have Labor governments. They are interested only in telling everybody how they should act. They do not believe that people are capable of making their own decisions. Labor governments always think that they know better; Big Brother in Canberra knows better than individuals. They will tell you what you can do with your life and your business.


This regulation is simply another impost on small business. The Liberal Party and the National Party are the parties of small business. Why? Because we recognise that they are the engine room of our economy. We also recognise that it is business—small business, medium business—that creates jobs in Australia. It is not governments that create jobs, unless they create artificial jobs in the bureaucracy—and heaven knows that they have done that. I forget the actual figure, but I think that since the Labor Party have been in power we have employed—what is it?—22,000 additional public servants. I take it back—




Senator Thorp:
  We have created 900,000 new jobs.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  The government has created 900,000 new jobs? I do not know that there are 900,000 new public servants, because those are the only jobs that governments can actually create. Small business and medium-sized business and big business are the ones that create jobs. The jobs that the government creates are the 22,000 additional public servants, most of them in this lovely city. Those are the jobs the Labor government have created. We in the coalition understand that real job creation comes from small and medium-sized business. That is why you cannot keep creating real jobs, as opposed to Public Service jobs, while you keep imposing costs and regulations on small business.


I repeat: good luck to the Gillard government for removing one regulation. I am not sure when the next election is going to be these days. Ms Gillard said it was going to be on 14 September. There is press speculation and a lot of rumours around members of the Labor Party that it is now not going to be on that date, but of course the parliament has not been brought into those discussions. Those of us who, in our democracy, are supposed to be running the country will of course, as is usual with the Labor Party, be the last to know. If the election is to be held on 14 September, and if the Labor Party are to discharge the promise they made about repealing 21,000 pieces of regulation in their term, they have a lot of work to do in the next few weeks. We know of course that that will not happen.


The regulation being removed, as my colleague has said, enables regulations to be made to exempt certain representations from component-pricing requirements in the Australian Consumer Law. The amendment will allow regulations to be made to place restaurant and cafe menu surcharges for specific days outside the component-pricing requirements, which put simply means that you can have a different menu or a different pricing explanation on different days. That seems very sensible.


It is brought about because there are substantial penalties for those who work on weekends and at odd hours, and that is appropriate in many cases. It does not, of course, take into account that many people, particularly university students who study during the week, often want to get their jobs on the weekend. They look forward to employment on the weekend, because that is when they can earn a bit of cash to pay for whatever they need money for. Regrettably, with the legislation and regulations that have been around over many years, the numbers of jobs available on weekends is simply not what it used to be. So all of those jobs that used to be available for university students, and others who find that working on the weekend really suits them, are no longer as plentiful as they used to be.


Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, you and I and many others have been to many seaside towns and tourist resorts where, when you walk along the main street on a Sunday, every second cafe is shut. Why? Because the small-business owners can simply not afford the staff to open them up. I was in Hervey Bay the other day with Keith Pitt, the excellent LNP candidate for Hinkler who will replace the long-serving Paul Neville—those are big shoes for Keith Pitt to fill, but I am sure he will do it—and we were talking to small-business men along the esplanade in Hervey Bay, and every second shop was shut down on the weekend, simply because they could not afford to open up on those days. So those jobs that used to be available to people who wanted to work on weekends in Hervey Bay are no longer available. That, I regret to say, is probably one of the reasons why there is unemployment in the Hervey Bay area. There should not be. Hervey Bay is a great place. It is the whale-watching capital of the world, with a great climate and great activities, and near Fraser Island; it is a magnificent place for people to go. But small business there, as it is everywhere in Australia, is struggling because of the regulation and cost of the things introduced by, first of all, the Rudd Labor government in 2007 and, more recently, the Gillard government.


Talking about competition and consumer affairs reminds me that small businesses are also very concerned with the duopoly of Coles and Woolworths. Coles and Woolworths obviously conduct legitimate businesses, and customers like using them. But they have an inordinate market power which producers, suppliers and wholesalers will tell you is not always appropriately used. That is why I am delighted that the coalition, as one of its core promises in the upcoming election campaign, is to conduct that root-and-branch review of the competition laws in Australia, to see what can be done to make it fairer for producers, farmers and small businesses to compete with Coles and Woolworths.


We now have a government led by Mr Rudd who will, no doubt, continue to promise to look after small business and reduce regulations. We all know, and Australians know, that Mr Rudd can be believed no more than Ms Gillard could be. We all remember Mr Rudd promising to end the blame game on health and hospitals, but what have we heard, consistently, on health and education and anything else that goes wrong under this dysfunctional government? It is all the fault of the states—they are the ones who do all the things for which the poor old Gillard and Rudd governments have been blamed! Well, everybody knows that that is a joke. Mr Rudd will continue to blame everybody else for his own failures as Prime Minister and then as a minister in Ms Gillard's government.


We know Mr Rudd well from Queensland. We remember when he, as a public servant, ran the Premier's office in Queensland. And you talk about dysfunctional governments there; you talk about how staff were always leaving the Department of the Premier and Cabinet in Queensland. It was because of the way Mr Rudd ran that office when he was in Queensland. It is easy to understand why one of Mr Rudd's colleagues, Mr Steve Gibbons, said, 'He is a psychopath with a giant ego.' It is very easy to understand that. It is very easy to understand why former minister Mr Craig Emerson, another Queenslander, who has known Mr Rudd not only in this parliament but when he was wielding the power in Queensland as the chief public servant in the Premier's office, said of Mr Rudd:


There has been attack on the Prime Minister—


that is, Gillard—


going back to the last election. There was destabilisation and leaking then; it's been going on since. … So if we're talking about attacking sitting prime ministers and destabilisation, I think Kevin—


and I think he meant Kevin Rudd—


should look in his own backyard because this has been going on for too long …


You will be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, perhaps better than I, of how people who have worked with Mr Rudd have always been very critical of any promises he has made, of the way he runs his office and the way he has run his government. That is not my criticism, I hasten to add; it is criticism by people who have worked with Mr Rudd in his cabinet, next door to him, and continue doing so. So promises that Mr Rudd might make, like this promise to abolish one regulation for every new one created, the Australian people will no longer believe. It is time that this country got a government it can believe and trust. I look forward to the next election, whenever it is, so that Australia can get a decent, honest government again. But praise where praise is due—one regulation is gone with this bill. I support this bill, but there are 19,899 regulations to be abolished in the next few weeks. I will believe that when I see it.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:23):  As this is one of the last bills that I will see in the Senate, it is very important that I speak on it. One of the reasons I came to this chamber was to support small business, and the issues I spoke about in my maiden speech are in a minor way addressed in this bill. This is a generic amendment. It is a statement of the bleeding obvious—that we cannot have small restaurants having to produce two menus. It is excessive bureaucracy. We have to get out of the way of small business. A restaurant on the High Street should not have excessive costs put on them. We have to make sure we create flexibility for people in the restaurant industry.


We have to realise that the restaurant industry is a great employer of people. As has been alluded to by Senator Ryan—he might not have thought I was listening to him, but I was listening to him diligently from my office whilst lying on my couch—there are around 38,000 restaurants in Australia and they generate around $29 billion a year. Many restaurants are family businesses, and they are the epitome of what I believe in in small business. This allows families to grow up knowing their children. To me and many in the National Party, it is a social statement—the capacity to live and grow with your children. I suppose we are influenced by how we grew up. I grew up on a farm. I saw my mother and father all the time because the business we worked in was where we lived. This is something that should be available to many people.


Restaurants are a feature of small business. How often do you go into a small cafe and see mum and dad and one of the sons all working together. In Chinese restaurants you see the whole family pitching in and working together and knowing each other and growing up as a tight family unit. So the ethos of small business is intertwined with the ethos of the family. It is a crucial part of the dynamic of where I have sat philosophically, and it is probably why I sit on this side of the chamber.


A key part of that also is that we must make sure that we do not create a bureaucracy that makes small business impossible. I have seen this even in areas such as the insurance industry, where small operators keep being loaded down with regulation for regulation's sake. This is generally to the benefit of large providers, who can deal with the overheads of excessive regulation whereas a small businesses cannot. The occupational health and safety officer is a classic example. Large organisations such as the one I used to work for, ConAgra, can employ an occupational health and safety officer; they have the capacity to do that by reason of the size of their operation. But smaller feedlots cannot because they do not have the volume to be able to support that.


A lot of the regulatory burden is state laws. One of the most insidious laws that came into the farming sector was the tree-clearing guidelines. It determined that an asset that was owned by an individual would overnight be divested from that individual and invested in the state. Many of my own colleagues on the conservative side of the fence started making excuses for it—'it had to be right', 'the community is right to steal an asset from an individual'. But it is not the community's right to steal an asset from an individual. Excessive regulation steals an opportunity from the individual because it creates a mechanism whereby it is virtually impossible for the individual to progress through small business.


If we are going to get out of the current circumstances we are in financially, we have to rely on the economic powerhouse of small business. We can either be forced into this position down the track or we can move into this position of our own volition by genuinely going into the area and recognising that there is always a risk-return trade-off. But at the moment we are too risk averse and the return is that we are putting unnecessary pressures on small business that will in the future impede an economy that has had the benefit in the past of a mining boom that has generated great wealth in the economy. But that boom will taper off because all commodities are cyclical. That is not some sort of Cassandra-like principle; it is a statement of the obvious. As the commodity sector peels off, you are going to have to rely on other sectors of the economy to take up the burden of supplying the return to the nation to cover our bills, to cover our debt and to cover the social services that we in here demand every day in passing legislation. That return needs to match what we lose from areas such as the manufacturing industry.


If you are going to use the argument of GDP, we must start removing regulation from small business. I hope this is a statement of firsts. I fully support the root-and-branch review of the Competition and Consumer Act. That is going to be an absolute statement of our belief in small business, our core constituency. Where we go with that is a reflection of who we are as a political force.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (23:06):  Since 2008, I have been privileged to deliver no fewer than 10 adjournment speeches on various aspects of Canberra's superb centenary history. It has been, for me, quite an unforgettable journey and one that I will always treasure. It has taught me so much about the quality, and the often unrecognised quality, of Australia past and present when viewed through the revealing lens of the nation's unique bush capital city.


For this reason, nothing has given me more pleasure, as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, than to be an active participant in Canberra's 2013 centenary celebrations. The year has plenty more in it, plenty more to come, but it will surely not be possible to surpass what we have already had, with Robyn Archer and her centenary team putting on such a great show.


The constraints of time tonight do not allow me to dwell on the mass of artworks, activities, conferences, speeches, concerts, events and exhibitions so far, but I would like to mention just a few of the year's highlights in this, no doubt my last centenary speech before the next federal election.


I start with the big March weekend, a few months ago, when Canberrans welcomed so many interstate and international visitors to this city. Andrew Schultz's Centenary Symphony beautifully captured in music the sense of celebration we all felt as we gathered around the lake having supper on that beautiful evening, witnessing a sensational musical score and one of the most elegant fireworks displays this country has ever hosted.


How appropriate it was to share such a special time with so many descendants of the original Canberra founders; Federation-era pioneers and personalities, including the present-day Lord and Lady Denman—the couple remarking, on the day of their return to England, that it had been the 'best week' of their lives. They were not alone in this. I am thinking, for example, of the audience lucky enough to be present at the memorable speeches given by the Governor-General, Ms Quentin Bryce; then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard; Chief Minister Katy Gallagher and then Minister for the Arts, Simon Crean, at the Foundation Stone site on Federation Mall. It was a pristine March morning, a beautiful autumn day on the Limestone Plains. Each of their presentations paid homage to the lofty sentiments of their equivalents 100 years ago. For a few unforgettable moments, the past and present were beautifully intertwined.


Then there was the Australian Ballet's specially commissioned Garry Stewart work, Monument, inspired by Aldo Giurgola's Parliament House design, which electrified packed houses at the Canberra Theatre last month. And we are not likely to forget in a hurry the assault on our senses provided by Patricia Piccinnini's Skywhale in recent weeks—a true triumph of balloon, breasts and any amount of purposeful hot air. I do not think Canberra public art will ever be the same again.


Less controversial this year but no less remarkable has been the string of centenary exhibitions at the national institutions that began, appropriately, right here in Parliament House last January when I had the honour of launching an exhibition entitled But Once in a History: Canberra's Foundation Stones and Naming Ceremonies, 12 March 1913.


If I were to single out one exhibition for special mention, then it would be the National Archives' Design 29, which is fortunately running until September, so you have time to get there to absorb the sumptuous artistry of the sixteen large renderings produced in Chicago in the Northern Hemisphere winter of 1911-12 by Marion Mahony Griffin and her team—a suite which comprised the visuals of Walter's entry, No. 29, in the international competition to design Canberra. For aficionados of the nation's capital, this exhibition is, quite simply, compulsory viewing.


Collectively, the treasure-house institutions during this special year continue to immerse visitors in a bygone era—an era of intense optimism, just before the outbreak of the Great War, that was largely shaped by the vision, energy and enterprise of Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher's second Commonwealth government. As this energetic government went full term, 1910 to 1913, with a first-ever majority in both houses of the parliament, Fisher was able to establish some of the fledgling nation's first vital areas of national infrastructure.


As we know, there had already been three talented non-Labor Prime Ministers before Fisher—Edmund Barton, Alfred Deakin and the formidable George Reid—but it took a Labor government to understand the precise nature of the pressing issues confronting the nation and fearlessly to pursue the best courses of action.


Andrew Fisher and his government were doers who, in defiance of the nay-sayers, implemented programs in the national interest—nation-building programs designed to last. The laying of the first foundation stones of the capital and the naming of the city in March 1913 were just one small yet significant part of a series of progressive initiatives. On his watch, Fisher established a national currency as well as the first national public bank, the Commonwealth Bank, the people's bank, becoming the very first Commonwealth Savings Bank customer on the 15 July 1912. Fisher also recognised that one imperative of an Australian Federation was the need to embrace remote Western Australia, and thus he immediately had work commence on the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway. In addition, the Fisher government developed a busy social welfare program that included the milestone Maternity Allowance Act, the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act and important, democratising changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. In short, the Labor government of Andrew Fisher trod courageously where no previous federal government had been willing to go.


In an entirely different era, a hundred years on and, amidst unprecedented national and global challenges, the Labor government of our era has demonstrated the same resolute attitude. While it has rarely gained the recognition it deserves, this government has done the blue-collar hard work, establishing the National Broadband Network and the game-changing National Disability Insurance Scheme. For the nation's schools, the government has implemented a national curriculum in key learning areas, introduced the MySchool website and injected an unprecedented level of school infrastructure funding the length and breadth of the continent. This Labor government has put a price on carbon, directing some $3.7 billion into aged-care reform; introduced paid parental leave and partner pay; and increased the pay for eligible childcare workers.


This is a record that any national government in any era would be proud of—much less a minority government. The last Liberal government under John Howard managed a paltry legislation record despite, like Andrew Fisher one hundred years ago, enjoying a majority in both houses. Fisher acted with urgency and purpose, while my reflection on the Howard government is that they squandered a rare opportunity in divisive pursuit of an outdated, ideological agenda with Work Choices. So, as the next federal election gets closer in Canberra's big centenary year, it is timely to reflect on our historic credentials as the party of gutsy leadership on some of the big national issues.


Sixty-five years ago almost to the day, another great Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, highlighted, as he put it, 'things [that] are really worth fighting for'—principles on which you give no ground. Despite all of the challenges of recent years, this has not changed. It will never change, and that is what makes us different to our opponents—100 years ago, now, and in the future.
