Whip/Selection of Bills Committee member

—I move:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I rise to speak on the amendment moved by Senator Abetz. What we now have is this—and I would not have expected to see it here: the Selection of Bills Committee has been unable to determine when a committee should report. The government has used, and will use, its numbers to force its position in the Senate. It is highly unlikely that this instance will not be repeated. The government has been reducing the ability of the Senate to scrutinise legislation. What it has done in this instance is seek to refer the Stronger Safety Net bill without the bill. No bill has been introduced into the Senate—none at all.
The coalition is going to support a referral to the Senate for scrutiny based on, we can only assume, the advertisements and the release by the Prime Minister, because we do not have a bill. We do not have a view yet from the government as to when the bill will in fact be introduced. I hope the government will be able to tell us that. If it cannot, we will have a position where the bill will be referred at some indeterminate time. The government has said: ‘We will refer it today and have a committee hearing on 8 June with or without a bill. It will then report on 14 June.’ Presumably—we can only presume—there will be a bill by that time. That means we will have to advertise to the public to make submissions based on, it seems, the statements by the Prime Minister and the public campaign this government has now funded. It seems that they have managed to get the campaign in motion well before writing the bill. That does not surprise me when it comes to this government.
We find ourselves in a position of being asked to support this motion. It is a piece of legislation that Labor think needs scrutiny. Labor believe it needs to have a Senate committee report and be dealt with. We are not here to deny the process; we want to engage in the process. We want to have a look at the bill; we want to have a look at what this government is doing in terms of the AWAs. Therefore, we are not going to oppose the motion. We expect the government to bring on the bill as early as it can so that stakeholders can have a look at the bill, what is contained within it and see whether the provisions that the Prime Minister has said will be dealt with are being dealt with appropriately.
The government has sought to introduce a fake safety net. Even if we consider it to be unfair, we want to see the black letter law, we want to be able to argue about those issues and we want to be able to ensure that the government is held accountable. That is the appropriate role the Senate plays in this place. Again, a one-day hearing is inadequate. The government knows that, but the coalition is going to ram it through.
They are now treating the Senate like a sausage machine. One day they will introduce the bill—and we do not even know whether we will have a copy of the bill—and we will be expected to deal with the legislation in the last two weeks before we rise. The stakeholders will have to provide submissions and deal with the legislation—and, as I have said, deal with what legislation? The government needs to commit to ensuring that stakeholders have adequate time to deal with the legislation, to read it and to provide submissions, and that the committee has sufficient time to hear those submissions and deal with the legislation in an appropriate way. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-05-10,"—The government announced its changes to the workplace laws a week or so ago with great fanfare and with huge expenditure of public money to tell everybody about them. They are so proud of these changes that they do not want anybody to have a look at them. That is how fabulous they think these changes are. They want to send them to a committee without having the legislation there for the committee to look at.
The title of the legislation itself, the ‘Stronger Safety Net’ bill, should be struck out on the grounds that it is misleading. This government rammed through legislation destroying the safety net, and for them to then put back a couple of threads and say that they are creating a stronger safety net has to be one of the most farcical misuses of the English language yet, and that is saying something for this mob.
This is not about opposing the legislation. For starters, we cannot oppose it because we have not seen it. As I said yesterday, it was the Democrats that played the pivotal role in ensuring that the safety net was there for the 10 or so years of the Howard government until they got control of the Senate. Anything that starts to put back in place the Democrats’ safety net we would be likely to support, even if it is only putting back a few threads. It is not about opposing the legislation. The Democrats are very proud of pointing to the safety net that we put in place against this government’s initial wishes—as was made obvious when they ripped it apart at the first chance they got.
Let us not forget what we have seen here. We have seen huge full-page newspaper advertisements all over the country paid for out of the taxpayers’ pockets to advertise the coalition’s new policy. That is corrupt behaviour and it shows how low this government has sunk. It is treating every coalition senator as a mushroom. It is assuming that they will support this sight unseen. All of the newspaper ads have gone in before the parliament has even seen the legislation, let alone passed it. That we could have public money spent telling people about a change that the parliament has not even seen, let alone endorsed, shows how much contempt this government has for its own senators, for its own back bench, for the Senate committee process, and it now expects some thanks or kudos for putting in place a derisory inquiry.
Nobody knows when this legislation is going to appear. Indications are that it might appear around the end of the month. What are people meant to put together submissions on—a newspaper advertisement or a press release from the Prime Minister? Leaving aside this government’s unbelievable record of deceit over more than a decade, the matter of basic incompetence in putting together legislation is precisely the sort of thing that Senate committee inquiries find time and time again because of the expertise from people in the area being examined. These are not all faceless, nasty, trade union bosses or thugs thundering in and giving the committee evidence. These are people from across the spectrum, people whom the Democrats always look to—as our record shows—to take a balanced approach to legislation. These are people that will not adopt mindlessly the trade union side or the big business side. They are people who have expertise in the area and will be able to say, ‘You might have put a newspaper ad out there saying that this is what is going to happen, but if you look at what is in the legislation it is not going to work like that.’ What do you do then? Do you pay for another bunch of newspaper advertisements? I am sure that you will take any chance you get to grab more taxpayers’ money to advertise. You have already put all the advertisements out there and you do not even know what is in the legislation—it is not even finished yet. You do not know whether it is going to deliver what you have already said in the newspaper advertisements, and this parliament is supposedly going to rubber-stamp it.
I remind the Senate and the public again of the Prime Minister’s pledge when he got control of the Senate. He said that he would not misuse his power, that he would not let it go to his head, that he would not use it arrogantly or inappropriately. This is yet another breach in a very long line of breaches of that most basic promise about an area which is fundamental. The government itself says that it is fundamental and for years the Democrats have said that it is fundamental. It is a key part of our economic prosperity, work and family balance and opportunity for people throughout the community. That is why we have got to get it right. It is not about being for or against the legislation. It is making sure that whatever is in it, whatever policy intent there is behind it, actually works properly. This is total contempt for the Senate process. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-10,"—The Greens also are opposing the referral date for this committee report. Of course we support it being referred to committee; we think it is absolutely essential. I remind this place of the pages and pages of amendments that came here to the original Work Choices legislation and the week we sat here trying to come to terms with them.
—That is because you wrote the pages.
—We put in a lot of amendments, yes, but the government put in pages and pages and pages of amendments to the legislation due to mistakes and loopholes that were identified through the committee process. Though that process was rushed, I think the committee sat for five days going through the legislation. We identified many loopholes—for example, for clothing workers, where there was a huge gap, and there were many other loopholes. We identified those through a rigorous committee process, fast-tracked as it was during that time. Many of us thought we needed a longer time to consider the legislation.
But here we are faced with the legislation hitting the deck sometime at the end of May, at a time when the committee can only meet in the week between 4 June and 8 June—so pick a date during that week. At most that gives us around a week from when the legislation hits the deck and is tabled to when we are sitting as a committee to review the act.
That gives stakeholders and the public about three or four days to look at the legislation and get a submission in. It gives the committee members only that amount of time to look at the legislation and, say, two or three days to read what will be a substantial number of submissions. We had dozens and dozens of submissions to the original Work Choices legislation. You can expect that we will get a number of substantive submissions from the community on these amendments. They will have to be studied very closely. The community will have a week and the committee will have less than a week to review these changes, to see if they are doing what the government say they will do—whether they are actually carrying out their intent or whether there is another series of loopholes that you could drive a truck through. We will have basically a week to consider these changes which are supposed to be substantive ones that will, supposedly, bring reform to the way that AWAs work.
I do not know if the Greens are going to be able to support the legislation, because I have not seen it. I suspect—in fact, I am pretty certain—it will not go as far as the Greens would like it to go. So we need time to assess the legislation, to assess what the community and the stakeholders say about the legislation and maybe even draft some amendments that will fix some of the holes that may or may not be there. But the point is that we need time to do that. The government are treating this place and the community with contempt if they think that a little over a week is enough time to consider substantive changes and to see if they are really going to deliver on what they have said and on what the community needs in terms of a safety net for the government’s new, so-called reformed, Work Choices. We need to see if the legislation actually addresses the fundamental flaws and provides the safety net that the government are saying is needed. A week is a contempt; the government are treating us with contempt. If the government were serious about getting real input they would allow the committee and the community a substantial amount of time to consider these changes. The Greens will not be supporting this referral date, although I reiterate that we support the referral to the committee. But, quite clearly, the government are treating that process with contempt by limiting it to 14 June, particularly in light of the fact that we will not be seeing the legislation until the end of May. The time for us to consider it as the committee is so short it is laughable.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2007-05-10,"—Family First is pleased the government has agreed to have the Family First bill on restoring family-work balance with regard to Work Choices referred to an inquiry. Even though we would have preferred more time, it is better to have the legislation referred through than not at all. Work Choices is a huge issue for the Australian public. People are concerned about whether the right balance has been struck, given that it was a very high risk strategy to say, ‘No problems, no changes,’ and that ripping up Work Choices and AWAs was another position that people were not looking for. They are looking for something in the middle. Family First’s bill was to guarantee public holidays, meal breaks, overtime and penalty rates and redundancy entitlements. These are matters of real concern to Australians, as is getting the right balance. So Family First is pleased that it has been referred through to an inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I also want to speak briefly on this matter because I am Deputy Chair of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee to which these bills are being referred and will have to deal with the practical problems in developing a report after scrutinising the legislation which is not before the Senate at this time. While we can have political positions about the legislation, when it comes to the practical task of reviewing and scrutinising this legislation it becomes incredibly difficult for us and demeans the Senate processes when we do not have the opportunity to have the legislation in advance and when people who wish to make submissions do not have the opportunity to fully consider the legislation. I do not know how long the bill will be, but the act it will seek to amend is a significant and complex one. The last amendment bill was the Work Choices amendment bill, which was a 600-page amendment bill and created a new bill which sought to fundamentally restructure existing legislation. There are still issues that people are trying to work out. There are still court determinations being made to interpret some of this legislation. To re-amend that bill and to get some proper advice and considered opinions from those interested—the public, trade unions, employer organisations—will take time. If they do not have the time to consider it and if the submissions that they make to our committee are not properly considered, then the task of the committee in scrutinising the legislation is made even more difficult.
We take it as a matter of course these days that the government does not allow us adequate time to scrutinise these matters in the first place. But it makes a mockery of the process, with even that short time to scrutinise the legislation, if the submissions cannot be fully considered because people do not have enough time to fully reflect on the legislation in front of them. The government seeks to refer these bills and we appreciate that; that is one of the fundamental roles of the Senate. But if you are referring them just so you can say that the Senate has gone through its process, again it makes a mockery of the whole system. If we are going to do the job of scrutinising legislation as we should, we should be afforded the necessary time, resources and ability to do our work properly. Having rushed reports and rushed inquiries does nothing for the reputation of this place. I am disappointed, as deputy chair of this committee who will have the practical responsibility of trying to pull together this report, that it is being conducted in such a way. The government should reconsider and should give a reasonable time. Once the legislation is in the public domain or introduced in the Senate, that is when we should start determining times for submissions and times for the Senate to do its job through the committee process. Adequate time should then be allowed for us to reflect on the submissions, reflect on the arguments put before us, reflect on the legislation we have actually seen and be able to prepare a considered report for the Senate as a whole.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-05-10,"—by leave—I thank the Senate. The circumstances in which the Senate finds itself are quite clear. This legislation is about providing an extra strand or two to the safety net that is already there for Australian workers. There is a perception, right or wrong, that the safety net that has been provided thus far should be amended and strengthened. We are of the view that that should occur. Given that we are of the view that that should occur, we believe that the sooner it occurs the better for all Australian workers. So it is quite disingenuous of those who feign support for the Australian workers to then seek to delay the consideration of this legislation.
Why are we moving this amendment today? Very simply, if the motion does not go in today, we cannot refer the bill to a committee out of session. We would therefore have to move it on 12 June and then, with all the delays of advertising, hearings and a committee report, we would be a considerable distance further down the track, thus denying the protection those opposite demand be provided for the Australian workforce. When you take all that into account, you can understand why the government is eager for this to occur as expeditiously as possible.
We had a bizarre contribution from my friend from the Democrats suggesting that, on the one hand, the government was corrupt in advertising its proposed changes and then, in the next breath, saying that we were hiding our proposed changes from the Australian people. You cannot run those arguments in tandem. Either we are putting them out there for the Australian people or we are hiding them. You cannot really have it both ways. Of course, that is the great thing about the Australian Democrats. They always like to have it both ways. That is why they have fallen between the stools of Australian politics.
—Where’s the legislation?
—And where is the legislation? I remind Senator Bartlett of the problem: a very distinguished predecessor of his from Queensland, Senator John Woodley, moved in this place referral of legislation to a committee before the bill was introduced, as I understand it, for the very same sorts of reasons we are doing so today. So there are precedents in this place that people like Senator Bartlett deliberately shut their eyes to, even when the precedent is from their own side, albeit a very small side, of Australian politics.
Senator Siewert tells us that chances are the legislation will not go as far as the Greens want it to go. Can I tell her? I reckon she is spot on, and I agree with her; it will not be going as far as the Greens want it to, because we will not countenance ‘no ticket, no start’. We will not countenance bargaining fees, and we will not countenance union officials being allowed into workplaces uninvited et cetera. In fairness, the discussion here is in relation to a fairness test for those employed on salaries of $75,000 or less. It is a fairly discrete area in relation to the current industrial relations system that we are seeking to amend to provide extra protection, and that is why we as a government are anxious to get it through as quickly as possible to afford the extra protection for the benefit of the Australian workforce. I would have thought that anybody who professes a concern about protecting the Australian workforce might at least be gracious enough to say, ‘It doesn’t go far enough but at least something is better than nothing and therefore we support the government.’
Once again, this is an example of opposition for opposition’s sake, no matter what the argument might be, even if it means not providing urgent protection for workers, which they claim is absolutely vital. They are prepared to delay it for an extra month or two on the basis of opposition for opposition’s sake. It is very disappointing. We are pleased to have the practical input of Family First into this inquiry. (Time expired)

As I said yesterday, it was the Democrats that played the pivotal role in ensuring that the safety net was there for the 10 or so years of the Howard government until they got control of the Senate. Anything that starts to put back in place the Democrats’ safety net we would be likely to support, even if it is only putting back a few threads. It is not about opposing the legislation. The Democrats are very proud of pointing to the safety net that we put in place against this government’s initial wishes—as was made obvious when they ripped it apart at the first chance they got.
Let us not forget what we have seen here. We have seen huge full-page newspaper advertisements all over the country paid for out of the taxpayers’ pockets to advertise the coalition’s new policy. That is corrupt behaviour and it shows how low this government has sunk. It is treating every coalition senator as a mushroom. It is assuming that they will support this sight unseen. All of the newspaper ads have gone in before the parliament has even seen the legislation, let alone passed it. That we could have public money spent telling people about a change that the parliament has not even seen, let alone endorsed, shows how much contempt this government has for its own senators, for its own back bench, for the Senate committee process, and it now expects some thanks or kudos for putting in place a derisory inquiry.
Nobody knows when this legislation is going to appear. Indications are that it might appear around the end of the month. What are people meant to put together submissions on—a newspaper advertisement or a press release from the Prime Minister? Leaving aside this government’s unbelievable record of deceit over more than a decade, the matter of basic incompetence in putting together legislation is precisely the sort of thing that Senate committee inquiries find time and time again because of the expertise from people in the area being examined. These are not all faceless, nasty, trade union bosses or thugs thundering in and giving the committee evidence. These are people from across the spectrum, people whom the Democrats always look to—as our record shows—to take a balanced approach to legislation. These are people that will not adopt mindlessly the trade union side or the big business side. They are people who have expertise in the area and will be able to say, ‘You might have put a newspaper ad out there saying that this is what is going to happen, but if you look at what is in the legislation it is not going to work like that.’ What do you do then? Do you pay for another bunch of newspaper advertisements? I am sure that you will take any chance you get to grab more taxpayers’ money to advertise. You have already put all the advertisements out there and you do not even know what is in the legislation—it is not even finished yet. You do not know whether it is going to deliver what you have already said in the newspaper advertisements, and this parliament is supposedly going to rubber-stamp it.
I remind the Senate and the public again of the Prime Minister’s pledge when he got control of the Senate. He said that he would not misuse his power, that he would not let it go to his head, that he would not use it arrogantly or inappropriately. This is yet another breach in a very long line of breaches of that most basic promise about an area which is fundamental. The government itself says that it is fundamental and for years the Democrats have said that it is fundamental. It is a key part of our economic prosperity, work and family balance and opportunity for people throughout the community. That is why we have got to get it right. It is not about being for or against the legislation. It is making sure that whatever is in it, whatever policy intent there is behind it, actually works properly. This is total contempt for the Senate process. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-05-10,"—The Greens also are opposing the referral date for this committee report. Of course we support it being referred to committee; we think it is absolutely essential. I remind this place of the pages and pages of amendments that came here to the original Work Choices legislation and the week we sat here trying to come to terms with them.
—That is because you wrote the pages.
—We put in a lot of amendments, yes, but the government put in pages and pages and pages of amendments to the legislation due to mistakes and loopholes that were identified through the committee process. Though that process was rushed, I think the committee sat for five days going through the legislation. We identified many loopholes—for example, for clothing workers, where there was a huge gap, and there were many other loopholes. We identified those through a rigorous committee process, fast-tracked as it was during that time. Many of us thought we needed a longer time to consider the legislation.
But here we are faced with the legislation hitting the deck sometime at the end of May, at a time when the committee can only meet in the week between 4 June and 8 June—so pick a date during that week. At most that gives us around a week from when the legislation hits the deck and is tabled to when we are sitting as a committee to review the act.
That gives stakeholders and the public about three or four days to look at the legislation and get a submission in. It gives the committee members only that amount of time to look at the legislation and, say, two or three days to read what will be a substantial number of submissions. We had dozens and dozens of submissions to the original Work Choices legislation. You can expect that we will get a number of substantive submissions from the community on these amendments. They will have to be studied very closely. The community will have a week and the committee will have less than a week to review these changes, to see if they are doing what the government say they will do—whether they are actually carrying out their intent or whether there is another series of loopholes that you could drive a truck through. We will have basically a week to consider these changes which are supposed to be substantive ones that will, supposedly, bring reform to the way that AWAs work.
I do not know if the Greens are going to be able to support the legislation, because I have not seen it. I suspect—in fact, I am pretty certain—it will not go as far as the Greens would like it to go. So we need time to assess the legislation, to assess what the community and the stakeholders say about the legislation and maybe even draft some amendments that will fix some of the holes that may or may not be there. But the point is that we need time to do that. The government are treating this place and the community with contempt if they think that a little over a week is enough time to consider substantive changes and to see if they are really going to deliver on what they have said and on what the community needs in terms of a safety net for the government’s new, so-called reformed, Work Choices. We need to see if the legislation actually addresses the fundamental flaws and provides the safety net that the government are saying is needed. A week is a contempt; the government are treating us with contempt. If the government were serious about getting real input they would allow the committee and the community a substantial amount of time to consider these changes. The Greens will not be supporting this referral date, although I reiterate that we support the referral to the committee. But, quite clearly, the government are treating that process with contempt by limiting it to 14 June, particularly in light of the fact that we will not be seeing the legislation until the end of May. The time for us to consider it as the committee is so short it is laughable.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2007-05-10,"—Family First is pleased the government has agreed to have the Family First bill on restoring family-work balance with regard to Work Choices referred to an inquiry. Even though we would have preferred more time, it is better to have the legislation referred through than not at all. Work Choices is a huge issue for the Australian public. People are concerned about whether the right balance has been struck, given that it was a very high risk strategy to say, ‘No problems, no changes,’ and that ripping up Work Choices and AWAs was another position that people were not looking for. They are looking for something in the middle. Family First’s bill was to guarantee public holidays, meal breaks, overtime and penalty rates and redundancy entitlements. These are matters of real concern to Australians, as is getting the right balance. So Family First is pleased that it has been referred through to an inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I also want to speak briefly on this matter because I am Deputy Chair of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee to which these bills are being referred and will have to deal with the practical problems in developing a report after scrutinising the legislation which is not before the Senate at this time. While we can have political positions about the legislation, when it comes to the practical task of reviewing and scrutinising this legislation it becomes incredibly difficult for us and demeans the Senate processes when we do not have the opportunity to have the legislation in advance and when people who wish to make submissions do not have the opportunity to fully consider the legislation. I do not know how long the bill will be, but the act it will seek to amend is a significant and complex one. The last amendment bill was the Work Choices amendment bill, which was a 600-page amendment bill and created a new bill which sought to fundamentally restructure existing legislation. There are still issues that people are trying to work out. There are still court determinations being made to interpret some of this legislation. To re-amend that bill and to get some proper advice and considered opinions from those interested—the public, trade unions, employer organisations—will take time. If they do not have the time to consider it and if the submissions that they make to our committee are not properly considered, then the task of the committee in scrutinising the legislation is made even more difficult.
We take it as a matter of course these days that the government does not allow us adequate time to scrutinise these matters in the first place. But it makes a mockery of the process, with even that short time to scrutinise the legislation, if the submissions cannot be fully considered because people do not have enough time to fully reflect on the legislation in front of them. The government seeks to refer these bills and we appreciate that; that is one of the fundamental roles of the Senate. But if you are referring them just so you can say that the Senate has gone through its process, again it makes a mockery of the whole system. If we are going to do the job of scrutinising legislation as we should, we should be afforded the necessary time, resources and ability to do our work properly. Having rushed reports and rushed inquiries does nothing for the reputation of this place. I am disappointed, as deputy chair of this committee who will have the practical responsibility of trying to pull together this report, that it is being conducted in such a way. The government should reconsider and should give a reasonable time. Once the legislation is in the public domain or introduced in the Senate, that is when we should start determining times for submissions and times for the Senate to do its job through the committee process. Adequate time should then be allowed for us to reflect on the submissions, reflect on the arguments put before us, reflect on the legislation we have actually seen and be able to prepare a considered report for the Senate as a whole.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-05-10,"—by leave—I thank the Senate. The circumstances in which the Senate finds itself are quite clear. This legislation is about providing an extra strand or two to the safety net that is already there for Australian workers. There is a perception, right or wrong, that the safety net that has been provided thus far should be amended and strengthened. We are of the view that that should occur. Given that we are of the view that that should occur, we believe that the sooner it occurs the better for all Australian workers. So it is quite disingenuous of those who feign support for the Australian workers to then seek to delay the consideration of this legislation.
Why are we moving this amendment today? Very simply, if the motion does not go in today, we cannot refer the bill to a committee out of session. We would therefore have to move it on 12 June and then, with all the delays of advertising, hearings and a committee report, we would be a considerable distance further down the track, thus denying the protection those opposite demand be provided for the Australian workforce. When you take all that into account, you can understand why the government is eager for this to occur as expeditiously as possible.
We had a bizarre contribution from my friend from the Democrats suggesting that, on the one hand, the government was corrupt in advertising its proposed changes and then, in the next breath, saying that we were hiding our proposed changes from the Australian people. You cannot run those arguments in tandem. Either we are putting them out there for the Australian people or we are hiding them. You cannot really have it both ways. Of course, that is the great thing about the Australian Democrats. They always like to have it both ways. That is why they have fallen between the stools of Australian politics.
—Where’s the legislation?
—And where is the legislation? I remind Senator Bartlett of the problem: a very distinguished predecessor of his from Queensland, Senator John Woodley, moved in this place referral of legislation to a committee before the bill was introduced, as I understand it, for the very same sorts of reasons we are doing so today. So there are precedents in this place that people like Senator Bartlett deliberately shut their eyes to, even when the precedent is from their own side, albeit a very small side, of Australian politics.
Senator Siewert tells us that chances are the legislation will not go as far as the Greens want it to go. Can I tell her? I reckon she is spot on, and I agree with her; it will not be going as far as the Greens want it to, because we will not countenance ‘no ticket, no start’. We will not countenance bargaining fees, and we will not countenance union officials being allowed into workplaces uninvited et cetera. In fairness, the discussion here is in relation to a fairness test for those employed on salaries of $75,000 or less. It is a fairly discrete area in relation to the current industrial relations system that we are seeking to amend to provide extra protection, and that is why we as a government are anxious to get it through as quickly as possible to afford the extra protection for the benefit of the Australian workforce. I would have thought that anybody who professes a concern about protecting the Australian workforce might at least be gracious enough to say, ‘It doesn’t go far enough but at least something is better than nothing and therefore we support the government.’
Once again, this is an example of opposition for opposition’s sake, no matter what the argument might be, even if it means not providing urgent protection for workers, which they claim is absolutely vital. They are prepared to delay it for an extra month or two on the basis of opposition for opposition’s sake. It is very disappointing. We are pleased to have the practical input of Family First into this inquiry. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.
Original question, as amended, agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-05-10,"—I rise on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to report on the budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office for 2007-08. This is a requirement of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and reflects the Auditor-General’s status as an independent officer of the parliament.
The Audit Office’s direct appropriation in 2006-07 was just over $64 million, with no further funding sought or received during the year. The Auditor-General advised the committee that he had sought additional funding from 2007-08 onwards across two priority areas. First, the Audit Office sought $19.6 million over four years to meet the requirements of new auditing standards. Concerns about the quality of financial reporting, following high-profile corporate collapses, both overseas and here in Australia, have led to more stringent requirements being imposed under the Australian Auditing Standards. The Auditor-General has advised that the standards continue to evolve, with further additional requirements expected to be imposed in the years ahead. Australian National Audit Office audits are, of course, undertaken in accordance with these standards, and the additional requirements have had a direct impact on the level of resources required by the Australian National Audit Office.
Second, the Australian National Audit Office sought additional funding of $3.7 million over four years to increase assistance provided to audit institutions in the Asia-Pacific region. Within the limits of its resources, the Audit Office has provided valuable assistance to other countries. For example, the Audit Office is assisting the Indonesian board of audit and Papua New Guinea’s audit office, and has released staff to work in Afghanistan and the Solomon Islands.
The assistance to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea is being provided under the auspices of AusAID programs. However, the Audit Office is facing increasing calls for more informal, short-term assistance which it is obliged to fund from its internal resources. For example, the Audit Office hosted 34 short-term visits in 2005-2006, involving 319 delegates from a range of countries. I note that the Audit Office was unable to support recent requests for ongoing audit training from Bank Indonesia and Thailand’s Auditor General because of resource constraints. I think that is a shame.
I am pleased to report that, in the course of the budget processes, the Audit Office has managed to achieve an acceptable outcome in relation to its request for funding to meet the requirements of the new auditing standards. The Audit Office received half of the new funding sought for meeting the requirements of the new auditing standards—that is, $9.8 million over four years. The Audit Office has also retained funding previously used on the audit of Telstra which will cover most of the shortfall. The Auditor-General resigned as the auditor of Telstra during the year and negotiated to retain the portion of the audit cost that represented the Audit Office’s internal investment in the audit. This amounted to $7.6 million over four years.
The remaining shortfall of $2.2 million over four years will be made up from efficiencies generated by the Audit Office in its operational costs. These efficiencies include changes to the Audit Office’s accommodation arrangements, which will result in substantially reduced rental payments from September 2008. While some of those resources will be required for refurbishment and refitting of premises, there should still be savings available.
The committee notes that the Audit Office did not receive approval in the 2007-08 budget for increased assistance to audit institutions in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the Audit Office will review possibilities of obtaining funding from other sources on a government-wide basis. The committee hopes that government-wide solutions can be progressed as soon as possible given the strong capacity of the Audit Office and other agencies to help encourage better governance practices in our region. I think that is to be applauded.
In addition to these funding arrangements, the committee itself recommended that the Australian National Audit Office receive additional funding of $1.5 million in the 2007-08 budget to produce an annual audit on progress in major defence capital equipment projects. That is a matter that you, Mr Deputy President, have a particular interest in. By way of background, the committee is undertaking a major inquiry into financial reporting and equipment acquisition at the Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation, following a series of critical reports by the Auditor-General on individual projects.
Although the inquiry is still ongoing, it quickly became clear that there would be significant benefit in the Audit Office being funded to annually review progress in major defence capital equipment projects, in a manner similar to a review conducted by Great Britain’s National Audit Office. The committee therefore released an interim statement on the inquiry late last year, unanimously recommending that the Defence Materiel Organisation produce an annual report on progress in the top 30 capital equipment projects. That report, in turn, would be subject to published assessment by the Audit Office.
The recommendation made by the committee is similar to one made by the Senate which the Audit Office has unsuccessfully sought funds for in the three previous budgets. Both the Audit Office and the Department of Defence have indicated their support for the committee’s recommendation. I am pleased to advise that the Prime Minister has indicated that a submission agreed between the Australian National Audit Office and Defence should be brought forward in the context of the 2008-09 budget to give effect to the committee’s recommendation. We believe that the annual progress report will put the Audit Office and the parliament in a much stronger position to review project management at Defence while major projects are still in train, rather than looking in the rear-view mirror via an audit and parliamentary review sometime after projects are finalised.
The committee had recommended that the Audit Office receive start-up funding for this initiative in this year’s budget; however, that funding was not forthcoming. The Auditor-General has advised that his staff will be able to undertake significant preparatory work within existing resources in the coming year. This is something that the committee will assess as the year progresses.
We acknowledge that the new process will have resource implications for the Defence Materiel Organisation and believe that this should be taken into account as required in future years. Overall, the Auditor-General advised the committee that the Audit Office’s budget for 2007-08 is sufficient to enable it to meet its auditing responsibilities. However, the Auditor-General also advised the committee that the cost of qualified auditors, accountants and audit contractors continues to rise, which does put pressure on its budget.
We note that the Auditor-General has increased the allocation for staff remuneration within the Audit Office’s budget for 2007-08. However, the attraction and retention of staff in the current market will remain a key issue for the Audit Office. In the light of these developments, the Auditor-General has indicated that he will monitor his budget position and market conditions throughout the course of 2007-08, and will inform the committee of his assessment ahead of next year’s budget.
The committee considers it important to ensure that the Audit Office is properly resourced. The Audit Office must be able to attract and retain the high-quality staff it employs to undertake its performance and financial statement audits. We will await further advice from the Auditor-General before informing the parliament on the resourcing of the Audit Office beyond the coming budget year.
The Auditor-General’s advice that his direct appropriation of just over $63 million for 2007-08 is sufficient has been noted and welcomed by the committee and, accordingly, we endorse the budget proposed for the Audit Office for the year ahead.
As this will be the last committee statement on the Audit Office budget before the federal election, I take this opportunity to commend the Auditor-General and his staff for the productive relationship they have cultivated with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in this parliament and for the efforts they go to to ensure that we are kept properly informed. Their share of the federal budget is a very cost-effective investment in ensuring that standards are maintained across the public sector and in ensuring that the parliament is able to scrutinise the performance of executive agencies in spending taxpayers’ money.

That:

Amendment 56 (The Griffin Legacy – Principles and Policies);
Amendment 59 (City Hill Precinct);
Amendment 60 (Constitution Avenue); and
Amendment 61 (West Basin)
        of the National Capital Plan, made under section 19 of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, be disallowed.
The Greens have moved this disallowance motion today because of huge community concerns. We want to stand up for the role of the Senate in a true participatory democracy. Quite a number of people in the Canberra community have voiced concerns to both Kerrie Tucker, the ACT Greens Senate candidate, and me—and they have, on investigation, quite a bit to be concerned about. In this case, the Senate is being asked to consider these amendments after the rushed inquiry; the amendments were tabled in the parliament before the committee had an opportunity to conduct that inquiry; and the time for scrutiny of these amendments has been restricted by the 15-day disallowance period, which is up today.
Let me go back that truncated inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. Its report commented:
Due process dictates that the committee should have been given sufficient time to scrutinise the Griffin Legacy Amendments. At the conclusion of this process the NCA could have utilised the findings of the committee and considered whether to incorporate them into the amendments before they were tabled in the Parliament. In rejecting this procedure, the Minister has ignored the role of a committee of the Parliament and the contribution that it is entitled to make.
Those are serious concerns. The parliamentary committees, such as that committee, are particularly important—as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore—to ensure that government proposals are rigorously tested, the community has an opportunity to bring their views and expertise to the table and the executive can be held accountable to some degree at least. In this case, the joint standing committee has worked hard under unreasonable time constraints. It has come out with constructive recommendations but then been ignored by the minister. Here we have an example of this Howard government showing contempt to the parliament as it has repeatedly done since gaining control of this Senate.
The disallowance motion I move here today is as much to support democracy as it is about planning itself. The Griffin Legacy amendments are no small matter. They are of huge significance to the future development of Canberra both as the national capital and as a city in which 320,000 people live and work. The implications extend well beyond the central national capital area. As Enrico Taglietti, the winner of the 2007 Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal, wrote in the Canberra Times:
One may give the benefit of the doubt to the NCA’s good intentions but that doubt can not be given to the unmitigated arrogance of the minister in refusing the Joint Parliamentary Committee’s recommendation to disallow the amendments.
I understand that the National Capital Authority claims there have been five years of consultation on this issue. But others who have been involved in the process take a different view, including the joint committee, which recommended there be more time given. There is a strong view amongst the community that, while the Griffin Legacy project was an excellent foundation, the amendments do not reflect adequately the underlying understanding of that work, saying:

The Griffin Legacy directs future public and private investment in core areas of the capital where opportunities are created for vibrant, mixed use precincts alongside cultural institutions, government buildings and major national attractions. It restores the intended urbanity and vitality of Canberra as a cosmopolitan lakeside city.
There has been considerable discussion as to whether the Griffin Legacy document is really ‘a blueprint for future development’. We should look at these amendments very carefully and not be rushed into a decision. The joint committee pointed out:
... the NCA has never explained the urgency in tabling these amendments and apparently seeking to rush these amendments through the Parliament. These amendments will guide urban planning in the Central National Area during the next 25 to 30 years.
I am concerned about the substantive criticisms of these amendments. They are of interest to the present generation and future generations of all Australians and, in particular, those living in this great city.
The bottom line is that these amendments are very significant in terms of future development in Canberra and a significant number of people lack confidence in the current planning process. It is obvious that there are passionate supporters of the national capital who hold quite different views on these amendments and they surely are worthy of respect. It is an example of a healthy democracy to see lively debate and we need to encourage such involvement in that democracy if we are to be able to work together as communities to deal with the significant challenges, including planning the future, which are before us.
There appears to be agreement that these amendments are no small matter—that much we can agree on: they are of huge significance to the future development of Canberra both as the national capital and as a city and a place in which people work and live. However, what experts or community members do not agree on is whether these amendments will ensure the protection of this beautiful city in the landscape or meet critical environmental, social and heritage standards. That is a serious matter of disagreement when there is so much at stake. For this reason, the Greens support the call for more time to be given to strengthening and clarifying these amendments to meet community concerns not only about the amendments themselves but also about the undermining of the democratic and planning processes involved.
If the minister had given the committee adequate time for its inquiry, for public consultation and for the consideration of these amendments, that would be one thing. If he had not so arrogantly tabled them in the parliament, we would not be here today. There would not be so much acrimony about this process had he thought about it, responded more democratically and given more consideration to what is a very important public debate instead of overriding it. But this government apparently no longer thinks that the public, the committee system or the parliament for that matter should be substantially contributing to its decision making and its policy. We disagree. The democratic principle at stake here is so important.
Let me sum this up by saying that, had the minister allowed the committee of this parliament—which overviews the important core developments of this city, the planning process and the public import—proper time, we would not be here today. I know Labor may well not support this disallowance motion, but this debate is as much about the failure of the democratic process under the Howard government as it is about the planning process itself. When you fail in that, you leave people angry and frustrated with the democratic process. This is not a police state; this is a beautiful, wonderful democracy. The fact that the government has control of the Senate should not take away its obligation to respect that democracy. I urge all senators to support this motion.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN AMENDMENTS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,18,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-05-10,"—Senator Brown seems to be supporting the disallowance of amendments to the National Capital Plan on the basis of the process involved, not the substantive issues. With respect, Senator Brown has his facts wrong yet again. The consultation process for these particular amendments goes back a very long way. The Griffith Legacy—
—That would be ‘Griffin’!
—I am sorry; the Griffin Legacy—was first discussed back in 2002, I think, not long after I ceased to be the minister for the territories, including the National Capital Authority. There has been an enormous amount of consultation since that time, leading up to these amendments.
The amendments were released for consultation last year. Extensive briefings and information sessions were undertaken and special presentation tools were provided. These included advertisements in the Canberra Times on 5 and 19 August last year, advertisements in the government Gazette and invitations to the public briefing in the Canberra Times and in other newspapers. There was an information forum on 17 August 2006 for the industry, the professions and community groups. The model of the Griffin Legacy was unveiled on 17 August 2006. There was a DVD presentation, and public information sessions were held on 18, 19 and 20 August and on 12, 13 and 14 September where the Griffin Legacy model is located. On 19 September a Youth InterACT forum was briefed, and there were various other community briefings.
The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories received three briefings on the Griffin Legacy, so the suggestion that the committee was not kept fully informed is simply incorrect. The first was on 23 June 2004, the second was on 13 September 2006 and the third was on 11 October 2006, the latter being particularly on the draft amendments. The Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads approved the amendments on 27 November and gave the joint standing committee the opportunity to conduct a formal public inquiry. Instead, on 30 November the committee decided that it would conduct a roundtable forum to examine the four amendments. The amendments were then approved by the minister on 30 November 2006 and tabled in both houses on 6 December 2006. The disallowance period passed on 22 March 2007 in the House. It was due to end on 29 March 2007 in the Senate, but I understand that at five minutes to midnight Senator Brown lodged his disallowance motion.
It is probably important to understand the recommendations of the committee. The first recommendation said:
The committee recommends that the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in the future provides the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories with the option of inquiring into every Draft Amendment to the National Capital Plan.
That is rather a curious recommendation, because it has always been the practice before approving an amendment for ministers to write to the committee asking whether or not they do wish to inquire. In fact, this happened in this particular instance. The second recommendation said:
The committee recommends that the National Capital Authority explore options for ensuring that submissions to all the Authority’s consultation processes are made publicly available subject to full approval by the submitter and compliance with the relevant privacy principles ...
The National Capital Authority did advise the committee at the roundtable that it had now implemented procedures to enable the names of submitters to be publicly available with their submissions, subject to their agreement, of course. Prior to implementing this new procedure, the National Capital Authority was prevented under the Privacy Act 1988 from making the submitter’s name publicly available. I am advised that the NCA has now also asked those who made submissions on the draft amendments if they are happy to have their names added onto the website for the record.
The third recommendation did, as Senator Brown said, recommend ‘that the National Capital Authority has the opportunity to further refine the Amendments taking into account issues raised in the committee’s report’.
There has been an enormous lead-up period to this, as I mentioned, and Senator Brown did not move this disallowance motion until five minutes to midnight. Neither his office nor any member of his party sought a briefing from the minister’s office or from the NCA prior to the tabling of his motion. I am advised that his office was briefed last week by the NCA—but at the request of the NCA, not at the request of Senator Brown.
The Griffin Legacy project commenced in 2002 and has been the subject of extensive and comprehensive consultation. As I mentioned previously, this included government, professional, peak industry and stakeholder forums; public meetings; briefings; open days; the use of the internet; and a model developed especially to illustrate the possible outcomes. In addition, at the minister’s invitation the National Capital Authority briefed the joint standing committee on three occasions. Before the minister approved the amendments, the joint standing committee was given the opportunity to conduct a formal public inquiry, but instead the committee chose a roundtable discussion approach.
I could go through the actual consequences of the disallowance if it were successful, but that does not seem to be Senator Brown’s objection. He is talking more about the process than what the amendments will allow. Under the plan, as it currently stands, 1.5 billion square metres of development is allowed. If these amendments go through—that is, if this disallowance motion is not successful—the development potential will only increase to 1.9 billion square metres, which is about a 26 per cent increase. This increase is generally in the West Basin and City Hill precincts, and both areas were always development sites.
I could go through this plan and these amendments in more detail but, as I said, Senator Brown does not seem to be arguing the merits of the amendments but rather the process, so perhaps I will not take the time of the Senate. Suffice it to say, though, that it fits in with the ACT government’s plans for this area. It is always dangerous to try to precis what will happen, but my understanding is that it will allow for greater development in the inner-city areas of Canberra. The point has often been made that, whilst this is a magnificent city—and I am very proud of what our government has done for the national capital over the years and of the work that I did for the three years that I was the minister in this particular area—there is a feeling that there is a bit of a dead heart in Canberra.
—Don’t say that. You are being offensive, Senator.
—That is not offensive. You really are beyond the pale sometimes.
 (Senator Moore)—I remind senators about shouting across the chamber.
—There is a comment that there should be more people and more activity in the central area. It is a comment made by some; it is not perhaps a universal view. The NCA has gone into this, as has the ACT government. There is this proposal for these amendments which will increase the attractiveness of Canberra. I should point out perhaps that, once implemented, these amendments will provide an additional 12 hectares—I want to make that point—of dedicated public open space associated with the inevitable development in these areas.
The amendments—and I thought the Greens would be very interested in this—address water-sensitive stormwater treatment through catchment and settlement ponds; recreation; commuter cycling; and sustainable public transport. They are all areas that the Greens pay lip-service to in their general comments, yet these amendments are going to address those issues and the Greens are trying to stop them. As I said, I could go on at some length about what the amendments will do, but that does not seem to be the point of the disallowance.
I should mention before concluding that all Australians and particularly Canberrans will be delighted that the government has committed $58.8 million over the next four years to two major infrastructure projects to transform the centre of the national capital consistent with the Griffin Legacy. I see that Senator Lundy is here representing the ACT. I am sure that she will get up and, in her speech, congratulate the government for providing those funds and proceeding with the Griffin Legacy, which, as I said, has been so long in the making. As to consultation and the people involved, qualified, world-class planners as well as the general community have been involved in all of that. That is good news for the ACT. It is good news for all of us, because I think all Australians are very proud of this city as our national capital.
The budget also commits more than $3.1 million per annum for the maintenance of roads and other assets in the capital. The two projects involve the duplication and upgrading of Constitution Avenue and the bridging of Kings Avenue over Parkes Way at the Russell roundabout. The projects to be undertaken by the National Capital Authority will bring direct benefits to Canberra motorists every day of the week. Everyone who drives a car in Canberra will be very pleased about that. Constitution Avenue will be duplicated and a new, quality streetscape will be created. From Russell to Vernon Circle there will be two traffic lanes in each direction, one with bus priority, and on-street parking on both sides of the avenue. A quality public domain will be provided, including pavements, street lighting, street furniture and landscaping. These improvements will realise the avenue as the great boulevard that was envisaged by Walter Burley Griffin for the National Triangle.
The bridging of Kings Avenue over Parkes Way at Russell roundabout will remove one of the worst traffic bottlenecks in the capital. Parkes Way will be lowered and new bridges will carry Kings Avenue traffic over Parkes Way through to the Defence headquarters at Russell. This work will also restore Kings Avenue as one side of Griffin’s National Triangle. These works will significantly reduce travel times between Parliament House, the city and the airport. Construction is going to begin in 2008 and will be completed in 2010. As these works will be constructed entirely within the existing road reservations, they can proceed regardless of this particular motion.
I mention all of those things to indicate this government’s and certainly Minister Lloyd’s great support for the national capital and what it means for all Australians. Our government over many years has been instrumental in building Canberra to the great city it is today. I know that the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies, was a great supporter of the national capital and all that is in it. Some of the very fine features of the national capital are things that evolved during Sir Robert Menzies’s reign as Prime Minister of this great country. Over the last 11 years our government has put enormous resources and effort into adding to the great city that the Australian Capital Territory is. It is a national capital of which we are all proud. I think the initiatives announced in the budget, along with the amendments proposed for the plan, will make it an even greater national capital for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN AMENDMENTS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,18,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-05-10,"—Labor will be opposing the Greens motion for disallowance. There are three key reasons for this. Firstly, there is in general an in-principle support for the Griffin Legacy amendments, although it is acknowledged that some finetuning would have been preferred. Secondly, there is a great deal of merit in ensuring a long-term vision to inform planning decisions for the next 50 years in the nation’s capital. Thirdly, we already have two planning authorities with much duplication in the ACT. We do not need a third in the Senate.
Our position is informed by the roundtable conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories in its review of the Griffin Legacy amendments. Those amendments, for the record, are 56, 59, 60 and 61, affecting City Hill, West Basin and Constitution Avenue, and also an amendment which covers in-principle matters across all of those areas. We are also informed by the committee’s interaction with the National Capital Authority over a number of years, not least, as you have heard, by the extensive consultation and presentations to the committee over quite a period of time.
The first point I would like to make is that the process of disallowance provides for no opportunity to amend the draft amendments to the National Capital Plan. We are not able to do the finetuning that many, including me, believe would have been beneficial to the content of the draft amendments. The disallowance motion is the only mechanism through which we can express a view in the Senate. The roundtable discussion of these Griffin Legacy amendments conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories understood that it could only be the minister who could give effect to such finetuning. Parliamentary procedures determine that only the minister for territories is able to introduce such draft amendments to the National Capital Plan and there is no opportunity for them to be amended once they are tabled. That is why the joint standing committee pursued the course of action that would encourage and facilitate the minister to make these changes. The committee understood that there needed to be a willingness and intent, if you like, by the minister to make the finetuning changes, as no-one else could. The committee hoped the minister would effectively withdraw the amendments and bring them back after finetuning them. But this recommendation could only be presented in the following way: it could only become a recommendation for the minister himself to move disallowance of the amendments because the procedures of the Senate did not allow even the minister to withdraw the amendments once they had been tabled.
But, as we know, the minister rejected that recommendation from the committee, and that determined that the government was not willing to make those finetuning changes. It is Labor’s view that, because we cannot do that finetuning in the Senate, and in the absence of the minister taking the initiative, we are dealing with a Greens’ disallowance motion that creates an all-or-nothing path for this group of amendments. In the face of an all-or-nothing proposition, Labor are going for all; we do not believe there is enough reason or argument for these amendments not to progress in these circumstances.
This is because, in all of the strident criticism that was expressed at the joint standing committee roundtable, outright rejection of these amendments was clearly a minority view. Most who criticised the draft amendments offered their qualified or in-principle support for a long-term vision to guide future developments. Subsequent tiers of planning, design and siting supervision will certainly address some of the concerns expressed—although, I have to say, only if there is the will to do so.
Labor believe these amendments are in the interests of long-term planning direction. They reduce the current unacceptably high levels of uncertainty among citizens, community, government and investors, and they will assist social and economic planning by the ACT government. They will also address many existing problems with the amenity of the central area. There has not been a great deal of investment, and the responsibility for that, I believe, lies with the Howard government.
The Greens are opting for the nothing option. I do not think this is surprising. They have not been intimately engaged with committee processes over many years and they have got hold of this issue recently and sought, I suspect, a political opportunity. I am not surprised by that at all. But there is another reason: the ACT has long suffered because of the competing tensions between territory level and national capital planning level authorities. We do have a dual planning system along main roads, so-called designated areas, aspects of Civic, pockets of national capital land and, obviously, the parliamentary triangle, and we are complete with anomalies such as the airport, which was under the sole jurisdiction of the NCA during recent periods of massive office development and now has no planning authority. Also, the pocket of residential land in Deakin/Forrest is under the sole jurisdiction of the NCA.
The last thing the ACT needs is a third planning authority in the form of the Senate. I am not a professional planner—there might be one or two of us here but the majority of us are not—and I would not presume to make subjective and detailed decisions regarding specific amendments. While I respect the opinion of many planners and architects who disagree with the NCA’s conclusions contained in these amendments, I do not think the Senate is the appropriate place to give life to their alternative suggestions or to veto generally supported propositions.
The third point I want to make is that we all have a responsibility to ensure the accountability of ministers and government bodies such as the National Capital Authority in fulfilling their statutory obligations—a point strongly made by Senator Bob Brown and observed succinctly by Senator Ian Macdonald. Both the Labor Party and the joint standing committee have been highly critical of the National Capital Authority in this regard for many years. Ultimately, the primary complaints in the matter of the Griffin Legacy amendments as expressed to the joint standing committee were: the concerns, issues and problems raised by the roundtable ought to have been canvassed, raised and fleshed out by the National Capital Authority before they got to the committee; and the minister having tabled the amendments in parliament. It is true to say that, had the roundtable occurred prior to the tabling, some of these issues could have been addressed.
As a member of the committee, I have to say that there was no sense of the magnitude of the concerns that existed prior to tabling. The roundtable was a decision by the committee as a way of checking the community sentiment because the committee understood the magnitude and importance of these Griffin Legacy amendments. But as a committee we were shocked at the vehemence and passion of many that participated in the roundtable. It is all good and well to say that in hindsight we would have preferred to have some way of at least advising the minister and the NCA of those concerns, but prior to the roundtable there was no real voice given to that, and that really falls at the feet of the National Capital Authority.
So while political responsibility for this lies at the feet of the minister, because he is the one who tables the draft amendments, I think there ought to be some serious questions asked from the government’s end about how the National Capital Authority really did go about their so-called thorough consultation with the sorts of people who attended the roundtable and who held very passionate views. Why were they not aired prior to this amendment getting to the parliament in the first place?
I also think it was disingenuous of Senator Macdonald to defend the NCA’s consultation process and the claimed privacy issues relating to submissions. After examination of the statistical overview of the NCA’s consultation plan the committee did find that many of the submissions they measured were not substantive. As a committee we felt that those privacy provisions were part of an exercise—whether genuine or not, and I am not judging that; they probably did run into a problem—which had the effect of clouding the clear picture of the views being elicited from the community. Had it been properly done, I believe we would have had a clearer and more balanced view of some of those primary concerns.
Finally, it is important to acknowledge the elected ACT government’s support for these amendments. In the furore about lack of meaningful consultation, the feedback I have had from my ACT Assembly colleagues is that they were thoroughly consulted and that the territory planning authority was closely involved in the development of these amendments. This is not the usual practice, unfortunately, but it adds considerable credibility to the draft amendments to the National Capital Plan before us.
In the spirit of constructive critique I would like to identify some of the universally expressed concerns, and the ones I would like to focus on are traffic and parking. I am concerned that the proposed densities of commercial and residential developments which, I hasten to say, will occur over the next 30 to 50 years—so we have some time to plan ahead—will inevitably result in increased traffic and parking. That is obvious. A thoughtful and realistic strategy must accompany any and all development approvals that may occur over the next 30 to 50 years under the auspices of this National Capital Plan.
I note the federal budget’s convenient and welcome announcement to spend money on road infrastructure at the Parkes Way and King’s Avenue intersection. It is helpful, and I urge both the ACT and the federal governments to keep their attention focused further east around the airport. We know all too well the traffic problems occurring out there. The traffic congestion at the airport is the fault of the National Capital Authority and is the product of what happens when the NCA has no responsibility for the impact on road infrastructure, traffic flows and associated costs with commercial developments approved at the airport. It is a symptom, I guess, of what happens when there is a disconnect in having two planning authorities.
These issues can equally be related to the increased traffic and parking problems in the Civic and Barton areas. The NCA has long argued for the implementation of pay parking in the Parliamentary Triangle. I think that most people in Canberra are familiar with the parking problems in Civic. The Commonwealth ought to make a contribution to resolving this problem given the Commonwealth’s decision regarding the location of Commonwealth departments and agencies.
In relation to parking ratios in commercial and residential buildings, I understand the Commonwealth and the NCA will adopt, or intend to adopt, the standards of the ACT. The standards or formulae need to address the contemporary needs of Canberra citizens and the workforce. There is a case for serious thought to be given to the current formula particularly if you extrapolate it to possible developments in the medium to long term. So I welcome the investment in Constitution Avenue announced by the government, qualified by my request that extra care and attention be paid to traffic flows and parking arrangements and, of course, useful and sustainable public transport to service these areas.
The care and diligence with which this issue is approached is a big test for the National Capital Authority. They have not shown themselves to be very responsive in the past, so I am not particularly confident. But I think there is a great deal of goodwill emanating from the Griffin Legacy amendment process. I have criticised the NCA vehemently in the past when they have denied the elected ACT government the right to implement policies they were elected on. The NCA is not democratically elected and I have long argued that they ought to respect the authority vested in the ACT government on planning issues when those issues are clearly about the local community as opposed to directly about the national capital and the Parliamentary Triangle.
The ACT has had self government for many years now, and I refer colleagues to the inquiry into the role of the National Capital Authority some years ago which highlighted the red tape contained in the two planning systems for much of Canberra. Labor presented a case for the removal of that duplication. The report acknowledged the maturity of the territory planning system and, importantly, our confidence that many of the precious and unique aspects of the national capital would and could be safely managed by the territory planning authority with due reference to the National Capital Plan.
In conclusion, I have a note on the budget announcements in relation to the Griffin Legacy amendments. Labor will be questioning the Howard government closely on the proposals for funding roads infrastructure and related proposals for land swaps. We are yet to see the detail but, as noted by Senator Macdonald, we do welcome these investments in ACT roads infrastructure. I am confident these amendments will serve us well. A vision and certainty is long overdue. The environment and the design of this city lie at the heart of its warm and wonderful character. We will have an ongoing role in being diligent to ensure that only the best outcomes emerge from this process. I was disappointed at the somewhat condescending and arrogant comment by Senator Macdonald in the government’s contribution to this debate. To even imply that Canberra has a dead heart is inaccurate, irresponsible and shows a lack of familiarity with this wonderful city. I also note that Senator Humphries appears to have been hiding under a rock throughout this whole public debate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN AMENDMENTS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-05-10,"—I thank senators for their contribution, but let me say that Senator Lundy has got it wrong about the Senate. The role here is to uphold democracy, to be a house of review, to be a backstop when government makes mistakes, to be a shoulder holder for the government and to make sure that wrong decisions are taken up by the keeper. To confuse that, as Senator Lundy has just done, with the Senate having a role of planner for the national capital is to have a basic misunderstanding of what this place is about and of its constitutional authority and responsibility. In its own press release the committee said:
Federal Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has recommended that the Griffin Legacy Amendments be disallowed so that the National Capital Authority has the opportunity to refine the amendments.
That press release came out under the name of the Chairman, Senator Ross Lightfoot, and of the Deputy Chair, Senator Kate Lundy. Senator Lundy dismisses that as saying that that was a call to the government to disallow these amendments so that they could take them back and consider them. But when the government failed to do that, the Labor Party capitulated, threw up their hands and said, ‘Well, what can we do?’ The Greens have come in and said, ‘We won’t capitulate to the government on this.’ As Senator Lundy said, many planners and architects ‘disagree’ with the NCA’s decision. She went on to say that at the roundtable there was a sense of the magnitude of the concerns and that the committee ‘were shocked at the vehemence and passion’ shown by people about these amendments.
Do we simply say that the government turned a deaf ear to that and truncated the committee’s deliberations, so we will capitulate as well? Of course we do not. The role of the Senate is to ensure proper process and that citizens are heard, not least when it comes to the planning for the next 20 to 30 years of this great capital. So I disagree with Senator Lundy; I think it is the role of the Senate and, indeed, of the opposition to stand up to a government when it is failing proper process and failing the citizens. We are a house of review. It is our job to uphold the review potential and power of the Senate, even when the government has the numbers. Had Senator Lundy supported the Greens on this matter, it is very likely that Senator Humphries opposite—he is not opposite now, but he would have had to come in here for a vote—would have been tested on this matter as to whether he stood up for due process for the national capital or he did not. Now he escapes that test because Labor has not put him to it.
Senator Lundy said that we do not need the Senate to be a third planning authority. We do not expect that role. But we do expect it to have the gumption to stand up for proper process when there has been such heartfelt and very informed opinion against the amendments which we are dealing with today. There is no reason why the National Capital Authority, for example, should not have been required to implement detailed rules and enshrine them into the National Capital Plan so that planners and people who love this city but have a different point of view could see that there are at least guidelines for the future, not a void into which all sorts of prescriptive and vested interests can move in the future against the wider interests of the citizens.
Canberra is the nation’s capital. I agree with the government that we are all proud of it and of the way it has developed, what it is and what it represents for this country. But I agree with Senator Lundy that the asseveration by the government senator that Canberra has got a dead heart is insulting, appalling and a blighted view of the magnificence of this green capital. What does the government want Canberra to be—Las Vegas? Is there some form of transformation of Canberra into a different sort of city that the government has in mind here? That is at the very heart of this matter because of course there will be big development proposals coming down the line to jump in on these amended rules; of course there will be pressure coming from the big end of town. What the minister’s representative disclosed here today is that this government is amenable to that pressure. So we should be alarmed and worried. He calls it the dead heart. No, it is not. It is a vibrant, beautiful, living heart of a city that is different. If only other cities had the green space, the relaxation, the delight to the eye that Canberra presents to the citizen and the visitor alike. That comment from the minister’s representative was insulting, unbecoming and ignorant of what this capital is about.
—I’ve done more for this capital than you will ever do!
—He says he has done more for the capital. He has just undone it in three words, in his description of how he views this city, and he should be ashamed of that. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate. It should put the citizens back into the picture. It should allow for a better period of reflection, debate and even finetuning, although there are major concerns for experts in the field. This process should not be guillotined, as it effectively will be if this last opportunity is overridden, when what we have at stake is 20 to 30 years of the future planning and development of this great city. I commend this disallowance motion to all senators and I hope they will support it.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-05-10,"—When the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2007 terminated last night I was making the point to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and her department that, in implementing these and other bills, we need to ensure that the interests of rural and regional Australia are to the fore. As I mentioned last night, as a result of the investigations and work that the committee did I am relatively satisfied that the arrangements being put in place are the right ones and do give flexibility for the future.
Before I conclude, there are two other brief points I would like to make. First, I wanted to congratulate the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Eggleston, who has just come into the chamber. Senator Eggleston is a very effective chairman of this committee. It is easy enough to deal with the Labor Party when they get argumentative on these committees; it is much more difficult when your own side becomes argumentative, and Senator Eggleston has a very good way of getting through difficulties, of liaising with the various members of the committee who have some problems with legislation and of liaising with the minister. He is usually able to resolve these matters very well. It is worth mentioning what an effective chairman Senator Eggleston is.
This legislation is about digital radio, and I want to draw the Senate’s attention to the government’s budget commitment of $10.1 million for community radio stations to begin the implementation of digital radio from January 2009. The funding that our government and the Treasurer provided a couple of nights ago will enable community radio broadcasters to extend their track record in innovation and provide fresh and vital services designed to complement the existing analog offerings. This is the first step in fulfilling the government’s promise to ensure access for community broadcasters to digital radio. For the 40 or so wide coverage community radio stations in the state capitals, it will provide the opportunity to add digital value to ongoing analog operations. I note the media release from the chairman of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia congratulating the government on its initiative in the budget. Community radio is particularly important in many parts of Australia. As a representative of country Australia, I know only too well what a great job community broadcasting does in making sure local communities are kept aware of events. They involve local communities and they provide a form of expression for local communities. It is good to see the government recognising this. Congratulations to the minister on the budget initiative to assist community radio.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL RADIO) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-05-10,"—Before I speak to the substance of the debate, I mention that Senator Ian Macdonald made some unfortunate comments when he stood to speak yesterday. Clearly, he had not been properly briefed. We understand that, once you have been moved from the front bench to the back bench, you are in a situation where you are not kept fully in the loop. The government assured the opposition that the bill would not be debated before 6.50 pm last night, and other arrangements were put in place. It is unfortunate that the government did not keep you informed of that, Senator Macdonald, but I accept your apology for your injudicious comments. I know you are particularly angry that former Senator Vanstone has taken the plum role you were hoping for in Italy. But you just hang in there. I am sure they will find somewhere for you soon—perhaps Iraq.
I rose to speak to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007, which brings with it amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974, and to the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2007. Radio broadcasting is a media platform of pivotal importance. Radio is broadcast into nearly every home, car and office across Australia. It can quickly relay news and current affairs, as well as entertainment, to a diverse range of people across the nation. The digital radio bills are of great importance as they have the potential to affect all Australians. The benefits of digital radio to both broadcasters and listeners are enormous. As with digital television, digital radio frees up spectrum, which allows more stations to be broadcast than can be broadcast under the analog regime. The opportunity to broadcast more radio enables broadcasters to develop new and specialist stations dedicated to genres such as sports, gardening, jazz music or children’s programs.
Digital radio brings with it improved sound. No longer will listeners in digital coverage areas have to suffer poor reception or distorted sound. Reception will be free from interference. Digital radio also brings with it ease of tuning. No longer will listeners have to waste time tuning and retuning their radios. With digital radio, there are no frequencies. Instead, listeners instantly tune their radios with the touch of a button.
Digital radio allows broadcasters to provide information to their listeners by way of text and picture images, for example by displaying on the digital radio screen a daily or weekly program guide, the name of the song and its lyrics, news and traffic updates or weather maps. Some digital radios also allow listeners to pause, rewind and even record live radio or programs in the future. This allows listeners to fit radio into their lifestyles, not their lifestyles into the parameters of their favourite radio broadcasts. Given the vast array of opportunities for broadcasters and the benefits for listeners assured by the introduction of digital radio in Australia, Labor supports the intent of the digital radio bills.
However, given the importance of radio to listeners across Australia, Labor considers that digital radio should only be introduced after careful consideration of the digital radio bills and informed debate as to their effect. Here Labor diverges from the government. Both Labor and the government support the introduction of digital radio in Australia. However the government, while acknowledging that this legislation needs some finetuning, believes that it should be passed. Labor does not consider that near enough is good enough and, while we support the bill, we do not believe that it should be passed without amendment.
Labor is concerned about the substance of the government’s Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill and also about the way the Howard government pushed this bill through parliament. Firstly I would like to speak to the deficiency in the substance of the bill. The bill only specifies the use of digital audio broadcasting, known as DAB and also known as Eureka 147, as the technology platform for digital radio in Australia. This provision appears at odds with the government’s own regulation impact statement in the explanatory memorandum. The explanatory memorandum notes that DAB is unlikely to be a suitable platform to address the extended coverage requirements of some regional and remote services in Australia.
Further, technical trials of digital radio technologies, including Digital Radio Mondiale, or DRM, need to be undertaken to determine which technologies or combination of technologies will best serve people living in regional and remote Australia. If this is the case, why does the bill specify only the use of DAB? Why is the government willing to pass this bill without having undertaken the requisite technical trials? Labor considers that this bill should ensure that the appropriate technologies are in place to enable the rollout of digital coverage to all Australians, including those in remote, rural and regional areas.
Additionally, Labor recognises that the choices to be made today in relation to digital technology will affect the manufacturing sector also. Manufacturers require certainty so they can develop and provide the appropriate technologies to harness digital radio and make them accessible to all Australians.
If it is later decided by the government that an alternate standard, such as DRM, is required so that digital radio will reach regional and remote areas, it will only then be necessary for manufacturers to begin producing multiformat devices with the ability to receive both DAB and DRM signals. Unless a second digital radio standard for regional areas is considered now, manufacturers will have no incentive to produce multiformat devices and the next generation of digital radios will not be DRM compatible. Clearly this is an issue of fundamental importance to Australians living in remote, rural and regional areas, and is pertinent to digital radio manufacturers. Labor considers that it is an issue that should be addressed prior to the passing of the bill.
Secondly, I would like to speak to the way in which the government disregarded the Senate’s role as a house of review and conducted an inadequate and flawed inquiry into the bill. The government referred the bill to the ECITA committee for inquiry on 29 March 2007, with a reporting deadline of 30 April 2007. The committee called for submissions on 4 April, requesting them by 12 April 2007. The objective of the bill is to pave the way for digital radio in Australia. However, the government’s short time frame for submissions saw that parties interested in the future of the Australian radio communications were forced to consider this important legislation in a very short time frame. This has clearly been inadequate. Secondly, the government did allow sufficient time for the submissions to be adequately reviewed and/or considered by the inquiry. Late submissions were accepted by the government and information was provided to the committee just one day prior to the final meeting of the committee. This expedited review process is clearly insufficient. Why is the government so determined to accelerate this bill through the important process of Senate review? Why was the inquiry such a sham? We did not even hold a public hearing. There are some serious and important matters raised in submissions from the public, and yet we could not be bothered, because this government is hell-bent on ramming it through the chamber, to hold a public hearing into some of these important issues.
Labor considers digital radio to be an important technological advancement and one that Australia should adopt. Yet, like all new technologies, it should only be introduced after informed debate and after careful consideration. The government did not allow any such debate or consideration. The majority report, released on 7 May 2007, acknowledges that fact. Furthermore, the report recommends that notwithstanding that there ‘may be some finetuning needed’—a government Senator’s own words—the bills should be passed. It would appear, then, from its own report, that the government takes the attitude that near enough is good enough.
The government is aware this bill is not quite right—that it requires some ‘finetuning’—but says that it will do and should be passed anyway. If this does not smack of political expediency, what does? The way the inquiry was handled demonstrates the government’s belief that the Senate should not do anything more than rubber-stamp its proposed legislation—a fine example, in this one small bill that has profound consequences, of democracy at work under John Howard!
Labor does support this bill, but it does not in any way support the manner in which the government has made a mockery of the legislative process in getting it across the line. It is on this basis that Labor intends to move a second reading amendment to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill. Labor’s amendment intends to make sure that all Australians are in a position to access digital radio, including those in regional, rural and remote areas, and that there is meaningful consultation to determine how we can achieve such access. The introduction of digital radio in Australia is exciting for all Australians. Digital radio offers a raft of innovations that will change the way we listen and use the radio to receive news, current affairs and music. However, it is important that we get the introduction of digital radio right and that no-one is left without access to this new technology and the benefits it can, and will, deliver.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL RADIO) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-05-10,"—The Democrats strongly support digital radio and look forward to its introduction. However, like other speakers in this place, I point to the shabby process that has occurred so far. There does not seem to be a reason to rush this legislation, because a whole raft of questions were raised during the inquiry process. There has been too little time to consider what are 137 pages of amendments. Questions raised cover the fact that technical trials were not done; issues concerning the DRM platform and its impact on rural and remote area access, and limited spectrum access and the operation of multiplexes; and where the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2007 leave community broadcasters in the event that they cease to hold a licence. I think it is not unreasonable to say that the government should have sorted out these problems before we had to deal with the bill itself.
The Democrats will consider the legislation and any amendments that are put up as the debate progresses. However, we recognise the difficulty in trying to fix this bill in the way in which many submitters to the inquiry on the legislation suggested it should be fixed. At the end of the day, this is really up to the government to fix rather than the Senate. I will be moving an amendment, which is not altogether related to the digital platform but is a very pressing issue for us at this point in time. I will come to it when the Senate moves into its committee stage.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL RADIO) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007 and related amendments to the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2007 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. This is an opportunity to pass legislation that will benefit millions of Australians and will see the introduction of a sound policy framework that will enable innovative digital radio services to be accessible by all Australians. It is an opportunity to establish a framework that includes provisions for appropriate and efficient technology and licensing arrangements. But there are concerns that this is going to be a missed opportunity. The issues surrounding this legislation are complex and the implementation of the legislation is far-reaching, and we have a duty to get it right.
Labor support the introduction of digital radio and the intent of the digital radio bills, but we stress the importance of the legislation having the best possible legislative framework. As it stands, this bill does not meet this requirement. For this reason we will move an amendment so that we make sure we do get it right. It is what the people of Australia expect—that we make sure that all Australians, wherever they live, get access to improvements in technology, and that includes regional, rural and remote areas of Australia.
The Senate inquiry should have provided that opportunity but, instead, it only highlighted the government’s lack of interest in ensuring legislation is adequately scrutinised. Having received the chair’s revised draft report and the final corrected response from the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts only the day before the committee met, members of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had to vote on whether to accept the final report, which had just one recommendation: that the bill be passed. Is it any wonder that Labor senators presented a minority report requesting an extension of time so that the issues raised during the drafting of the bill could be adequately addressed? Interested parties, including stakeholders, had to read, absorb and respond to the 137-page bill and its amendments in just eight days. It is not unreasonable to expect proper scrutiny. It is not unreasonable for interested parties to be provided with sufficient time to consider and draft submissions. It is not unreasonable to expect meaningful consultation.
The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007 will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to enable the licensing, planning and regulation of digital radio services. The legislated framework before us enables the provision of digital radio services by commercial and wide-coverage community radio broadcasting licensees and national broadcasters using the digital audio broadcasting, DAB, platform. The ABC in its submission to the Senate inquiry raised concerns that the DAB would not adequately service regional and remote Australia and recommended:
... that an additional digital radio standard that is appropriate for wide-area coverage of regional and remote Australia be adopted before the provisions of the Bill come into effect.
The coalition senators acknowledged this in the committee report, which stated:
The committee hopes that the government will take an approach that minimises barriers to the adaptation of digital radio in rural and remote areas.
When we look at the legislative framework before us, it is nowhere to be found. One would expect there to be some scope in the legislation to move to an alternative platform should it prove to be a better option and therefore provide manufacturers of radio receivers with the incentive to produce multiformat devices that can be adapted to receive DAB and DRM.
In today’s paper, we have the government acknowledging that consideration would need to be given to whether other technologies such as DRM were more appropriate in regional and rural areas and saying that the new system would be reviewed by 2011 to allow adjustments to the regulatory framework if necessary. Surely the aim should be to get it right from the beginning, get it right for the service providers and the consumers, and provide industry with long-term certainty in relation to technology development.
Our national broadcasters have raised concerns that the requirement to form a company in order to be eligible to access category 3 licences places additional tax obligations and administrative costs on them. Concerns were also raised about the restrictive definition of digital program enhancement content, with the view that to encourage the take-up of digital radio the definition should be broadened to include animation and video clips, which are already available on mobile phones.
The bill’s objective is to pave the way for digital radio in Australia, but there was minimal time for submissions to be written, minimal time for committee members to consider the content of the submissions, minimal time for the committee to consider the responses to its questions provided by the department and minimal time for committee members to adequately consider the full implications of the adoption of the chair’s revised report, with the recommendation to pass the bill. The inquiry process again appears to have been accelerated when there is no apparent time imperative for passing the digital radio bill. So we again see the Howard government’s disinterest in external scrutiny of legislation and again have significant issues raised, but the opportunity for them to be addressed is lost. The time frame was restrictive in that it did not permit the key issues identified as part of the Senate inquiry to be adequately considered—issues including ACMA being able to issue multiplex licences to only digital representative companies and no provision of guaranteed capacity for community radio broadcasting services on all available multiplexes.
Labor senators request that debate on the bill be deferred so that there can be a full assessment of issues raised in the submissions and that issues raised by Commercial Radio Australia, the ABC, SBS and other stakeholders can be adequately assessed. There are complex issues encompassed in this bill that should be addressed now. We should take up the opportunity to improve radio communications legislation and pave the way for digital radio in Australia.
Digital radio is an exciting development. It should be an exciting development for all Australians. It should ensure that rural, remote and regional areas are adequately serviced. It should be a case of access and entitlement issues being well managed. We should take the time necessary to ensure that industry concerns have been addressed in the best way possible; that consumers, wherever they live—city, metropolitan, rural, remote and regional Australia—have access to this exciting development; that the transition to digital radio is as smooth as possible; and that all Australians have access to gaining the maximum benefit from the introduction of digital radio broadcasting.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL RADIO) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-05-10,"—As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts I would like to pick up where Senator Conroy left off about the committee process in dealing with the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2007. The committee did not get to formally have a meeting or a hearing on this piece of legislation that the government heralds with great fanfare and trumpets in its budget announcements. We were circulated a few submissions and the chair’s draft report before we even had time to work out whether we wanted to conduct a hearing: such was the hurry that the committee was in. Perhaps it is a sign of the way that some committees are conducted in this place.
As I said, a draft report was circulated. We were told, very quickly after that report was circulated, that we needed to have a teleconference to adopt the report. Unfortunately, that could not take place with the alacrity that the chair wanted, because I for one need more than 12 hours to consider things. I was not prepared to take a draft report one day and sign off on it the next morning, and that is what was proposed. It was an unnecessary rush. At that point, when the draft report was circulated and the initial teleconference was suggested, we had not even received the response from the department. So there is room for improvement when it comes to the way that this committee is conducted, with regard to the pressure that the government perhaps puts on members of the committee and the way that they therefore conduct themselves.
If this is about the use of new technology and new advances in communications then perhaps we could actually be given the time by the department to consider their response to the matters that were raised in submissions before the committee is unnecessarily rushed into it. This is not the first time that it has happened in this particular committee, so perhaps we have some issues that we need to deal with.
As Senators Conroy and Wortley mentioned, we not only have concerns about the committee’s tight deadlines—and that is a growing issue with the way that the government is choosing to treat some of the committees in this place—but also have some issues with the legislation itself. It was a fast-tracked process, but the submissions that the committee did get revealed a number of significant issues that we felt we could have taken further time to consider.
As I said, the submissions revealed significant issues with the drafting of the bill. The short reporting time frame that we were given, particularly when considering the response from the department, did not permit the committee to fully explore all of those issues. We could have, if we had had the chance to fully explore them, corrected some of the issues within the bill, or our concerns may have been alleviated and we may have found it was a matter of misinterpretation. I think we need to fix the process. If we are going to talk about the significance of this advance in legislation and the budget announcements as heralded by Senator Macdonald, we need to get the process right so that, if this is as good as the minister says it is, we can all support the bill process. I formally move the second reading amendment that has now been circulated in the name of Senator Stephen Conroy:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate:
notes:
that the inquiry into the bill by the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee did not allow interested parties sufficient time to consider and draft submissions to the committee, this constraint not allowing meaningful consultation on the bill;
the lack of information as to how the omission of the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) platform from the legislation will affect the roll-out of digital radio to rural and regional Australia;
that this legislation only specifies the use of Digital Radio Broadcasting; and
that trials on DRM and compression standards are still being carried out;
calls for debate on the bill to be deferred until meaningful consultation has occurred; and
demands that the Government make every endeavour to ensure that standards are in place to enable the rollout of digital radio to remote, rural and regional Australia”.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL RADIO) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-05-10,"—I commend Senator Webber for waffling on about however long was required for Labor to get their act in order on this second reading amendment, which seems to have been largely the same as the one in the House of Representatives! Anyway, let us be charitable about this. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill 2007 and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2007 provide the Australian radio industry with a unique and important opportunity to commence digital radio services. These bills provide for the introduction of digital radio services using the digital audio broadcasting or DAB standard initially commencing in the state capital city markets by 1 January 2009.
Digital radio has the potential to provide a range of new and innovative services to listeners and thereby enhance the quality and diversity of radio services currently enjoyed by millions of Australians every day. Yet I note that the opposition is calling on the government to delay the introduction of the new technology, citing a lack of consultation with industry and suggesting that regional radio listeners have not been included in this process—I will deal with both of those issues a little later. In fact the Australian radio industry has been working closely with government for three years in the development of the policy that is implemented through this legislation. Numerous opportunities have been extended to major stakeholders to contribute to the development of the policy framework, and their valuable contributions and how important this is to the radio industry have been embraced and welcomed by the government.
The Senate committee’s recent report on the provisions of the bills noted that submissions to the inquiry were very supportive of the bill’s intent and the majority of its provisions. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the interest of these stakeholders in commencing digital radio has been a key factor in bringing this legislation forward. The Australian radio industry, which has to implement this legislation and use this technology, has lobbied strongly for the introduction of digital radio to enable it to respond to the opportunities and challenges of an emerging digital media landscape. It astounds me that the opposition and others do not see the relevance of getting started in digital radio. If you wait until the technology all aligns, you will never start. Technology continues to develop, and the legislation is flexible enough to allow reassessment—and there is a legislative review in 2011, which I will get to.
There are opportunities and challenges presented by this legislation and the adoption of digital radio. These opportunities will simply pass the industry by if we have troglodytes looking at this sort of legislation who do not understand that technology evolves and changes and that you cannot nail it to the floor until it all lines up and then start. It does not work like that with technology because it will be obsolete by the time everybody agrees on it in a Senate committee.
This government is very supportive of the intention of introducing digital radio. It is the last significant broadcasting platform to remain analog only, and digitisation is a key strategic priority for radio—they do not want to be left behind; they want to get on with it. The legislation provides the radio industry with an opportunity to go digital in a manner which incorporates the lessons learned from digital radio implementation overseas. We know from our inquiries and the extensive research that has been undertaken, for instance, that digital radio is generally preferred as a supplementary technology to analog radio rather than as a replacement—different to television. Analog radio shutdown may well be a long-term prospect but only a long-term prospect at best, and the dual operation of analog and digital is a reality for all countries that have commenced digital radio.
In recognition of this, the legislation provides for a progressive transition to digital radio without seeking to mandate both an unrealistic and costly conversion from analog. The first digital radio broadcast is to occur in the state capital city markets on or before 1 January 2009 using the DAB standard. The use of DAB as the primary platform for digital radio in Australia has the strong support of the Australian radio industry, including the ABC. It is widely recognised that DAB is the most developed terrestrial digital radio platform already introduced in a range of countries—and, importantly, for a small to medium country like Australia, there are a range of reasonably priced DAB consumer receivers available on the international market.
Contrary to the suggestions of the opposition, listeners outside the state capitals have not been and will not be overlooked. The legislation will enable the commencement of DAB radio services in regional markets, depending on the interest of relevant broadcasters in providing services. From my conversations as I travel around Australia and talk to broadcasters in rural and regional Australia, there is strong interest, and we aim to ensure that they will be able to access this new technology. However, I am pleased to note that the commercial radio industry has expressed considerable interest in providing DAB services in markets such as Newcastle, Wollongong, Geelong, Hobart, Darwin and the Gold Coast, and it is reasonable to expect that listeners in these markets will be provided with DAB radio services in these areas sometime after 2009. While DAB is the clear choice for the implementation of digital radio in Australia’s larger metropolitan and regional markets, it is acknowledged that the platform—
 (Senator Troeth)—Order! I would ask that conversations in the chamber cease while a senator, particularly a minister, is speaking. Please resume, Minister.
—It is, however, acknowledged that the platform may not be able to replicate the extensive broadcast coverage of some AM services. Consideration will need to be given to whether other technologies such as Digital Radio Mondiale, or DRM, are better placed to address the audience needs of some regional areas. I think it should also be noted that, at this time, DRM is not a widely deployed technology nor has it received significant commercial support. Only recently have manufacturers even committed to producing DRM sets in any meaningful numbers. In my view, there would be clear risks if Australia were to draft legislation to specifically support or even mandate the introduction of a technology that is yet to achieve significant commercial support in overseas markets.
This consideration, together with the view of digital radio as a supplementary rather than a replacement technology, supports the conclusion that it would be simply premature for Australia to develop a detailed and specific regulatory framework for alternative digital radio technologies at this time. However, there would be a clear benefit in continuing the assessment of the technology options for regional digital radio, and we think it is a sensible way forward. It is consistent with the government’s stated commitment to ensuring equitable access to new services in broadcasting by people living in rural, regional and remote Australia.
To this end, the legislation provides for a statutory review, as I mentioned, by 1 January 2011 of technologies for the transmission of digital radio broadcasting services and restricted datacasting services in regional licence areas. This review will allow for the appropriate consideration of issues such as the availability of equipment for and the coverage characteristics of various digital radio technologies as well as the types of services that could result from the use of those technologies in regional areas and will thus allow for adjustment to the regulatory framework should that be necessary.
The bills provide for the participation of wide-coverage commercial national and community broadcasters in the first phase of digital radio implementation. This recognises that the strength of Australian radio over recent decades has been based in no small part on the individual contribution made by each of these sectors. To back this up the federal government has provided funding of over $10 million to help community broadcasters establish digital radio infrastructure. It was a very important although quite small initiative in what was a most significant budget.
The government has also committed to funding the rollout of infrastructure to support the delivery of digital ratio services by the national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS. Together these initiatives will enable the sectors to participate with the wide-area commercial broadcasters in the commencement of digital radio services in the state capital cities on 1 January 2009. In Australia, the national broadcasters play a vital role in the Australian radio market and they are a critical source of service diversity, with their services highly valued by audiences across the country. Similarly, community radio is an established player in the radio broadcasting landscape also making a valuable contribution to the diversity of offerings of radio services. This funding package will ensure that the roles of the respective sectors are carried forward in the digital environment.
So, taken as a whole, the measures contained in this legislation cement radio’s important position in the Australian media landscape, providing industry with the opportunity to invest in innovative new digital content and provide listeners with a rich and more diverse radio offering.
I do want to address a couple of matters that have been raised in connection with the opposition’s second reading amendment, the first of which is the suggestion, indeed the claim, that this legislation has been rushed and calling into question the degree of consultation. The Australian radio industry has been working closely with the government, as I have said, for three years in the development of the policy that is implemented through this legislation. Numerous opportunities have been extended to major stakeholders to contribute to the framework’s development.
I just wanted to mention that back in December 2004, which is almost ancient history when you are looking at this kind of technology, the government initiated an extensive process of industry consultation, research and policy development to examine the most appropriate technology and framework for the introduction of digital radio in Australia. It culminated with the release by me in October 2005 of a policy framework to guide the implementation of digital radio which is now being implemented through this legislation. And—to borrow a well-known phrase—guess what? Nobody seemed to suggest that there was anything wrong with the policy framework. I never heard the opposition complaining about any of the policy framework as it was being developed. Indeed, it had the strong support and involvement of industry, and the framework was warmly received by the major stakeholder groups when it was announced. The stakeholders have been further involved in the development of the legislation to implement it through the release of an exposure draft of the bills prior to their introduction to parliament and through the Senate committee’s inquiry.
Somehow or other all this went under the radar, from 2004 until the Senate inquiry. You would think the Senate inquiry happened over 24 hours, but it went from 29 March to 30 April. That is hardly a rushed inquiry, and I reject any suggestion that the committee were anything other than able to deal with the issue. If they could not, it really calls into question their ability to get their heads around what has been on the table now since about 2004.
The government’s policy development process has been open, it has been transparent, and we can hardly take the blame if people do not wake up when they have some issues with it. The committee’s report on the provision of the bills said that the submissions were very supportive of the bills’ intent—and, indeed, industry wants this. I intend, as far as I am capable of delivering this legislation in this place, to ensure that they have it.
In sum, we have an interest in proceeding with the legislation to reflect the industry’s stated desire to get on with it and to actually commence digital radio. The Australian radio industry have lobbied strongly for the introduction of digital radio because they want to take advantage of the opportunities and challenges. The opposition should get out of the way and let them have it, because they actually run the industry.
I have mentioned in my summing-up remarks the fact that we do acknowledge that technology evolves, and it is important that we continue to look at the best way to deliver it in other areas such as rural and regional Australia. We will continue to ensure that consideration is given to other technologies such as DRM. It may not be the best, but we will continue to look at what will be. It is not widely deployed, so we certainly do not want to go down the path of adopting something that might otherwise not be a commercial or, indeed, a proper solution.
This legislation, as I have said, provides for a statutory review, and we will keep it closely under review. It is the intention of this government that digital radio will be available throughout Australia, and we will do it in a measured and a considered way that will allow the industry to adopt the technology that best suits them and certainly to deliver the services that will help to meet the needs of Australians regardless of where they live.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-05-10,"—We are dealing with the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007. Labor supports this bill. I will run through some of the provisions in the legislation. Schedule 1 deals with the effective life provisions of mining rights. Under the uniform capital allowance provisions, taxpayers can deduct the decline in value of depreciating assets used for income-producing purposes. The decline in value is worked by using the effective life of the asset which resembles the period over which any taxpayer uses the asset. The general depreciation rules do not apply to certain intangible assets listed in the 1997 act. Instead, the uniform capital allowance rules prescribe statutory effective lives for these intangible assets. A statutory effective life means that the legislation stipulates the effective life of these assets. Taxpayers cannot self-assess and the commissioner does not set the effective life of these assets.
Mining rights were included in this list in the 1997 act by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 2003 and linked the effective life of a mining right to the life of the relevant mine, petroleum field or quarry. An unintended consequence of including mining rights in this list has been that some taxpayers using the diminishing value method for working out the decline in the value of their mining right have wrongly believed that the effective life was based on the whole rather than the remaining life of a mine to which the mining right relates. Further, holders of mining rights wrongly believed that they had to assess the life of the right annually. This results in outcomes that are inconsistent with other depreciating assets under the uniform capital allowance regime, which was not the intended outcome of TLAB4 of 2003.
The amendments in schedule 1 of the bill clarify the treatment of mining rights by removing mining rights from the table in section 40-95(7), listing intangible assets with statutory effective lives and, secondly, inserting new sections, 40-95(10) and 40-95(11), to work out the effective life of mining rights separately from other assets. These amendments clarify the law so that it reflects the original policy intent. The changes mean that a taxpayer requiring a mining right from a prior holder will be able to estimate the remaining, rather than the whole, life of the existing or proposed mine to which the right relates, as with other assets. The amendments provide that taxpayers work out the effective life of their mining right themselves by estimating the period until the end of the life of the mine, quarry or petroleum field. Taxpayers holding mining rights will have the choice of using either the prime cost or diminishing value method in calculating the decline in value, as with other assets. Once the life of the mine has been estimated, there will be no requirement for a yearly or periodic re-estimation of the effective life of the mining right. However, a taxpayer can reassess the effective life if the original estimate is no longer accurate.
The amendments apply from 1 July 2001. This is retrospectivity which is required because the 2003 amendments were also retrospective to 1 July 2001. This will ensure that the policy intent is reflected in the law since the introduction of division 4 in the 1997 act. Therefore retrospectivity is appropriate. Labor supports the efforts to clarify the law and provide certainty to taxpayers. However, I note that these clarifications, which cause great uncertainty for taxpayers and business, have come rather late, since the uniform capital allowances were introduced in 2001.
I now turn to schedule 2 of the bill. This proposes to allow deductions for boating expenses to taxpayers who do not use their boat for specific business activities. Current income tax law allows only deductions for expenses incurred from operating a boat where the boat is used for a specific business purpose. The tax law denies deductions for taxpayers who use or hold their boat or boats to earn some passive income. For example, a boat owner who occasionally rents out their boat for income is not entitled to a deduction. These amendments will allow deductions for expenses related to earning income from boats even when they are not carrying out a specified boating business. The proposed changes will allow taxpayers who cannot demonstrate that they were carrying on a business using a boat to deduct expenditure related to their boating activity up to the level of income they generate in that year and allow excess deductions to be carried forward and deducted against future boating income activities. A taxpayer will be able to deduct expenses to: acquire a boat; retain ownership; acquire rights to use a boat; retain rights to use a boat; and use, operate, maintain or repair a boat in relation to any obligation associated with a boat or any obligation associated with a taxpayer’s right to use a boat.
Expenditure in relation to fringe benefit will be exempt from the quarantining rule so that expenditure by an employer in providing a boat as a fringe benefit as part of a salary package is deductible to the employer regardless of the employer’s boating income. This is consistent with the general treatment under income tax law of expenses in providing fringe benefits. The amount to be carried forward to be used against future boating income is modified for some taxpayers who receive a capital gain from their boating activity, have boat business profits, receive exempt income or become bankrupt. Labor supports this measure. The amendment should ensure that where taxpayers generate an income treatment using their boat they are not be treated unfairly compared to other taxpayers.
Schedule 3 of the bill proposes amendments to the tax law relating to research and development tax concessions. The amendments make 10 technical amendments to clarify the law, remove unintended consequences and ensure the law accurately reflects the original policy intent of the R&D provisions. Three main tax concessions that companies that incur expenditure on R&D may claim are: accelerated R&D deduction, 125 per cent rate; premium incremental concession, 175 per cent rate, for companies that increase their level of R&D expenditure over the average R&D expenditure over the preceding three years; and the refundable tax offset for small companies equivalent to the value of the R&D deductions. Labor supports the amendments. However, Labor notes that more than technical amendments are required to boost R&D in this country.

 (Senator Marshall)—Order! It being 12.45 pm, we will now move to non-controversial legislation.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I will not speak at length but I want to make some comments about the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments and Other 2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. This legislation includes a range of measures that are directed at supporting some—and I underline the word ‘some’—of the most disadvantaged people in Australia. In this bill there is an allocation of $500 to seniors who were eligible for the utilities allowance and the senior concession allowance as at budget night. It also includes an allocation of $1,000 as a one-off payment to carer payment recipients, $600 to carer allowance recipients for every eligible care receiver that they provide care for and $1,000 to carer allowance recipients who also receive a wife pension or a DVA partner service pension.
Labor welcome the contribution of funds to these most deserving people. We welcome the one-off payment to seniors in recognition of the financial pressure that age pensioners are under. In the 12 months to March, food costs in Australia have risen 4.6 per cent; in that total, fruit has risen by 15 per cent. Those considerable cost increases impact on the daily lives of older Australians. Petrol, as we all know, has been rising inexorably, it would seem, over the last 12 months. We all know of older people who ration their travel directly because of the cost of fuel. Coming from a rural area of Australia where the cost of fuel is higher and there is a lack of public transport, I know that older people in those regions are under even more pressure in terms of their costs. We also know that the increasing cost of fuel affects volunteers in our society, particularly older people who volunteer for organisations such as Meals on Wheels and who want to continue visiting other older people who are in more need than they are. So in that respect we are very pleased to be supporting the allocation of $500 to seniors who meet the qualifications the government described.
We also welcome the one-off payments to carers, because they too are under financial stress. We know that people caring for a loved one are, on average, $5,600 a year worse off than people with no caring responsibilities. That is, as I said, an average figure; we know there are many people who are carers, especially those caring for people with disabilities, who have had to leave paid employment in order to fulfil that role. I also hope that the government takes some heed of the budget response from Carers Australia in which they expressed disappointment that the government had not recognised the recommendations they had made in their pre-budget submission.
There are also a range of measures in this legislation to support veterans. There is a compensation payment of $25,000 to former prisoners of war in Europe or their widows. There is an increase in the funeral benefit, from $1,000 to $2,000, and for the veterans disability pension there is an increase of $50 a fortnight in the special rate and $25 a fortnight in the intermediate rate. Again, Labor welcome these changes to the financial arrangements for veterans in Australia. But I have to say that some of those measures are a catch-up event, finally recognising some notions of equity for some of those veterans. Labor have been calling on the government to address the erosion of our most severely disabled war veterans pensions over the last 10 years. Because these pensions are only linked to increases in the cost of living, there has been a drop of over $70 a fortnight in the value of the special rate disability pension. As I am sure we all understand, that is a very substantial amount for people dependent on a pension.
In contrast to the government, a Rudd Labor government would make sure that our most severely disabled war veterans will have their pensions adjusted to take account of not just the cost of living but also the standard of living. A Rudd Labor government will make sure that these veterans will no longer have to depend on the government delivering the sorts of ad hoc catch-up payments that we are talking about today. If Labor are successful at the next election, future increases that account for increases both in the cost of living and in the standard of living will be automatic under our government. Indexation is the only long-term solution to maintain the true value of veterans pensions. With those brief comments, I reinforce that Labor are supporting these measures. We know that they will be very well received by those people who receive them. As I have underlined, these measures support some of the most disadvantaged in our community.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ONE-OFF PAYMENTS AND OTHER 2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-05-10,"—I would like to speak briefly on the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments and Other 2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 on behalf of the Democrats. It is always appropriate when there are positive measures in a budget to acknowledge those and to note and praise them, lest one be accused of being churlish and always focusing on the negative. There are positive measures in this. Nonetheless, one has to make the point that there are inadequacies, not only because of those who merit help but are not covered in this legislation and the budget more broadly but also because of the way some of these measures are put forward.
Firstly, I will start by noting some of the measures I think should be acknowledged as clear-cut positives. I want to focus particularly on the veterans affairs aspects of this legislation. The increase in the maximum amount of funeral benefit payable from $1,000 to $2,000 is a welcome and important increase. As always, people can argue that there should be more, and I think that case can continue to be put, but it is a significant rise which has been pushed for for some time. The fact that the government has listened to that concern is, to a fair degree, something that should be acknowledged.
Similarly, increasing the maximum period for the backdating of war widow or widower pension claims to six months from the existing three months is also welcome and important. It is no surprise that, in the event of the death of a partner, it often takes people more than three months to get around to sorting out what their eligibility might be and putting in their claims and those sorts of things, and extending the period of backdating to six months is a welcome measure. Again, it is a measure that is there because of the advocacy of a number of ex-service organisations, in particular the War Widows Association. It is an appropriate opportunity to pay tribute to the work of organisations like that. They do an enormous amount of work in trying to pass on and give voice to the concerns of the people they represent and continually push people in the parliamentary and political process to be aware of and act on those concerns. So it is not just a tick for the government that this measure is here but also a tick in recognition of the work that advocacy organisations do generally—in this case, the War Widows Association and ex-service organisations.
I have made the point repeatedly in this place that it is important that we do as well as we possibly can in looking after the needs of veterans and, I might add, other ex-service personnel. There is an ongoing debate. Indeed, there are more measures in this year’s budget to try to address the recruitment and retention goals of the Australian Defence Force. Most of those I am supportive of. But I think it is an undeniable fact that, unless we can do better in the way we treat people who join the ADF, particularly those people who run into difficulty—the people who suffer injuries, who are wounded in service or who have other harm come to them as a consequence of their service—we will never meet our recruitment and retention targets. All their comrades around them and, even more so, their families see the way they are dealt with and the harm done to them and spread the word that maybe the ADF is not the way to go. In many cases, those who are in there see how one of their comrades is treated, and that gives them a much greater incentive to get out in case the same thing happens to them. It is always crucial that we do better in that regard. It is the easiest thing in the world for politicians to wave the flag and talk up the proud sacrifice of our Defence personnel, because politicians are not the ones making the sacrifice and, in most cases, neither are their children. But it is another thing entirely to ensure that we meet the grade and demonstrate the commitment behind the easy words by following up those who need assistance.
One other area in this budget and in this legislation is an increase in the amount of the intermediate rate disability payment, paid under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, of $25 a fortnight or $50 a fortnight for the special rate disability pension. This is what is broadly called the TPI rate. That has been a key area of contention in the veterans community for a long time. They have presented a very plausible case that the real value of this payment has declined over time because it is not indexed. That was partly, but only partly, addressed by the federal government some years back when they indexed just part of this payment. The other part has continued to remain unindexed and its value has continued to decline over time. So this is a catch-up payment. That should be welcomed but it should not be overly praised as something that is particularly noteworthy. To be finally badgered into making a catch-up payment that does not even catch up all the way is, frankly, not really something that deserves heaps of praise; it deserves acknowledgement but not heaps of praise. On top of that, it just maintains the ongoing problem. It is a one-off catch-up payment that catches up part of the way, and that is good, but it is not indexed; the rate will not be maintained at that level. So the problem will return again over time, and the concern will continue. At a time like this, with surpluses of this size, why on earth this less than full catch-up payment could not maintain its value and be indexed is beyond me. It seems to me to unnecessarily continue a concern and needs to be addressed.
It is a part of the problem with a number of the other measures, including some of the broader measures for carers and others. Of course, the extra support for carers is welcome. One-off payments have benefit, but they are one off. They are intermittent and cannot be planned for or relied upon. They are not structurally built into the system, so carers, in particular, and veterans and ex-service personnel will still have structural disadvantage that is built into the system. They will have to rely on hoping that budget largesse will appear again next year or every three years just before an election, and that is not satisfactory.
The Democrats make the same point with regard to the tax cuts that have been given. It is welcome that this year’s tax cuts have been focused mainly on lower income earners, but they are one-off tax cuts which are predominantly returning bracket creep. What we need to see is structural reform that will lock in those gains for low-income earners over time, rather than leaving them hoping that they will be the beneficiaries of budget largesse next time around. It is the easiest thing in the world for governments to hand back money that they have gained basically through the operation of inflation and bracket creep. If we had some vision here, we would be locking in the tax breaks or the tax changes via indexation—even partial indexation if you want to maintain some budgetary flexibility—so that they maintain their value year after year. That is the sort of change the Democrats have been pushing for for a long time and that is what we would like to see.
The same point applies to these payments for veterans. The catch-up payment is welcome, but how about we lock in indexation all the time on the entire payment so that it maintains its value consistently over time? That is what we should do. I think you could make the same claims with some of the other measures that are in here as well—certainly the funeral payment amount. Why can that not be indexed to CPI? Why do we have to lock it in and let it lose its value over time, and then make people put a lot of effort into campaigning to get it to retain or return its value, after which governments expect a shower of confetti and streamers and a tickertape parade when they finally give back something that they should have put in place in the first place? That applies in a whole range of areas, not just in the ones in the bill. That is the difference between the one-off, instant, quick fix, big bang budget measures and visionary structural improvements and reforms. We need to see more of the second.
This is a criticism not just of the current government—I am trying to be balanced once again; it is something that applies pretty much across the board with budgets at all levels and to all parties these days. It seems to be driven and almost reinforced by the way the public engages with budgets and by the way the media reports on budgets. It seems to always be an instant gratification engagement—one of looking for all the lollies, the cookies and the sparkly bits. If you lock things in so that they are there in a structural form continually, then there are no sparkly bits for next year. With the attention span of the entire community, I guess, and the way a lot of media reporting goes, memories do not last that long. People are not going to remember and say, ‘Well that was a good thing they did last year and I’m still grateful for it this year.’ Who remembers all the good things from last year’s budget?
Everything is being looked at in isolation, in this election year in particular. No doubt we will see that repeated for whatever is in this budget we are talking about now. It will be completely forgotten. Whatever good is put forward in all the pre-election, post-budget spending measures will again be looked at in isolation and as a self-contained box, ignoring what has already been done, including the good things that have already been done in this budget. We are just doing the same thing over and over again. It is reinforcing what I see as a big problem, which is that not enough of the improvements that do deserve congratulations are put in place in a structural, ongoing sense. They are put in place in a one-off handout sense. That is a real problem and it is something we need to look at more broadly in the way each of us approaches budgets, government expenditure, the tax system, welfare payments and all of those sorts of things.
Returning to the specifics of the bill, I have focused on the veterans area because I think veterans do need to be acknowledged as often as possible. But I would also like to note the payments to carers and older Australians. If there is one group in the community who you could rain down largesse upon in great amounts almost continuously and not get many complaints from me, it would be carers. They have an enormous responsibility and an enormous task that is not, and in some ways can never be, fully recompensed. Any form of extra assistance with money and the costs of their role is always welcome. The bill does not address some of the structural issues and, both with this and with the veterans area, it is of course about more than money. Those other aspects are areas where we still need to monitor the adequacy of service delivery, whether it is for carers or for veterans.
I would note and reinforce the comments made in the other place by the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs, Mr Griffin—I think, earlier today—about the veterans’ affairs area, including the increase in the amount of time it is taking for the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to process claims and the concerns about the decline in overall staffing numbers. Those are the other sorts of things that go beyond payment rates but can often make as big a difference or a bigger difference to people in terms of quality of life and assistance with their needs. Whether it is processing time for the claims, ease of assistance when they need support, being directed to the services that actually meet their needs, or other sorts of support services that are available to carers such as respite services and other sorts of services and assistance, we certainly still have a way to go in those areas. We need to continue to focus on those as well.
One-off payments always help, but they do not deal with some of those wider structural problems—whether it is amounts of money or adequacy of service. It is the Democrats’ role to ensure the Senate can operate in a way that keeps the focus on those issues. We seek to pull out more of the facts on those issues and we will certainly continue to do all we can to maintain that role.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ONE-OFF PAYMENTS AND OTHER 2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-10,"—I thank Senator McLucas and Senator Bartlett for their contributions and reflections. Through the Social Security and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments and Other 2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007, the government makes a further commitment of support to older Australians, carers and many of our ageing veterans. Each eligible person of age pension age who qualified for utilities allowance or seniors concession allowance on 8 May this year will get a one-off payment of $500, as will recipients at that date of mature age allowance, partner allowance or widow allowance. A one-off payment of $1,000 for carer payment recipients and $600 for carer allowance recipients will also be paid to those who qualified. The measures in the bill aimed at many of our ageing veterans will enhance their quality of life—especially those with a disability, or their war widows or widowers—including doubling the maximum amount of funeral benefit payable from $1,000 to $2,000, increasing the intermediate disability rate paid under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act by $25 per fortnight and increasing the amount of special disability pension by $50 per fortnight. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-05-10,"—The legislation before the Senate is seeking approval for a one-off additional government co-contribution into the superannuation accounts of those people who made eligible contributions in the 2005-06 income year. The legislation will effectively double the government co-contribution for those who have already made voluntary contributions in the 2005-06 financial year. It passed the House of Representatives yesterday, where Labor supported it, and we are supporting it here today.
The cost is estimated at $1.1 billion, with most payments being made in this financial year at a cost of $990 million and a further estimated cost of $80 million in the 2007-08 financial year. This, along with a number of other measures, characterises a very clever and cunning strategy by the government to disburse lump sums in significant ways in the lead-up to the election. Right on the lead-up to the election, six months out, we see these dollops of lump sums being distributed throughout the community.
In retirement incomes policy there are two approaches to increasing the level of retirement savings in a community. One is what is commonly known as compulsion. You compel people to save for retirement; that is done in a number of ways, such as compulsory superannuation. A government age pension is a form of compulsion. The other, which is usually a part of a retirement income system mix, is the incentive approach, where you reward people for future saving—with the emphasis on ‘future’.
A combination of measures has been adopted in Australia: tax concessionality and the co-contribution itself for future saving. I must say I cannot recall an example in any other country where they are significantly rewarding people for past saving, not future saving. It is a unique approach and probably a world first. Nevertheless, that in itself is not a reason for opposing the payments. Labor supports the payments because the payments will result in a one-off addition of just over $1 billion flowing into the superannuation savings accounts of about a million people. It is up to $1,500; not everyone gets $1,500. To that extent there is an improvement of about a billion dollars on the already $1 trillion of saving in the country.
I will describe briefly the operation of the co-contribution scheme. It grants up to $1.50 of government contribution for $1 of employee voluntary contribution, capped at a maximum government payment of $1,500. The current scheme allows the maximum government co-contribution of $1,500 to be paid up to the income threshold of $28,000 and then it phases down at the rate of 5c for every dollar of income above the threshold, completely phasing out at $58,000.
Co-contribution policies have a somewhat chequered history. The original policy of a co-contribution was announced by the Keating Labor government in 1995. This was to be a compulsory co-contribution—three per cent employee and three per cent government—to be phased in between 1996 and 2002. It would have delivered an extra $4.6 billion per year in 1996 dollar values when fully implemented. It was to build on Labor’s compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee, initially introduced at three per cent in 1987 and phased up to nine per cent by 1 July 2002.
—And supported by the Democrats.
—I take the interjection; it was supported by the Democrats. I was just about to remind the Senate: it was vociferously opposed tooth and nail, month after month, by the present government. I can recall some of the comments at the time by Mr Costello, Mr Howard and Mr Downer. The current foreign minister claimed that it was going to be socialism of the economy if you introduced compulsory superannuation: ‘You’re going to wreck small business, wreck employment.’ Now, the way they talk and the way the Treasurer boasts about his credentials on superannuation, you would think they had actually introduced it. My, how times change!
—I thought we had.
—You thought you had! Well, just to remind you: you were not here. I remember the months and months of debate. I do not think Senator Murray was here, but I remember the months and months of trenchant opposition to compulsory superannuation.
—I am a student of these things.
—I know you are, and a well-versed and well-read student, Senator Murray. Labor is unapologetic about a combination of compulsion and a voluntary incentive approach. In fact, Labor is proud of compulsory superannuation.
Up until 1987 the benefits of superannuation generally flowed to about 40 per cent of the workforce, in the main middle- and high-income earners in occupations such as management and the public sector. The majority of low- to middle-income earners, often casual and part time in occupations such as retail, hospitality and transport, of which over 60 per cent were women, did not receive superannuation payments. As I have said earlier, Labor introduced compulsory superannuation. It was a matter of fundamental fairness. We are proud of that, and we stand by it.
Of course it represents not just critical social policy but also major economic policy. It adds to savings, helps investment and strengthens the Australian economy. I cannot think of a single measure in the Hawke-Keating period, the 13 years of Labor government, that was any better in terms of fundamental social and economic policy than compulsory superannuation. As I have said, it was trenchantly opposed by the current government.
Today there is in excess of $1 trillion in superannuation savings, and it is overwhelmingly driven by compulsion: the superannuation guarantee. As important as the co-contribution is and as important as voluntary top-up contributions are, with incentives in the system, I think over $60 billion a year—the considerable majority of superannuation flows—is a consequence of compulsion: the superannuation guarantee.
As I have said, in 1995 former Prime Minister Keating wanted to add to it with a co-contribution of three per cent from the government for three per cent from the employee. I was very pleased, actually, by an election promise made by the coalition in 1995. They promised to retain Labor’s commitment on the three per cent and three per cent co-contribution, albeit that they said they might deliver it in a different form. But what happened? In 1997, not in 1996, the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, abandoned the co-contribution—it must have been one of those non-core promises—and therefore abandoned the additional $4.5 billion that would have resulted from the compulsory co-contribution. He did replace it partly with what was called a ‘savings rebate’. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing is looking a bit puzzled, and I am not surprised, because this savings rebate introduced in lieu of the compulsory co-contribution only lasted six months. So it is no wonder that the parliamentary secretary is looking a bit puzzled; very few people can remember what happened to that savings rebate which was intended to replace the co-contribution.
However, things did get better in the saga of the co-contribution. We acknowledge that the government introduced a voluntary co-contribution in 2002. Of course, it is voluntary, so it costs a lot less, but let us put that issue aside. We took a $4.5 billion step back and then we took a $1 billion step forward, so some progress has been made. The initial co-contribution was dollar for dollar, within the parameters I have mentioned. Interestingly and, I think, usefully—and I give credit to the government—in last year’s budget the co-contribution was extended to the self-employed. I give credit to the government for expanding it further. That will probably bring the cost of the co-contribution to about $1.3 billion going forward. This gives vital assistance and encouragement to low- and middle-income earners. It is welcomed by Labor and, if Labor is elected to government, it will be retained.
As I mentioned, we have seen a one-off increase retrospectively in the co-contribution. I have to say again for the public record that it does represent somewhat of a rebuff to the current Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton. I was pleased to see him—and again, as a Labor member, in a bipartisan, positive way, I pay tribute to the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton—publicly arguing this year for an expansion in the parameters of the co-contribution, specifically targeting people under 45 years of age, and not for a one-off retrospective payment. I think that was a legitimate, positive policy parameter change that the current Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton, was pursuing. But unfortunately Mr Howard, being the fairly cynical, clever politician that he is, obviously overruled Mr Dutton and said: ‘Look, there is an election coming up. Let’s be clever and cunning. Let’s drop a billion dollars and reward past saving one-off, because we do not want to increase the cost of this scheme in the years going forward.’ So, regrettably, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton, was overruled by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer.
As I have said, Labor supports the measure of an extra billion dollars to increase superannuation savings. But it does highlight the government’s lack of vision in what should have been a tackling of some fundamental design issues of the co-contribution. Mr Dutton’s positive suggestion was one that was made. I know the Association of Superannuation Funds and a number of others made positive suggestions around adding to the incentive for additional middle-income earners to contribute through the co-contribution. But we have had a short-term, cunning and clever political lump sum dropped in for one year instead. There is another design issue—and I know that ASFA looked at it—in that the cut-off point for middle-income earners is $58,000. ASFA are arguing for an extension of the cut-off point to higher up the income scale. I say on behalf of Labor that this is an important issue. If you look at when the scheme was introduced, you see that the 30c marginal income tax rate cut off at about $58,000. It has now been significantly increased, and therefore there does need to be a reconsideration of the design of that cut-off threshold.
I want to touch on a critique, and it is not my critique alone. There is concern about having a lump sum retrospective saving rather than trying to redesign the system to encourage future saving. It is a critique that has been made by some others. I have mentioned ASFA. Ms Smith, the CEO of ASFA, stated:
... there is disappointment because it is only a one-off for past contributors, so—
the budget—
missed an opportunity to change savings behaviour ...
She went on to state:
This initiative rewards individuals who accessed the co-contribution a year ago, but it is difficult to see how it will encourage younger people to invest in their retirement future.
As I have said, I think that is a legitimate concern. There was another critique from a Mr David Knox. He is not from the Labor side of politics; he is generally a supporter of the government. I think he was involved in the infamous Fightback design. He is an actuary of some renown and I have considerable respect for him. He is quoted as saying:
“I think the co-contributions payment is timed to be an attractive benefit in the lead up to the election,” Mercer principal of retirement David Knox said.
“We endorse any further support for savings, however, our disappointment is that this one measure won’t change future behaviour because it’s based on decisions people have already made.”
There are a number of other people who have pointed out a similar flawed approach, lacking in imagination, to examining the fundamental redesign of the system.
As I have said, Labor is supporting the Superannuation Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Co-contribution Measure) Bill 2007. There is an extra $1 billion going into the superannuation accounts for 2005-06 of low- and middle-income earners who qualify. There is one other group which, importantly, has missed out and which I did refer to earlier. The co-contribution scheme is to be extended to the self-employed. Frankly, I am somewhat surprised that the government did not pick this up: the co-contribution scheme is being extended to the self-employed, but it did not apply to them in the 2005-06 year. Therefore, the low- to middle-income self-employed people have missed out. I was taken aback by the fact that the government has totally ignored, with its retrospective one-off application, the needs of the self-employed in this area. That is an issue that I do not think anyone has pointed out so far in the public debate. Nevertheless, $1 billion is going into superannuation for low- and middle-income earners. It is a cunning and clever political ploy and we admire the cunning and cleverness of the Treasurer and the dash for lump sum cash in the run-up to the election—surprise, surprise, six months out from the election. That cunning and cleverness is all timed for the election. That is all part of politics, but the bottom line is that there is a billion dollars going into super. That will compound over time for those people. It will improve the retirement circumstances of those individuals and it should be supported.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET CO-CONTRIBUTION MEASURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-05-10,"—With respect to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Co-contribution Measure) Bill 2007, the co-contribution scheme is designed to boost the superannuation of low- and middle-income Australians. The scheme works by matching a qualifying employee’s eligible personal superannuation contributions with a government contribution at $1.50 for each dollar contributed by the employee, up to a maximum government contribution of $1,500. The maximum government contribution of $1,500 is available for qualifying employees on incomes up to $28,000 for co-contribution purposes and who voluntarily—if they can—save up to $1,000 annually. It then phases out at the rate of 5c for every dollar of income above $28,000 and phases out completely at $58,000. I was reminded by the shadow minister earlier that it was the Democrats who, with the Labor Party, ensured that the compulsory superannuation guarantee scheme was introduced to this country, against trenchant coalition opposition. The foresight of the Labor government at the time and of the Democrats deserves to be applauded over the decades to come, because no single measure has done more for Australians than that one.
I then thought about the co-contribution scheme. I had a look back at former Senator Cherry’s remarks—Senator Cherry was a senator from Queensland whom I sorely miss—with respect to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004. At that time he was talking about the fact that the co-contribution scheme happened because of the Democrats combining, in this case, with the government. It was the Democrats’ agreement with the government that permitted this measure to go through. In his remarks on the bill I just mentioned, Senator Cherry said the following:
The Senate would be aware that this particular measure passed through the Senate last year after negotiations between the government and the Democrats which established a doubling of the initial funding for the government co-contribution for low-income earners. As a result of those discussions—and I should acknowledge the very positive role that Senator Coonan played in that discussion—the funding for the low-income earners co-contribution for the next four years was increased from $460-odd million to $920-odd million.
So we not only helped to pass the measure; we also helped make it the size and strength that it is today.
This bill provides for an additional one-off government superannuation co-contribution to eligible persons in the 2005-06 income year only—which will double the amount already received. For instance, a person eligible for a co-contribution of $1,500 in the 2005-06 income year will receive an extra $1,500, making a total of $3,000. If the eligible co-contribution amount is $500, then they will receive a total of $1,000 all up. Interest will not be payable on amounts that arise solely from this one-off payment—which is an important consideration. The cost of it is high, but of course it is a payment towards the future of the Australians who receive these benefits. But I found it quite odd that this bill was introduced two days after the budget. The budget papers and the bill were obviously designed at the same time. Budget Paper No. 1, item 1-16 states:
This will improve superannuation savings for low income earners at a cost to the Budget of approximately $1.1 billion in 2006-07.
But the explanatory memorandum for the bill says:
This measure is expected to result in a cost of $990 million in 2006-07 and $80 million in 2007-08.
For those who can do their maths, there is a cool $30 million difference, in two days, between those two figures. That is pretty sloppy. Budget papers do not round up to the nearest billion or hundred million; they round up to the nearest million. Suddenly there is $30 million more that the government has put into its budget papers, available for it to do other things with, when the EM is much more specific and indicates it will be $1.07 billion. So we have a cool $30 million difference in two days. I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing could perhaps indicate just why that has happened.
The other thing we should recognise is that undoubtedly this measure only affects a select group of Australians—a lucky number—and the problem for us is that neither the budget papers nor the explanatory memorandum indicates the number of Australians who will be affected by this measure. Once again—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—I would ask the parliamentary secretary to indicate to us in his closing remarks how many Australians he thinks will benefit from this. Although this one-off payment increases superannuation balances for those who are eligible, by a set amount which then compounds over the life of the balance—making it a very attractive gift that grows over time—one cannot help but suspect that its main motivation is as an election sweetener. As soon as you see a one-off gift at this time in the electoral cycle, it does, unfortunately, provoke such impure thoughts.
Among other measures, the Democrats support superannuation savings being encouraged through government co-contributions targeted at low- to middle-income earners. So we support this bill, and we support it without amendment. We have not quite understood why it is non-contro early in this session and why it could not have waited until June. There is no real need for urgency that I can see, except for the government’s desire to get an immediate feel-good response for the coalition when those eligible are advised of their nice gift from kind John and helpful Peter. However, it does not really matter, because we would pass it today and support it today and we would pass it and support it in June. You are entitled to get your government bills on the Notice Paper as you see fit. As you noticed, we did not oppose the cut-off being exempted in this matter.
In closing: I suspect your motive, but anything which improves the superannuation savings available to Australians and therefore prevents later government payments at a far higher rate occurring—because this is an early payment and compounds over time it saves the government money later, strangely enough—is a good idea and is supported by us.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET CO-CONTRIBUTION MEASURE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-05-10,"—I thank Senator Sherry and Senator Murray for their considered remarks. Sadly, I cannot help the honourable Senator Murray in relation to his questions to me, except to say that, importantly, this measure will affect roughly two million Australians. The Superannuation Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Co-contribution Measure) Bill 2007 will boost the superannuation savings of low- and middle-income Australians by doubling the government’s superannuation co-contribution payable in respect of eligible contributions made in the 2005-06 year. For example, if a person was otherwise eligible for a co-contribution of $1,500 made in the 2005-06 year, they will now receive an extra co-contribution of $1,500, bringing the total co-contribution for that year to $3,000. This provides a substantial reward to eligible low- to middle-income Australians who have saved for their retirement and builds on the already successful government co-contribution. These changes also build on the substantial improvements to superannuation made by the government through the recent Simplified Superannuation reforms.
This government first introduced the co-contribution scheme in 2003-04. It then increased the co-contribution from $1 to $1.50 in the 2004-05 year and raised the upper income threshold from $40,000 to $58,000. From 1 July 2007 eligibility for the co-contribution scheme will be extended to the self-employed, and the income thresholds will be indexed each year in line with the growth in wages. Over 2.7 million co-contribution payments, worth approximately $2 billion, have already been paid under the scheme. This measure will increase payments under the scheme to $3.1 billion.
This is an important budget measure. It has been made possible only because of this government’s very strong economic management. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-05-10,"—In speaking to the second reading of the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2007, I make the point that this bill makes a number of changes to the ESOS regime and amends positions that were taken through this parliament in 2000. These changes have been characterised by the government as ‘technical’ or ‘minor’. In fact, at least one of them is a major and significant change which I will address in my remarks here today.
The bill follows a series of more substantial amendments to the regulatory framework, changes that were introduced after a major review of the ESOS regime that reported in 2005. That review recommended some 41 changes to the act, not all of which were actually adopted by the government. These amendments, finally passed through the parliament in December 2006, followed other changes to the act in 2002 and 2005. It is quite clear that this is an area of regulation that requires constant updating. It is gratifying to see that the government has at least acknowledged the importance of that principle and is continuing to monitor the effectiveness of its legislative framework in this area.
However, the fact is that this government has yet to get things right when it comes to regulating the international education industry in this country. International education is an extremely lucrative service export for Australia. Its net impact on the economy is said to be around $7 billion per annum. For that reason alone, this country simply cannot afford to get it wrong. It is an industry that depends vitally on our international reputation and on the quality and reliability of what might be in economic terms described as the product that we offer. In this case, it is the education and training that is provided. We cannot treat our international students lightly or negligently, whether they come to this country to undertake their studies or whether they study in Australian institutions operating offshore.
While Labor is supporting this bill, there is an opportunity here to draw attention yet again to the poor management of the international education industry in this country. Despite all the tinkering that has gone on with the regulatory regime throughout recent years, it is my contention that there remain considerable problems yet to be addressed. There are recent examples of highly questionable activity which in themselves constitute a threat to the quality and the international reputation of Australia’s higher education sector. Serious issues surrounding the quality of education and the treatment of international students at several of our international education and training institutions across the country have been exposed in recent times.
At the centre of those reports, I might remind the Senate, has been Central Queensland University’s Melbourne shopfront campus. There was a situation which was given some attention in the Melbourne Age where there was a hunger strike by some 60 international students at Central Queensland University’s Melbourne campus. The Minister for Education, Science and Training told the Age newspaper on 15 March 2007:
... the Government had imposed a rigorous framework to protect the rights of overseas students.
The truth is that there is no evidence that the government has actually taken any action in these matters. The students claimed that they had been tested on subject matter that was not included in their coursework and that 300 did not pass the final exam for a master’s degree. Since the Howard government has been in control of higher education, there has been an increase in Central Queensland University’s reliance on international student fees from some 10.7 per cent of their total income in 1997 to 45.7 per cent in 2005. Central Queensland University receives $132 million each year from international students. However, it would seem that the regulation of this industry has not kept pace with what has been going on in Central Queensland University’s international education programs.
The minister and the department have failed to act on reports of the substandard training by private providers. In Melbourne, there was the International Business and Hospitality Institute. The government failed to quickly respond to claims that up to 30 Chinese students at the International Business and Hospitality Institute were given substandard training. When the college suffered a cash flow crisis, it simply stopped teaching the students and told them to ‘take a holiday’. This is despite the fact that the students had paid their fees in advance. According to the Age of 22 March 2007, several former teachers went to the Australian Crime Commission over this matter, so dissatisfied were they that the problems had not been satisfactorily addressed by the government. Following the revelations of this particular case and another one in Victoria, the CEO of the relevant office in the state education ministry resigned suddenly. It has been suggested within the industry that there is some connection between these events and that resignation, although the Victorian government has declined to make such a connection.
The umbrella organisation for private training and education providers, ACPET, has complained over and over again to this minister, Minister Bishop, about the activities of problematic private providers, but she has consistently failed to respond to those complaints. This is despite a whole raft of powers available to her under Commonwealth legislation—set out in the ESOS Act—to draw attention to errant providers. While it is true that state governments do have a role in monitoring the performance of international education providers, it is quite clearly the case that the primary responsibility rests with the Commonwealth of Australia. The responsibility may well be shared, but the lead responsibility is with Canberra.
Over the years Labor in the Senate have drawn attention to the government’s failure to deal with these issues—to deal with the rorts and the abuses by the unscrupulous providers that have been able to bring the whole industry into disrepute. We have argued that, if you do not deal with the rotten apples in the barrel, the whole barrel will ultimately be ruined. However, it is not just a case of the damage done to other providers; it is a case of the Australian government having the responsibility to protect the rights of students who come to this country and expect—and have a right to expect—the highest of standards.
I argue that, as with tax avoidance, the government must exercise constant vigilance in this area to safeguard the reputation of this vital industry. If it does not, our international reputation will be seriously affected. This not only will have profound consequences in terms of our capacity to attract students and to earn income from this industry but also may well have serious consequences for our diplomatic relations. This is not just a question of economic relations; it is a question of social and personal relations. Ultimately, over time, it can have an enormous impact in terms of our standing within the region. As I say, it only takes a few rotten apples to poison the whole barrel.
The other significant amendments that are being proposed by this legislation are the insertions of the objects into the act. Such an addition to the act was recommended by the 2004-05 review, but the government have only now sought to move in this area. The objects have been inserted to adopt a general way of wording as recommended, and they include, among other things, ‘To protect and enhance Australia’s reputation for quality education and training services’ and ‘To complement Australia’s migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas’.
Why the government have taken so long to act on this is a matter of some curiosity to me. It strikes me that it is difficult for the government to acknowledge that they have got it wrong. It is better that they do so now than not do so. The Labor Party has been arguing for some time that the substantive rorts in the international educational regime, the immigration rorts and the rorts that have seen students sold short in terms of the quality of the education and training provided to them, needed to be addressed. The Commonwealth has to face up to its responsibilities in this way.
I know I have been arguing this case for the better part of 10 years. I will continue to argue it. It is better late than never that the government have started to move in this direction. It was certainly the position that I argued in 2000, it was the position that we argued last year and it is the position that we have continued because the rorts have continued. We finally see in 2007 the government come clean about why there is a necessity to acknowledge the Commonwealth responsibilities with regard to the ESOS legislation.
I acknowledge that the amendments inserting the objects into the act in no way affect the operation of the act, but it is a significant reminder to those within the Public Service of their obligations and to ensure that the ESOS regime is aimed at producing that outcome. Every provider and government authority that reads this legislation should understand it and should be able to appreciate their obligations to the sector as a whole, to maintain and enforce the highest of standards of both education provision and compliance with Australia’s migration laws. The failure of both providers and government departments to fulfil their obligations under the ESOS regime puts at risk not just the viability of that individual college or institution but also the viability of other providers and the ultimate success of the industry as a whole.
The other thing that really disturbs me about these matters is the way in which international education is being used by this government, particularly through our public university system, to provide an inordinate reliance on overseas students as a way of making up the shortfalls in government revenue. Over the last decade we have seen a determined and persistent underinvestment in higher education by this government which has seen Australia’s universities become more and more reliant on international students as an alternative source of funding. So there has been a massive shift in the level of university funding from public to private sources. In 1996, of the full amount of money that was available for universities, some 60 per cent of revenues came from the Commonwealth. It is now down to 40 per cent. In 1997 income from overseas students made up 7.8 per cent of the total revenue for all universities. That proportion had almost doubled by 2005 to 15.1 per cent. As I understand it, it is well over $2 billion in terms of income derived from this source. Claims have been made from time to time about international students who have been put into the system graduating in such numbers, with serious impacts on the quality of provision by some universities. It has been argued that all too often international students with a poor grasp of English are graduating and getting permanent residency visas. Their English is so poor that they never should have been accepted for study in the institutions to begin with, let alone allowed to graduate.
Prominent Monash academic Professor Bob Birrell’s findings on the English language abilities of international students have been rejected by the minister for education, who was quoted in the Age on 17 March 2007 as saying that she had seen no evidence that substandard students were graduating from Australian institutions. The minister herself argued that the industry had brought $10 billion to the Australian economy over the financial year. Yet she is not prepared to deal with these questions up-front and to ensure that the quality arrangements in our universities are such that a charge such as that made by Professor Birrell could not be made.
In recent times we have seen discussion by this government about their changes to education and they have argued that they are now providing additional support for funding of universities, particularly through capital. The Australian National University, for instance, is worth about $1.5 billion in terms of its plant; the backlog, in terms of its capital requirements, is probably $500 million. I see in the paper today that other universities are arguing that they have funding backlogs of some $200 million and above.
In the case of the Australian National University, they have a capital roll-in of $12 million per annum. While I do not in any way associate the Australian National University with any misuse of international programs, it highlights a question about what is happening to the finances of our university system. It is the same with the University of Sydney and other Group of Eight universities. The capital requirements of these universities are such now that there is a massive backlog as a result of the failure of this government to invest over 10 years. In some of our other universities that do not have the level of resourcing that a Group of Eight university has, there has been an undue reliance on international students to try and fill the gap. The capital programs are the area in which this enormous deficit is becoming most pronounced, because there has been this presumption for 10 years that you can put off fixing the buildings, you can put off fixing the drains, you can put off building necessary accommodation and you can put off buying equipment for the necessary research programs. The end result has been an undue reliance on international students—to the point where some of these institutions have been forced to take steps that I am sure that they would have preferred not to take. They have exposed themselves to an undue reliance on that source of income, which makes them very vulnerable in terms of their overall finances.
This is a bill that is long overdue. I am sure that it will not be the last in this area. It highlights the need for the government to be much more conscious of and diligent in its responsibilities in regulating international education. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
but the Senate notes that while there is a need to update the requirements for the provision of education to overseas students, it condemns the Government for poor management of Australia’s international education industry, including:
the threat to quality in Australia’s higher education sector as a result of the Government’s cuts to, and lack of investment in, universities, leading to undue reliance by the higher education sector on revenue from international student fees; and
a lack of action taken in response to recent examples of questionable activity in the overseas student area in both the university and vocational education and training sectors”.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1

I just want to say, in doing that, that the essence of my speech goes to Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands getting the ability to be registered as CRICOS providers under the ESOS Act. Finally, we welcome this acknowledgment by the government. I am sure that people on Christmas Island will acknowledge and welcome this announcement as well.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—

ESOS Act 2000 regulates provision of education for overseas students in Australia.
Protects our reputation and the integrity of our education “export” industry by ensuring overseas students receive a quality education for which they paid. At the same time ensures students comply with their visa conditions.
This Bill represents the third group of amendments to the Act in order to implement recommendations made under the evaluation of the ESOS Act, carried in 2004.
Our education “export” industry is now our 4th most valuable, behind iron ore, coal and tourism, contributing around $10 billion annually. So certainly worthy of protection.
We have supported our international education sector since the 1980’s when the Hawke Government first opened our universities to overseas students.
We do still seem to have a good reputation, despite this governments under funding our public education sector, especially in universities, for a decade now.
Public schools have been squeezed for funds.
We have seen in particular our universities and VET sectors seriously squeezed for funds and forced into charging higher fees, opening the gate to full fee paying students and balancing the change in funding mix under this government.
Indeed one might say the drive for overseas students has been forced on our higher education sector as one way of regaining revenue cut by this government.
We have also recently seen examples of poor monitoring of some, a minority, of the education providers, where overseas students have had very poor teaching or tuition and certainly not received anything like value for the money they have paid.
In several documented instances, for example in provision of business or hospitality courses, although the Australian Council for Private Education and Training (ACPET) has raised the issues with the department, their responses have been rather less than overwhelmingly keen to act on the complaints.
That we still have a good reputation is due to the efforts of those involved in provision of education to overseas students more than the Howard Government.
In particular though I am now most happy to see sections of this bill now supporting the inclusion of the Indian Ocean Territories within the Act. This amendment is in response to a recommendation of the ESOS Evaluation to include the IOT, and to provide in particular Christmas island District High School with the opportunity to apply for registration on the Commonwealth register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students  (CRICOS)
Under this amendment a new section 4B will allow an education provider on Christmas island or Cocos ( Keeling) Island  to apply for this registration
While I realise that this does not yet mean Christmas Island District High School WILL get a CRICOS number, it at last has the opportunity to apply for registration, and if successful will be enabled to bring in students from south east asia.
These will be older, senior students from families back in SE Asia since many of the population there have strong links back into Malaysia for example.
This High School has long wanted to be given this opportunity.
They can now apply for CRICOS registration for the provision of courses to overseas students, subject then to the West Australian Government committing to guaranteeing the placement of these students in appropriate tuition in years 11 and 12 should the high school be unable to continue these classes.
I believe the WA Department of Education has in fact already visited  the island. But it would seem highly unlikely that the Christmas Island District High School would fail to continue the provision of these education services.
This will mean that more students will attend the high school, increasing the numbers in year 11 and 12 and thereby making these courses even more viable and sustainable.
I have known CI for some years and been fortunate to make several visits to what is a special place.
It is very isolated, most of the population are of Malay or Singaporean background but the overall population is a good mix of cultures who get on wonderfully well.
The discussion about including IOT within the ESOS Act has been long ongoing. In this time the school and community have discussed the matter in depth, so they are very much ready for this welcome change. The community are totally supportive of the school taking in international students.
Year 11 and 12 classes have only been available for the past 3 years at CIDHS, but they have been highly successful and have enabled many students to stay home and complete their school studies instead of going away to Perth or elsewhere on the mainland.
Some still choose to go away, but now there is that real choice.
Like my colleague in the other place Mr Snowdon, I too congratulate all those concerned in getting year 11 and 12 up and running so successfully in such an isolated outpost.
I am sure that the CI community and school have a very firm commitment to maintain and indeed improve the education services available on island, and this bill is therefore most welcome as the final step in enabling this community to have the chance of applying to provide for international students",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1

In response to the Uhrig report the Government agreed that the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (the FMA Act), should be applied to statutory authorities which did not need to own assets and where it was appropriate they be legally and financially part of the Commonwealth. This Bill transfers ASIC, CAMAC and APRA from the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (the CAC Act) to the FMA Act.
Under the new regime, the three agencies will hold money and property on behalf of the Commonwealth, rather than in their own right. This reflects their status as agencies that are largely budget-funded, in contrast to agencies that raise funds from commercial activities.
The agencies will have the power to enter into contracts on behalf of the Commonwealth. ASIC and APRA will retain the power to enter into contracts on their own behalf, however the intention is that this power will only be used for regulatory purposes (for example, regulatory agreements).
A number of provisions in the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (ASIC Act) will be amended to reflect that ASIC will now be acting as a trustee on behalf of the Commonwealth in relation to moneys and properties held on trust.
The Bill also defines the reporting requirements of ASIC, CAMAC and APRA under the FMA Act and the responsibilities of the Chief Executives of the agencies. The changes to the governance structures of these agencies do not impact adversely on the operational capabilities or the independence of the statutory bodies.
The Uhrig Review was established to identify issues concerning governance arrangements in relation to statutory bodies which impacted on the business community and to provide policy options for the Government to obtain the best from statutory authorities and office holders through the accountability framework.
I have spoken several times on the Uhrig Review, and have said I do not support its approach in all circumstances. Increased centralised ministerial or chief executive power and discretion, and decreased independent oversight and advice might inappropriately result in some situations.
However in relation to these bodies, ASIC, APRA and CAMAC, these amendments will increase the transparency in the way these entities deal with public monies and improve the consistency in their governance arrangements.
The focus of this Bill on how officials handle public money, public property and other resources of the Commonwealth, as well as the obligations and responsibilities of the CEO are all matters which the Australian Democrats support.
In passing I would like to point out that the handling of public money was an area which the Australian National Audit Office had concerns in its 2005 Report. As it pointed out, as at June 2004 investments held by Commonwealth entities were $20,20$ billion.
In its report, the ANAO found that there were several entities which held investments which were not authorised by the relevant legislation. It was conceded that although they were non-compliant with the relevant legislation, many of the investments were considered of low risk.
However, it must be of concern that even though there were legislated provisions as to how public money could be invested, departments and statutory authorities did not always comply with those provisions. It is hoped that since the ANAO’s report, statutory entities are aware that legislative provisions setting out how and where public money can be invested, are not merely ‘suggestive’, they are obligatory.
It is hoped with this change in legislation, bringing more entities—especially those reporting to Treasury – within the purview of the FMA Act that there will be less non-compliance with the legislation. Given that the money will now revert to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, (CRF) rather than be held or invested by the statutory authorities themselves, the Bill does appear to ensure that public monies are treated the same, regardless of the entity which receives it. That is as it should be.
Statutory authorities are still responsible to the Australian people and the Australian parliament. If they receive taxpayer’s money then it should be used in compliance with its governing legislation and not at the whim of the CEO, the Minister or the Board. It should not be put into investments which do not fully comply with the terms set out in the governing legislation.
I realise that changing these entities from being governed by the CAC Act, is helpful, However, I do note that the ANAO looked at entities which were regulated by both the CAC Act and the FMA Act and it found ‘that, for a number of entities, there had been shortcomings in the management of the investment of public funds.’
Simply changing the Act under which the entities deal with funds is not sufficient. As the ANAO pointed out:
“Entities require strategies and procedures that both comply with the investment parameters provided by the Parliament and optimise risk-adjusted returns.”
It is hoped that in the intervening years since the ANAO Report, that such procedures and strategies have been put in place in all the statutory authorities.
The JCPAA has reviewed a number of ANAO reports regarding financial management and reporting in government agencies and has noted a general decline in standards.
In light of that general decline, I would like to refer to the March 2007 report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee on Transparency and Accountability of Commonwealth Public Funding and Expenditure.
The Committee made 19 Recommendations regarding appropriations and expenditure, all of which would help statutory authorities as well as government departments in providing information to the Parliament regarding appropriations and the use of public moneys.
I think that, although ALL the recommendations are relevant to the discussion here today, Recommendation 2 is particularly apt.
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that the Government implement a system of review for standing appropriations to ensure that access to the CRF is withdrawn when no longer required and to ensure that standing appropriations are subject to periodic government and parliamentary review.
With regard to standing appropriations in this bill, on an initial examination, the Special Accounts for ASIC (Schedule 1, Items 12) and APRA (Schedule 1, Items 63) do not appear to raise particular concerns. Without seeing them in operation it is difficult to determine whether they would raise the same concerns identified in the committee’s Transparency and Accountability report regarding the transparency of intra-departmental transfers.
In conclusion, Parliamentary oversight is essential in relation to the use of public moneys by any department or statutory entity.
This Bill is a step in the right direction, but it is essential that the Government respond positively to the unanimous recommendations of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on transparency and accountability as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNANCE REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION (TREASURY PORTFOLIO AGENCIES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-05-10,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

This Bill sets up a new policy on the governance of government agencies. That’s recommended in the 2003 Uhrig Report.
It’s not controversial and the Labor Party supports it in principle. But there’s a contradiction in the introduction of this legislation. This legislation tries to tighten-up accountability of government agencies. That’s fine – but the bill’s drafted by a Government that refuses to account for anything. In other words, do as we say, not as we do. I’ll return to that theme shortly. There’s currently a plethora of agencies. In fact, it’s not clear how many there actually are. In 2003, for example, the Finance Department recorded 955 agencies. Just a year later that number had grown to 1153. I suppose the difference is explained by the fact the Department kept finding more! Which shows how poorly understood is the extent of this Government’s bureaucracy. And so the poor state of accountability. Whatever the number, it’s an enormous bureaucracy, with an enormous array of governance arrangements.
Such an array begs several questions. What do they all do and are they all relevant? More important, how are they accountable to the government and taxpayers? So the review undertaken by Uhrig is vital. In adopting the Uhrig recommendations, the Government’s imposed a new template. In this, all agencies should fit with respect to their legal status and accountability. The basic principle is, any agency dependent on the Budget should be accountable for its funds under the Financial Management and Accountability Act (FMA Act). Such agencies must employ staff under the Public Service Act. They should also be headed by a CEO accountable to a minister. CEOs should be issued with an annual letter from the minister. This should contain a “statement of expectations”. It’s against this which the CEO must regularly respond and report. It’s a step down from a similar charter issued by the PM to his ministers. But this is the new chain of accountability; in theory at least. I assume failure to deliver is entered on a scorecard for future appraisal purposes. But of course such failures will go unchallenged, as we’ve seen.
In this model, there’re no executive boards with decision-making powers. The CEO’s solely accountable to the minister. He or she: dominates the structure. sets strategic direction, hires and fires, and determines all budgetary allocations. So the CEO is the new supremo. Boards, councils and commissions—however titled—are only advisory, even though their powers may be statutory. This is a pragmatic model. Lines of responsibility are clear, as are roles and processes for work planning and reporting. Many board and council jobs entailing status, power and influence have been transformed. Independent boards or councils have been converted to advisory status. The CEO has become all powerful.
It’s an onerous position for him or her. In fact it’s revolutionary for those more used to consensus and consultation. With that accountability goes control. And that’s something with which the Howard Government is obsessed. Control. It means broader views can be excluded and ideology enforced. An independent bureaucracy has long been a hallmark of the Westminster system. As Sir Humphrey Appleby put it: “Governments may come and go, but we go on forever.” That was certainly the Australian way until the 1970s: a cosy relationship between a lazy conservative government and the public service. Fortunately, that’s broken down. Since 1972, there’s been a more balanced relationship between Government and bureaucracy.
The Uhrig principles of themselves don’t change the status quo. But they do allow an ideological bent to gain a foothold. The line of accountability between a minister and his CEO is now very direct. While a CEO may ignore his advisory board or council, he dare not ignore his minister. That should cause great concern with this current Government. The National Health and Medical Research Council was “Uhrigged”, as the vernacular now has it. There, research supremos lost control of the budget. To be replaced by the ideological influence of Health Minister Tony Abbott. That is one real risk of the Uhrig model. The other model of government agencies are those not budget-dependent, but commercial in their operation. These are legally and financially separate from the Government. They fall under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act (CAC Act). Control depends on the legislation and so is varying. They’re governed by boards in general, and operate as corporate bodies. They’re also accountable to the minister. They’re not covered by the Public Service Act. But they have full reporting obligations. It’s these two templates that are being applied to government agencies.
This bill deals with three agencies within the Treasury portfolio:
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC),
The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee (CAMAC), and
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)
These agencies are budget-dependent, so they’re now covered by the FMA Act alone—and the Public Service Act. They can’t hold money in their own right. Generally, they must comply with the provisions of the FMA Act, as with all other FMA agencies. The CAC Act is no longer applicable. But there’re unique circumstances to be recognised. ASIC, for example, is the public watchdog which protects investors and enforces Commonwealth securities law. Those roles and responsibilities remain clear and unchanged. Likewise, CAMA’s role—to advise on regulatory action under corporation legislation or within the financial services industry—isn’t changed. Nor will the functions of APRA be altered. It’ll continue to regulate banks, credit unions and other financial and insurance industries. We can expect better accountability and performance. Being covered by the FMA Act doesn’t automatically improve accountability or performance. It simply makes it easier to achieve, if the Government is so motivated.
But accountability of government agencies doesn’t stop with ministers of the day. That’s supposed to be the Senate’s role—in theory at least. That’s why we have Estimates committees. And that’s why we take our responsibility so seriously. We must critically examine legislation and cut through the spin and propaganda for the public’s good.  This legislation’s far more important than the Minister would have us understand. It’s about accountability of appointed agencies; to the government, not to the people and the Parliament. That’s where accountability stops. And accountability—and the truth—is hard to come by under this Government. That’s certainly the case with Defence, where the culture of protecting information in peace time is treated the same as in war time. Defence is aptly named! Indeed, accountability is not a word in the lexicon of the current Defence Minister.  So while the legislation’s good in theory, it’s limited in practice. As I’ve mentioned, there’s another theme behind these bills.  Control.
The management paradigm over the past decade or so says “let the managers manage”. Enterprise management became the new management theme. Devolution became fashionable. In many cases, government activities were put at an arm’s length. The Finance Department was pushed aside by this government. The reason for that is political. If an agency is seen to be independent of government, then ministers aren’t accountable. There’s no political fly paper. But as we’ve seen under this Government, such operational freedom can have disastrous consequences. The scandal of the Australian Wheat Board is still before us. Here was a statutory marketing organisation set up to operate commercially, as with other government business enterprises. The sense of having it at arm’s length politically is now abundantly obvious. Not one government Minister was ever brought to account. That’s in spite of the corrupt and incompetent behaviour of the AWB, to our national shame and embarrassment. This is the risk with all government business undertakings. It’s why so many have been privatised. So it’s no surprise to see centralisation returning to the bureaucracy.
The Finance Department is resuming its controls over expenditure. The Minister and the Expenditure Review Committee are re-exerting themselves. That is, of course, with the exception of the authoritarian behaviour of the Prime Minister. In such regimes control is power. This is all relevant for the legislation we have before us today. The principles it will enact for the three agencies are valid. But they beg the question about their full implementation to other sacred cows. Where accountability remains as remote as ever, there’ll be more AWB scandals.
Good governance receives lip service, but political motive renders it ineffective. There’s more to accountability for this Government than that set out in this Bill. This is mere housekeeping and a flash of managing a large bureaucracy. It gets nowhere near the issues of
Accountability for ministerial negligence
Waste of taxpayers’ money and
Outright deceit
Just remember the appalling record of children overboard. And the decision to go to war in Iraq. The dishonesty was palpable and never brought to account. Ministerial accountability is a joke. Freedom of Information is almost a dead letter. And as Labor knows, answers to questions on notice are treated with contempt. To that extent this bill is window dressing. But it’s better than an empty window. We support the Bill.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I rise to seek an explanation from the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations as to why there are 394 questions on notice to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relation remaining unanswered from the November 2006 supplementary estimates round that were due to be answered on 15 December last year. I also ask why there are 295 questions on notice remaining unanswered from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations from the February 2007 additional estimates round which were due in by 30 March this year.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-05-10,"—It is noteworthy that before I could even utter one word Senator Carr came in with an interjection—the person who was responsible for a whole host of questions that cost the education department, if I recall, more than $1 million to answer. If you were to add the two figures that Senator Marshall has just indicated, there are 700 questions—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. The minister is abusing the process here. The minister was asked a specific question and he is now trying to make a political attack on Senator Carr.
Government senators interjecting—
—Well, I suggest he can speak in the taking note debate. The senator has complied with standing orders; he has asked a direct question. Mr President, I ask you to ask the minister to answer the question.
—The Senate will come to order! Senator Abetz.
—I thought Mr Rudd was the only one with a glass jaw, but it looks as though it runs in the leadership of the Labor Party! The point that I was making was that the number is around 700 questions. That is one very huge workload by anybody’s standards. What we had in that period of time as well was a change in the ministry, and it is vitally important, especially in this sensitive area, to ensure that every answer is technically correct. As I understand it from the minister’s office, these questions are being answered, are being worked through. Often, answers are provided to the minister’s office and they then seek further information and it goes back to the department. It is taking a long time. I accept and acknowledge that that would be frustrating to those senators who have asked those questions and are seeking answers to them. I have raised that with the minister’s office and I have been given the assurance that they are working on providing the answers as expeditiously as possible.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,29,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
You would accept the minister’s response if it had some accuracy behind it, but the reality is that in the last estimates round all the outstanding questions asked of DEWR in respect of why they have not responded were answered this way. The heads of the departments said that all the answers had been provided to the minister’s office. They are sitting in the minister’s office being unanswered to us and to the Senate. The minister has the answers, which go to the question of the operations of the Work Choices legislation, the most vicious attack on working people’s terms and conditions of employment we have ever witnessed in this country. We have known that this attack reduces the wages and conditions of Australian workers and the government has known it too. The government knew it in the first round of Senate estimates when they provided the statistics to demonstrate that categorically. Since then they have stopped collecting the statistics and stopped answering our questions, yet the minister has the answers but just does not want to pass them on.
Up until the minister now, the minister and everyone else in the government have been saying how fair the Work Choices legislation is. When we asked questions, over two rounds of estimates, which went to that detail, what did we get back? No answers were received by the Senate. The answers simply went to the minister’s office, and the minister then used that information to draft amendments, because what those answers will tell the minister is that the government were absolutely wrong. Work Choices is unfair. Work Choices does reduce the wages and conditions and the family circumstances of working people in this country.
It is inappropriate that the minister continues to sit on the answers and not provide them to the Senate committee, especially when we are on the eve of another round of Senate estimates. That will be two rounds of Senate estimates without having the questions answered. We will go through another one; the questions will not be answered. On top of that, we have a Senate inquiry into the proposed amendment legislation on Work Choices. How is the Senate and how are Senate committees expected to do their work properly if these very fundamental questions about the operation of Work Choices are not provided to the Senate to enable us as a Senate committee and the Senate as a whole to use that information in our deliberations? It is completely unsatisfactory. The minister’s response that somehow these questions have taken up enormous amounts of time and resources, I must say, does not ring true because every department, in every instance, has done the work and provided the answers to the minister. The minister is simply sitting on the answers. The government do not want to provide the answers to the Senate because they know it proves what the opposition has been saying about Work Choices since day one. It is time the minister convinced the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to come clean and present to the committee the answer to the questions.
Question agreed to.
—Mr President, on a point of order: I did not want to interrupt the eloquence of my good friend, but I was not aware that you could raise at this point unanswered questions from an estimates committee. You certainly can under standing order 74, but thank goodness I did not take the point of order before such an eloquent speech. I just want to know whether we are setting a precedent now and that we can do that into the future. You might like to reflect on that, Mr President, and on standing order 74.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2007-08 Budget.
Firstly, I want to remark on Senator Johnston’s contribution in answer to Senator Sterle’s question today. I confirm that my recollection of budget night was that the parties that were taking place were convened by government senators and in the offices of ministers. In my experience, there were no parties taking place on the opposition side. Indeed, the newspapers were reporting the functions that were being run so that donations could be made to the coalition’s election campaign. I recall seeing a number of people with visitor passes, who had been at parties, wandering around the Senate corridors. I think it is an absolute disgrace for Senator Johnston to misrepresent the facts, trying to make a theatrical point in answering a serious question from Senator Sterle.
In terms of the matters which he addressed, frankly it is pretty important to note that the member for Kalgoorlie saw nothing for his electorate in the budget. I am glad that Senator Johnston talked about a rail project; otherwise there would have been nothing he could have said about the measures in the budget that were directly related to the member for Kalgoorlie’s electorate. But he did remark about the mining industry. Of course, it is notable that this government has been in denial about the fact that the boom in the mining industry has been responsible for the economic position that this country faces at the moment.
The fact is that Treasurer Costello will not acknowledge that the Australian economy’s current performance is being driven by the mining boom rather than by good policymaking. The mining boom, in turn, is being driven by a world economy that is experiencing the best performance over three decades. Let me quote from Budget Statement 3: Economic Outlook, the Treasurer’s own paper, which says:
The world economy grew by 5.4 per cent in 2006, the fastest growth rate recorded in over 30 years ...
The budget papers acknowledge that the mining boom is the main story for the Australian economy. Further, on page 3-3, it says:
The Australian economy is adjusting well to the increasing global demand for mineral and energy resources ...
Further, it says:
The Australian economy continues to benefit from strong world demand, with labour and capital continuing to shift towards the mining and construction sectors in response to the increase in commodity prices.
I know that the government senators do not want to hear this because it gives the lie to the claims by the government that the mining boom is not responsible for this—that it is their economic management.
Government senators interjecting—
—I am glad that they are interjecting, because I know that this hurts. I know that they have been exposed as telling the Australian public an untruth about their performance. It is an untruth because we all know that, if the Chinese economy were not booming and if the mining sector were not booming, the money would not be there for the sorts of things which we heard described by one of the ministers opposite as ‘largesse’—the government’s performance in spending money was actually ‘largesse’. That was the word used by a government minister. If anyone else says something is largesse, never let the government say that it is wrong, because that was the word used by a government minister.
The mining boom is clearly a matter which is responsible for the best terms of trade we have ever had. The terms of trade reached their highest level in over 50 years in the December quarter. The recent strength in the terms of trade has predominantly been driven by non-rural commodity export prices, which rose by 67 per cent over the past two years. The aggregate increase was dominated by large rises in the price of iron ore and coal, as well as mineral fuels, gold and metals. That is from Budget Paper No. 3. It is the Treasurer’s own paper that proves that this government’s economic performance rests substantially, if not entirely, on the minerals boom. The fact that the Treasurer is trying to walk away from it proves that this Treasurer is not prepared to be truthful with the Australian public about the benefits that they are receiving—the ‘largesse’ that they are receiving from this government is designed for one thing, and that is the government’s own re-election.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! I understand that this may be Senator Ian Campbell’s last contribution to this chamber. I would ask senators to acknowledge that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2007-08</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,30,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2007-05-10,"—I say, in taking note of answers, that what the Australian Labor Party needs to understand is that, yes, the minerals, gas and oil industries in Australia have never been in better shape, and they need to be in much better shape if we are to continue the prosperity that has been built in Australia since I made my first speech in this place back in May 1990, almost to the day.
In speaking of the minerals export industry and the development industry that is built around it, the prosperity that we see particularly in Western Australia and in states like Queensland—but all across Australia—has occurred because we have as a government since 1996 focused on policies that mean that we can develop those resources in a world-competitive manner. Taking away the Native Title Act restrictions that were put in place by Labor was a big part of that; reforming the Corporations Law, so that you can raise capital, and the takeovers laws were a big part of that; bringing into place environmental laws that ensured that you could get approvals through more quickly are a part of that; and of course industrial relations reforms were vital to that.
The Labor Party cannot become the friend of mining 10 days after it put through its national conference an industrial relations platform that would take Australia back to the 1950s. The north-west of Western Australia and the goldfields of Western Australia have been transformed by AWAs, which allow individuals to negotiate with their employers to create flexibility. That is a phenomenally important thing.
In this my last speech to the Senate I remind Australians that Australia is a much better place than it was in May 1990, when I came here. We did have a lot of leadership shown by the former Labor government—under Paul Keating’s leadership, particularly when he was the Treasurer—to open up the Australian economy, to float the Australian dollar and to allow more financial institutions in. We saw some phenomenal reforms, particularly under Peter Walsh when he was the Minister for Finance, to bring back the fiscal train wreck that was occurring. Labor did do some very good economic policy, and it had an opposition sitting over there that waved it through and encouraged it, as opposed to the opposition we have now that has sought to stop most of the economic reforms of the Howard-Costello era.
There are two points I would like to make in the short time I have; I have chosen to make it short because I think after 17 years in politics it is a bit hard to whinge about things that have not occurred—if you cannot do it then, you should get off and leave it to other people, which is what I will do. One thing that annoys the hell out of me, Mr President, is that in the Senate we totally ignore the standing order about reading speeches. I read my first speech when I was sitting behind where Robert Ray is, but I hated reading it. I found it so boring and so painful. I chose that day not to read another speech and I have virtually stuck to that. I would recommend, particularly to the new senators who have joined us but also to all of you, that you learn how to make a speech without copious notes and without having to read it. Do your research, write it out if you want, learn it and then just give it off the cuff. It is a wonderful skill. I am far from perfect and in fact I am hopeless at reading speeches now. I think it is an incredibly important skill that only the Senate would uphold. They will not do it over the other side; they are not made of the right sort of stuff. It is a wonderful skill to learn. The Prime Minister is probably the greatest practitioner of giving an extempore speech—certainly in this country and possibly in the free world. He is a master at it. A lot of new members and senators, but particularly senators, should learn to do that. Throw away your copious notes, throw away those typed out speeches and the little lecterns that people are using, and learn to make a speech.
In terms of policy, Australia has changed a lot in the years since 1990. We are a much more open place and we have fiscal responsibility, which is building prosperity. It is wonderful to have been a part of a government that has brought in voluntary student unionism, for example, so that we have freedom on campus; I can leave this place knowing we have finally got that policy through. We had the waterfront reforms and the environment reforms—all these reforms are important.
The huge challenge, and it is becoming a cliche to say it, is to get climate change policy right. We have had a lot more realism brought into debate over the past few months. The time for the sort of lazy policy we see from some parts of the polity in Australia is changing. You do need a mix of heavy investment in new technologies and you do need market mechanisms. We need to find a market mechanism that suits Australia’s economy. We cannot just borrow a policy from Great Britain and say, ‘We will take a 60 per cent cut in 30 years.’ That is something that suits the islands of Great Britain, but a target that might suit them is very unlikely to suit the economic circumstances of Australia in the middle of the Asia-Pacific. We need to work with China. I want to thank my friend Zhang Xiaoqiang, the Vice-Chairman of the NDRC in China. He and I made a joke last year in China about the fact that I think I have had more meals with Zhang than I have even had with my wife, Brenda, and our children over recent years. (Extension of time granted) I think that engagement with China in particular is something that Australia can do really well, developing market mechanisms and technology exchanges. The AP6, the Asia-Pacific partnership, is a wonderful way to pursue that.
I will just mention a few thankyous, firstly to Brenda and my family. They are in the gallery today. Thank you very much for putting up with what is an absurd lifestyle. We have had a wonderful journey as a couple and as a family. None of us can come here and change Australia and contribute to policy unless we have the support of a family. All of us have that, and I have been very lucky to have you, Brenda, supporting me and the kids.
I thank the many good friends I have made in this place, some lifelong. Choofer, on the front bench: we have been together since November 1980, from the Nedlands/Dalkeith Young Liberal days. It is an amazing friendship; I do not think we have ever had an argument. We have probably disagreed from time to time over some preselections, but we always get there in the end. Mate, thanks for being there. Thanks for being a friend.
To friends and colleagues on both sides of the chamber, I have very much enjoyed making friendships and working with you. We all come here to improve Australia. Australia is a better place than it was back in May 1990, when I read that first speech. That is the result of a commitment from people in all political parties. We all come here to make it a better place.
I conclude by thanking the staff of the parliament: the clerks, the deputy clerks, the attendants Lorna and Kathy and everybody else, the Hansard staff and the Comcar staff. You all are an amazing team that contributes to making a big difference. I also thank the volunteers in the Liberal Party back in Western Australia, a much-maligned party. There are thousands of people; on both sides of the chamber we have volunteers who ensure that we are here and given the privilege to serve. So I thank all those thousands of people in the Liberal Party back in WA.
I conclude by saying that what is very, very special about serving in parliament is that we are part of a democratic institution. It is so phenomenally important. We take it for granted in a country like Australia. We had delegates from around the Pacific and around our region who are just learning how to create democracies at the moment and who are struggling, and it is only a few hundred years ago that men and women in the British Isles and in the United States—or America as it was then, before it became united—spilt gallons of blood on the battlefields before they created the parliament at Westminster and then ultimately the Congress in Washington. It is a very special thing to have a parliamentary democracy. Ours is based on the traditions of Westminster and Washington. They are phenomenally important institutions.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I take the opportunity on behalf of the opposition to wish Senator Ian Campbell all the best in his future endeavours. I note with great interest his acknowledgement of Labor’s economic reform and the importance of climate change and also his wistful, ideological nostalgia for the VSU, which of course we opposed but which we know is very dear to Senator Campbell’s heart. But good luck in the future, Senator Campbell, and all the best to you and your family.
My role here is to take note of answers to questions in question time today on matters pertaining to the budget. The key point I want to make, like many of my colleagues, is that this is not a budget designed for the long term, no matter what the government try to dress it up as. The facts are that the Howard government have for 10 long years squandered the positive economic circumstances that we found ourselves in, in particular the resources boom and the windfall arising from it.
I want to pick up the point that Senator O’Brien was making about the use of Senator Johnston’s term ‘largesse’. I think the implication of the use of that word is quite profound. In other words, the Howard government think they are doing people a favour. How condescending, and how exposing of the hubris and arrogance that now pervades the Howard government, that they can use such terms. It is quite offensive, and I think it definitively shows that there is a shallow commitment, if there is any commitment at all, to the welfare and wellbeing of Australians, particularly those who provide caring roles and those most in need in our society.
For Labor’s part, we have been very focused on the issues of the future, the things that will shape our country now and from this time. They are the issues of education. It is about the infrastructure that makes our future possible, including broadband and the sorts of physical and social infrastructure that will underpin our society and economy. On education, Labor has always been committed to building an education system that not only services our current needs but provides for opportunities for growth for all our young people and adults embarking on courses of lifelong learning, renewing their skills or changing their careers later in life. Mr Rudd’s policy of an education revolution has really resonated with Australians because people understand two things: that investment in education is necessary to make the most of our most valuable and renewable resource—that is, people—and that our education system has been not just neglected but hampered and damaged by the Howard government over the last 10 years.
These two things, both clearly understood by Australians, mean that any shallow attempt by this government to rid themselves of the reputation of the education underminers will be met with cynicism and disbelief, no matter how they try to dress it up in this budget. People are just sick of being manipulated, and they will not be fooled again.
The bottom line is that the Howard government does not have an eye for the future. It has only blinkered vision that sees only political problems to be resolved. As the alternative government, Labor takes its responsibility far more seriously than that and always will. It is just not good enough for Mr Costello to front up with a university endowment fund and think that the government will be forgiven for a decade of neglect. The fact is that the Treasurer is now smirking in the spotlight of an answer to a problem of his own making. It is not even the right answer; it is a headline in place of an answer. Our kids deserve better. They are the future, and their potential is in the hands of a government that cares more about short-term political power. Now, with HECS caps off, it looks like the Howard government has re-established universities as institutions primarily for those of wealth and privilege.
We know this because we have looked at some of the numbers that show the increases in HECS will pull some $200 million from people in the future. Further proof is that we are at the bottom of the OECD rankings for national investment in education of four-year-olds—a crucial development year. All of the research highlights this fact, yet this government has done nothing to make an investment there. In contrast, Labor has the policy to improve this situation. Further proof is the shrinking proportion of GDP that is spent on universities. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-05-10,"—I also add my best wishes to Senator Ian Campbell for his future. We have crossed swords a bit over time, but I recognise that he has made a considerable contribution to the operation of this chamber.
Today I want to refer to the so-called answers given by Senator Scullion. Senator Scullion’s bluster and defensive responses to Senator Kirk’s and my questions provided no comfort to people with disabilities or older Australians who care for people with disabilities or elderly loved ones. It is not the style that that group of people are looking for, and it is not the way that they will feel they should be considered by this government. These are the facts that I tried to ask Senator Scullion about today: a person who is on an age pension who is caring for an elderly partner or an adult child with a disability will not receive the $1,000 one-off payment that a person under the age of 65 will receive—a person on carer payment. Senator Scullion acknowledged that in a roundabout way today when he said there were two demographics. I am sorry, Senator Scullion; there are three. There is a group of people who are on the age pension but who do exactly the same job; they do exactly the same task as that of a person receiving a carer payment: they care for a person who is severely or profoundly disabled or an elderly person and they are not in receipt of the carer payment.
There is a large group of people who feel as if they have missed out, and rightly so. They will get $600 as a carer allowance recipient. That is the truth, and that is what this government has to deal with. The fact is that the application of this policy is discriminatory. It does discriminate on the basis of age. They do the same job, yet they get different treatment. Older people know that they are being treated differently. They know discrimination when they see it or feel it, and they will not be duped by Treasurer Costello’s patronising rhetoric that this is an acknowledgement of the fine work that they do.
I draw the government’s attention to a media release from Carers Australia in which they state:
Carers Australia is surprised and disappointed at the apparent disregard of recommendations it made for the 2007-08 Federal Budget.
They called for improved financial security for carers, for carer health initiatives, for strategies to assist carers to remain in the workforce and for a national carer framework. These are just a few of the recommendations Carers Australia say were overlooked in the budget. Mr Chodziesner said:
We were expecting a budget that would be family friendly. We thought we would hear announcements that would look to the future. There is nothing for family carers in this regard.
Now I want to go to the question that Senator Kirk asked. Senator Scullion said that the one-off payment was very well received. That is only partially true. It was very well received by those who will receive it. People with disabilities feel as if they have been overlooked in this budget. They feel forgotten. Leanne who rang the ABC in Adelaide said: ‘What are we? Are we nothing?’ Those questions are resonating across the sector. People with disabilities and people who provide services to people with disabilities feel that they have been overlooked and forgotten in this budget. I am sure that the government knows of their concern. The reason for their fury and their concern is that the budget has no indication of growth funding for the CSTDA, which is currently being negotiated. It is my understanding that the ‘negotiations’ that were held on 3 April could hardly be called that. Also, the outcome of those negotiations must be a multilateral agreement, but it looks as if we are heading toward bilateral agreements, which will not be useful. (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-05-10,"—There was much fanfare and self-congratulation in this place on Tuesday night when the Treasurer handed down his 12th budget. We waited in anticipation: would this be a budget that would deliver on the big challenges of our time—climate change and water—a budget that would help struggling families, lock in access to health and education or make the tax system fairer? With more than $16 billion extra a year to spend, anything was possible. But what we got was a grab bag of cheques in the mail: $700 vouchers to parents to spend on tuition for their children; a $500 one-off cash bonus for most of the over-65s; $1,000 and $600 for carers; a childcare rebate of up to $8,000 cash—two years worth all at once; apprentices to get $1,000 to top up wages; $5,000 to move to where the jobs are; an $8,000 rebate for buying a solar photovoltaic unit; and a top-up of up to $3,000 for superannuation contributions. In fact, if you have a pulse, you will be likely to qualify for a windfall of some description. There were also minimal tax cuts for the lowest income earners and bigger cuts for those on middle to high incomes; very modest sums for Indigenous health and housing; a partial answer to poor dental services; tiny increases in childcare support, mental health and obesity; some handouts for farmers; $5 billion parked in a future fund for universities; and big spending on defence.
This budget has one purpose: to buy the Howard government’s way back into office and to kill off what must be for the Prime Minister an unsettling rise in the polls for the Labor opposition. What an extraordinary place to be in Australian political history, and what an extraordinary opportunity it presented—an economy at full strength, low inflation, coffers overflowing! We probably have to go back to the gold rush to find a time when governments were rolling in so much money from mining and taxes. In the boom more than a century ago, the money was spent on major infrastructure—on rail and road networks, sewerage and water systems, town halls, universities, parliaments and ports—but not so in this budget. Even as the Treasurer beamed with self-satisfaction at his own largesse, there were plenty outside thinking: ‘Shouldn’t some of that serious money be spent on tackling the really serious challenges we face?’
Federal government revenue next year is set to reach a massive $245 billion, excluding GST. However, the rain over the last week or so does not necessarily signal an end to the crippling drought, personal debt has grown alarmingly, housing is less affordable and rates of obesity and alcohol use loom as huge costs to health. And, despite coal exports worth $26 billion a year, Australia’s foreign debt keeps growing. The budget papers predict that export volumes will be up by five per cent next year but—here is the rub—imports will rise by 6.5 per cent. Our current account deficit will reach $66 billion—a staggering six per cent of gross domestic product. If the country settles back into a pattern of extremely low rainfall, if another big storm wipes out a whole sector in agriculture, as it did bananas last year, and if oil prices keep going up—and they have almost returned to the highs of late last year—then the Reserve Bank would have to act. This budget assumes a growth rate of 3.75 per cent, consumer prices to rise by 2.75 per cent and wages to go up 4.25 per cent—all of which nudges us closer to an interest rate rise and disaster for those families who are up to their eyeballs in mortgage repayments.
In its indecent haste to bribe its way into office, the Howard government again failed to tackle Australia’s most urgent threat—climate change. The United Nations Security Council, the UK and Pentagon defence experts now say that climate change is a bigger security threat than terrorism and is more complex than the Cold War. So what did we get on Tuesday night? Defence got an extra $2 billion and land transport $22 billion, but climate change did not even rate $1 billion. It is in fact wagging a finger at the most menacing threat of our time. For all the fanfare, the solar rebates will put barely 15,000 PV systems on rooftops, and these will be completely swamped by new housing—housing that for the most part will have pathetically poor energy efficiency. Add to this Australia’s record for having the world’s worst energy standards for appliances and equipment and it becomes clear that the grants were headline catching but totally ineffective in dealing with the enormity of this problem.
Where were the triggers for big investment in markets for energy savings and renewable energy? Where were the policies that industry and business were pleading for? The World Bank estimates that $55 billion was invested directly in renewable energy in just three years. Renewable energy investment is growing globally by 50 per cent a year, but not in Australia. From a purely business perspective, this is a global market that Australia should not be missing out on. As one of the most wasteful countries in the world, we need to ramp up energy efficiency initiatives. It is shocking that Australians who want to do the right thing are being betrayed by cynicism and deceit: being told that cuts would ruin the economy and that only coal and nuclear can provide baseload power. It is wrong and the government knows it. Yes, solar panel rebates are welcome, but this limited number will not solve the enormous problem we face. Fifty-three million dollars for stickers telling households how to save energy will not cut it either. The $170 million for adapting to climate change is in fact the white flag in this budget. It is easier to surrender than to act, particularly if your horizon is the next election.
Of course, the Howard government sceptics remain firmly in denial that catastrophic changes to our lives and our environment are upon us and will worsen unless we act now. One hundred and seventy million dollars will not be enough to adapt to the impact of climate change. In fact, the cost of adapting will be 20 times greater than the cost of taking action now to avoid the worst of it. But I am guessing the Howard government will have a road to Damascus moment as polling day draws closer. Its emissions task force will conclude that policies to lock in emissions cuts are required after all. The government will suddenly and resoundingly accept what the international scientific community has been telling it for years. It will swoop in just before the election with a multibillion-dollar handout for more so-called clean coal and nuclear reactors—perhaps even dam the few remaining wild rivers for hydro.
The reality is that this government believes that climate change is just another political problem like child care and dental health—problems that can be solved by funding just enough money to deliver a political advantage. But this is not every other problem; this is about the spectre of catastrophic climate change which may threaten our very civilisation. The Democrats, again, call on the Howard government to abandon political manoeuvring and to act now on climate change.
In every budget there is something that makes me really angry. This time it is a broken promise—a longstanding one to the Democrats and a recent one to Warren Entsch, other Liberals and to millions of Australians. Mr Howard has reneged on the undertaking he gave that this budget would recognise interdependent relationships for Public Service death benefits. Cabinet apparently knocked it back, saying it would increase unfunded superannuation liabilities by $2 billion. This is absurd. Superannuation liabilities increase all the time. In any case, what is the purpose of the Future Fund? The fact is that miserable and mean conservatives also opposed equality for women, the end of slavery and every other cause of the dispossessed and the disadvantaged. Mr Howard, if $2 billion is the price of equity, pay it. You have got the money—we all know it.
For years—decades even—Democrats have argued for long-term, sustained and sustainable commitments by successive governments to the nation state’s basic underpinning—its people and its land. From preschool to workforce entry takes nearly two decades. It is a very long time before you get a social and an economic dividend. Australia is paying for the coalition’s underinvestment in the last decade in the land—infrastructure, water, energy—and in our people: skills and making work worth while. There is supposed to be a labour shortage in this country. The crazy thing is that we have plenty of people available—combining the unemployed and the underemployed, over 1.5 million—but too many of these people do not have the skills or the incentives for the jobs that are available. To maximise productivity and skill creation you need a high level of sustained investment, and it has to be by governments. Productive investment needs long-term thinkers, not user-pays obsessives and hands-off economic rationalists. I think the coalition only woke up in the last year to the need to invest in the supply side—in education and in skills and training of all types. How is it that a budget to answer Labor’s education revolution could exclude the TAFE sector? Mr Howard, we do need plumbers and electricians and it is good to give young people help to enter these worthy careers, but that is not all there is to fixing the skills shortages. What is left of manufacturing in this country needs brains, not brawn.
The other aspect of the skills supply side is making work worth while. That means tax reform. It is true that participation has lifted as effective marginal tax rates have lowered, but not nearly enough. Real wages have lifted, but again not nearly enough and at nowhere near the rate of increases in profits. It is true that there have been tax cuts for the last five budgets. It is true that the low-income tax offset lifts the effective tax-free threshold substantially, but what a complex system we have. It is no wonder that it is not a good motivator to get people into work. ‘You will pay X dollars of tax, but, wait, we will give you Y dollars back.’ For goodness sake, we say: do not tax these people in the first place.
We have always agreed that top thresholds and rates had to be cut, but not without first helping the lowest-income Australians to shift from welfare to work. But always, for the coalition, the wealthiest got theirs first. We understand the rationale. Tax cuts to richer people are often saved. Tax cuts to the poor are spent and can endanger the economy, overstimulating it when it is near full capacity, as it is now. That is why the Democrats argue for phasing in structural tax reform over the medium term. Raising the tax-free threshold to the poverty line of $12,500 would apparently cost over $35 billion over four years. But can someone please explain why we income-tax people who are below the poverty line? Tax reform needs a plan but Mr Costello has no income tax plan; he just has an annual show bag at budget time.
Thank goodness for elections. At least vote buying means that lower-income Australians get a slice of the $31 billion in tax cuts over four years, even if it is only $2.88 a week, which is $50 less than someone earning a quarter of a million dollars. Nonetheless we applaud the return of funds to taxpayers whose tax bills are increased each year by stealth through bracket creep, and whose pay packets have recently been cut by Work Choices. This is money owed to them, taken without notice and without permission by a system which forces working men and women into a higher tax rate even as their real wage remains the same or goes backwards.
We acknowledge the Howard government’s stewardship over a buoyant economy and the many positive things they have done, but they are unable to grasp the idea of eliminating bracket creep by indexing the tax thresholds, a position that is widely supported, not least by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Treasurer, it seems, does not get this essential equity principle. He expects praise for giving back tax revenue that he should not have in the first place. That is not good economic management. That is the Treasurer slipping his hand into pay packets and helping himself to more, while the government rolls in money, and the wages of many remain stagnant or go backwards. Had the 1980 lowest threshold of $4,041 kept pace with earnings it would now be about $15,000.
Any advocacy for struggling workers is incomplete without reference to those predatory IR policies which involve taking from the poor and giving to the rich. Work Choices is the poster boy of exploitative workplace legislators. The reality is that any money now being given back to low-income earners as tax cuts is limited compensation for wages driven down by the poisonous Work Choices, a law which punishes those without power, influence or wealth. At a time of healthy surpluses and soaring revenues, this was the opportunity to make the tax system simpler, fairer and more transparent.
The Democrats say it is not good policy to maintain a system of tax churning by taxing lower-income Australians and then instigating a complex system of returning bits of what was taken at various later dates in the form of benefits. We call on the government again to lift the tax free threshold over time, so that low-income earners do not pay income tax until they get to $20,000 in earnings. This will take at least two million people out of the income tax system, the vast majority of them women and part-timers. So you want greater participation in the workforce? Try this one, and let us pay for reform by getting rid of welfare for the wealthy and rationalising inequitable, inefficient and outdated tax concessions. It is called base broadening.
The budget earmarked $5 billion for the Higher Education Endowment Fund from which it is intended will flow perpetual funding to universities for capital works and research facilities. The Democrats welcome extra funding for universities. They are simultaneously starved of funds by government and lauded as the places where Australia’s future lies. We welcome the boost for capital works and research facilities, but those buildings and facilities must be filled with students. Bricks and mortar and a lick of paint do not help students struggling to pay their fees and rent, or for their books.
We acknowledge the Howard government’s decision at last to extend rent assistance to Austudy recipients, a measure the Democrats have campaigned on for years. We acknowledge there are other student income support initiatives but they fall well short of what is needed. And equality of access to university education has been ignored. In fact this budget actively paves the way for more rich students by removing the cap on full fee paying places. We oppose this regressive policy absolutely. Why would we want to lock in a system of inherited privilege rather than merit and intellect as a pathway to university education? Poorer, brighter students will be crowded out in favour of those clutching a fistful of dollars or those prepared to burden themselves to a life of crippling debt. It is obvious that cash-starved universities will err towards full fee paying students. Already universities are flagging another rise in HECS fees for those business courses which copped financial cuts in this budget. The Howard government’s higher education policies are designed by zealots who do not care that some are already paying more than $200,000 for their degrees. It is policymaking which is elitist and divisive.
In this budget the government has tried to placate those families struggling with child care, but what is on offer will do little to solve the real problems. We are pleased to see the government is finally moving to fix the absurdity of the 30 per cent childcare tax rebate so that families will receive the money more quickly. This was criticised by us and many others at the time; waiting 18 months was not helping the families who needed it most. And we are pleased to see that low-income families are now eligible. But the childcare tax rebate is still inflationary and a poor response to the sector’s many problems. The Treasurer is talking up the ‘up to $8,000’ that families could now receive but of course that is for two years; at most it could be up to $4,200 a year but almost nobody gets that. In fact the average payment will $813 per child.
The 10 per cent increase in the childcare benefit on top of indexation will help low- and middle-income families but it is a once-off. Childcare costs went up 12 per cent in each of the last two years.  If this pattern continues—and we have no reason to think it will not—people will be in the same boat they are in now in 12 months time. It would have been good to see the level of childcare benefit linked to the real costs of child care on an ongoing basis. Nor did we see any acknowledgement of the difficulties in finding places for the under twos. More affordable care does not help if you cannot find a place for your child.
There is not much vision for early childhood care and education here despite our poor position internationally on funding for this area. There is no sign either of removing FBT for employer provided child care and nannies are still not brought into the system. We need to see a national long-term plan for reform of child care and of the way that we provide early childhood services. We need better staff-child ratios; we need improved training and qualifications for all childcare staff; we need mandated age-appropriate learning and development program and national planning controls to make sure centres and services are equitably distributed, including operational subsidies for some areas And of course what is most missing is a national paid maternity scheme.
Australia’s 2.6 million carers will welcome the one-off bonus of $1,000 and the increases in respite funding. Nonetheless, this $341 million in handouts is peanuts compared to the $30 billion that family carers save the economy every year. The work that is done by carers often comes at great personal cost to their own physical and mental health, not to mention the pressure on their other relationships and the impact on their employment and financial situation. And what about the government’s commitment to people with disabilities? The response to the Senate’s unanimous report of a couple of months ago recommending substantial additional funding was obviously missing.
People may wonder who got the seriously big money in this budget. Well, let me now turn to defence. Defence gets another surge—this time to $2 billion, bringing the budget to $22 billion in 2007-08, with major new spending on mostly high-tech assault equipment like the $6 billion worth of Super Hornet fighter-bombers. Another $228 million is to be spent marketing the services as employers of choice. It is little wonder that this is needed when the treatment of returning men and women has been so shabby. All of this, and the money wasted on Iraq, may ingratiate us with President George Bush, but it is money that would have been better spent on climate change or on health and education or even on peacekeeping and good relations with our neighbours in this region.
Or let us for a moment imagine what a fraction of that money could have done for Indigenous Australians. The Democrats are extremely disappointed that, in a budget brimming with pre-election bribes and one-off handouts, so little for Indigenous people has been provided—even though this government has acknowledged time and again that they are the most disadvantaged and disenfranchised group in Australia. The failure to act on one of our most pressing national problems at a time when we can easily afford it is immoral. The most generous reading of the budget figures provides $135 million over four years, or less than $35 million extra a year, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These are the ones with a life expectancy of 20 years less than the rest of us.
The $300 million for Indigenous housing, while welcome, is likely to be wasted by the irksome conditions attached, like funding only houses that can be transferred to state housing authorities or made available for purchase by individuals. Nobody is against providing more opportunities for Indigenous people to own their own home, but that should not be to the exclusion of other effective options. This appears to mean that Indigenous community housing organisations will only receive funding if they relinquish control of their housing stock. Despite the highly distorted picture the government has been presenting about the state of Indigenous housing, even the minister acknowledges that some Indigenous community housing organisations have been very well managed. A one-size-fits-all solution makes no sense in locations where the private home ownership market is unlikely to work. We can look forward to Indigenous people again being blamed for government failures. The statistics for health and housing for Indigenous communities show a sorry neglect. We challenge the Rudd opposition to bridge the gap in Indigenous health, employment and housing, and to do so without a paternalistic agenda.
To conclude: we looked for inspirational leadership to deal with the menace of climate change; we got dust thrown into a powerful and growing storm. We looked for tax reform; we got money returned to low-income earners from whom it should never have been taken in the first place and nothing to protect them from it being nicked again. We looked for childcare and school funding that would cut to the heart of the problems in those sectors; we got a spray of surgically enhanced early payments and subsidies. We looked for funding that would ensure all of our best and brightest would have access to university, regardless of their income; we got a fund that will improve the look of facilities but little to finance the students who populate them. And Indigenous Australians continue to be treated in the same shameful way they have always been treated.
This is a budget which cements old prejudices and bribes voters. Its centrepiece? Truckloads of money. It could have done so much, but actually did so little. Sure, the Treasurer threw back to us some of it and, like kids in a lolly shop, we are expected to scramble for our share. But you can bet your bottom dollar that we will all end up paying for it in a multitude of ways and in the not-too-distant future. If you missed Tuesday night’s budget, do not worry: there will be another: ‘2007 Budget: the Sequel’. Just before election day, another large stash of money will be found and another round of  promises and spending will commence. And I am tipping that the sequel will be just as show-stopping as the first: a daring taxation robbery; a dramatic fight scene in which the key players alternatively fall away and then claw their way back; lots of special effects; and a winner-take-all scene at the end. But whether you will see reparations made in Indigenous communities, a lid on interest rates, a commitment to tax reform, access to higher education or a real response to climate change when you finally get out of the theatre remains to be seen.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,37,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-05-10,"—What a pity that the 36 of the 38 government members were missing throughout the presentation by the Leader of Democrats on this all-important budget night in reply here in the Senate. This year’s budget is more about greed than green. The Treasurer and the government have a huge ethical responsibility in spending the nation’s money and in ensuring its future. That ethical responsibility was not met in this budget. The massive tax cuts were for spending now. But the government failed in its higher responsibility to tackle the greatest threat to this nation’s future and to the lifestyle of our children and their children: climate change.
The Treasurer began his speech by saying that this country of Australia has changed a lot in the last 10 years. Well, it certainly has. It has got hotter, it has got drier and it has become more threatened by the arrogant failure of this government to address the environmental crises, and to make this country safer, more secure and happier for this generation and for the generations yet to come. The Greens have markedly different values and priorities from the government. The priorities for a Greens budget would include halting climate change, conserving water resources and protecting the environment, ensuring the 650,000 Australians on dental waiting lists receive the care they need, urgently funding measures to reduce the 17-year gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and of course increasing education funding to meet the OECD average education spending levels—where Australia should be, if not well in advance of that.
On climate change, security analysts from the Pentagon, along with ecologists and the world’s preponderant scientific opinion, know that climate change stalks our global community’s future more fearsomely and less discriminately than terrorism. With Tuesday night’s budget, however, came the dumping not just of Australian’s hopes but of Australian’s expectations that our government would at last tackle that climate change nemesis. The environment budget barely budged—just $281 million more, or two per cent of the unprecedented budget surplus of $15 billion. Yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told the same Treasurer and the same government just last week that the world has less than 10 years to turn around the accelerating pollution of the atmosphere with greenhouse gases or we face catastrophic consequent changes for the planet, and that of course means for Australia.
Climate change is not a future event. It is here, now, with a monumental impact. That is why the Howard government budget outlines a $10 billion federal-state rescue plan for the Murray-Darling Basin, including the buyback of overallocated irrigation licences, which have left the rivers run down, incapable and stressed. Seventy per cent of the great red gums lining the river’s banks are suffering, dying or dead. But the Treasurer fails to act. Inexplicably, his plan for buyback of those excessive licences which are sucking the water out of the river systems does not begin until the budget of 2009-10. He has put it off for two more ruinous years. The Greens would immediately fund measures to address overallocation in the Murray-Darling Basin. We know, the farmers know and the public know that this cannot wait another two years.
The Treasurer, however, has decided on an immediate $31 billion in tax cuts over the next four years. This comes after the $25 billion largesse, including tax cuts to the rich, in last year’s budget. This year’s $31 billion, we are told, is for across-the-board cuts for salaried workers. Well, yes, it is, but the board is skewed. Once again, the rich get much richer at everyone else’s expense. In fact, 10½ per cent of people get 44 per cent of the money. Those on over $75,000, get the lion’s share. Those so poor they do not pay tax, including Australia’s 1.2 million pensioners, get a one-off $500 payment, and then after the election nothing. Carers, who save this government billions of dollars, get a meagre $1,000, and then after the election nothing. The budget is top heavy. Far from fostering a fair Australia, the big end of town is once again left clutching a big fistful of dollars. The Greens will support the across-the-board tax cuts, even though they are regressive. Unlike Labor, we will vote against the provisions for huge special cuts—some $10 billion over three years for the highest income earners beginning next year.
With that $10 billion, we would move to make Australia the energy efficient nation. I doubt the Treasurer or the Prime Minister know what energy efficient means. They are so stuck on the much less effective, more expensive, more dangerous and, for now, unavailable option of nuclear reactors. Yet energy efficiency could slash Australia’s coal consumption by a massive 30 per cent. That would mean a rapid cut in greenhouse gas emissions in a way that dangerous nuclear power simply could not emulate. Already, Australia’s 250 biggest corporations, which effectively consume 40 per cent of our electricity, are doing energy audits. We would regulate to require that the audits’ recommendations be implemented. We would extend the auditing to the rest of business in Australia and to Australian homes over the coming years, offering government funding as needed to ensure that audit figures are implemented.
Environment Minister Turnbull’s $8 million allocation to change light bulbs will eventually reduce greenhouse emissions by four million tonnes per year—that is equivalent to taking eight per cent of cars off the roads in Australia. But handing out light bulbs is like handing out sand buckets during a bushfire. It is better than nothing, but it is no substitute for investing in the fire brigade. However, implementing the energy audits of those 250 big companies would save roughly 84 million tonnes, which is more effective than taking every single car, truck and bus off the roads of Australia. In addition, if all of Australia’s 5.5 million homes were fitted with a solar hot-water system, which is one of the cheapest ways most of us can substantially reduce emissions, another 23 million tonnes of emissions would be saved. Solar hot-water systems cost about $3,000 more than the old electric water heaters, but they pay for themselves through lower power bills within five to eight years.
These are just a few of the many untapped energy efficiency opportunities this country has but which are being missed by this government. The Greens want the government to bring in energy-efficient building codes and retrofitting, for example, with insulation of existing buildings for energy efficiency. The government budget allocates just $30 million per annum for solar panels. Look at that on the back of an envelope: $8,000 per roof means that just 3,750 roofs per annum will be fitted with panels—not enough to fit the roofs of Dubbo. So it would take up to 2,000 years to realise the aim of converting every roof in our sunny country to a mini power station. That is Howard hopeless.
The Greens will pursue real national action, not Howard government tokenism. In the absence of government action on energy efficiency, but with the tax cuts, let me give some advice on how Australia’s working families might combine the two. If a householder spends one week’s worth of tax cuts on two compact fluorescent light globes then she or he can convert the $14 into $100 worth of savings, because one compact fluorescent globe saves around $50 to $75 in its lifetime. If a householder takes the $14 worth of tax cuts for two years—that is, $1,500—she or he could spend $150 on a home audit and/or replace all the light globes at home with compact fluorescents, because a pack of five costs $20, and invest in insulation, which costs $1,000 to $2,000 for an average home, or solar hot water, which costs $2,000 to $5,000. This could save around $500 a year—hundreds of dollars off household power bills year after year into the future. So the invested tax cut is repaid to the householder in three years and there is a $500 bonus year after year following that.
The Australian Conservation Foundation is calling for five per cent of homes to be retrofitted for energy efficiency each year, which means that within a generation all Australian homes will be energy smart. This should start with low-income and disadvantaged people and in particular target rental properties, which are usually the least well insulated. It is a proposal that the Greens urge the government—or, if the government cannot do it, the opposition—to take up, work out and implement.
Two other great opportunities would be grasped by the Greens. The first is to end the broad-scale logging and burning of Australia’s old-growth forests. This is destroying the nation’s wildlife and needlessly polluting the atmosphere. There are 1.5 million hectares of plantations in Australia. That is more than enough to supply all of Australia’s wood needs for paper, home building and furniture making. But Prime Minister Howard’s commitment, echoed by opposition leader Rudd, is to keep needlessly cutting and burning Australia’s biggest carbon banks: its old-growth forests. That has to be altered and the logging and burning of forests committed, like whaling, to history. It is extraordinary that the budget has $197 million to begin the task of ending the slash-and-burn logging of the forests of Indonesia, but in the last two years $100 million has been spent on forest intensification, logging and burning, of the great forests of Tasmania to the south. The second opportunity the Greens would grasp is to transform Australia from being road dependent to using rail and sea transport for freight, with fast, clean and efficient public transport systems. One small component would be to abolish the GST on public transport, thereby cutting ticket prices on rail, bus, tram and ferry passenger transport by an immediate 10 per cent.
Summing it up, with good regulation and part of the $10 billion tax cuts for the mega-rich diverted to a national energy efficiency program, Australia could indeed make deep cuts in its infamous greenhouse gas emissions—as much as 30 per cent. We could go from being the worst polluter amongst the developing countries to the most advanced, cleanest, most efficient, most job prospective, most export oriented, resource renewable, energy efficient, ecologically transformed nation.
Contrast that with what the government has proposed. Just yesterday it was joined by Labor in voting down a Greens motion to end the logging and burning of Australia’s old-growth forests and wildlife habitat. Acting Deputy President Troeth, you will remember that this morning both parties voted down Senator Milne’s motion to back global scientific opinion that, to prevent catastrophic climate change, we should aim to keep global temperature rises to two degrees Celsius or less. Into that prescription read: the coal industry, with its puppeting hands over the big parties. We could not even philosophically aim for a target that the world scientists say we must aim for if we are going to avoid catastrophic change. When I say ‘we’ I mean Labor and the coalition. The Greens would put that aim absolutely on centre stage and achieve it in the interests of our children and the grandchildren of Australia.
An unfortunate reality is that there will be more natural disasters in our region. The tsunami in 2004 showed all Australians how vulnerable we are. The scientific consensus is that climate change will result in more, and more destructive, cyclones, bushfires and epidemics. Australia needs to be ready to react more quickly and more effectively to natural and man-made disasters in our region. Tonight I renew the Greens’ call for a disaster relief centre for the nation which has the capacity to deploy people, equipment and aid to those in need inside and outside our country when disaster strikes.
The Japanese had a team of doctors and nurses on the ground in Indonesia within 24 hours of the tsunami. The French had aid in New Orleans within a day of Hurricane Katrina because they had predeployed materials in the Caribbean for exactly that purpose. The one thing preventing Australia from having such an international, regional and domestic relief centre is political will. I am ashamed that, when a ferry sank in neighbouring Indonesia’s waters earlier this year with the catastrophic loss of some 500 lives, this government did not pick up the phone, did not offer assistance. That is something we must redress, and having a national and international relief centre may well do that where that political mind is closed and the political will is missing.
On the topic of our responsibility to the region, the Greens believe that Australia should immediately increase our aid budget to the 0.7 per cent of GDP recommended by the UN. That recommendation, which we agreed to, goes right back to the beginning of the last decade. Australia is a rich country and we can afford to show leadership on such an important humanitarian matter. Instead, the government’s budget affords the poverty-stricken billions of our shared world only half of that target commitment.
The government continues down the path towards an American style two-tiered health system. The Greens would abolish the health insurance rebate scheme and divert that $3 billion into the public health system instead. The current scheme serves the nation so badly that the taxpayer top-up for this private, exclusive system blew out by $283 million last year. That comes from the taxpayers and it is more than the entire extra spending on the government’s environment budget for 2007-08.
The Greens policy is to have a ‘denticare’ system paralleling Medicare. No Australian child or adult—to paraphrase someone else—should live with dental caries by 2010. Yet this government torpedoed the $100 million concession card holders dental care program back in 1996, its first year in office, and now there are an estimated—can you believe this?—650,000 Australians on dental waiting lists. Some elderly or disabled citizens wait two to three years to have their dental problems cared for. That is unforgivably heartless and a dereliction of duty by a government with a $15 billion surplus it has trouble spending.
Childhood obesity is estimated to cost Australia tens of billions of dollars in the coming decades as record rates of diabetes and heart disease debilitate our children and our children as adults down the line. In the Senate right now, the Greens have an amendment to the food standards act that would see all food advertisements banned during children’s viewing hours. However, the government has failed on this issue, and its failure is difficult to fathom. When it comes to the $4,000 that new parents get, young mothers are not allowed to receive the lump sum because it is feared that they might spend it all on televisions and cigarettes. But when it comes to junk food advertising—you have to look for the unseen hand of the big food corporations here—we are told that it would be patronising to suggest that parents are not in a position to decide what to let their children eat. The costs of junk food and obesity, like the costs of climate change, will dominate public debate in the coming decades. If we took decisive action now—and it appears this government will not—we would not just save money; we would save lives and raise the wellbeing of the nation for decades.
Only two years ago, the government was in the midst of another reaction to public fear in the form of bird flu. While the media may have lost interest in bird flu, the world’s epidemiologists have not. The threats to Australia, and to the rest of the world, remain as high as they were in 2005. A recent report from the Lowy Institute found that even a mild pandemic influenza outbreak would have significant consequences for the global economic output. In this scenario, it predicts that there would be 1.4 million deaths and that approximately a third of a trillion US dollars would be shaved off the global economic output. Yet the government has not allocated any new funding measures to this threat in the budget. Where is the public education campaign to sensibly prepare Australia for a bird flu pandemic which could leave not 180 but 180,000 citizens dead? Instead of funding such public preparedness for an epidemic, Mr Howard is infamously diverting up to $60 million to explain his so-called Work Choices backflip. This inverse priority is staggering and politically corrupt.
Aboriginal health and housing is grossly underfunded and misdirected in this year’s budget. It will not go anywhere near far enough to address the 17-year life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The focus of the government’s budget measures is on regional and remote communities—and no doubt they deserve much more funding. However, the majority of Aboriginal Australians live in urban communities where their life expectancy is just as bad as those in remote communities.
Health experts agree that $500 million per year is required to lift Aboriginal health standards to those of non-Aboriginal Australians. Taking this figure, Tom Calma, the social justice commissioner, has proposed a plan to address the gap in life expectancy within a generation. The Greens back him. It is appalling that rather than $500 million this budget allocates only about $30 million per annum to this nationally urgent responsibility.
A further $2.3 billion is needed to catch up on housing levels, but the Costello budget actually takes money away from Aboriginal housing in urban areas, focusing on remote and regional areas. Having taken the funding from urban Aboriginal housing, the government has done nothing to ease housing affordability, leaving the majority of Aboriginal Australians worse, not better, off. Despite recent international attention on Australia’s record as the worst in the developed world on Indigenous health and development, the government has yet again failed to deliver on meaningful reform. The blinkers are on, the eyes are down and the back is turned on the first Australians.
The Greens’ goal is for public education to become a full-time, not just a pre-election, priority for the federal government. Treasurer Costello’s budget was big on headlines but notably short on a plan to bring public education investment and outcomes up to world’s best standards. That would need $7 billion more in annual spending. The Treasurer’s $5 billion, one-off trust fund for universities will provide less than $400 million per annum—seriously short of 10 per cent of the required investment for Australian education to catch up with that of similar countries around the world.
The Greens call for the needed $7 billion dollar boost in public education from the Commonwealth. It is a national investment plan from preschool to university. It starts with building public preschools, paying preschool teachers a fair wage and guaranteeing two years of free public preschool to every Australian child. That is what is required. That is more than Labor committed to tonight. But let me praise Labor for the commitments made tonight by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, after so many years of serious neglect and decline in the funding of Australian education by the Howard government. There is no single more important and far-reaching education measure that the nation’s government could take than providing much more funding for early childhood education.
The Greens also recognise the vital importance of TAFE not only to the skilling of our nation but also to social and community infrastructure. Not a single extra penny was spent on TAFE in this budget. The Greens would return funding to 1996 levels in real terms, $750 million, and work towards returning TAFE to permanent staffing, so ending this government’s cheap casualisation of the TAFE workforce.
In this week’s budget another step was taken towards the university sector being privatised and Americanised by this government. The Greens would abolish HECS and full-fee degrees, boost core funding for universities per student, and realise the aim of accessible, high-quality, equitable public education for all Australians. This would have been easily achievable had Mr Costello thought education was more important than the $55 billion in tax cuts of the last two years.
The Australian Greens will go to this year’s election offering a much more far-sighted plan for Australia than either the coalition or Labor. Besides our priorities for public health and education, we would keep Australia’s uranium in the ground and not in nuclear reactors in Sydney, Beijing or Mumbai. Unlike Labor and the coalition we would get the chainsaws and firebombers out of Australia’s great wild forests. And, unlike the coalition and Labor, we would prioritise clean energy efficiency over the expansion of coal-fired power stations in Australia and coal exports to the rest of the world. We all share the same atmosphere wherever that coal is burnt.
The Greens would move not just the dollars but the philosophy of this nation. We are the values party and so would implement triple bottom line accounting—budgets measuring and allocating not just the nation’s wealth but also its social and environmental wellbeing.
Prime Minister Howard still thinks politics is a fight between the economy and the environment. It is not. World’s best practice shows that good environmental policy is fundamental to good economic policy. You cannot plan Australia’s future, let alone assure intergenerational equity, if you do not guard its environment. The Greens’ regard for Australia is wider, longer and deeper than this old Howard view.
Ten years ago, coalition senators laughed at me in this chamber when I warned of the dangers of climate change. They are not laughing now. Ten years from now, this nation will be transforming. To do that, it needs a different hand at the helm. My job, our commitment as Greens, is to accelerate that transformation. Long after this week’s tax cuts are forgotten, the program I have outlined tonight on behalf of the Greens will remain part of the prescription for a new, safer, more responsible Australia in the 21st century.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,37,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2007-05-10,"—Family First welcomes initiatives that are good for Australian families and is pleased the government has provided some help for families in this budget. But this budget is a budget of missed opportunities for the Howard battlers. The Howard battlers are the Australian families in the outer suburbs and regional areas who are struggling to make ends meet. They are families reeling from soaring petrol prices as well as increasing grocery costs and electricity and water bills. The government has missed its opportunity to provide real relief to these Australian families where they need it most—at the petrol pump.
The government has also missed its opportunity to provide real relief to Australian families with respect to child care by giving all families genuine choice about the type of child care that best suits their needs. The way to do that is to treat all parents the same instead of giving a lot more to those who opt for institutional child care. If families want their children to be cared for by a grandparent, friend, neighbour or nanny in a family home, why should they miss out? Give all parents the same benefit and then let them be the judge of who is best to care for their children.
This budget of missed opportunities for the Howard battlers confirms that the Prime Minister has failed the families who have put their faith in him. This is a budget that puts the market first, that puts the market ahead of families. It is a budget that looks at the childcare issue through the lens of how we can get more mothers into the paid workforce. Instead, we should be focusing on what is best for our children and what is the best we can do for all parents so they have genuine choice about whether to stay at home or enter the paid workforce.
Let us turn to petrol, an issue the government has turned its back on, despite the fact that soaring petrol prices are crippling Australian families. Only this week, a survey of more than 5,000 families revealed that one in every three families declared high petrol prices as their main challenge when trying to make ends meet. For a year and a half Family First has been calling on the government to cut petrol tax by 10c a litre, which the Prime Minister yesterday said would cost $2.8 billion. The government’s stubborn refusal to cut petrol tax again shows how out of touch it is with families in the outer suburbs and in regional Australia who are today paying up to $1.40 a litre for petrol. Family First will continue its campaign, because cutting petrol tax is affordable and commonsense, because it provides real relief to families and small businesses and because it takes pressure off inflation and interest rates.
Now consider the much debated childcare issue. The Treasurer trumpets how the focus of the government’s childcare policy is to get mothers back into the paid workforce. ‘It is very important to encourage mothers back into the workforce,’ he said. Not only does this remark devalue the role of stay-at-home parents, who are very much part of Australia’s workforce, albeit not paid; it is revealing that the government’s No. 1 focus is on serving the needs of the market, as opposed to serving the needs of our kids. The key question is not ‘How can we get more mothers back into the workforce?’ but ‘What is in the best interests of our children?’
Family First supports parents returning to work if that is what they want to do, but childcare policies must be driven by the interests of children, not of adults. We need childcare policies that are family friendly, not market friendly. While the government has provided more money for child care, it has failed to reform a flawed system that benefits only parents who opt to send their children to institutional child care.
Family First regrets that a government that claims to be pro family still refuses to give families real choice by giving all families the same funding, even if they do not opt for institutional child care. It is a fact that many Australian parents prefer to look after their own children, particularly when they are young, or to entrust their child to a family member or friend in a home environment rather than to a childcare centre.
Parents who send their children to childcare centres can claim childcare benefits of up to $7,500 per child per year, while also pocketing up to $4,000 per child per year in childcare tax rebate. But if parents prefer that other people look after their children in a family home—say, grandparents, the next-door neighbour, a close relative or a friend—they can only claim up to about $1,300 per child per year and they are denied any childcare tax rebate. It is a big difference—a huge difference, in fact. Enrol your child in a market-friendly childcare centre and you can line up to claim your financial bonuses, but bypass the commercial option and have your child cared for by a friend or a grandparent in a family home and you will miss out. The government is providing a clear financial signal as to where its priorities lie: for the Howard government, the market always comes first.
It is also fascinating how the government’s childcare system is so focused on helping middle- to high-income professional couples, certainly not the Howard battlers. How many Howard battlers can really afford to pay large out-of-pocket expenses on child care in the first place to get the rebate? The childcare tax rebate assumes families can afford to pay these expensive out-of-pocket childcare expenses up-front. To claim the maximum $4,000 rebate, parents would have to be spending about $12,000 a year in out-of-pocket expenses. Most families that my wife, Sue, and I know would struggle to find just $500 for out-of-pocket expenses. How many Howard battlers can afford that sort of money?
Let us turn to other aspects of the budget. Family First welcomes the additional funding to fight illicit drugs but is disappointed there is no extra funding to tackle the $7.6 billion alcohol toll. Australia has a culture of binge drinking, and alcohol is second only to tobacco as a preventable cause of death and hospitalisation in Australia. Furthermore, 40 per cent of police resources are tied up in alcohol related problems. Australia has tackled the road toll, the drug toll and the tobacco toll. We are well overdue on tackling our alcohol toll.
Also, Family First believes the government missed opportunities to genuinely help the Howard battlers by lifting the tax-free threshold for all taxpayers from $6,000 to $8,000 this year, rising to $13,000—equivalent to subsistence income—in future years as the budget allows. Family First regrets that the government did not provide a further increase in the tax-free threshold of $1,000 for each dependent child.
Finally, Family First condemns the government for failing to provide any budget money to upgrade the Princes Highway, ignoring the greatest need of families in south-west Victoria. The budget listed the Geelong bypass, the Calder Highway and the Pakenham bypass for funding, which is welcome, but did not allocate one cent to the Princes Highway. It is ludicrous that the main route from Melbourne to south-west Victoria and South Australia, which provides trade, transport and tourism, is not considered a road of national significance.
This budget is an attempt to buy votes but a budget of missed opportunities for the Howard battlers.
Debate (on motion by Senator Colbeck) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,37,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-05-10,"—I stand tonight to acknowledge Motor Neurone Disease Awareness Week and to pay tribute to the 1,400-odd Australians who have motor neurone disease. Motor neurone disease is a rapidly progressive and fatal disease that can affect any adult at any time. The cause of motor neurone disease is unknown. There is no known cure. Tonight I want to pay tribute to the Australians with motor neurone disease, the families and carers of those people with motor neurone disease and the various motor neurone disease associations in the various states and territories of our great country.
In doing so, I would like to place on the record that my father had motor neurone disease and my family has for many years been involved in various associations, particularly and specifically the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Tasmania, of which I was president for a number of years, and I was also on the national board of the Motor Neurone Disease Association.
As I said, I want to pay tribute to those with this disease and their families and carers. In doing so I would like to outline to the Senate and place on the record some of the attributes of the disease and highlight some of the challenges that the families and carers of people with motor neurone disease and, indeed, the people with motor neurone disease have in Australia and around the world.
The life expectancy for most people with MND is just two to five years. Around half will die within 14 months of diagnosis. The incidence is the number of new cases of MND each year. There is no accurate measure of the incidence of MND in Australia, but there is an estimate that it is one in 40,000 or 2.44 in 100,000. The prevalence is the number of people who are living with MND. The prevalence of MND is approximately one in 15,000 people or seven per 100,000. As I said, there are currently an estimated 1,400 people living in Australia with MND.
In short and in summary, every day in Australia someone dies with motor neurone disease and another person is diagnosed with that same disease. In 2004-05, 507 people died with MND. In 2005-06, 445 newly diagnosed people registered with the MND associations. World figures say that there is an incidence of around two per 100,000 and a prevalence of six per 100,000. That is as at 2005.
MND occurs in all countries, usually in people over the age of 40, and more often in men than in women. But there are cases of younger people being affected. The peak ages of onset are in the 50s and 60s. MND leaves people unable to walk, talk or feed themselves, but the intellect and the senses usually remain unaffected. People with MND can still think and feel, but their muscles refuse to work. The senses, intellect and memory are generally not affected.
Motor neurone disease is the name given to a group of related diseases affecting the motor neurones or nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. As the motor neurones gradually die, the muscles stop working. Motor neurones are nerve cells that control the movement of voluntary muscles—that is, muscles that are under conscious control. These include all of the muscles of the trunk and limbs and those of speech, swallowing and breathing. So you can understand the challenges facing people with motor neurone disease and the difficulties that lie ahead of them following diagnosis.
MND is a progressive, degenerative disease of the motor system occurring primarily in middle age and causing muscle weakness and wasting. With no nerves to activate them the muscles gradually weaken and waste, and paralysis ensues. Weakness is often seen first in the hands or the feet. The first sign may be difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech. Muscle twitching and/or cramps may also occur.
There are three clinically distinct forms. The first is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, as it is referred to in the United States. In the US it is also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease—Lou Gehrig was a famous baseball player. The second is progressive muscular atrophy and the third is progressive bulbar palsy. Some forms of MND are familial—that means they are inherited. In fact, in about 10 per cent of cases of people with MND that is the case. There is also a sporadic version and that is more common. That is the cause in 90 per cent of the cases of people with MND.
MND affects each person differently in respect of initial symptoms, rate, pattern of progression and survival time. There are no remissions. As I have indicated, the average survival time after diagnosis is two to three years or less, with a few people surviving five years or more. There is only one drug available currently in Australia and around the world. It is called Riluzole, sometimes called Rilutek. That drug has some measurable effect on MND, but its benefits are limited. It is the first effective treatment for people with MND and it can be prescribed by a neurologist or GP. It may extend a person’s survival time by an average of nine to 12 months and, indeed, slow the progression of the disease.
Progression of MND can be rapid, creating high levels of disability and consequent needs for support. The support needed includes assistance with feeding, communication, movement, transferring, toileting and daily activities along those lines. It certainly has a comprehensive impact on one’s life. A key feature of the disease is the speed of progression, which creates huge adjustment problems not only for the people with the disease but also for their families and carers. It causes a loss of independence, employment relationships, communication, social life and future plans. Only last week SBS ran a very interesting and moving story about a person with MND and his family and their fight and challenge to cope with the disease.
Unlike for cancer, heart disease and AIDS, there is little advice health promotions can give to reduce a person’s chances of being struck down by MND. It can strike anyone at any time. It is for this reason that groundbreaking research is being conducted around the world, particularly on some forms of stem cell treatment, and this has been heralded as the best chance of a cure.
MND was first described in 1869 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. Interestingly, the first motor neurone disease awareness campaign was launched on 23 March 1999, by the Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge, the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, as part of Motor Neurone Disease Awareness Week. Dr Wooldridge said that the new awareness campaign would help the community better understand how motor neurone disease affects those who have it and their families and carers.
In May last year Tony Abbott, the Minister for Health and Ageing, announced that the Australian government would provide $22 million over four years towards establishing a national adult stem cell research centre. He said that the funding would be dedicated to innovative research, particularly into Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and motor neurone disease.
I want to tonight pay tribute to the motor neurone disease associations around Australia, especially to Helen Sjardin-Howard, the national president, and to Carol Birks, the national executive director of the MND Association of Australia. I want to also pay tribute to Mavis Gallienne, a current board member and former president whom I worked with many years ago, and a tribute to Kevin Langdon, former president and currently patron of MND New South Wales.
The global awareness day is coming up on 21 June, and the national MND conference is being held in Perth on 19 June. I want to pay tribute to Bill Braithwaite and Tim Hynes, who are the current president and former president of the association in Tasmania. I want to pay tribute to my mother, Lady Sally Ferrall, who is patron of the association in Tasmania and demonstrated great courage and determination during a very difficult time when my dad had motor neurone disease over a three-year-period.
I pay tribute to Rod Harris, the chairman of the international ALS/MND association. It is a great credit that an Australian leads such an association. He is currently the executive director of MNDA in Victoria. I also pay tribute to Karen Brookes in Launceston, who has MND and is travelling to China soon for stem cell support. Finally, I pay tribute to my wife, Kate, who is a member of the state executive of the association in Tasmania. She is a speech pathologist and does so much work for the association and for people in Tasmania.
I should also mention Dr Paul Brock, who appeared here in Parliament House just last year on 21 June, International Motor Neurone Disease Awareness Day, and gave a tremendous address on the difficulties of living with motor neurone disease. I pay tribute to all those Australians with the disease and to the associations and their members, who support people with the disease, their families and their carers.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Motor Neurone Disease</title>,Adjournment,38,1
