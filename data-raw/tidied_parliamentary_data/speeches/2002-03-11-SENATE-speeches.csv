"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-11,"—I wish to speak briefly to this motion to change the coalition's membership of the so-called `children overboard' inquiry, which also includes an investigation into the Pacific solution, I hasten to remind people. I certainly will not be opposing this motion. The government has the right to choose its representatives on a committee in the same way as any other party in this place. I note with sadness the departure of the three previous coalition members, who served the committee well in their brief 30-minute attendance at one meeting. They were people who had a background in the broader issues, and I think they would have contributed well. But I am sure that Senator Mason, Senator Brandis and Senator Heffernan also have lots of intellectual capacity to bring to the committee's deliberations. 
I think it is worth noting that one of the members, Senator Heffernan, is a parliamentary secretary—a parliamentary secretary to the cabinet, for that matter. Whilst it is not unprecedented for parliamentary secretaries to serve on committees, and there is nothing in the rules of the Senate to prevent it happening, I think it is worth drawing that to the attention of the Senate. I do not know how frequently Senator Heffernan has served on committees before.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—This is his first time, is it? There is a first time for everything. I am sure he will perform well, nonetheless. Page 395 of the most recent edition of Odgers' mentions that parliamentary secretaries serve:
... only occasionally. Their presence on committees could give rise to questions of conflict of interest or bias ... for example, where committees are inquiring into actions of government for which ministers and parliamentary secretaries, as members of the executive government, are individually or collectively responsible. 
Given that this committee is inquiring very specifically into the involvement of the Prime Minister, let alone other senior members of cabinet, and that the parliamentary secretary in question is the Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet, I think there are legitimate questions to be raised in that regard. It is not impugning the motives of Senator Heffernan, I hasten to add, but I think it is worth noting the potential issue of a conflict of interest. This is the subject of standing order 27(5), which provides: 
A senator shall not sit on a committee if the senator has a conflict of interest in relation to the inquiry of the committee.
The fact that we will have a member of the committee who is also Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet and, I understand, is able to sit in the cabinet raises some issues which are worth noting. I do not indicate that we are opposing the motion, but it is appropriate to note those things in terms of monitoring the ongoing conduct of the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Membership</title>,Committees,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-11,"—I would like to add to what Senator Bartlett had to say. Not only should we try to have committees above politics—we all know that we are human and it is difficult to achieve that aim—but also we should be seen to do so. The government's changing of the committee membership at this time makes it very political indeed. You cannot get away from that. It is a directive, on the face of it, from the Prime Minister's office, at least from cabinet, and it is an interference in the usual running of the Senate. I do not think that it should pass without me saying, as a senator, that I object to that. The Senate needs to take very careful note of it. 
We should see what moves can be made by the Senate to protect us from interference from the executive. This is interference from the executive in an important committee which, no doubt, will be looking at the behaviour of the executive. There is no higher task for the Senate than to act as a public watchdog on the behaviour of the executive at a time when, more and more, parliamentary duties are usurped by the minority—outside the parliament, behind closed doors in the cabinet room. It is a very serious departure from the appearance at least of fair representation on a committee and of people going without any prejudice to the committee. 
It is abundantly clear that a political decision has been made to influence a Senate committee, and the public will see it that way. I object to that and the Senate should think carefully about it. If it manifests itself in the outcome of the committee's deliberations, all the worse. It is up to the individual members who are on the committee to stand up now, if they want to, and explain why they withdrew or why they accepted the appointment to this committee and what the process was. Let the Senate at least be acquainted with the process so that we can have this appearance of prejudice taken away. If there is some other reason, it is for the government to give us that other reason. Otherwise, there is a stench in this process, and I do not say that without thinking about it. It is not right; it is just not right.
—They have a lot to hide.
—The Senate deserves an explanation and I expect that from the government now.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Membership</title>,Committees,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-11,"—This is the first time I have witnessed a debate about membership of a committee, but I welcome the debate. It is interesting to note that, either by their interventions in the debate or by their interjections—referring to Senator Conroy's interjections—they have some objection to Senator Heffernan being put on a committee. I remind the Senate that I was a member of the Senate references committee—it might have been a legislation committee—that investigated the Natural Heritage Trust. Senator Brown may even recall this. At the time I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and I recall that I spoke to the Clerk of the Senate and discussed the issue of a potential conflict between my role as a member of the executive and membership of the Senate. The answer—and I do not put words into Mr Evans' mouth; I am not actually talking about the answer that the Clerk gave me—is that it is quite clear that a parliamentary secretary may serve on a Senate committee. At that time, no-one raised objections to me serving on that committee. In retrospect, the fact that I was a member of the ministry and that I had responsibility for the department that was, in part, responsible for the implementation of the Natural Heritage Trust was, in fact, of assistance to that committee.  
The Labor Party is trying to condemn the membership of the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, which is an incredibly focused political exercise. It is something which has been generated by the Labor Party, who are obviously very keen to try to get up the argument that somehow they were robbed—that once again they nearly won the election but all of a sudden, due to some sort of trick, they were robbed. It was not Mr Beazley's incompetence; it was not the fact that they tried to recycle most of the Keating and Hawke ministry like an old car at a second-hand car yard, knocking out a few dents and giving it a spray job and saying, `Here's new Labor'—and you have Peter Cook in it, Laurie Brereton and even Kim Beazley who sat in all of the Hawke and Keating cabinets—`here's the third way.' 
It does not suit the Labor Party to admit the fact that the Australian people voted for the coalition with an increased majority. Instead of looking inside their own ranks and saying, `What can we do to make ourselves relevant again to the political debate in Australia?' they would rather look backwards and say, `We were robbed,' and try to blame everybody else but themselves. Instead of getting on with reforming the Labor Party and trying to make themselves relevant again, instead of reforming the stupid 60-40 rule—where the trade union movement has all of the votes and all of the proxies within the Labor movement, determining all the preselections for people like the senators opposite—and instead of getting on with the real job, they would rather say, `We were robbed.'
So what do they do? Instead of playing the game, instead of playing the ball, they play the man—and they want to pick on Senator Heffernan. Why do they do that? Because he is a very effective senator who is prepared to shine the light on the hypocrisy in the Labor Party. Can I suggest to the Australian Labor Party, to Senator Brown and to the Australian Democrats that they let Senator Heffernan perform his duties as a senator before this place—do not pick on him, focus on the issues. If you want to set up a witch hunt, you can choose who you put on it but do not give us advice on who we put on it. 
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Membership</title>,Committees,2,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-03-11,"—We return again to the question of the Regional Forest Agreement, which threatened to raise its ugly head towards the end of the last sitting prior to the election. It was made clear then that both the government and opposition were keen to pursue it and pass it in the New Year and, regrettably, that is likely to happen in the coming days, if not today. But I want to note particularly that when His Excellency Dr Hollingworth officially opened parliament only a matter of weeks ago, he said in his address to the Senate and to senators and members assembled here that one of the things that the third Howard Ministry was keen to do was to address the issue of salinity. I was struck at the time that, at that very moment, at the opening of parliament, when the government was announcing its keenness to address salinity, it was also ensuring that it wanted to progress and pass legislation which significantly contributes to it—that is, the destruction of our native and old-growth forests. 
I think salinity is set to be one of the most devastating problems that rural and regional areas around Australia have ever encountered. While the problem may itself be mostly in these regional areas, the effects of salinity and of subsequent soil degradation— either directly or indirectly related to it— affect all of us. If left unaddressed, salinity affected areas in the south and western regions of Australia—that is, excluding Queensland—will increase from 5.7 million hectares to a staggering estimated 17 million hectares within the next 50 years. In my home state of Western Australia, some 630,000 hectares is currently salt affected. At this rate, it is set to rise to around two million hectares over the next 50 years. This means that, in time, more than one-third of my home state's wheatbelt area will be salt affected.  
The federal government has acknowledged this situation by including salinity control as an election issue. A recent parliamentary brief on combating salinity confirms that policies aimed at salinity need to be comprehensive and address other degradation issues such as soil erosion, water quality and biodiversity loss, in concert with salinity. In part, this brief says:
When salt stored in soils and/or ground water is mobilised by extra water provided by human activities such as land clearing or irrigation, the resulting rising water tables can bring the salt to the surface causing land salinisation or be discharged into water courses raising river salinities.
The briefing goes on:
Land clearing has had a major impact on dryland salinity. Controls on land clearing are seen as a mechanism to not only protect biodiversity but to prevent the spread of dryland salinity.
The Commonwealth government has obviously realised this and, in response, has called on the Queensland government to implement land clearing controls. Yet, despite this clear and well documented connection between land clearing, soil degradation and salinity, the very first bill that the Commonwealth introduces into the new parliament is this one, designed clearly to commit our native forests to logging. In 1998, the West Australian state government, then under the reign of Premier Richard Court, confirmed that both the Department of Conservation and Land Management, CALM, and the water authority, `had clearly established, by their respective research, that there was a relationship between logging and salinity in the forests of the south-west of the state.' In 1999, a standing committee report on ecologically sustainable development showed that the Environmental Protection Authority, EPA, found:
...the WA community was worried about the increased intensity of harvesting in the jarrah-marri forest because of the potential salinity impacts.
The report goes on to note that the EPA identified the major issue of concern from over 4,000 submissions on the issue was:
... increased intensity of harvesting in the jarrah-marri forest with potential salinity and other impacts. 
The findings of this report, in the chapter relating specifically to salinity, provide clear reasons why the Commonwealth is negligent in leaving the decisions relating to forest management to the states. Among the findings is the clear disregard by the WA state government of EPA recommendations and assessments about logging practices in salt risk zones, and clear conflicts of interest between CALM in conservation and resource utilisation. Yet, instead of immediately stopping wood chipping in all native forests and calling for an immediate end to logging in old-growth and high conservation value native forests, the Commonwealth government has again introduced the Regional Forest Agreement which guarantees access to native forests for logging, while protecting specific areas of wilderness and old growth forests in reserves.
I take this opportunity to remind the Senate of the Democrats dissenting report coming out of the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into the RFA Bill 1998. We said:
1. The RFA process fails to resolve one of the most long running and contentious issues facing the nation
2. The RFA process fails to deliver on jobs for impoverished and vulnerable rural areas
3. The RFA process unfairly discriminates against the plantation industry
4. The RFA process will destroy many areas of native forests including old growth areas and fails to protect Australia's biodiversity contrary to an international agreement
5. The RFA process discriminates unfairly against other important cultural values and social and economic benefits provided for by native forest areas
6. The RFA process will be mostly controlled by State governments who have vested or financial short term interests in the outcomes thereby leading to positions of conflict of interest
The RFA process raises constitutional issues and poses potential legal and financial difficulties on the Commonwealth and the taxpayer.  
That situation remains unchanged, as does the Democrats resolve to oppose this bill. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you may be aware, previous Premier Richard Court's coalition government lost the last election in my home state, and the Labor Party based its entire campaign around the protection and preservation of old-growth forests if it won government—and it did win government. But, despite the state Labor Party winning on that promise of ending logging in old-growth forests, we now find that the federal Labor Party is pledging its support to the Howard government's RFA legislation, which will result in massive subsidies to logging companies which destroy Australia's old-growth forests. 
If this legislation is successful here in this place, it will mean that the state RFAs will be legally binding. This raises serious questions about the process through which the state RFAs have been devised. For example, only after the Western Australian RFA was signed by all parties was it revealed that one-third of the reserve system—which, of course, was meant to be old-growth and high conservation value forests—comprised rubbish tips, gravel pits, weeds, a water storage tank and a cleared catchment area. The then Court government's pre-RFA hard-sell advertising campaign claimed that the agreement would protect more than a million hectares of forests from logging—but, of course, there would be no need to log sand dunes, swamps and rocky outcrops. One area described as old-growth forest was later revealed to be 700 hectares of cleared farmland on Agriculture WA's Mount Barker research station. This grossly inadequate forest reserve system only increased public concerns over logging of our native forests and served to further undermine public confidence in the entire RFA process.
This bill is nothing more, I think, than a ticket for the Commonwealth to abdicate its responsibility to the states for the care and protection of our old-growth and native forests. Western Australia's RFA bears witness to the appalling situation that can arise when hard fought-for environmental safeguards are ignored. Parliament cannot continue to ignore public opinion by passing this bill. RFAs are designed to seal the fate of forests for some 20 years. Given how precious little old-growth forest is left, it is amazing that such a far-reaching and important environmental decision can be taken so flippantly. The future of the industry, of the forests and of future generations deserve a much more carefully considered approach. But, when it comes to forests, the government moves in mysterious ways. Mr Wilson Tuckey, until recently minister for forests, has steadfastly refused to release Commonwealth funding that has been specifically set aside for the restructuring of timber towns in Western Australia. Of the $15 million that has been earmarked for the restructuring of WA timber towns, only $136,000 has thus far been spent—and this is outrageous.
Our old-growth forests are worth much more to the community, to the state, to the country and, indeed, to the world if they are left standing. The spectacle of an ancient forest far outweighs the short-term financial gain of letting it go and cutting it down. In closing I would like to quote from a memo received today—I think it was sent to all parliamentarians, including me—from the Wilderness Society. In it they have summarised in 10-point fashion the key reasons, with which I concur, why this legislation should be opposed. The Wilderness Society argues, and the Democrats agree that:
1. Forest types identified under Tasmanian RFA as requiring 100 per cent reservation are being cleared for plantation establishment.
2. Areas in Victoria and Tasmania identified as being part of the RFA forest reserve system have not been reserved and have instead been logged. This is grounds for the Commonwealth to terminate an RFA.
3. The Tasmanian RFA is being subverted to allow the highest proportional rate of land clearing in Australia, using Commonwealth money! Up to 640,000 hectares of native forest may be permanently cleared in Tasmania under arrangements which directly subvert the intention of the RFA.
4. The RFAs have not provided the promised job security, hundreds of jobs have been lost from this unsustainable industry.
5. In Victoria and Tasmania the total hectares logged and total hectares clearfelled has increased each year following the signing of the RFAs. These increases have never been subjected to any form of environmental assessment. Europe has abandoned clearfelling on the grounds that it is unsustainable and the practice is being phased out in North America for the same reason. 
6. Victoria, NSW and Tasmania continue to violate the pre-cautionary principle by logging irreplaceable old growth forests.
7. Export woodchip production has increased by 30%.
8. Post RFA projects which would further increase the amount of forest logged each year (for charcoal production and electricity generation) are exempt from environmental assessment.
9. The native forest logging industry is the only industry in Australia exempt from Commonwealth environmental requirements (the EPBC Act). This is yet another example of the anticompetitive arrangements available to this cosseted industry to the disadvantage of the largely private sector reafforestation and plantation based alternatives.
10. The RFA Bill does not provide the native forest logging industry with resource security. Victoria is poised to dramatically reduce the amount of sawlogs available to the logging industry because levels approved by the Commonwealth under five Victorian RFAs have recently been found to be unsustainable.
In closing, I reiterate the Australian Democrats vehement objection to any logging of old growth forests and our great passion for preserving them rather than destroying them. We oppose this legislation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-03-11,"—In rising to speak to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002, I believe there are certain areas that we should look at very closely. One is the need for an ongoing forest industry and another is the improved forest management practices that are carried out today. We need to look at the reserves being set aside and at promoting plantations of both softwood and hardwood, and we need to look at the social impacts of this vehement attack to shut down the forestry industry.
Ever since Australia was settled by Europeans, timber has been of vital importance to the economic wellbeing of this country. From the days of early inhabitation, principally along the eastern seaboard, hardwoods and softwoods have played an important part in the very existence of both European and indigenous people. Timber was used for shelter, buildings, stock fencing, firewood, shipbuilding and transport. Since then not a lot has changed. The utilisation of a renewable resource, which has been doing just that—renewing itself—ever since Europeans came to this country, continues today. 
The terminology `old growth' is something of a misnomer inasmuch as forest experts have for the last 20 years claimed there is almost no old-growth forest remaining in Australia, and particularly in Queensland. It is an indisputable fact that most of our crown forest has been cut at some time. Anecdotal evidence compiled over the last 30 years suggests that this figure could be as high as 90 per cent. So of the areas being claimed as old growth, possibly 90 per cent of those have already been cut. Such is the phenomenal regrowth ability of both wet and dry sclerophyll and, of course, rainforest, particularly after the forest floor and the canopy has been disturbed, that this scenario applies to almost all areas of supervised, selective cutting of hardwood and softwood in native forests. 
Old-growth should refer only to mature species at the end of their useful growing period whose place in the forest could be removed to make way for younger and more vigorous understorey. Scientific data clearly shows mature trees, such as those referred to as `old-growth', have a much lower carbon dioxide conversion rate than that of a vigorous understorey—that is, the new forest coming through. On the fauna habitat side, trees that are ready to harvest do not provide any suitable refuge or habitation for fauna. I will just clarify that by saying that a tree suitable for logging, by nature, cannot have any hollows in it, any immaturities, twists and so on. These, the unwanted species that could be twisted, bent, hollowed or deformed, are then left for habitat for fauna.
The need for an ongoing forest industry is of great importance to the entire economic fabric of Australia. In the affected centres, too many regional people have too much invested by way of housing, property, education, sport, cottage industries and medical facilities—to name but a few. We are talking of a great social upheaval not seen before throughout Australia—other than the severe dislocation of industries and people caused by the needless World Heritage listings a decade ago. The present level of harvest from private and crown reserves should be maintained as long as the reserves can sustain the yield, especially in the production of high-value products. If estimates cannot guarantee that the present yield can be sustained, more old-growth hardwood areas should be opened for selective logging, remembering that most of these areas have been previously cut. This may be the only way to uphold the Native Forestry Policy Statement signed by both the Queensland and Commonwealth governments committing to an ongoing native forest industry. Other states that have signed RFAs have an ongoing native forest industry undergoing sustainable harvest, so clearly there are no scientifically justifiable reasons for closing down native forests. 
Conversely, there is much scientific evidence showing the need to continue the native forest industry. Queensland's native forest management has generally been regarded by other states and independent foresters as quite good, with some industry people claiming it is above average. Certainly this researcher has found that to be the case. However, there is only so much one can do with the resources at hand. In the case of thinning, burning, road building, crowning, weed control, feral animal control and, above all, fire control, departmental employees and, in some cases, contractors, presently cannot fulfil their obligations as good neighbours. This is not necessarily caused by a lack of manpower or resources but by the sheer size of the areas involved, which defy good management by anything other than an army of workers, which then makes the exercise unviable. 
For instance, the native forest areas stretching from Kalpowar north of Monto to Mount Rainbow east of Biloela is about 100 kilometres long and up to 40 kilometres wide. Admittedly, some of this vast area contains pastoral leases and freehold grazing property, but the bulk is under forestry control. This is far too much country for the existing crew to maintain. When a fire starts at either end there is virtually no hope of controlling it. We only have to look at the recent episodes in New South Wales to see the dangers and the outcomes of not having cool trash reduction. In this area the terrain is extremely rough and in most cases inaccessible by vehicle. It should be noted a bomber aircraft crashed in there in 1943 and was not discovered until 1994. This area has been logged several times during the past 50 years and part of it has now been declared a national park. The area has been closed to logging for three years, in spite of large reserves of Sydney gum, spotted gum and red gum still being available. The loggers and natural regeneration have done such a good job up until now that the Parks and Wildlife Service have declared it a park—and that is stumps and all. Fortunately the burning practices of the forestry department have in most cases maintained the native forest, leaving it in good shape. This is not the case throughout Queensland in the Parks and Wildlife Service, whose burning practices are totally deficient.
Historically, this continent has been shaped by the Aboriginal firestick, some say for 4½ thousand years. Perusal of James Cook's log and diary detailing his observations along the eastern seaboard in 1770 give an insight into what our coastline and hinterland looked like to our early explorers. Cook said the countryside was `open and park like' where along the entire coast he saw intermittent smoke rising from burning grasslands. There were no great areas of rainforest, but small areas of `dense thicket' providing shelter for native fauna. The Aborigines farmed and harvested marsupials for their existence, using fire to burn old grass, thus making way for green grass, which naturally attracted feeding marsupials. Consequently, as pointed out by Leichhardt and Mitchell, our greatest inland explorers, the Aborigines burnt grassland where it would carry a light fire, never leaving huge areas of dense, dry grass which would cause total destruction of forestry species. As the animals moved from burn to burn, the Aborigines would follow. Thus the forest floor was kept clean of woody undergrowth, encouraging eucalypt seedlings to thrive and grow. This husbandry is the basis of our eucalypt forests today. Many naturalists and historians have concluded the tree cover over eastern Australia is now much more extensive than when Cook saw it in 1770. 
Proper management practices, which include logging, not only would provide a better environmental outcome for our forests but would provide a greater supply of sawlog materials. In the government's proposed management system there appears scant mention of the potential of hardwood plantation development opportunities. Graziers could better utilise parts of their holdings and supplement their incomes by planting hardwood species. Although graziers have proved to be responsible land-holders in a general sense, there exist areas of varying types of land degradation not suitable for grazing due to loss of topsoil through wind or water erosion or prolonged drought combined with short-term overgrazing by introduced, non-native animals. Incentives in the form of 150 per cent recovery taxation rebates and better security of tenure without the baggage of land claims could provide for hardwood reafforestation projects on pastoral land.
The vexed issue of the people versus large corporations has come into play: hence the RFA document. It seems that yet another facet of government owned resources has become a political football with the multinationals trying to kick the goals. The motives of the large timber companies in according short-term compensation rather than supporting the initiatives for long-term viability of the industry raise a number of questions. Do the large companies have a community conscience? Their main thrust seems to be in their withdrawal to cities, supporting the concept of pine plantations. The argument about the suitability of hardwood over softwood for structural purposes does not need any explanation.
Can we expect one of the last public resources, forests, the property and the heritage of all Australians, to be turned over to the multinationals? After all, the Queensland government has handed over management of one of the state's major water catchment areas to a private consortium for distribution to irrigation farms. The bottom line in this exercise is that the people lose sovereignty and control over a vital resource, in that case water, which will be traded as a farming commodity—but at what price? In all, a lot of people will be affected. Already rural Australia has one of the highest suicide rates in the Western world, compounded by loss of industry, loss of meaningful work and above all loss of self-esteem in the individual.
In passing this bill, we need to look at opening up more old-growth forests for selective logging sufficient to maintain the present output on a 30-year plan and to assure long-term security of investment. We need to plant sufficient quick growing species of hardwood to sustain what is now being taken out. We need to investigate multiple-use systems in all suitable areas of forestry and national parks incorporating the abovementioned criteria. We need to investigate cottage type industries which can operate in conjunction with continued logging. Activities could include processing waste shapes, sizes and unsuitable species, as well as mill and forest waste; manufacturing laminated veneer, beams and trusses; and value adding kiln-dried finger jointed boards and a wide range of high-value charcoal and other carbon products. Using the high volume of mill waste, charcoal products could be used as an additional clean fuel for power production. We need to train foresters in proper hazard reduction burning and good-neighbour policies. And we most definitely need to maintain cattle grazing and encourage bee-keeping in forestry reserves. One Nation will be supporting the government's RFA Bill and we will be looking to the government to implement some of the areas that I have outlined.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Watson, Senator John",LP,2002-03-11,"—The debate on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 is quickly taking on a sense of repeated deja vu—I get the feeling that we have seen this all before. I am seriously concerned that this process is now becoming a matter of repetition ad nauseam. I am sure that the Tasmanian forest industry has no wish to have this matter extended even further and, given the degree to which many of the legitimate amendments from the Labor Party have actually now been incorporated into this new bill, it would indeed be tedious—in fact, very serious—to see an opposition continuing to delay the passage of this bill. The bill does provide certainty—a certainty which is necessary for long-term investment in the forest industry. 
As the economics editor of the Australian, Alan Wood, noted in an article a couple of weeks ago, the Tasmanian economy is badly affected by excessive regulation, particularly of the environment. He noted that this is stifling investment and stifling growth. Tasmania has seen its economic development, especially in areas associated with the environment and resources, used as a plaything of the federal government for the past two decades, at terrible loss to Tasmania and to Tasmanians. Too often we have seen Tasmanian forestry investments and Tasmanian forestry jobs put in jeopardy because of the power play of politics. Once again, we see forest based industries seeking to make bold and imaginative investments in Tasmania in the belief that this RFA Bill will proceed. Further delays will only compound the frustration of industry with their inability to ensure that investments in this area can be pursued with reasonable commercial risk, not unreasonable political risks.
This bill is necessary to demonstrate that the Commonwealth is committed to sustainable forest management and resource security. The RFA process has been supported by all major political parties and all state and federal governments. While it took the coalition government to get on with completing the RFA agreements in the late 1990s, the process has been further supported by governments on both sides for a decade. This decision has been supported by extensive Commonwealth funding of industry adjustments to the new practices. So this government—our coalition government—has eased the transition instead of simply letting industry bear the entire burden of the new regulatory regime. The industry must be able to rely on the RFA process that enables a scientific approach based on scientific, environmental and cultural data and not on short-term political considerations. Tasmania has perhaps the most advanced forestry practices in the world—listening to this debate one would tend to question that—but, unfortunately, the misrepresentation by some speakers in this debate has contributed much to the misunderstanding about a vital industry to Australia but particularly to my state of Tasmania. 
I think it is also a worry that the Senate continues to intrude on traditional areas of state responsibility. Unless this legislation is passed, Tasmania's forest industry will again be sold short and investors will be unwilling to risk their capital due to insufficient protection of their rights. The regional forest agreement concluded between the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the then Liberal Premier of Tasmania, Hon. Tony Rundle, in 1997 provided a base on which the Tasmanian forestry industry could plan its future with greater security and certainty than ever before. It followed two decades of protests and lobbying by a noisy minority of conservationists, mainly political radicals, that created an environment of insecurity for this industry, which for so long had been the backbone of the Tasmanian economy.
The insecurity led to a situation where the forestry industry was loath to commit to long-term investments in a resource which was potentially a political football and which might be snatched away from them at short notice—at the whim of politicians seeking to impress groups such as Green sympathisers whose voting preferences could change governments. Even within Tasmania, the system of proportional representation used in state elections favours results leading to governments with small majorities, or to minority governments, unable to make bold and positive decisions needed to promote progress. 
The RFA in 1997 provided a legislative framework which ensured access to an ongoing resource for a productive forest products industry, while also protecting the most important natural heritage areas of Tasmania. The agreement followed an exhaustive period of community consultation, during which all sides of the debate were able to provide detailed input and have their views considered. Today, the forestry sector contributes about $1.2 billion in value to the Tasmanian economy—the second largest manufacturing industry in the state. More than 8,000 Tasmanians are employed in forest industries, with the Launceston based Gunns the largest private employer. Gunns produces timber, value added timber products and building products. It is Australia's largest producer of sliced veneers. Gunns and other companies are also active in investing in the Tasmanian industry, but they rely on the additional security provided by this bill to ensure their investors and workers are not held to ransom by unwarranted interference with the RFA at some future date. 
For some time, unfortunately, campaigns have been conducted or coordinated by anti-industry groups such as the Wilderness Society, attempting to discredit the forest industry and those companies operating within the industry. These campaigns, including those operating under the questionable banner of ethical shareholding campaigns, have also involved dissemination of misinformation and direct targeting of both private and institutional shareholders. These campaigns have included phone calls and correspondence to shareholders to elicit support to oppose a company's operation, direct approaches aimed at undermining the credibility of the industry and the company with institutional investors, attempts to undermine relationships with financiers and also attempts to undermine customer relationships.
While the campaigns to date have failed, it is inappropriate and unreasonable that forestry companies are required to operate in such an environment and quite ironic that parts of the campaign are being undertaken under the banner of ethical shareholding interests. While forestry companies targeted by these campaigns will continue to address such programs appropriately, it is important that, where possible, government clearly indicates its support for industries and businesses operating legitimately as well as ethically. Recently in Tasmania, contractors' plans have been vandalised, costing ten of thousands of dollars. This situation is becoming a major problem.
Passing this bill will state clearly to the investing community that forestry is an industry and that it is conducted on a sustainable basis, within a framework of world class management practice. With 40 per cent of Tasmania's land area reserved—including 29 new areas of national parks and reserves actually created through the RFA process—the RFA provides a balanced framework within which the industry can move.
This bill seeks to consolidate through federal legislation the agreement needed to protect investment in the industry. This investment is essential, to protect current jobs and to grow more jobs with the creation of more value added processes. Private forestry owners are at a particular disadvantage at the moment. They gave a commitment which effectively passed land over to the scientists—in some cases, up to 40 per cent was set aside for prospective reserves. I know that Senator O'Brien has proposed amendments, and I trust that these are not going to be permitted to delay the passage of this bill. Unless this legislation is moved to a resolution, we will have another round of endless debate of the sort that we all know our colleague opposite, Senator Brown, consumes and thrives on. No-one could possibly seek that sort of torture at this time—I certainly hope not.
The industry is straining at the reins. It wants to progress and invest and provide value adding jobs. Tasmania seriously needs this outcome, and Tasmanians deserve our support in passing this bill without further unnecessary delay. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-11,"—The Greens will vehemently oppose this Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002, which is against the interests of the Australian people in terms of the environment, of employment and of the economy itself. There has been a very rigorous public debate on the matter, and the public knows where it stands. Since the 1980s, there has been no opinion poll on the matter of logging in our wild forests which has given it public backing. The unnecessary destruction of this great nation's forest heritage and wildlife in the pursuit of profit, when we have a two million-hectare plantation base to meet all our industrial as well as domestic wood needs, is an indictment of the power of the corporate sector over the two big parties. On the one hand, we have opinion polls showing between 70 and 90 per cent opposition to the chainsaws going into the wild forests of Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales and on the other we have over 90 per cent of the elected members of parliament voting for the chainsaws. 
—A majority in your household.
—Yes, it is true, Senator Tchen, that a majority in my household would oppose the chainsaws, but in this case my household is the Australian conservation movement, which is some 15 million Australians, if you look at those opinion polls. Think about that.
What the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 would do is, firstly, remove the power of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and/or the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, were the minister in that portfolio concerned about conservation, for the next 20 years. It is a move by parliament through this legislation, coming from the executive, to trammel the ability of ministers in the future to act in the public interest to protect this nation's heritage and, indeed, to protect the increasing numbers of jobs and small businesses dependent upon that heritage. Secondly, it is a move by parliament, if it passes, to remove parliamentary scrutiny of the prodigious amount of compensation going into the regional forest agreements out of the public purse—that is over $300 million of taxpayers' money going to industry so far—as well as scrutiny of the process of the regional forest agreements themselves. I will have a number of amendments before the committee stage, but they have been circulated for the Senate to look at now. Amongst those amendments is one which ensures that parliament does not give away, that the Senate does not give away, that right of scrutiny.
These regional forest agreements were signed between the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and several premiers of Australian states. What this legislation would do is to remove the right of parliament to view those regional forest agreements in the public interest. Talking of public interest, I think that is a matter that the Senate should take note of because, as I said, hundreds of millions of dollars as well as the environmental estate of this great nation are involved. We should be paying more attention to it and therefore, Mr Acting Deputy President, I call your attention to the state of the house. (Quorum formed)
I was explaining that the legislation effectively removes the right of parliament to scrutinise the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money which ends up effectively on the profit lines of the woodchip and logging corporations because it goes to providing the infrastructure that those companies need, at a time of global reduction in woodchip prices, to stay viable. The public pays the money to build the roads into the forests, to provide the extension through forestry commissions in the states to directions as to how the logging is to take place, and the overview and the failed policing of that process, and then the replantation of those forests. But, beyond that, the legislation would remove for the next 20 years the right of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives, to look at the destructive impact of the regional forest agreements on the environment and to be able to assess whether or not the environmental impulse of the legislation, which several big party senators have spoken about, is being adhered to. The legislation removes that right of the parliament. I will be moving an amendment to restore that right, and another amendment to make the environmental provisions of this legislation binding.
The environmental provisions in the regional forest agreements are not binding; the economic components are, but not the environmental components. This is anti-public legislation, supported by the coalition. One can understand that if one looks at the traditional role of the coalition in backing up the big corporate sector against public interest. But when it comes to the Labor Party it defies comprehension that it is supporting this legislation. I will be interested to see in the committee stage what the Labor Party will do about yet another amendment I will be bringing forward. In view of the key amendment in this legislation to give the woodchip and logging corporations compensation if they are prevented by Commonwealth action from sending the chainsaws, bulldozers and firebombers into parts of Australia's national and, indeed, World Heritage forests, that should be matched by clauses which guarantee that the corporations do the right thing as far as their employees are concerned. 
If you look at the pronouncement made by the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, when he came to Tasmania in 1997 with the regional forest agreement, you will see that it said 550 jobs would be created as a result of that agreement. In fact, 450 jobs have been shed. It is a net difference of over 900 jobs in total there, if you look at the 100 jobs that have been created. We see that the regional forest agreement is basically a job shedding process. What about those workers? They are duped—not only, sadly enough, by the industry, which cries `Jobs, jobs, jobs' as it is shedding them, but also by the CFMEU itself and by the Labor Party which backs it which says, `We are in this for jobs.' It overviews the continual shedding of jobs—thousands of jobs—even as the corporations pocket the hundreds of millions of dollars that this process gives to them.
I would have thought that Senator Harris would be alert to this because it is regional jobs that are being lost. It is not the jobs in the offices in downtown Launceston in terms of Gunns Pty Ltd. In fact, the men on the board of that company, the biggest woodchipper in the Southern Hemisphere, have voted themselves a pay increase to $500,000 per year for being directors since the regional forests agreements came into place. It would be interesting to trace how much of the compensation money, by a process of displacement several times removed, actually ends up going into the pockets of that board. It is a pretty invidious process which we should be examining as we go down the line—but which we cannot if parliamentary scrutiny is removed.
Where indeed is the CFMEU? This union—which tugs its forelock to the bosses of the woodchip industry and effectively does nothing as people are sacked in their hundreds, Senator Bishop, in places like Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales—does not set a foot off the kerb to defend those jobs. I think it is very important that the Labor Party take note of this. I will be speaking about the Labor Party's role—and I know you will be looking at this, Mr Acting Deputy President. If they support this legislation, it will restore some of my concern that the Labor Party have lost it as far as the workers are concerned. I do think that there ought to be more members of the Labor Party in here listening to my challenge over this legislation, so I draw your attention to the state of the house, Mr Acting Deputy President. (Quorum formed)
You will remember that before that long quorum call I was talking about the amendment the Greens will be putting forward which makes compensation payable to employees of logging companies. Indeed, the amendment says:
	(1)	Persons who are eligible to receive compensation in accordance with the provisions of an RFA—
that is, the companies—
		must compensate any employee or contractor engaged in RFA forestry operations whose employment or contract is terminated.
	(2)	The amount of compensation payable will include all entitlements, plus the amount of reasonable loss or damage sustained by reason of the termination.
	(3)	The State which is party to the RFA must establish a process for implementing this provision within six months of an RFA being entered into or of this legislation commencing, whichever is first.
Whatever else may be argued in here—and I will be interested to hear the position of the minister, as well as that of his Labor counterpart—you cannot say, on the one hand, that you are concerned about employees in the logging industry in rural Australia while saying, on the other hand, that you will compensate companies using taxpayers' money if they are required to protect trees but you will not compensate employees when the companies have free rein but continue to sack them. In the case of Gunns, for example, aggregation and driving their contractors morning, noon and night in the name of efficiency have led to the shedding of hundreds of jobs.
The newspapers in the last few days have been full of the busting of the Goolengook peaceful blockade in Victoria, which has been going for five years. I went down to that blockade at the outset, to look at the Goolengook forest myself because there had been a lot of publicity about it. I think I may be the only person in this place who is directly acquainted with what is going on there. 
—I have been there.
—I apologise. Senator Allison has been there, and possibly others of her colleagues have too. I do apologise, Senator Allison, but I would be interested to hear which Victorian members of the Labor or Liberal parties have been to Goolengook—very few, if any; I think probably none. The problem is that, if you do not see what is being destroyed, you do not feel for it or understand it. Certainly the Prime Minister has a studied ignorance of the forests of Australia; he will not go to them. So far, the Leader of the Opposition—his predecessor set the course for this—also resolutely refuses to go to the forests to have a look at what is being destroyed there. At Goolengook, you see magnificent ancient forest with a pristine river flowing through. Sections of rainforest intermingle with the eucalypts which dominate the ridges and the dry sections of the forests, and the whole of it has an extraordinary panoply of wildlife. At night, there are marsupials and bats. There are owls calling. In the morning, there are lyrebirds and a whole cacophony of other birds of the forest. Yet all this is earmarked for destruction, and when I went down there I got arrested and taken off in a paddy wagon to Orbost, simply for being with other citizens who have faced this and endured the same process. Then, when the courts looked at the matter, what did they find? Was it the protestors who were acting illegally? No, it was not; it was the loggers. They were logging a defined reserve under Victorian heritage protection legislation, and so the case was thrown out. But then what happened? The Kennett government put through legislation retrospectively, protecting the loggers' interests—not the environmental interests— and put these areas, which had been protected, into chainsaw zones. 
I ask this assembly: who in here can point to the change in the regional forest agreement that accompanied that unilateral action by the Victorian government? Is the minister going to defend that? It is not in the regional forest agreement process, and it has not been debated by this parliament, but 1,000 hectares of pristine forest, which were in the regional forest agreement, are being fed to the chainsaws. They moved in a mighty army of chainsaws and bulldozers today, with not a squeak from either the Minister for the Environment and Heritage or the shadow minister to say, `We will stop this process by the only countermeasure there is, which is action of the federal parliament, the other arbiter in the regional forest agreement.' So, not only is there no mechanism for defending what the RFA says it is defending—which is the prime forests—but, when the RFA is busted unilaterally by a state government, there is no federal action. Moreover, if the parliament were to pass this legislation, it would be seeking to bind its own hands against any action it might take over the next 20 years.
I have a very sensible amendment here which says that the environmental components of the regional forest agreements will be defended by the parliament. What is the minister going to say about that? Already the economic side is defended; what about the environmental component? The minister will get up on his feet, he will have a tirade and he will denounce the people, but he will not address the central concern about the environments of these forests, because he has not been there and because this legislation sells out the environment, the economic interests of the people of Australia and the employees. My amendment seeks to defend all three. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“That further consideration of this bill be deferred until Parliament has scrutinised:
	(a)	the five year reviews due for the East Gippsland and Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreements; and
	(b)	the report of a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into Forestry Tasmania, the Forest Practices Board and Private Forests Tasmania”. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-03-11,"—Like my Democrat colleagues, I will be opposing this RFA legislation. As we have seen many times in this chamber, the RFA agreement was supposed to give certainty to the timber industry, it was supposed to be environmentally sustainable and it was also supposed to be based on solid science. I must say that, even though Victoria's data is better than that of most other states, the developments in Victoria show us—in no uncertain terms over the last few weeks—that none of those objectives has been achieved. The agreement is clearly not giving certainty to the timber industry in Victoria.
A report released a couple of weeks ago recommends that, across the board, there should be a 30 per cent reduction in the amount of timber taken from our native forests. We have seen a time of unprecedented losses in timber worker jobs. We have also seen sawmills close down. The only winner out of all of this appears to have been the woodchippers, who continue to increase the amount of their take and the amount of woodchips that are exported. It is clear that everybody—except perhaps the woodchippers—has been conned in this whole process. Environmentally sensitive areas have had to be logged to satisfy timber contracts. That is certainly the position of the Victorian state government; it makes no bones about the fact that it was forced into this position because it could not sustain the contracts it had already signed. At every possible level the RFA system has not worked. (Quorum formed)
I think it is clear that the comprehensive regional assessments that were done some time ago were rushed, as was the RFA process itself. We know that very high levels of logging were locked in at that stage and that they are clearly unsustainable. Clear-fell logging in some parts of Victoria has dramatically reduced the amount of water available to cities such as Geelong, which depends significantly on the forests in the Otways for its water supply. That is not taken into account in our assessment of the sustainability of our forestry practices, but it is nonetheless a very great concern to residents of Geelong.
I will get back to my comments about the recent report which showed that a 30 per cent statewide cutback would be necessary to even begin to put logging onto a sustainable footing. It was recommended by the author of the report, Jerry Vanclay, Professor for Sustainable Forestry at Southern Cross University in New South Wales, that, in some areas, a cutback of up to 80 per cent of our logging take would be necessary. By way of a condition on those recommendations, he also says we have very little knowledge of exactly what level of sustainability our forests can provide and that our knowledge about forests is indeed scant. This is a matter which the Senate ought to be very concerned about because, as I said earlier, the RFA process was supposed to have been predicated on sound science—and it is clearly not.
The Wombat State Forest has been massively overlogged. Over the last 21 years, 80 per cent of it has been clear-fell logged or burned. Seven years ago, forestry in the Wombat employed 440 people; now that number is down to 70. Hundreds—maybe thousands—of jobs have been lost since the RFA system was set up. We know that 400 jobs were lost in Tasmania, according to the Marsden Jacob report. Every year since the signing of the RFAs, the total hectares logged and the total hectares clear-felled have increased without any sort of environmental assessment on that increase. What we do know is that woodchip exports have increased by 30 per cent. In 1999-2000, seven million tonnes of woodchips left Australia. Of course, all of them came out of our native forests. Old-growth forests in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania are still being logged, even though we know their biodiversity is absolutely irreplaceable. The Democrats intend to comment further in this second reading debate on national competition policy and the way in which our RFA system pays little regard to these questions of a level playing field and plantations versus native forests. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today relating to a grant to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.
We know from answers given by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives today and by the Minister for Health and Ageing in the Senate that all of the $5 million grant to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners will now go to the original programs and we know that the Prime Minister has foreshadowed withdrawing the grant to the College of General Practitioners.
The situation is this: the government clearly realises that this particular grant is a rort. But today, in the Senate, Minister Patterson has indicated that she really has very little knowledge of what is happening in her own portfolio. As recently as this morning Senator Patterson was justifying this grant to the College of General Practitioners on the basis that those grant moneys would have gone back to consolidated revenue if they had not gone in the form of a grant to the college. She also justified the grant on the basis that contracts were signed with the college—in other words, the government had contractual obligations that it could not break. What an inauspicious start for this minister to have to come into the Senate chamber in question time today and say that that advice that she was giving the Australian public was wrong and that the government now, recognising the difficulty of this situation, is going to take a different course of action. And so the government should, because the record is clear. On 27 September last year, Dr Wooldridge signed off a Commonwealth grant giving a lobbyist organisation, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, $5 million to construct a headquarters in the parliamentary triangle. One million dollars was directly siphoned away from asthma sufferers. Four million dollars was filched from the $14.5 million medical specialist outreach program for rural health.
When it came to other health programs in the 2001 financial year, such as suicide prevention, funds were simply carried over to this financial year—they were rolled over, as you would expect. But Dr Wooldridge, in the cavalier way that became his hallmark as a minister, with the disregard for proper process that he became famous for, skimmed money off in a most insidious way to pay for his preferred lobbyist organisation. The grant was approved on 27 September 2001. The contract was signed just a day later. The election, of course, was called exactly a week later, on 5 October; the writs were issued on 8 October. The situation is this: Dr Wooldridge was contracted to work as a consultant with the College of General Practitioners in January this year, and the president of the college said that Dr Wooldridge would be providing advice on public health strategies. Perhaps he had already been providing advice on public relations strategies—in other words, `You need a building in the parliamentary triangle to look like a player.' But so much for public health, with useful programs being cut back to facilitate this strategy. 
It is a public relations disaster for the college and yet another Dr Wooldridge shonk. Does anyone know of any other example of a lobbyist receiving government money to build a brand spanking new building? Of course not. At the very least, there is a perception that Dr Wooldridge has cut corners to help his future employer. I would go further and say this is one of the worst examples of a rort we have seen in the six years of the life of the Howard government.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2002-03-11,"—I find this probably one of the most hypocritical accusations this Labor Party can ever make against anybody, whether it be an individual or a government. But, then again, we should be used to that type of behaviour from the Labor Party. I want to talk about a real rort—not a rort where they accuse there might be something odd but one where the money is going directly to the Labor Party.
In 1993 the Labor government arranged for the lease of a Canberra property that they called Centenary House and they leased it to the Australian National Audit Office—a la the taxpayer. The lease was for 15 years; the normal Commonwealth lease is for around five years. To make matters worse, the Labor Party demanded a rental increase of nine per cent per year or the increase in market rents, whichever was the greater. Since that time, Canberra leases have risen at the rate of only two to three per cent per year. The Labor Party set their increases to the Australian taxpayer at nine per cent. The annual rent rise was just an obscene figure. Isn't it funny that we are talking about $5 million of money that has not even yet gone to GP House or anything else—it has not even been spent—but the taxpayer gives $5 million every year to the Australian Labor Party.
The Australian taxpayer really deserves an answer from the Labor Party. Over the period of this lease the Labor Party have ripped out $36 million over and above market rents, and they think that is reasonable. But isn't it ironic: that means that every election they get around $7 million for spending on election campaigns and they somehow think that that is okay. On top of public funding, they rip off the ANAO and the Australian taxpayers by $7 million every election period. The Labor Party could take quite a responsible line on this. They could actually say, `We are going to stop that rort and that rip-off of the Australian taxpayers immediately.' In fact, Senator Abetz, Senator Kemp and Senator Ian Campbell have all asked the Labor Party to just make that one phone call to say, `It finishes as of today.' None of the Labor Party members has done that. On the issue that the Labor Party are now dredging up—which is far, far less critical than their rip-off of $36 million over market rents—the fact of the matter is that no asthma money and no outreach programs will be cut back.
A further example of hypocrisy is that for 13 years when the Labor Party were in government they did not even have asthma as a national health priority. It took this government coming into office and the former Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, to make asthma a national health priority. Up until then the Labor Party had not even heard about asthma. There is not one single, solitary thing that has gone from the asthma program. It is the same with the specialist outreach programs. Did the Labor Party over the period of their 13 years in government put specialists into the bush? No, they did not; it took this government to do that. I reiterate that not one cent is going from those programs. The Labor Party know it. Why do they not answer the more critical question as to why they are continuing to rip off $36 million into Labor Party coffers? We are talking about a facility that will provide good medical services for this country, yet they are taking $36 million for their election campaigns from the taxpayers' pocket. So I think the Labor Party have a lot to answer for on this issue. They cannot have it both ways. This is not a reduction in spending on asthma or the outreach program; they are both to be maintained fully. The Labor Party know that, but they choose to ignore it.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-03-11,"—I think it would be useful for listeners to note that there has been no attempt by the government to defend this outrageous rort perpetrated by the former Minister for Health and Aged Care. We know that today, following the publicity on the weekend, the Prime Minister is backing away, and so he should; but I want to make it clear that the present Minister for Health and Ageing was being very disingenuous today when she tried to pretend that she had no knowledge of these matters. These matters were canvassed extensively at the Senate estimates process some three weeks ago. At that stage the minister was defending the process and she and the public servants provided explanations and a defence for Dr Wooldridge's decision. As I say, the current minister was defending this announcement.
Following the publicity on the weekend, it seems that they have had a rethink and now the money is going back into medical services such as asthma from which it had been taken. That is a policy reversal, which we are pleased to see, but the money should never have been taken out in the first place. What we have to concentrate on is how a minister was allowed to rort the system so badly and so outrageously under John Howard's leadership, how that rorting received Department of Finance and Administration approval and how the then Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey, approved that rorting. So it was something that the whole government was involved in perpetrating in an attempt to curry favour with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.
I want to concentrate on some of the facts of this case. We know that $5 million was promised by the Commonwealth for a $10 million building. We were going to pay half the costs of this building. It was approved by the minister for finance and the only obligation on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners was a requirement to get a couple of other GP organisations to move in with them. That was the only requirement. The government said, `Here is $5 million, please get somebody to live with you. We do not care what you do with the rest of the building. The title is in your name. You will have complete ownership. You have the right to rent out the rest of the space. All we insist on is that you get some other GPs to move in.'
Do you know how much space they were required to take themselves in this building? It was 200 square metres. For the $5 million, they were going to occupy 200 square metres. I asked at Senate estimates, `How big is the building?' They answered, `There are four storeys and we are insisting that they take the top floor.' The contract required that they were on the top floor, with the views— and with a lift, I assume. So they are taking 200 square metres of a 1,000 square metre floor and there are four floors. So we are paying $5 million so that they can occupy 200 square metre of a 4,000 square metre building. We are going to pay $5 million for the privilege of having them in there, and they have to find some other people who might have to take up another 100 square metres or so. But the rest, the other 3,700 square metres, they can rent out at commercial rates in the centre of Canberra for their own gain. This is the sort of deal that we are into.
More than that, former Minister Wooldridge did take a personal interest in the matter. In addition to putting $5 million into his new employer's building, he insisted that it be fitted out to his taste. So we are paying $1.9 million so that the top floor—where, no doubt, former Minister Wooldridge will occupy an office—is fitted out in the manner to which he has become accustomed. 
—There will probably be a restaurant up there!
—There might be a restaurant, judging from the wine and food bills the former minister used to run up at taxpayers' expense. This contract not only provides $5 million for nothing—$5 million of Commonwealth money rorted to this organisation—but also is quite particular in ensuring the fitout is of a proper standard so that the new employees, like the former minister, will be able to live in a manner to which they have been accustomed. They are taking 200 square metres out of 4,000, but they are insisting on top-quality furnishings on the top floor so that they will be able to live in comfort. This is the sort of detail that has gone into this rort. This is the minister organising his new office accommodation in Canberra, with his new employer, and asking the taxpayer of Australia to put $5 million into it. It is a rort.  
I do not know what they are going to do with the spare space, because no-one else wants to be in it. My colleague Senator Forshaw thought they might want to put the spare MRI machines in some of the spare space. I think that we ought to call it Wooldridge House, rather than GP House, because it is very much about former Minister Wooldridge's personal interests. It is a rort he perpetrated, and to call it GP House would be a slur on the GPs of Australia. We ought to call it Wooldridge House.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2002-03-11,"—I can understand why the Senate gets a bad name. The speakers from the other side have shown an abysmal ignorance of the whole structure of the medical profession in this country.
—You're the world expert, aren't you?
—The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners was recognised by the Labor Party, when Senator Ray was a minister, as the accrediting body for general practitioners, and now we have Senator Faulkner saying that it is a lobbyist organisation. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is the accredited organisation to examine the standards of general practitioners in this country. I get criticism across the chamber from Senator Ray saying that I am the expert. I am not the expert on this; I have never been a general practitioner, and I do not set myself up as such. It is acknowledged within the medical profession that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is a highly reputable organisation. It sets the standards for general practice in this country, and obtaining recognition by that college is significant in that it is a specialist in the field of general practice. 
Senator Faulkner said that they are a lobbyist organisation, and he used the emotive words `$1 million was siphoned off the asthma program' and `$4 million was filched from the medical outreach program' when that is totally untrue. No money has been siphoned off, no money has been filched. I told him that I would mention a more outstanding example—a significant former Labor minister who established a department and now works full time for that department. Gerry Hand established ATSIC and now works full time as chief executive officer of the Goolburri Land Council while accepting other advisory positions. He established the department, and now he works for ATSIC full time. 
To criticise and say that it is a rort because a contract was entered into with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and to infer that the former minister was guaranteed employment through this is a lie. It just is not a fact. Certain agreements have to be reached before that money is put forward towards the establishment of that building. A full public report has been requested by the Prime Minister and the minister so that we can discuss this, but it is still in the formative stages. 
The former Labor government were the first government to initiate massive amounts of money going to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners for its training programs, and part of that agreement is that other general practitioner organisations take space within the building so that a demonstrable area will be occupied by other general practitioner organisations, such as the Australian Divisions of General Practice. This will be to the betterment of the training and the promotion of the specialty of general practice within this country, which will lead to better service. I know the Labor Party specialise in dipping into possible areas of rorting and so on, because they are experts in that field. You have only to see what happened with Centenary House. That will never be lived down by the Labor Party, because it was the greatest rort of all time. I do not think anybody has disagreed with the contract that was entered into there. 
A lot of money has gone into targeting the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program. A key element of that is recommendations from the state based advisory committees on the services most needed in particular regions and how they can best be provided. That is an important process and it will inevitably take time. The fact that the money has not yet been expended is due to the process that is being gone through so that the best outcome can be achieved. The money has been allocated. Some $1,800 million has been spent on targeted rural programs, and this is but part of the rural health program. We are not stepping away from the importance of that program. There is a commitment to rural health, and in the current financial year there is approximately $580 million being spent on targeted rural health programs.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-03-11,"—We have heard some pretty feeble excuses proffered this afternoon. The first one, which we heard over the weekend, is that if this money had not been spent for the purpose to which Dr Wooldridge eventually directed it, it would have been returned to consolidated revenue. That seems to have evaporated as an excuse today, but the fact is that there is nothing, in principle, wrong with the department returning money to consolidated revenue. It is not a carte blanche to go and spend it any way you might like. We now know that the Department of Health and Ageing has rollover provisions and that any underspend in the asthma area or in the rural area could have been rolled over to another financial year. So those pathetic bleatings put out yesterday by the current and past ministers can be dismissed. After all, we are talking about September—only three months into the financial year! You are not even getting ready to know where you are going to underspend and how you are going to reallocate it—and do not tell me that there are not other priorities in the Department of Health and Ageing that you cannot move $5 million into, other than your own favourite trade union.
The second feeble excuse used is: `The department was consulted about this.' If the department was consulted about it, why not go through the normal cabinet process? Normally, what would be required is a submission to cabinet and approval by cabinet, but this rotten, stinking fish never went anywhere near cabinet. This was decided just a week before an election was called, and the minister knew the timetable for the election. I want to know whether the Prime Minister himself signed off on this. We have had mixed messages regarding this; let us at least get that fact down. It is alleged that Minister Fahey—another outgoing minister—signed off on this. I want to know whether it went to the Prime Minister for his approval outside the normal cabinet process.
The third feeble excuse is that, at the point at which the $5 million was allocated, there was no discussion between Minister Wooldridge and the organisation about his future employment. I think I am entitled to doubt Minister Wooldridge's word on this but, in any event, it makes absolutely no difference—it is absolutely irrelevant. When Minister Wooldridge is coming up for a discussion with this particular college about his employment, are they supposed to put his largesse aside—the $5 million that he has tipped into the can? Can they actually build a Chinese Wall into this so that it does not enter their thinking that this person has just given them $5 million, and maybe they should employ him? But the real responsibility here was on Minister Wooldridge— then citizen Wooldridge. He should never, ever have accepted a job from an organisation that he had just tipped $5 million into without cabinet approval and maybe—yet to be established—without prime ministerial approval. It was up to him and his own ethical background as to whether he accepted an offer from them, given the dubious circumstances of this grant. But he did not hesitate to take a job with them.
Dr Wooldridge yesterday claimed he had not as yet made a single approach to former colleagues, ministerial staff or public servants on the RACGP's behalf since leaving parliament. Why would that shock me? Why should he have? He was being paid off for services already rendered. Why should he do any work for them? Why should he represent them anywhere? He might as well just go along and pick up the pay packet, because he has already delivered to this particular organisation.  
There is no question in my mind that parliamentarians and former ministers, when they leave this place, need to pursue post-parliamentary careers—especially as people leave this place a lot younger than they once did. But, in the case of Dr Wooldridge and that master of mendacity Mr Reith, their post-parliamentary careers are too closely linked to their previous portfolios in too short a period of time. It is not impossible for Mr Reith in a couple of years time to work in the defence area—but to walk straight out of the ministry with all of that knowledge as to where the ministry's industry policy is and go and work for a lobbyist, or for Dr Wooldridge to do so, is really beyond the pale.
Imagine the outrage if a Labor minister forked out $5 million to his own trade union, which was in the process of fighting an equivalent trade union in that area, and then took a job with that union, having left here! Can't you imagine the outrage that the great union bashers, Alston and Abbott, would have gone on with in these two chambers, whilst they now just look on this and on their colleagues with embarrassed silence. Centenary House has been mentioned. They are saying that this is equivalent. There is one difference: with Centenary House, there was a full judicial inquiry run by Justice Morling. I challenge the government to do the same in this regard. (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-03-11,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents. 
A series of documents has been tabled by the Clerk today which relates to grants by the Australian Research Council—documents which, I might say, relate to the administration by Dr Kemp. What concerns me is that these documents do not contain the direction by Dr Nelson to the Australian Research Council of 25 January this year. This was a direction to the Australian Research Council undertaken by the government which flew in the face of the legislation passed by this parliament last year which sought to give increased autonomy and authority to the Australian Research Council for the administration of the various grants that are under discussion here in the Senate.
The government has sought to increase the moneys to the Australian Research Council and then direct the way in which those moneys should be spent. This is in contrast to the statements that were made during the debate in the Senate establishing the Australian Research Council as an independent statutory authority. We do not dispute the right of the government to issue a direction. What concerns me, though, is the process by which the government has undertaken to issue the directions which affect 30 per cent of the new money for research being spent under Backing Australia's Ability. The government has said it wants to increase flexibility and it wants to increase independence while, at the same time, the government's actions have in fact reduced flexibility by locking up the money the government has designated to four specialised research areas.
There has been widespread rejection throughout the research community in this country of the government's approach. The Australian Academy of the Humanities, the Australian Academy of Sciences and the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies have all said that the process that the government undertook in issuing these directions was wrong and that it should be reviewed. The government is now set upon a process which seeks to establish priorities for research funding across all Commonwealth agencies, across the $4.7 billion budget—not just for the Australian Research Council, which of course administers about $600 million per annum.
The government is not able to determine who the minister responsible for this program is. We are not able to determine whether it is Minister McGauran or Minister Nelson who is formally in control of these new priority setting processes. We have seen that the Prime Minister has a direct interest in these priority setting approaches. We have seen that this is an elitist driven process determined behind closed doors without discussion—secretive processes undertaken by this government, orchestrated by shadowy elites—which has threatened to compromise the integrity of the Australian Research Council. What troubles me most is that there is a process now under way within this government, in relation to research funding, which is controlled directly by the Prime Minister's office. We see this in regard to stem cell research where the Prime Minister has sought to appoint Mr Kevin Andrews to take control of that particular matter—despite the fact that the machinery of government orders show the Department of Education, Science and Training to be responsible for research coordination. The government is attempting to intervene in such a way as to undermine the integrity of such organisations as the Australian Research Council. I am very concerned about the defence the government presents us on these issues. In Senate estimates, we noticed that the Australian Research Council directions were issued on 25 January and we now know the decisions were made by government in September of last year but not announced to the Research Council in fact until 25 January of this year.
Why did it take so long to tell the Research Council that the government had determined new priorities for its spending? Why is it that the government undertook a secretive process? The best I can establish is that a group of 42 scientists as well as other groups of people—not just scientists—were called to a meeting in Limestone Avenue, the CSIRO headquarters, last year. There they were told, in very general terms, that there were to be new priority setting processes under way for the Australian Research Council, but they were never told what they would be. Then, in turn, what occurred was that the Australian Research Council came up with 12 priorities of its own, to which the government responded by allocating four priority areas. The government ambushed the research community in this country. It bushwhacked the research community in this country. It did not at any point seek to involve the public in discussion about what ought to be research priorities in this country; and at no point has it sought to engage the public in a defence of the government's actions. 
This is a serious matter. Clearly, when it comes to research, a country of our size cannot fund all conceivable options. However, what we can do is have enough confidence in the Australian people to involve them in discussion about what ought to be the priorities for research in Australia, given that we all understand how important research is to the future prosperity of the country. When I read the papers sent down by the government in response to the grants that have been allocated by the Australian Research Council, I note that the government has 15 days in which to respond to a direction to the Australian Research Council. So I am waiting with some interest for that direction to be tabled in this chamber. When it is, this chamber ought to have a proper debate about the way in which this government is administering research policy. 
What we have seen is that there has been a fiasco in relation to the allocation of priorities for the Australian Research Council. What we have seen is that Minister Nelson, in terms of this government, seems to have been placed in a situation where his naivete and his ineffectiveness have been exposed. He seems to take the approach that being `hale fellow, well met, call me Brendan' will get him through. The problem he has is that these are serious questions now, very serious questions, about the way in which we allocate moneys and the way in which the Australian Research Council is allowed to get on and do its job. I am particularly concerned that Dr Nelson will have to lift his game, given the budget context that we are now entering, to ensure that the Prime Minister does not run over the top of him and run over the top of the research community in this country on such basic questions as to how we should be spending $4.7 billion per annum in public money.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Research Council</title>,Documents,22,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-03-11,"—I just want to conclude my earlier remarks by indicating that I intend to move an amendment on behalf of the Democrats, after the minister finishes the second reading, which will deal with the question of national competition policy and the requirement that a regulation impact statement be done for all federal legislation and that we should not consider this legislation until that statement has been done. I will expand a little more on that amendment at the appropriate time.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator, I think you really should speak to it now rather than after the debate has concluded. This is a second reading contribution you are making.
—Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I understand it, I can do this after I move the actual amendment, which I have not done.
—By foreshadowing it, you are really putting the two debates together.
—Can I move that second reading amendment motion now?
—You can foreshadow it.
—Right. And I have done that.
—You can speak to it.
—This amendment relates to the regulation impact statement that accompanies the explanatory memorandum for the bill in 2001. As honourable senators will be aware, the regulation impact statement has been a requirement for all new federal legislation since 1997 and it derives from the national competition principles. The RIS, as it is called, is intended to be a cost benefit analysis of new legislation and an assessment of whether or not it conforms to the principles of competitive neutrality.  
The responsibility for the RIS belongs to the Office of Regulation Review which sits within the Productivity Commission. The process that they follow in relation to a RIS is to discuss and negotiate the content with the responsible agency. At recent estimates hearings my colleague Senator Andrew Bartlett raised questions in relation to the RIS for this bill. AFFA could not recall whether the Office of Regulation Review had deemed the RFA regulation impact statement adequate or not and the Office of Regulation Review said that they preferred not to answer the question.
As I said earlier, there is plenty of evidence that the bill does not conform to the principles of competitive neutrality. We know that plantation owners and farmers contemplating agriforestry know that there is no competitive neutrality. In my home state, state government deals with woodchippers and logging companies show that timber is practically given away. In fact, it seems likely that the reliance on native forests has become so detrimental to the proper development of the plantation industry, particularly hardwood in this case, that we are likely to see the importation of hardwood from overseas plantations well before we see anything like a sustainable industry here in this country for that timber.
I think there are many examples whereby competition policy can be seen to be not working in this instance and, whilst the Democrats are not often supportive of some of the outcomes of competition policy in this country—I think it is fair to say there has been more that is detrimental than not—in this instance we think that if legislation is required to go through this process and to demonstrate cost-benefit analysis then it ought to in this circumstance as well. 
It is my understanding, for instance, in Goolengook that Daishowa has set up a syndicate which will involve some of the industry in that area and is likely to mean that most of the timber which is available from those forests, even after there has been a cut, is likely to be confined to just a small group and that there will be a number of sawmillers who will be excluded from this arrangement. The conservation groups at Goolengook are working with that part of the industry there, as I understand it, and talking about how sawmillers and other forestry workers can enhance the ecotourism opportunities in this part of the world by building tracks and by building structures which could ensure people will both get into these wonderful areas and have minimal impact on the environment itself.
This is yet another example of how some people have been shut out of this process. We seem to be giving away our very valuable resource for practically nothing to woodchippers. They are the ones who are pretty much in control. They are the ones who are not missing out in Victoria on the reductions across the board of the timber yield. Clearly, this is not fair. Clearly, it is not good for farmers; it is not good for sawmillers; it is not good for workers and it is not good for biodiversity. It is not good for anybody, it would appear, including the communities that depend on forestry for jobs and income. It is not fair on them. The only beneficiary out of all of this would appear to be the woodchippers themselves, and the massive increase in that industry that we have seen go offshore without value adding. I think we can expect much better than that. Let us call upon the national competition policy to do what it was set out to do—create a level playing field—and talk about fairness in competitive arrangements. If it is good for other pieces of legislation, it is good for the regional forest agreement legislation. But of course this means that this place ought not consider this legislation until that has taken place.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2002-03-11,"—I rise to deal with some issues that have been raised during this debate. In particular, I want to deal with some matters that Senator Brown raised which I comprehensively disagree with, in toto. The report of my committee would indicate absolutely why. But I must now take the challenge that has just been issued by Senator Allison. What was said about the establishment of plantations and the agreements on private land is just absolute nonsense. I talk about my state of Western Australia in particular. The offers that are being made in the agreements between private land-holders in terms of plantations, whether it be the private agreements or whether it be the CALM agreements—unfortunately the CALM agree-ments have stopped as a result of the demise of CALM by the previous Western Australian government—are by far and away the greatest commercial return that individual private land-holders can receive. That does not matter whether it is done on an annual basis or an annuity, whether it is done on a 10-year basis or, as in some cases, the life of the forest or the life of the timber or the life of the cutting, depending on what the particular production line is as the forests are thinned. It grieves me greatly to hear this poppycock that is dished up to us about the commercial aspects of it when it is just plain wrong. 
The issues I wanted to deal with in particular go to Senator Brown's comments in a previous debate where he says:
... this bill is being railroaded through the Senate and that the committee, which met last night, has not travelled to the places where it really matters so that, although the logging community gets the opportunity to have maximum input ...
Let me say straight out here: the logging community got no advantage or disadvantage, and nor did anyone else who put in submissions or appeared before the committee. We went to great trouble as a committee, all of us. Senator Brown was involved in the process and he nominated some of the people we invited to give evidence before the committee. In terms of the first round of the inquiry, which was held in Melbourne, there were 371 submissions from across all states and all interested parties. There were 41 witnesses, which included some organisations and individuals, who appeared before us. There were two hearings in Canberra. In the final hearings, which did not deal with the full Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 but dealt with the amendments that were before us, there were another nine organisations and an additional 20 people, a cross-section of the people involved in the particular bill. So I say to Senator Brown that what you said on that night is absolutely totally wrong. I think it does the debate in this place and you and the people you represent no good to misrepresent the work that the committee did on this legislation. We dealt with those amendments the second time around. We even endeavoured on your recommendations, sir, to have a particular individual from the Reedy Marsh forest group hooked up on a radio phone. Unfortunately, we were unable to do that because something broke down with the technology. 
I just want to put the record absolutely straight here in this debate that this piece of legislation—through the two hearings we have had, through the work that has been done in estimates and through questions asked—has had more scrutiny, more discussion, more questions asked about it, more witnesses at hearings and more submissions than most pieces of legislation that come before this Senate. There was nobody, not one, who sought to put a submission in who had a submission rejected. As I understand it, I know of nobody—and nobody came to me as chairman of that committee—who asked to appear before the committee who was not granted the right to appear before the committee. As I understand it, we had a clean bill. Certainly none of the other committee members came to me and said, `Listen, we have a couple of people or an organisation who would like to submit to the committee and they have not had that opportunity.' As far as I was concerned, as chair of that committee, we covered it in total.
Another question I want to raise in this debate—which is becoming a real issue as far as the forests are concerned, and it is bigger than this bill—relates to how opponents of proper forest management think our forests are going to survive, not only in this country but also overseas, in terms of the wildfire threat that is around now? Without proper management, proper firebreaks, proper controls, we are not going to stop the devastation that occurs. We had very recently the wildfires in New South Wales. I personally have no idea what percentage of that was private land, what percentage was forests used for commercial use and what percentage was public reserve, which is not being touched, but I have no doubt that there is a mixture right across the board. We saw the Californian fires just a few years ago and the devastation they incurred. There is a likelihood that some of that country in California, as in New South Wales, will never recover to its former state because there was so much timber burnt, so many leaves and branches burnt. When that catches on fire it is hot. I have been in more than one of these fires and I know how hot it gets. 
We had, five or six years ago, the situation with the Fitzgerald national park in the southern part of the Western Australian coast. Of 1.6 million acres, one million was burnt in one fire. Some of that park had not had a controlled burn for 35 years. As a result, a number of the species which were growing there very thickly and very productively and which were an integral part of Fitzgerald park and the forest and the bushland are struggling to recover, because the seed was burnt. I have been in fires, or fighting fires, where the temperature was over 45 degrees and we had 70- or 80-mile an hour winds blowing. In those situations, unless we provide the management required to break the heat of these fires and the fronts that they build up—and they burn for weeks and weeks unless there is some way by which you control them—you get this absolutely devastating damage. 
And the situation has become worse. It has become worse because no discipline is being applied to the management of the forests. I have not mentioned the loss of property. Fortunately, I understand that in New South Wales there was no loss of life. Certainly, in the big fire we had near Fitzgerald there was loss of life, and there have been a number of fires where loss of life has occurred. You then have the private freehold properties which adjoin these parks. So the issue that has to be dealt with—and which comes before us every time—is that a little more common sense has to be applied to how we manage our forests. What is the point in allowing a beautiful big tree to die and become a fire hazard for the young ones that are growing? We must remember that a forest is like us: it is a living thing. It comes up from a seed, it grows, and after a period— in some instances 1,000 years, in some instances only 15 years—it dies. I have not seen too many that have lasted the 1,000 years but I have the 15 years and I have seen the devastation in the Casuarinas and in the Christmas tree belts, where you get all the dead debris on the ground and, without control or sound management practices in between, devastation occurs.
Unfortunately, I agreed to speak for only 10 minutes, but I wanted to make those two points, which I will re-emphasise. The committee, which I chair and of which Senator Brown is a participating member, heard an enormous number of submissions. I have quoted them here. We called an extensive number of witnesses and, as I said before, as far as I am aware there was no witness who put their name forward and who wanted to appear who did not get that opportunity. We invited the various senators—Senator Brown was one who took up that opportunity—to put forward names of people or get in touch with individuals or organisations who wished either to appear before or to present to that committee. When you put it all together, we received well in excess of 400 responses.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Brown, do you have a point of order?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-11,"—No, I wish to make a comment on Senator Allison's foreshadowed amendment if now is the right time to do it. Otherwise, I will wait until after the vote on the first amendment and then make the comment.
—You can do it now, provided you confine your comments to the precise terms of her amendment.
—I will, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I will respond to Senator Crane at a later time. I knew you would give me good direction on that. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The amendment that Senator Allison is foreshadowing is a very important one. It provides that, before there is further consideration of this bill after the second reading, we as senators should see the assessment of the regulation impact statement for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 which was conducted by the Productivity Commission to see if there are anticompetitive components in the industry, or indeed in this legislation, which should be brought to the Senate's notice and therefore to the notice of the House of Representatives. 
The debate has already pointed to there being anticompetitive measures in this legislation and attendant on the regional forest agreements. For example, $380 million of taxpayers' money goes, through these agreement systems, into the cutting of wild forests, of native forests. But that is not available for the plantation industry, which is in direct competition. It has to be noted that 75 per cent of the wood used in Australia now is coming out of the plantations, not out of the wild forests. But the money being poured through the regional forest agreements is not going to ensure fairness in the matter; it is going to prop up the logging of wild forests where, for a whole range of structural reasons, it cannot compete against the plantation industry. It cannot compete in quality, it cannot compete in volume—it certainly cannot compete in efficiency. One is led to suspect that if the Productivity Commission has looked closely at the RFA legislation and process, that will be its finding. We have not yet seen that report and review from its Office of Regulation Review, and we must see that report and review. The Labor opposition should see that report and review. It should insist that, just for the fair working of the Senate, we get to see it.
It is obvious that this Senate and the committee that will come out of the deliberations here if the second reading goes through ought to be acquainted with that report. It is going to be a failure of good process in the Senate if we have to take measures which get us to see that report after this legislation has been dealt with. I suggest very strongly to the government that it produce the report to the minister, and I suggest very strongly to the shadow minister that he join us in insisting on this report. It would be a very unusual departure from process in this place if the opposition were not to assist the Senate in discovering information which is important to a Senate debate like this. This is a key piece of information. 
The minister can put the matter to rest very quickly by producing the report. I have no doubt that he has had the matter brought to his attention, and certainly it has been done so by Senator Allison now. We should see that report. We should not be going to an amendment to the second reading, but if the amendment is necessary then I expect the opposition will be supporting it so that we make the government produce the report which we need to have in hand if we are going to properly deal with the legislation in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-03-11,"—My understanding of the report which is sought to be compulsorily produced is that no such report actually exists. That is the advice I have been given: there is no requirement for the production of such a regulatory impact report, as referred to in Senator Allison's amendment. On that basis we cannot see why we would support an amendment to lay on the table something which does not exist, and to delay the passage of this legislation while that is the case. I hope that the minister in his reply will clarify this matter because if that is the case then obviously we would not be supporting this amendment. I understand there is a regulatory impact statement in the memoranda for the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002. 
If that is the process, then we are happy for this matter to proceed. If there is indeed a document as referred to in Senator Allison's amendment, then we would ask that it be laid on the table now. We should not wait and delay the passage of this legislation while that occurs. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-11,"—I will start with the matter that Senator O'Brien referred to, and it deals with Senator Allison's amendment. I had hoped Senator Allison would be here to hear what I am about to say. (Quorum formed) It is important that she understands what I am about to say, and that is that there is no such thing as the `assessment' of the regulation impact statement. There is no such thing. Were the amendment to pass, it would be incapable of being effected because there is no such thing. 
—They did no assessment? Is that what you are saying?
—There is no such thing as the assessment of the regulation impact statement. What there is is a regulation impact statement which is actually contained in the explanatory memorandum. It is there in detail. What is being sought is already in the explanatory memorandum, except that I do concede that that refers to a statement on the previous bill that was coming through that we hoped to deal with before the election. It is all there in the explanatory memorandum. What we do have from the Office of Regulation Review is an advice, which I am happy to provide to the Senate, saying that the regulation impact statement is in the explanatory memorandum to the RFA Bill; that it is identical to that in the explanatory memorandum for the RFA Bill 2001; the office provided clearance for the RIS on 20 August 2001, their reference being 2392, which is the previous one; the regulation impact statement is a substantial expansion of the RAS provided in the 1998 bill and was developed in consultation with the Office of Regulation Review in August; and a substantial and wide ranging analysis of individual RFAs was conducted in the comprehensive regional assessments undertaken as part of the RFA process.
The Office of Regulation Review has advised that it was not the role or the purpose of the RIS process to duplicate this existing detailed analysis. Rather, the ORR advised that the RIS would add value, providing a high level summary of the national impacts of the combined RFAs. It was on this basis that the regulation impact statement for the RFA bill was endorsed by the Office of Regulation Review. The RFA bill 2002 is different to the RFA bill only in respect of clause 12 and a new schedule relating to the EPBC act. No change to the RAS was required by that change.
Senator Bartlett requested this at an estimates committee hearing, the appropriate place for this. The officers at the time said they would take it on notice. What I have just read out is the response that will be sent by me to Senator Bartlett in response to his question at the estimates committee hearing, but I will also table it here. I do so now. Senator Allison, your amendment was well-meaning. It was something your colleague Senator Bartlett was involved with. I hope that as a result of this here now you will withdraw your amendment because it is no longer necessary. 
The Regional Forest Agreements Bill provides legislative support and commitment to the outcomes of the regional forest agreements and for ongoing action to implement the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council. The bill commits the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the 10 RFAs concluded with four state governments between February 1997 and April 2001. Those RFAs were the conclusion of a process which had its roots in a three-year inquiry into Australia's forest and timber resources conducted by the Resources Assessment Commission as far back as 1989 to 1992. The commission found an overriding national need for improved intergovernmental institutions and decision making processes that would support comprehensive forward planning for forest use.
The National Forest Policy Statement of 1992 set in motion the regional forest agreements process. You will recall that was provided by an agreement between all state governments and the federal government—at the time, I might say, a federal government not of our political persuasion. But that is an agreement that we supported and one we have carried on because the Commonwealth government of the day did agree to that process. It provided a nationally agreed policy framework for a long-term and lasting resolution of competing forest industry, conservation and community interests and expectations concerning our nation's forests. The statement committed the Commonwealth and all states to the ecologically sustainable management of forests and a balanced return from all forest uses. 
The current bill has 12 clauses to address the three main objectives of the bill. The first objective is to give effect to certain obligations on the Commonwealth under the RFAs. These obligations involve ensuring that the forest operations in regions subject to the RFAs are excluded from Commonwealth legislation relating to export controls and the environment and heritage, binding the Commonwealth to the termination provisions of the RFAs and binding the Commonwealth to the compensation provisions of the RFAs. 
In excluding RFA forestry operations from certain Commonwealth legislation, the bill draws a line in the sand for political and bureaucratic goal shifting—and that is what it is all about. The decisions have been made. The debate has been entered into. We have had a wide ranging consultation over more than a decade. Having reached a conclusion, we do not want politicians or bureaucrats then changing the goals once everyone is relying on that process.
The environmental, heritage and economic values of these regions have been comprehensively assessed through the RFA processes. Each RFA is signed only after the Commonwealth has satisfied itself that state regimes adequately address sustainable forest management, environmental protection and heritage. There is, therefore, no need for further assessment at the Commonwealth level for the 20 years of these agreements. The Commonwealth is satisfied that these assessments will take it through the 20 years of the RFAs. Any forestry operations inconsistent with the commitments in the RFA processes are to be addressed within state processes and reported in annual RFA reports and in the five-yearly reviews. The Commonwealth may terminate an RFA only in accordance with the RFA itself. The bill has the effect that dispute settlement procedures in the RFAs must be observed and the state provided with a 90-day notice on any failures to comply with the RFA provisions, such as implementation of the reserve system or codes of practice or management systems. Specific termination provisions are set out in each individual RFA.
In binding the Commonwealth to compensation provisions in the RFA, the bill provides legislative support to the provisions of the RFAs. The RFAs set out the circumstances under which the Commonwealth would be liable to pay compensation and the process by which the amount of compensation is determined. They provide that, in the event that the Commonwealth takes action inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement that leads to prevention or substantial limitation of the use of land outside the reserve system or sale or commercial use of products from those areas, then, as any reasonable person would quite rightly say, the Commonwealth must pay as compensation an amount equal to the reasonable loss and damage sustained by reason of that changed action—changed action on a decision previously made by a Commonwealth government.
The second and third objectives are to provide legislative commitment and support for the National Forest Policy Statement and the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda and to provide for the continuation of the Forest and Wood Products Council. Clause 11 provides the Forest and Wood Products Council to be a forum for the minister and the industry stakeholders to consult on a range of matters, including the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda.
The bill also provides for parliamentary oversight of the RFAs. It requires the publication of information about RFAs and requires the minister to table RFAs, amendments to RFAs, RFA annual reports and RFA five-yearly review reports. These clauses, along with the objectives clause, are a practical way of addressing the issues that were raised in the Senate during and around the debate in 1999. It gives the parliament full and comprehensive oversight of the RFAs and the RFA processes and allows enormous opportunity for any senator or member of the House of Representatives to oversee the RFAs.
The RFAs and the EPBC Act included some assumptions about future legislation, and some tidying up is now necessary to ensure that they are properly aligned. The bill, through a schedule, amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and provides that that act and the RFA Bill have identical provisions relating to the application of the EPBC Act on RFA forestry operations. 
The current provisions in the EPBC Act permit a person to undertake RFA forestry operations without approval but define RFA forestry operations in terms of a non-existent 1999 act. The schedule to the RFA Bill corrects that anomaly by repealing the existing provisions and provides that references in the EPBC Act to the RFA forestry operations are as defined in the current bill.
The effect of the schedule is to ensure that part 3 of the EPBC Act, which requires Commonwealth environmental approval for certain actions, does not apply to RFA forestry operations undertaken in accordance with the RFAs. This exemption is limited so that RFA forestry operations in world heritage or Ramsar areas—or those that are incidental to another action—may be subject to the EPBC Act.
The RFA Bill, then, is a fairly simple bill targeted at specific objectives of underpinning the commitments the Commonwealth has already entered into in the 10 RFAs with four state governments and in the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992 and the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda of 2000. I urge senators to consider this bill on its merits. I repeat that these bills are the conclusion of more than 10 years of consultation, of negotiation, of working it through with all interested parties—with conservation groups, the industry, governments and local governments. Anyone who might have an interest in these areas has been consulted over the past 10 and more years. As a result of that, in the early days the National Forest Policy Statement came around. Following that, there were regional forest agreements signed by the Commonwealth and state governments.
This bill is about securing the Commonwealth's obligations legislatively under the regional forest agreements. It is important to understand this, because some people— some, I think, deliberately, some innocently—misinterpret what this bill is all about. Perhaps unfortunately, we cannot by Commonwealth legislation make other people comply. But we certainly can bind ourselves legislatively to the regional forest agreements that have been signed, and we do provide then for the situation where, for some very significant and important reason, the federal government of the day decides to change the RFAs and, in doing so, causes loss or damage to people who have relied upon those RFAs to make investment decisions, to make job decisions. In that case, quite naturally, the Commonwealth would pay the cost that its change of attitude might impose on those who have invested on the strength of a commitment given by Commonwealth governments in the past. That is only fair. That seems very reasonable. I am surprised that anyone at all could object to that process.
There are some other comments that I did want to make about this bill, and I am not going to have the opportunity in this second reading speech, but I am sure that I will have the opportunity in the— (Quorum formed)
I do say to my colleagues and those in the gallery that Senator Brown is going to pull these sorts of stunts all the time because he does not want the will of the people—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Even a minister may not reflect on another member. If I call a quorum, it is a proper process, and it is my right under the standing orders to do so. I draw that to your attention. He may not reflect on that.
 (Senator Watson)—Minister, try not to reflect on another senator.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, thank you for the ruling. What I was just saying to my colleagues and those who might be interested in this debate is that Senator Brown has indicated that by whatever means possible he will stop a vote being held on this particular bill because he knows that the majority of Australians, as evidenced by the two majority parties in this parliament, who represent clearly the majority of Australians, have agreed that it is essential to have this bill. It is an abuse of this parliament to stop this parliament having a vote on a bill which is of such great importance to the people of Australia.
There were a number of issues I wanted to raise but I will have to deal with those as we go through the committee stage. I am sure there will be lots of opportunities. What I did want to raise were the issues that Senator Brown spoke of in his contribution. Whilst I welcome debate on this very important issue, it must be debated on the basis of fact. For too long Senator Brown has misled the people of Australia as to what this bill is all about. Even this morning he was saying things like, `This will remove the jurisdiction of ministers in the future.' Absolutely wrong—just plain wrong in fact. He also said that it will remove the right of the parliament to review the public interest in this area. Absolutely wrong—just simply not accurate in fact. Unfortunately this is the way the debate has gone on for the last 10 years. Senator Brown, and colleagues of his, repeat statements that are simply not factual, but if they repeat them long enough and loud enough they eventually rub off on someone. This is the way this debate has been going for some time. Senator Brown said that the bill will remove the right of the Senate to look at the impact of the RFAs. That is absolutely wrong; but someone will hear him and believe it. I think that after 10 years it is about time this debate got back on to actual facts—things that are real, rather than things that Senator Brown and others choose in order to pursue their own political agendas. 
I might say, Senator Allison has pursued this—I will give her the benefit of the doubt; perhaps she has done it unwittingly, because I know her party are also totally opposed to any sustainable use of our native forests. She has followed Senator Brown in using the word `woodchipping' in an emotive way— woodchipping overseas by multinationals and all the sorts of things that are guaranteed to bring a tear to some people's eyes if they do not follow the debate fully. Of course, woodchipping and the sustainable use of the native forest really mean jobs; this is about people. Sure, we care about the forest—we all care about the forest—but we also care about people and jobs, and that is what this whole debate is about.
It should not need me to remind those who oppose this bill just what it is all about and what the whole debate is about. It is about security for jobs; it is about the future of small timber towns; it is about guaranteeing comprehensive, adequate, representative reserves that have substantially increased in Australia as a result of the RFA process. You know that, Senator Brown. This all happened because of the RFA process. Sure, there is some logging in native forest, but it is controlled and it is sustainable. It is about time the truth of this got out, rather than Senator Brown having the sole say on this, as he seems very skilful at doing. I congratulate you on that, Senator Brown, but it is not fact.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-03-11,"—I rise this evening to provide a contribution in recognition of International Women's Day, which was celebrated last Friday, 8 March. By way of background, International Women's Day was first observed around the world many years ago. International Women's Day is renowned internationally and women around the world will have celebrated the day in some form or another. International Women's Day grew out of the women's struggle for better working conditions and the right for women to vote. The movement sought equality and justice for all women. In recent times, though, it is a day on which women have celebrated change, a day when women have reflected on the progress they have made or, at times, the lack of progress we seem to have made in some areas. It is a day to assert, again, our right as women to have political, social and economic rights, and to look at a way in which we can ensure that those rights are achieved for women around this world.
There is some debate about the origin of International Women's Day. It is said to have started somewhere between 1857 and 1908. International Women's Day was first held in March 1911. At a gathering in 1910 of around 100 women from 17 countries—in fact, the Second International Conference on Socialist Women being held in Copenhagen at that time—it was unanimously resolved to honour the women's rights movement through some sort of international celebration. The first public event in Australia was an International Women's Day march in 1928. However, it was not officially recognised until 1974—some 46 years later—by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Mr Gough Whitlam, in the lead-up to the United Nations International Women's Year in 1975. In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming that 8 March would be a United Nations day for women's rights and international peace.
I also want to talk about the new development in recent years of the Women's History Month. During the 1970s, there was a growing sense that much of the history of women who had fought for the vote, for equal pay, for better access to education and other strategies had been lost or, indeed, forgotten. History, as taught in schools, did not meet the need for honouring these stories. However, in some universities in Australia and throughout the world, we have seen a growth in women's studies and women's histories programs. In 1978, in California in the USA, an education task force on the status of women began a Women's History Week celebration. This was to coincide with the March 8 International Women's Day. Schools in the USA began to host their own Women's History Week program, and the movement spread. In 1981, the United States Congress passed a resolution establishing a national Women's History Week. In 1987, at the request of the National Women's History Project, the US Congress expanded the week to a month. Every year since then, US Congress has issued a resolution for Women's History Month and the US President also issues an annual proclamation for the event. 
Meanwhile in Canada, Women's History Month has been celebrated annually since 1992. In that country October was chosen, because it celebrates the famous 1927 legal case when five women petitioned the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of Great Britain for clarification of women's rights under the British North America Act for women to be appointed to the Canadian Senate. In fact, on 18 October 1929 that committee ruled that section 24 of the British North America Act should apply equally to women. One year later we had a woman, Carine Wilson, becoming the first woman to take her place in the Senate of Canada. It is interesting to note that in 2002 the President of the Canadian Senate, as in our own Senate, is a woman.
I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to a leading feminist in our country, Helen Leonard. Many people who have known Helen and who have worked with her will realise that, quite tragically, during the federal election, she passed away. This is the first opportunity that any of us have had to publicly pay tribute to her work. Helen was born on 7 March—the day before International Women's Day—1945 and she died last year on 12 October. Many of us did not have the opportunity to pay our respects at that time, as we were caught up in the federal election, as Helen would have wanted us to be. Helen was a mother of three, a lobbyist, a networker extraordinaire and, of course, the creator of the largest and most remarkable photographic record of the women's movements from the 1970s onwards. 
I had only known Helen for three years. She was terrific in making sure that whenever newly elected women parliamentarians arrived in Canberra she was there to meet you. She was always there to ensure that her lobbyist views were imparted to you and she was always there as a person who would encourage and support whatever work you were trying to do in terms of improving outcomes for women. Helen was one of those who created the Nursing Mothers Association at a time back in 1973 when it was seen to be offensive to breastfeed in public and relatively few Australian mothers were encouraged to breastfeed. She went on to be appointed to the National Women's Consultative Council, as a representative of the national Nursing Mothers Association. She was one of those who founded the National Women's Media Centre, at a time when only 20 per cent of interviewees in the media were women, and she led the project to produce the 1998 National Women's Media Directory. 
Helen moved on to Canberra in 1998 and became a national executive member of the Women's Electoral Lobby. From there she became a lobbyist for numerous organisations such as CAPOW—the Coalition of Australian Participating Organisations of Women—as the peak national women's organisation. She was the person some years ago in March 2000 who created Women's History Month for us here in Australia—and, of course, that month continues on, hopefully, in memory of her.
I want to use this time to publicly pay tribute to Helen, to her work as a lobbyist, to her commitment as a feminist and to her undying passion to improve life for women in this country, no matter what the cost. Helen was always on the phone, always emailing you, always there to ensure that you knew what the issues were and that, in fact, you were there standing up for women, as she would want us to do. She is survived by her partner, Judy and children, Christopher, Robin and Carolyn. I am sure that, along with many other women, they are extremely proud of the work that she has done.  
She would have been bitterly disappointed at the outcome of last year's federal election, having worked tirelessly for a number of achievements in areas of the women's movement where she wanted to see change occur. But perhaps I can best sum up some of the work that she did by quoting many tributes that are on the web site in her honour. Susan Halliday, the former Equal Opportunity Commissioner, said:
Her enthusiasm was contagious, her ability to motivate people inspiring and her willingness to look for the bright side throwing caution to the winds and get out there and make a difference when it appeared all had been lost, goes unmatched. 
So, Helen, on behalf of women in this country and politicians in this House, we pay tribute to the work that you did through the years on our behalf.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>International Women's Day</title>,Adjournment,26,1
