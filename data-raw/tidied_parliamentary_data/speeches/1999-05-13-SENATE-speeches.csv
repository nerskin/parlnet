"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-05-13,"—On behalf of Senator Ferguson, I present the report of the Economics Legislation Committee on the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and two related bills, together with submissions and Hansard  record of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (NO. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Report of the Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,10,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-05-13,"—I table supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the government amendments and requests for amendments to be moved to the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999  and A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements—Consequential Provisions) Bill 1999 . These memoranda were circulated in the chamber on 11 May 1999.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-13,"—The amendment that has been separated from the rest of the Democrats' food exemption amendments is obviously an important issue to many people. It was a major source of debate within the committee inquiries, and a number of people gave very considered evidence in relation to its impact. I know it is an issue of concern to many retailers because of the whole issue of a goods and services tax. Of course, this is not something that has been put on them by the crossbenchers of the Senate; the goods and services tax is something that is being shoved through by the government.
The issue of compliance is not something that in general is being put on them by the minor parties. The reality is that the Greens (WA) have always believed that consumption taxes of any kind should have the ability to be varied, depending on whether they are necessities of life you are talking about, depending on whether they are environmentally harmful goods and services or areas of activity, and depending on whether they are areas of activity that one should be encouraging in the 1990s leading on to the 21st century. In that sense, there might be some problems initially in the implementation of any differentiated tax, but the reality is that the problem has not been created by the Senate, by the crossbenchers, or by the Democrats; 
 the problem has been created by an unfair tax which the Senate is trying to mitigate. I indicate that the Greens (WA) will support the principle of exempting food should—and we hope it will not—a GST be forced upon Australia. On that basis I will accept and vote for the amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-13,"—The minister in his response yesterday quoted evidence given to the committee by a number of reputable individuals and reputable organisations. But the minister knows, as I know, of course, that the quality of evidence varies according to the witness. Regrettably, many of those witnesses who he used,  despite some of them being eminent people of considerable reputation, had not conducted empirical studies and were making assertions not based on facts. The quotes I used yesterday were in fact from people and organisations who had studied these matters and studied them closely.
Amongst the quotes that the minister gave appeared these words: that making food GST free would be a `disaster', that it would `exponentially' increase compliance costs, and that it would make the administration of the GST by businesses `a nightmare'. Really, when the very top estimate is for $100 million extra compliance costs if food is GST free, as compared to $1.9 billion for imposing the GST, you have to be concerned about the balanced argument. The minister quoted the ASCPA, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, from their press release issued on 10 February by Angela Ryan, who is the ASCPA tax director. The release said:
Approximately 300,000 business operators will face a massive increase in compliance costs as a result of making food GST free. This is a dead weight on the economy and one that will inevitably be recouped through increased prices.
Well, the $1.9 billion worth of cost to business from the government's imposition of the GST will also be recouped from an increase in prices as compared to the $100 million that she estimates making food GST free would cost. She makes no remark about that.
Also within this press release she accepts the ATO's figure of 300,000 business operators who would be affected. Yet, as I have indicated, we have checked the ABS figures and they come to 40,000—7,835 supermarkets and 37,246 retail businesses specialising in food retailing. It is nowhere near 300,000. What is this `massive increase' in compliance costs when the increase at maximum is five per cent of the overall cost of imposing the GST on business and is possibly as low as two per cent?
Why would it be a `dead weight on the economy' when you have so many countries worldwide who do this very thing, who differentiate the price of food in their GST regimes? Is she saying that other major countries are experiencing a deadweight effect and are finding out that these problems are so massive that they cannot cope with them? This does not make any sense. Here are some of the countries which, if you follow the logic of Angela Ryan's press release, are so affected: Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Sweden, Great Britain, Canada, Iceland, Mexico, Switzerland, Turkey, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea. There are another 90 countries that I can read out, if you want, but you are getting the point, aren't you?
If 700 million people in those countries can cope with food being differentially rated or zero rated, why do people like Angela Ryan and Mark Paterson think that our 18 million Australians are too stupid, too incompetent, too incapable, to do what retailers and businesses do very easily in those other countries? It is just assertion; it is not evidence. I will quote to you again from the UK National Audit Office report on VAT compliance costs in 1994. I do so because they are the equivalent body to our own very esteemed Auditor-General's department. This is what they say:
The incidence of compliance costs in relation to trader turnover is broadly consistent between the United Kingdom (zero-rated), Germany and the Netherlands (which concessionally tax food), Canada (which zero-rates food), and New Zealand (which taxes food).
The issue of compliance costs is not a material issue when we are considering whether 
 food should be made GST free. The issues that concern, and should concern, the government are those issues of equity versus the issues of efficiency—which are the economic issues—and those issues which attend to revenue. And those are the issues which we will deal with at length in the next set of amendments.
This whole compliance costs area indicates to me that business have not done their homework. I fully understand the argument of Mitch Hook—the head of the Food and Grocery Council, and a very reputable person—because it obviously makes sense from their point of view for there to be a common rate across their whole industry. They are arguing to their book, and quite rightly so. That is a sound argument. I happen not to agree with it but I think it is a sound argument. But do not come and say to us, as you did in your response, Minister, that these people—who, as far as I know, have never run a business in a country which has a GST or VAT which zero rates or concessionally taxes food—talk about it being a disaster and a nightmare, when it is not a disaster and a nightmare for all those countries which have chosen to go this route.
Far, far more countries have chosen to zero rate or concessionally tax food than have done otherwise, and they have done so for equity reasons, for social justice reasons, and because they know that it does not affect efficiency and does not affect the economic outcomes. However, this amendment does recognise that there is some increase in compliance costs and it would seek to compensate for that increase in compliance costs which would emerge. That really is the purpose of our moving this amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-13,"—To briefly reply, I think that you, having accused everyone else of making a lot of assertions, did precisely that. In your comments you referred to countries which either zero rate or differentiate food. I think you might have mentioned Austria. Well, the standard rate of the VAT in Austria is 20 per cent, but the food rate is 10 per cent. In Finland the standard rate is 22 per cent, but the rate for food is 12 per cent. 
 We are having a 10 per cent GST. There is no point in quoting countries in which the rate that you quote for food is in fact higher than the 10 per cent rate which we are imposing. That adds some perspective to some of the comments that you have made.
In relation to what is a desirable tax system, a desirable tax system is one which emphasises efficiency, equity and simplicity. I stress the word `equity'. We are going to be into that debate in relation to the next amendment. Frankly, in all of the material that was presented to the committee, no-one believes that it would in any way increase the efficiency of the system or its simplicity. We would argue that the equity is severely compromised. I leave my comments there because we are going to be joining the major debate on this after we deal with this amendment.
Let me just make one quick point to the Senate. As a result of the length of the debate we have had, we have cemented ourselves into the 10 longest debates in Senate history. In fact, this is the seventh longest debate ever and, of course, we are still going. We have spent some 39 hours and 53 minutes debating the ANTS bill, including over 24 hours in committee to consider just 36 amendments. I remind the Senate of the progress, or the lack of progress, that we have been making.
Yesterday there were a number of examples where an inordinate amount of time was taken up repeating the same points. I try to keep my remarks to the minimum. I have tried to respond to questions which have been raised, and to deal with them in a sensible fashion, but there were a number of cases yesterday where speaker after speaker rose on this debate and repeated essentially the same argument as the previous speaker. The Labor Party was particularly guilty of that. We will not be supporting your amendment and the sooner we move on to the major amendment that you seek to move, the better.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-05-13,"—An unfortunate start, Senator Kemp. You are being so provocative this morning, accusing us of tedious repetition, when we only have to look at the substance of the answers that we have obtained from you. The amendment that we are dealing with and the 
 following amendments from the Democrats are significant. They relate to food in all its aspects—everything from the amendment that we are dealing with at the present time through to issues relating to tuckshops and other matters. It is not my intention to waste the time of the Senate, and I know it is not Labor's intention to waste the time of the Senate. We have been quite properly drawing attention to the inadequacies, the fundamental flaws and the fundamental unfairness of a goods and services tax.
Labor will not be supporting this amendment because we do not support a GST. The most effective way to ensure that the horrors of a GST are not imposed on the Australian public is to ensure there is no GST. That is Labor's consistent position, a very principled position. We do not believe you can make a soft and cuddly GST. That is the commitment we gave to the Australian electorate and that is the commitment we intend to honour absolutely.
Senator Murray has touched on some of the issues. He read out a list of countries and the way in which they treat food with respect to GST, or value added tax, or whatever the particular variant is called in those countries. It went further than being used by Senator Murray as an attempt to enhance his argument on food; it showed that there are a significant number of countries that have a GST. But, if you reflect on those countries, what has a GST done for those countries?
We have numerous examples in Europe and throughout North America, with the important exception of the United States, which does not have a GST. If we look at advanced economies, most now have GSTs or VATs, and the government has made that point on many occasions. However, there are two economies that do not have a GST: one is the United States and the other is Australia. The assertion is continually made that the Australian economy will do better under a GST. History will tell us whether that is right or wrong. If the GST is defeated—as Labor certainly hopes it will be; we will be fighting for that to the end—and if we then have a look at the economic progress of Australia over the following years, it will be interesting 
 to see whether the economy does better than its current performance. I suspect that it will not.
The government's argument is that we need a GST to improve and continue to improve economic performance. On the other hand, of course, the Treasurer argues that the economy is doing very well, to paraphrase the Treasurer; I am sure he would use slightly more extravagant language than that. We do not see that, for a whole range of reasons that Labor senators have touched on this debate.
I am not going to waste the time of the Senate. We are anxious for this legislation to progress, and to get to the final vote by the end of June because we want to vote this whole, horrible GST package down. We are not in the business of making a GST, with all of its horrible needles and spikes. We are not in the game of pulling out a couple of those needles and spikes. The most effective way to deal with this issue is to simply say no to a GST on the final vote, when we get to it. My hope, Senator Kemp, is that we will get to it reasonably soon.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-13,"—I am glad Senator Sherry got up because, frankly, the remarks of the Assistant Treasurer exasperated me. Minister, I do not know what your experience in life is or what your background is. I do not know whether you have experience in business or accounting systems or anything of that sort. The compliance cost issue—and there are, I think, six people here in the chamber who were on the committee—relates to the suggestion by us that food is differently rated from the standard rate. It does not matter whether it is nought or 10 per cent or whether it is six per cent or 21 per cent, when you are introducing accounting systems, the compliance cost arises because you have to vary the price, you have to vary the system, you have to change the computer codes and you have to change the pricing. The compliance costs come from the administration and the management of a differential rate. For you to stand up and say that all those countries have a different rate, and therefore my argument does not count, misses the entire point.
I do not think it is typical of the whole government, but it shows that the Assistant Treasurer has not followed the evidence that was put before the committee. I cannot understand why you have not done that. This is the most important bill that you are ever going to carry as Assistant Treasurer, and you have not mastered the basic argument that the compliance cost in the differential rating of food arises because it is a different rate—not because it is zero versus 10 per cent. The same problem arises when it is six per cent versus 21 per cent. I hope that you have grasped that basic point. If you cannot understand that, I almost do not understand why we are having the debate. It just floors me.
The second point you made, which again illustrates that you have not followed the evidence, was that no-one has argued that making food zero rated is good for the economy. The very people who agree with you that food should be taxed argue that if food were not taxed employment would go up and the economic benefits would be positive. Have a look at the Murphy evidence. Have a look at Professor Dixon's evidence. These are people who support your position that food should be taxed, but they recognise that, if it were not taxed, there would be positive economic benefits to the agriculture and food industries. Two out of the three advisers who attended that evidence are here, and they can tell you that fact. So please do not misrepresent to those of us who were there the professional evidence that was given—it really is exasperating. Hold to your policy position, but please do not do that, because it invalidates everything else you say.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-13,"—I would like to indicate my concern about some of the comments Senator Sherry made in relation to the position of the ALP. Over the last day or so, the ALP have been suggesting that if a GST is shoved in place—and it will not be the Greens who support it—it could not be changed or fixed. I can understand their saying that this package cannot be made warm and cuddly, but my concern is that the ALP are saying that if the GST were forced on the Australian community against its wishes, and if food were not 
 exempted, they would never move to change that situation—that there is nothing about a flat rate GST that they could ever change.
We have heard evidence that smart economies around the world recognise that environmental costs of pollution should be built into the costs of buying goods and services. We know that countries that want to encourage certain sorts of progressive employment creating industries are saying that that should be encouraged by ways of differential tax. I am concerned about the message that is coming through from the opposition about the inequalities or inequities that exist within this package. Does it mean that if it ever gets shoved through against the wishes of the Greens and the ALP, food would remain at the same rate as the rest of the package? Does it mean that whatever problems they and others have identified during the committee process of inquiry—whatever bad process, whatever bad drafting, whatever is wrong with this bill now, including the high-roller taxes—will stay in concrete? That is a really interesting issue.
Is it that they want it to be bad and to leave it that way? Or is it that, if a GST gets put through with all its problems, there would be some sort of commitment from the ALP to leave it in exactly the form it lands in? I do not personally think that they would do that. However, I do need to clarify this. Would it stay the same? They are saying it would be impossible to stop having a GST. We all know that once you have given money to the states you will never get it back, so is the reality that it will be set in concrete in all of its elements? Or is there potential to do with it what you could do with a consumption tax? The progressive smart countries of the world are using consumption taxes to move ahead on ecological issues, on sustainability issues and on equity issues. Could that be done? Or is the Labor Party saying that, however bad it is, if it ever falls to the ground, that is where it will stay?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-05-13,"—I think there would not be any disagreement with the position that food is one of the essentials of life. I certainly recall during the committee hearings when Senator 
 Harradine was sitting next to me on a number of occasions and we were involved in questioning of witnesses that he rightly drew out the point that it was not just food. We were looking at issues relating to transport, public transport, power and clothing—they are other essentials of life.
The reason I make that comment is that this approach to taxing the essentials of life, including food, is but one of the major flaws in a goods and services tax. It is just one, but it is a very major one. Labor has consistently highlighted the other issues relating to the adverse impact of a GST—the poorly designed compensation package, particularly in respect of pensioners, self-funded retirees and a significant number of people who have not yet reached pension age and who are not receiving some form of social security, for example low income farmers and persons who either have retired voluntarily or have effectively been forced into retirement prior to pension age. We have highlighted issues relating to inflation, pass through, the impact on small business—and the list goes on. That is why Labor believes that the GST should be voted down. And I look forward to the day that we do vote it down.
—But will you repeal it?
—That, Senator Kemp, brings me to my next point, which is directly related to the issue that Senator Margetts raised. The Labor Party's tax policy will be presented to a national conference which is now scheduled for July-August next year. I am happy to say that it will be in my home state of Tasmania yet again. That is when our tax policy will be presented to the Australian electorate for consideration. We are not developing our tax policy on the run. I am certainly not developing it here in the Senate; I would not be here for long if I attempted to.
—You have no policy position.
—The election was held last October and Labor is developing a comprehensive tax policy for the next election. We will do that in our own time for presentation to our national conference next year. I am certainly not privy to advance copies of 
 any tax policy; it does not exist at the present time.
—Will you repeal it if it goes through?
—Our tax policy will be unveiled at the national conference next year.
—And you will be one of many who vote for it.
—I hope I will be one of many to vote for it. It is not for others to suggest what our approach will be at this point in time.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—I will be very happy for you, Senator Margetts, to come down as an observer to our national conference next year; I would be happy for you to come and observe our tax debate. We are the alternative government. I look forward to seeing you there, and Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Lees and Senator Murray.
—I do not think it is a genuine alternative.
—As far as Labor is concerned, there are only two alternatives: there is your GST with all its inequities and unfairness, and there is Labor's clear position—no GST. You could not have a clearer principle.
—No tax position.
—I will take that interjection. That is not correct and you know it, Senator O'Chee. Our tax policy will be unveiled at the national conference next year.
—Senator O'Chee will not be here to vote for it.
—We definitely know that Senator O'Chee will not be here to vote on our tax policy when it is presented as legislation when we are re-elected to government. So we do not have to worry about you, Senator O'Chee, in respect of that.
Senator O'Chee interjecting—
—Senator O'Chee, I did not want to get this debate off to a bad start. We are making progress, as Senator Kemp made very clear in a press release, although he did make some unkind comment.
—When is morning tea?
—I hope you are not thinking of food; this is a critical amendment. I have consistently stated in the Senate that we are anxious to get to a final vote on this issue; it will occur by the end of June. We are thoroughly examining the issues relating to a GST and I believe we are exposing the fundamental flaws of a GST. We will continue to do that in the Senate; that is part of the political process. We have only to look at what happened last week with the exposure of this outrageous concession given to high rollers. I do not want to put gloom on Senator Kemp's day, but Labor is consistent in its approach to a GST.
—He is looking much happier today, though.
—He is looking a touch happier as more time elapses between last week and this week. Once again, I make it very clear that Labor does not support a GST. We are not in the game of trying to remove the horrible spikes and pins in the GST, of trying to produce some sort of teddy bear version of a GST. If you hug the GST you are still going to get a horrible shock. The Democrats are in the game of hugging the GST. That is their business. I respect your arguments, but we do not agree with your approach. We are not in the business of hugging a GST. Our tax reform proposals will be developed in adequate time, presented to the national conference next year and then presented to the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-13,"—I will be very brief. The response to Senator Margetts's question was a classic example of a bit of ducking and weaving, but people who read the Hansard  can judge whether I am correct or not. A couple of remarks made by Senator Murray cannot go unchallenged. As Senator Murray knows, I am slow to be provoked, but I do not think they can go unchallenged. Senator Murray relied rather heavily on evidence given by Professor Dixon. Professor Dixon told the Senate inquiry:
In the long run, exempting food has a negligible but negative impact on economic welfare under either labour market assumption.
So the very best evidence that could be quoted may have been taken out of context. I think Senator Murray may have accused me of taking something out of context, so I put that back on the record. We do not accept Senator Murray's estimate that 400,000 businesses will be affected.
—40,000.
—Sorry, 40,000. The tax office estimate is 370,000. I think Senator Murray has excluded a large range of businesses in the food chain which properly should be counted in this particular proposal. Senator Murray, I just make those comments to add a little bit of perspective. When I was quoting the differential rates, I was referring to that part of your speech where you were talking about zero rating food. I wanted to get on the record that there were various ways one could read what other countries are doing, so I think my remarks should be viewed in that context.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-13,"—I will not pursue this issue anymore so that we can move on to the next thing. Just on notice to you, Minister: could you ask your advisers to provide the ATO list of all businesses affected by food? I asked for it way back when—whenever they appeared before the committee—and I have not yet seen that list. I would like to compare it with the ABS list.
—The question is that Democrats amendment No. 1 on sheet 1353 be agreed to.

These are amongst the most important amendments that the Democrats are presenting to the Senate on this package of legislation, and they are the amendments that seek to make food GST free. If these amendments are not acceptable at this point in time—and I suspect that is where we are going today; we will have to see—then we will be trying still to make a number of other changes to the package. But if, at the end of the day, we do not recommit and pass these amendments, we will not be voting for the GST. I will outline the arguments for the amendments initially and when some time permits I will then go back and look specifically at how it will all operate.
The GST on food is the most regressive and most unfair part of the GST as proposed by the government. This is because food makes up 24 per cent of the spending of low income households but only 12 per cent of spending of the top 20 per cent of households. The GST makes its impact on low income households even worse because the price effect of the GST on food is three to four times that of other goods, and this is because food—other than confectionery—is now not taxed.
Treasury itself has conceded this point. We only need to look at what Treasury has actually agreed to in terms of how much various items will go up to see that. Let us just go through a few. Fresh meat rises by 6.6 per cent; fruit, 5.7 per cent; vegetables, 5.7 per cent; and flour and a whole range of cereal products are up by 6.2 per cent. So Treasury itself has conceded that there is a significant increase in the cost of all those items that are at the moment not taxed. Then we look at other items: confectionery is going to go up by about 1.7 per cent only; soft drinks are going to come down—because we 
 have them at a higher rate, they will come back down—to 10 per cent; electronic equipment will fall by 5.5 per cent; new cars will fall by 8.3 per cent; and financial services will fall by 10.6 per cent. It is significant that all of these latter items are consumed in greater proportions by high income earners.
We have heard, particularly in the last 24 hours, a great deal about the need to rein in inflation. Indeed, Senator Hill neatly avoided the real question that I asked him yesterday and went off on some sidetracks, including inflation. We agree: of course we have to keep inflation down. So let us actually do it in this package. Treasury estimates that the impost of the GST on food makes up three-quarters of the inflation impact of this package—in other words, three-quarters of the 1.9 per cent inflation rate caused by the GST in the second year. A GST without food would have an inflation rate by 2001 of just 0.5 per cent. So where is the logic? Where is the consistency? Do we want to keep inflation down? If we do, let us do it by taking food out.
Chris Murphy, in his longer term modelling, found that taking food out of the GST would see the inflation rate fall in the longer term from 0.9 per cent to a negative—to minus 0.5 per cent. In other words, if we take food out of the package, the price impact of the GST in the longer term is actually negative. That means that, in the longer term, there will be virtually no need, in an average sense, for any compensation for the GST with food out. Obviously, in the short term there is a significant need for compensation and an ongoing need for compensation for the losers because, as we know, averages hide losers. Pensioners, for example, will still need significant compensation, but it will be a lot less than if we keep food in the package.
The extraordinary thing about these price effects is that food makes up just $4 billion to $5 billion of the $32 billion raised by the GST—that is, 13 per cent of the revenue base—but 75 per cent to 100 per cent of the adverse price effect of the GST and much more so for low income earners. This is why food is so important and why we will not walk away from it. That is why virtually 
 every major church and welfare group has entered into the tax debate and has become involved in the issue of taking food out—zero rating food. I will just go through some on the list: ACOSS, Anglicare, the Anglican Church, the Catholic Church, the Uniting Church, the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Consumers Association, the Australian Association of Social Workers, the Carers Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Association, the Public Health Association, ATSIC and the National Rural Health Alliance.
These are the people who know what is going to happen. Most of them work at the coalface. They know the impact the GST will have on low income families and on low income earning individuals. They work every day with those people who are already having trouble making ends meet, and they see very clearly what is going to happen and how low income earners will be hit very hard.
The conclusion that the Democrats have come to that the GST has to be taken off food is not just shared by church and welfare bodies; it is the view held by the governments in 23 of the 27 OECD countries that have a VAT or GST system. All but two European countries, for example, provide concessional treatment for some or all food. Why? Because the case for taxing food is regressive, which is undisputed in those countries. The compelling argument is no longer even debated. If 23 out of 27 OECD countries can do it, why should we be an exception and why should it cause so many problems in Australia? Only four countries tax food at the full rate. They are the ones that have listened to the simplicity arguments and have gone down that road. Let us look at who they are, what their tax rates are and what the circumstances are in those countries.
Let us start with Japan. Their GST rate has been only three per cent on everything from day one. So it is not such a problem if food is included in Japan. New Zealand is a separate case with major problems. I will put that to one side and just look at Norway and Denmark, the other two countries. It is worth noting what the social safety net is in these 
 two countries that tax food fully, and indeed in Sweden, which taxes almost all food. They have the most generous social security systems in the world. Income support, as one retires, is typically linked to a person's former income. Retirement benefits are between 70 and 80 per cent of the person's former income—not 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. They do not have the levels of poverty that we have in Australia.
Internationally, with New Zealand put out as the odd example and one that I certainly do not want this country following, we see that we are on very solid ground and in very good company when we call for GST-free food. We are also on very solid ground economically. I note the government has not attempted to refute our economic arguments. There has been a lot of bluster and a lot of the going back to the mandate mantra, but they have not taken apart the argument economically because they cannot.
The Senate tax committee commissioned Australia's two most prominent private sector modellers, Peter Dixon and Chris Murphy, to model the GST with food in it and the GST with food taken out. Their models came up the same results on all of the major variables: GDP growth, exports, business investment, consumer welfare and consumption. The results were virtually the same whether food was in or food was out.
Let us put it another way to make it as simple as possible for the government, because it has escaped them so far. You do not need to tax food to deliver all the economic benefits of the GST. You still get a 1.8 per cent boost in GDP but you get that without the downside—a massive redistribution of the indirect tax burden from the rich to the poor.
We ran over most of the arguments yesterday, and I will skip over those quickly. They are that it is all too complex and that compliance costs will soar. I think we have very clearly put those arguments to bed. I realise the government is never going to accept it, but those arguments are a nonsense. Then we move on to the other argument run by the Treasurer—the one he used again yesterday at the Press Club—that it is going to somehow unravel the package and blow out the 
 deficit. It is not going to unravel anything. It has not unravelled anything in 23 other OECD countries. It is not going to touch the deficit because we have completely funded taking food out within the package. We do not want the budget surplus tapped into at all. We look at this as an entity in itself within the package. You pay for taking food out by adjusting income tax rates.
We have always argued that this is the way we have to go: treat the tax package as an entity unto itself. If the minister wants to look at the detail on or the amendments to those bills before this chamber—when we get to them—regarding tax cuts, they outline our specific proposals. These amendments will save $3.6 billion, fully funding the exemption of food in the first year, and still leave full tax cuts in place—indeed even better tax cuts in place for 69 per cent of taxpayers.
The government also throws up the tired old furphy that exempting food will benefit high income earners more than low income earners. In percentage terms—and that is what is important—the argument is blatantly untrue. In dollar terms it is true: high income earners will get some benefits back. But under our adjusted tax scales, they are losing money to pay for making food GST free. In other words, they are losing maybe $40 a week in their tax cuts but they will pick up $8 to $10 a week because their groceries will not cost so much. It will balance itself out. We do not have a problem with that. The problem lies at the bottom end of the income scale.
To give you an example, a taxpayer on $80,000 a year would gain, on average, $8.93 a week from the exemption of food but would have their tax cut reduced by $49 a week. This is a clawback under our amendments, and we are perfectly happy to live with that. As many of the church groups have said, it does not matter that removing the tax on food is also going to mean that the basket of groceries is cheaper for those on high incomes. It is their tax cuts that are going to change in order to pay for that. I would argue that our proposed tax scales are much fairer than what you are proposing in ANTS because, for example, a taxpayer on $20,000 a year would see their tax bill reduced by 
 $13.35 a week. That is $3 more than you are currently proposing, Minister, within your ANTS package.
The Democrats scale ensures that low income earners are better off by reducing the huge and unfair tax cuts for high income earners. Regardless of Mr Costello's continued chanting, it is all fully funded, with no impact on the budget bottom line. He commented yesterday that, if we could come up with a package that did not cost millions, he would be interested. Here is a package that effectively costs nothing, and he is still not interested in any negotiations. Our proposals are a lot fairer. They are a lot more affordable than what the government is presenting. They preserve the economic benefits of tax reform but actually deliver a fairer sharing of the tax burden.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-13,"—I was waiting to see whether there were any others who wished to make a contribution to this debate.
—We are anxious to move it on.
—Excellent. That is the best news I have heard all day. Let me make some responses to the points made. First of all, the Australian Democrats argument for making food GST free is essentially that it would make the government's reforms more equitable. I think that is the key element. Senator Murray nods, and I take it that we are addressing that particular concern. Making food GST free would be a very inefficient way of delivering assistance to the needy. This is because the benefits of a GST-free treatment of food go to everyone who purchases GST-free goods. A better approach clearly is to target compensation to those who need it. The evidence that was given to the committee is quite interesting on this. I think we naturally look at the evidence which backs up our case, but in my view the overwhelming weight of evidence strongly supports the government position on this. The fact of the matter is that the higher income groups spend more money on food. I am looking anxiously at Senator Murray to see whether he agrees with my assertion on that.
—No, we don't.
—Not as a percentage.
—But the total amount of money spent on food tends to rise as the income goes up. There was evidence to the Senate committee by Access which I have here. We can all argue about the Access data, but let me quote what they said:
Expenditure on food expressed in dollars per household varies markedly between equivalent disposable income quintiles, but rises from about $4,850 for the bottom household income quintile to about $7,100 for the top household income quintile, an increase of about 46.3 per cent.
That is the case. We can all argue about these figures and we may have our own comments on the Access figures, but I think the basic principle is unarguable: expenditure on food by household groups rises as the income itself rises. Therefore, what will happen here is not an equitable treatment. It will mean giving more benefit to higher income people than would be given to lower income people. That is one of the arguments, and I think it is an important one. When you want to run the equity argument, I think you have got to take into account those issues, and they should be effectively addressed in your remarks.
In relation to what other countries do, I know there is the old saying, Senator Lees, that there are lies, damn lies and statistics—
—There are facts too.
—You have quoted from a table on what happens in Europe. I guess it was a similar table to the one I have here. This is the table of VAT treatment of food in OECD countries. Eighteen of the 25 tax food.
—How many do it at the full rate?
—My understanding and information is that two actually input tax food and five zero rate food. As I said, you could look at this table and say, `Hey, most countries tax food.' That is a fair assumption from this table.
—So are you offering us two per cent?
—No. That is the point I am making: most countries do that. Then you look at the comparative food prices in other countries. Some evidence was given which 
 shows that in fact food prices in Australia are substantially lower than food prices in other countries. So I put the point to you that, on the equity argument, you have got to address the fact that higher income groups spend more on food than lower income groups, so presumably the vast amounts of your benefits will flow to people on higher incomes.
—Use the tax cuts to pay for it.
—I know you shake your head and say you do not agree with me, but I think that is an important issue. When you look at what other countries do in taxing food, I think that is an important issue, and I have quoted some figures there for the edification of the Senate. So I think your case is not one which is sustained by the evidence before the committee. Very few people, including the modellers which I think were preferred by your party, supported the exclusion of food from the package, including on welfare grounds. So the government will not be supporting the amendments that you have moved.
You referred to Mr Costello's comments yesterday. The only point I would make is that it is hard to negotiate when you say, `Well, we are not going to do this. This is our bottom line. This is non-negotiable.' Then you say, `But people should negotiate with us.' You are saying that on all these issues these things are not negotiable. Then you say that we should negotiate. We were elected to government. The government puts together its tax package based on the election promises that we gave at the last election. Then you come to us and say, `We won't talk to you. These are our non-negotiable demands.' Senator, I would have to put to you that I think that puts the comments by the Treasurer in a slightly different perspective than the one you had in your comments in the Hansard.
In summary, I make the point that we are opposed to this measure. We are opposed on a variety of grounds. Seeing that the equity ground was one that was strongly run, I think that Senator Lees' comments have not addressed that. There are other great complexity arguments that certainly can be raised. We have had the bakery people coming out and 
 raising particular complexities in how this would apply to bread, and I think there are a whole host of other arguments that can be very easily run.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-05-13,"—I was not going to speak again at this stage but I cannot let the comments of Senator Kemp's on negotiations go. Minister, I have now been in this place 10 years—not nearly as long as many, I realise—and I have never struck what I guess has become known as a `negotiating process'—I would not call it that—like this before. With other ministers we have been able to say, `Okay, let's agree to disagree on that and let's get down to areas where we think there is some room to move'—and, as we heard yesterday, there is some room where you are happy to move—`Let's talk about that.' But, no, unless we are prepared to put our principles aside and agree with the government on key issues, there will be no negotiations on things like diesel, health, education and charities—nothing.
With health legislation, for example, we have said very clearly, `Okay, you're never going to get me to agree that giving away $1.8 billion unchecked to private health insurance is a good idea.' But there are still other issues we can work on, other ways we can approach the problem and other matters that we can still talk to ministers about. It was the same thing under the Labor government—we were not going to have a bar of several issues that they brought up in respect of health but we could work on others.
As we know in this debate, we may see these bills go through at the end of the day and, as with Wik—yes, we saw them go through at the end of the day—we may have some of our amendments in the bills. So we want to stay at the table, negotiate and talk to government, agree to disagree on food if we have to. But we want to at least talk to the government on a range of other issues that we are going to be voting on as this process proceeds. But to say, `You do it our way or we don't talk to you' is not negotiation",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-05-13,"—I was not going to be provoked into making a response but I could not help but 
 wonder, when Senator Kemp started talking about pastrycooks, whether I was looking at the gingerbread man. Senator Kemp referred to the issue of high income earners spending more on food. In monetary terms that would be true, but you have to look at percentages. If Senator Kemp argues that high income earners spend more on food, I suspect that is true of everything, every conceivable item. High income earners do spend more on clothing. I suspect they spend more on housing.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—On health; that is right, so you have to look at the percentages. There may be a couple of areas, but I certainly cannot think of any of the essentials of life where a high income earner would spend less in money terms. The reason they spend more money on essentials of life is they have more money to spend and this government—in its income tax cuts—is giving them more money to spend, much more money to spend than low and middle income earners. That is just one of the essentially unfair features of the government's tax package.
As I said earlier, we are anxious to get to the final vote on this; we are anxious to vote the GST down. Food is one of many of the essentials of life—essentials including public transport, power, rent and housing. We do not believe there should be a tax on those essentials of life, full stop, because we do not believe there should be a GST, full stop. That is the commitment Labor gave in the lead-up to the last election. Labor intends to keep faith with its supporters and the people that voted for it on that basis—and I might note in passing that the majority of Australians hold that view: no GST. Labor, having given that pledge, that commitment and that promise, intends to honour in the Senate that commitment and promise to the Australian electorate.
We are not against tax reform and it is not correct to say, as Senator Kemp has touched on occasionally, we are against tax reform. There were certainly in our 13 years in office some very important changes to Australia's tax system. As they were needed and as they 
 were necessary we introduced them. Labor will be developing its tax package for the next election and, as I said earlier, that will be discussed in detail and unveiled at our national conference. I am not privy to the developing details but I do know one thing and I can say this with confidence: the Labor Party does not support a GST—defeat this GST in the Senate in the next month; defeat the GST—and the GST will not be in the tax package that we are going to take to the next election.
—But will you repeal it?
—It is not a matter of a repeal, Senator Kemp, because we are insistent that we vote down the GST. We know we are never going to convince you. I would certainly hope we can convince the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine that they should join with Labor to vote down the GST.
They should do so not just because it taxes the essentials of life, such as food, clothing, power, rent and housing costs, but also because of the inequitable income tax cuts. For people who earn $70,000 or $80,000 a year there are tax cuts of the order of nine, 10 or 11 per cent—depending on your family circumstances—but for low and middle income earners the tax cuts being offered by the government are much lower in monetary and percentage terms.
They should do so for the sorts of reasons that have been explored comprehensively over the last few months relating to pensioner compensation and self-funded retiree compensation. We had another example yesterday with Senator Cook's question to Senator Newman. The budget papers themselves show that within three or four years the so-called compensation for pensioners will be eroded and will disappear.
But it is not just pensioners and self-funded retirees who will be affected. A significant group in the community who have not reached retirement age and do not receive social security in some form will also be disadvantaged. The impacts on inflation and jobs are the sorts of very substantial issues as to why a GST should be voted down. I do not intend to make further comments. We are 
 anxious for this debate to move along, to deal with these amendments and to get to the final vote by the end of June when hopefully we will see the end of this GST within the Australian political and economic system forever.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-13,"—I would like to ask the Democrats, whose amendment this is, where I as a citizen would stand with the GST in the following situation. Yesterday I went down to the food store—to Aussies here in Parliament House, but it could be any food store in the country—and bought a carton of soya milk and a banana roll for my lunch. Today I have decided to buy a carton of ordinary milk and a roll plus a banana separately and to go away and put the two together and have my lunch. Will I be treated any differently, as far as the GST is concerned under the Democrat amendments, today as compared with yesterday?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1999-05-13,"—First of all, let me tell Senator Brown that I believe he would save three or four cents today—so congratulations, well done. The Assistant Treasurer has said that he has statistics on the OECD. He seemed to say that, if you look at all the OECD countries, then you will see that naturally the government is right. I do not think that is right; I do not think that is correct at all. In fact, if you look at all the OECD countries and the way they tax food you will see that world's best practice would be to either zero rate or give a concessionary rate to food. I have a few statistics here that I am sure you would be interested in.
As Senator Lees said and as the Assistant Treasurer said, of the 29 OECD countries, 27 have a GST or a VAT and of those 27, 23 either zero rate food or they have a concessionary tax on it. Let us go through them: Ireland, Poland, Korea, Canada, Mexico and the UK all zero rate food; Spain, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Turkey tax food at four per cent or less—one-fifth of the standard rate; France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Greece, Portugal and the Czech Republic tax food at between four and eight per cent—about one-third of the 
 standard VAT rate in those countries. So of the 23 OECD countries that have a concessionary tax on food, six zero rate food, five tax it at a very low nominal rate, seven tax it at around one-third of the standard rate and five tax it at rates over 10 per cent but still less than the variable rate of GST or VAT. So only New Zealand, Japan, Denmark and Norway fully tax food at the standard rate, which Australia now wants to do. Sweden taxes most food at the standard rate.
When we are talking about having an internationally comparable tax system, our proposal is a mainstream proposition; your proposal is the one that is out there. Twenty-three out of 27 OECD countries accept that food is a special case, that taxing food hurts the poor more than the rich and that good tax policy and good political policy deems that food should be treated at either a zero rate or a low concessional rate.
Another thing that comes from that international evidence is that most countries have opted for a food exemption which focuses on basic foods, as our amendment does. It is not just the Irish option, it is also the German, the Belgian, the Spanish, the French, the Italian, the Austrian, the Portuguese, the Mexican, the Canadian, the Turkish, the Polish, the Czech and the Hungarian option. It is the option of lots of countries. In fact, of the 23 countries that concessionally or zero rate food, 17 distinguish between basic foods and either junk food or takeaway food.
Our amendment reflects the practice adopted in most OECD countries in one way or another. It is the Democrats, not the government, who are benchmarking tax policy against world practice. It is the Democrats who are looking carefully at how other countries have dealt with tax issues and who have sought to learn from that experience, which tells us that you have to take food out.
What about the countries that fully tax food? As Senator Lees has told us, Japan has a GST of about five per cent. That is hardly an impost, although it was enough to cost a government office and also to cause an economic recession because consumers did object to that five per cent. New Zealand 
 started with a GST of 10 per cent with some compensation. Two years later the rate went up and the compensation went down—surprise, surprise! So New Zealand does not present a great case for taxing food. The other countries that fully tax food are in Scandinavia—Norway, Denmark and, by and large, Sweden. In each of those countries, as Senator Lees has told us, the social security system is far more generous than it is in Australia—much, much more generous. Social security is also tied to income in those countries, so as wages go up so does compensation go up. That is not the case in Australia. The compensation offer from the government is nowhere near as generous as the treatment in those Scandinavian countries. So we presume that the government, in offering inadequate compensation, is benchmarking itself against the famous New Zealand.
A recent paper by Robert Stephens to a tax reform conference at the University of Melbourne looked at the New Zealand experience. He concluded that the comprehensive GST combined with a flatter tax scale has reduced the progressiveness of their own tax system. In 1982, those on three times average earnings paid 15 per cent more in tax than the those on average earnings, but by 1998 that difference had fallen to only 6.3 per cent. Further, he found that the taxing of food had a lot to do with this. Exempting food in a revenue neutral way would increase the disposable income of the bottom quintile by 0.5 per cent but reduce it for the top quintile, where we all are, by 0.2 per cent. And he found that compensation was inadequate—it did not last. Most importantly, he found that the failure to compensate adequately explains why poverty increases substantially with family size.
Similar studies by the OECD comparing Sweden and Denmark with the Netherlands and the UK also found the same thing—taxing food is regressive. Interestingly, the last time that Denmark increased its VAT by three per cent—that was in 1992—no extra compensation was paid at all. So the international experience tells us that 
 compensation tends not to last and it tends not to reach all of those who need it.
How does the concessional treatment of food compare with compensation? It is a lot better. In Denmark, which taxes food, the VAT rate rose from 10 per cent in 1967 to 25 per cent in 1992—all without extra compensation. In the UK in the same period the VAT rose from 10 to 17.5 per cent, but the tax on food stayed at zero. In Ireland, the VAT standard rate rose four per cent but food stayed at zero. In the Netherlands, from 1969 to 1984 the standard rate rose six per cent but food rates stayed frozen. In France the standard rate has risen four per cent and the food rate has been reduced. In fact, in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, France, Spain and the UK the standard rate has risen by an average of 5.4 per cent but the food rate is either the same or lower than it was when the VAT started. In only two of those 23 OECD countries with concessional treatment of food has the food rate risen in recent years by more than the standard rate, and that was as part of budget austerity budgets.
So, in 21 out of 23 countries, once food won concessional treatment it stayed that way. Government has a distinct reluctance worldwide—not just here—to increase taxes, particularly taxes on food. If we win this argument now there is a good chance that food will stay GST free. By contrast, social security compensation is under threat in most Western countries. In Australia, the government boasts of how many people it has thrown off social security benefits and about the fact that $1.8 billion of social safety net promises were broken in the 1996 budget.
So international evidence tells the Democrats that the fight about food is worth having, and it is worth having right now. If we win it now, that is it—it is won. If we lose it now, that is it—we will never get that back. I urge senators to reject any GST on food. It is unfair, and it fails to meet international best practice for a fair and efficient tax system as a real and permanent impost on the poorest in our community.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-13,"—Senator Bourne, in responding to my 
 question about the specifics of the bread roll and milk, said tritely, `Well, you might save 3c or 4c.' This is a serious matter. We are dealing here with the purchasing power of people right across this nation. Let me say to Senator Bourne and the Democrats that, if we are dealing with $3 or $4 lunches, 10 per cent of the GST makes not 3c or 4c difference but 30c or 40c difference. If you translate across to 10 million lunches, you are dealing with a $3 million or $4 million a day difference in the taxed as against the non-taxed food. If you add on top of that the cost of trying to determine where the GST line falls a la this Democrat amendment on the small shopkeepers, the small business keepers in this country, the cost becomes much greater again.
The problem here is that the good intentions of the Democrats to shield people through having the GST taken off food leads to the much wider difficulty of a failure to shield people in general from the GST. The points that the Democrats are making about the GST hitting poor people unfairly when it applies to food apply to the whole range of other things that people in the wider populace buy and consume. This is why the Greens from the outset have said that we are opposed to the GST because it is increasing the gap between rich and poor in our country. To say, `We'll save it on food but we basically endorse the GST in its wider impact on the community', is a very false means of defending the poorer people in this country.
The Democrats shepherded the potential for the GST through the last national election. As senators will be aware, I have said that in this place before. The Democrats said to the nation, `We will make this a nice GST', and people dropped their guard. Had they not done that I believe this government would not have been returned because of the justifiable fears that many voters—not least swinging voters—have about the impact of the GST on their future. But they did it. They cushioned the concern about the GST, and now we are here debating a GST in this place because the Democrats took that point of view at the last election. We are now seeing Democrat amendments which are aimed at making it a 
 nice GST. The problem for us is that we would not—and I believe should not—be entertaining a GST at all if it were not for that particular role taken by the Democrats.
I am not going to be satisfied with a response which says, `You'll save 3c or 4c', to a particular question I put to the Democrats on this matter of food when we were in committee. It is a very complicated amendment they are putting up. It may seem simple to them but to people out there on the street in Australia it is complicated, and for small business it is expensive, difficult and frustrating.
As Senator Margetts said, a GST minus anything is a better GST. But we should not have a GST with any component of the necessities of life cut out from it—food being an obvious one. We should not have this GST at all. If we get it, it will be because of the Democrats' role in enabling the government to get away with the presentation of the GST at the last election.
I want Senator Bourne, Senator Lees or any of the other Democrat senators to come back to that specific question about the 30c or 40c difference it makes to your lunch, your breakfast and your dinner if you are an average Australian. Where do you draw the line on this in a way which will not confuse people? How do you justify these amendments as a means of allowing the government's wider GST program to be brought in so that the average Australian taxpayer is saddled with it?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-05-13,"—I was hoping that we could get on with this, but I cannot ignore Senator Brown's comments. Wow—responsible for the election of the Howard government! I think there would be a few ministers who would disagree with that. Be that as it may, I am not going to walk away from our interest in staying at the table and talking about tax reform—it is a genuine interest. We believe that Australia's tax system does need an overhaul, but it has to be done fairly.
Unfortunately, Senator Brown has not listened to what I said when I opened this debate, so I will have to go through it again. 
 Very quickly on his issue of breakfast, lunch and dinner: there should be no difference whatsoever for breakfast for the average Australian. If your average Australian has cereal for breakfast, there would be no tax; with some milk, no tax.
—With soy milk?
—With soy milk, no tax. Senator, I recommend that you actually read our amendments. If the average Australian had toast with vegemite, there would be no tax on the bread, the butter and the vegemite. If we make ourselves some scrambled eggs and sausages, there would be no tax on any of that. So for breakfast, there would be nothing.
As for the bread roll, the milk and the butter, et cetera, for lunch, if you make your own lunch there would be no tax on anything. However, the tax line comes in when it is prepared. In other words, when the bread roll, the butter and the cheese are put together as a prepared product, tax would be payable.
Dinner would depend on whether you go out to a restaurant or whether you prepare it in your own home for yourself. Largely—and I refer you back to the amendments again—it would depend on the level of preparedness of that meal. Some of the reasons for drawing the line at prepared or unprepared food relate to jobs. As I said earlier, we do not believe that we should see Woolworths competing against the corner store where you may pick up a pizza on the way home and you would pay tax, yet you would not pay tax when you pick it up from the supermarket. If it is a prepared meal, it should be taxed; like should be taxed as like.
Senator Brown raised two other points. The first related to compensation for those small food retailers who are going to have some small compliance costs. We dealt with that amendment yesterday. We would have actually overcompensated food retailers. Amendment No. 1, which was voted down in this place, would have put in place a collection fee for small retailers equal to four per cent of the input credits on food products—in other words, they would keep some of the money—and that would cost around $120 million. The evidence before the 
 committee is that it would cost them only about $40 million. If that amendment had been passed, they would have been well overcompensated for any additional costs or any additional computer programming they would have done with some foods GST free and some foods not.
The final point is—this is one of the great furphies in this debate, and I am amazed that the government has not done a little bit more work on it; I understand they cannot because they are still sticking to their guns on food—if we take food out, the modelling brought before the committee by Chris Murphy found that the inflation rate would fall in the longer term from 0.9 per cent—this is the inflation impact of this package—to minus 0.5 per cent. In other words, by taking food out, you actually compensate for the extra money people are going to have to pay for a range of services. This still does not mean we need no compensation; far from it. Pensioners and low income earners still need that base level of compensation tied to average weekly earnings—properly, not to 25 per cent; more like 26½ per cent. But we have never been able to have discussions about this with government because they have not been interested in talking to us.
I say to Senator Brown: taking food out negates most of the need for any compensation. For those people who need compensation, the smaller package of compensation will be a smaller target for future governments to have a go at removing.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-13,"—I respond to that by asking Senator Lees whether she could give a clear exposition on the difference between the tax applying to prepared food as against not applying to unprepared food. She said it is not going to make any difference to breakfast, to cooked sausages or scrambled eggs. Is that the case for the working person who gets breakfast at a cafe or a takeaway place on the way to work? Can the senator please let the committee know about the trend which is universal but applies as much in Australia as anywhere else towards buying prepared foods rather than preparing meals at home? Has this been taken into account? Can Senator Lees 
 tell the committee what the changes are projected to be in Australia over the next 10 or 20 years as far as consumption of prepared meals for breakfast, dinner or tea by Australians, including low income earners, are concerned?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-05-13,"—I am happy to respond to that. There were some projections in the evidence before the committee, and I think it is safe to say that there may be some change in behavioural patterns if we see this GST go through. That was evidence from the dietitians and nutritionists, those people who are concerned about some of the trends for Australians to move to the very highly processed and prepared foods and away from basic fruit and vegetables. I am not going to say that it would be a problem if we were to see some switch back to what we would consider to be fresh food, but by no means is that the only area that will be untaxed. All tinned food would be untaxed. Indeed, virtually everything that is now tax free in the wholesale sales tax system is in here, except for the line as far as prepared foods are concerned. That is where the change is.
The other issue is jobs. In Canada there was a significant impact on the fast food industry because of the way it was introduced. We do not want to see a lot of young people's jobs under threat because of the unfair advantage supermarkets would get if their prepared food was untaxed compared with prepared food purchased elsewhere. It is fair to put a tax across-the-board. Looking at the basket of goods picked up by low income families at a supermarket, it is around 88 per cent of the items they purchase and around 83 per cent of their total expenditure on food. It has been done in a way which is certainly a lot fairer than the New Zealand model, which the government is proposing. At the end of the week, the basket of groceries taken home by low income families will be marginally cheaper in price because of the other items besides food that will come down in price—shampoos, soaps and all the other things that will come down to 10 per cent. The government cannot argue its case on the basis 
 that some items are coming down because, with a GST on food, the basket of groceries at the end of the week is going to cost significantly more.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-05-13,"—I would like to return to some comments the Assistant Treasurer made. I do not want to misquote you, Senator Kemp, but you were suggesting that the idea of not exempting food from the GST had overwhelming support from people or submissions before the inquiries. I suggest that you should say that you had support in the form of opinion but certainly not in the form of evidence. I would like the Assistant Treasurer to comment on those submissions to which my colleague Senator Murray has drawn the Senate's attention, specifically those submissions that looked at the positive impact, not only in equity terms but in employment terms, of removing food from the GST. When the Democrats are talking about that exemption, we are not just addressing the direct cost implications, which we have heard some reference to from the last speaker; we are also concerned with the indirect effects on matters such as employment. I have not heard a lot of debate on this matter today from the government.
My colleagues have already discussed the important point that the exclusion of food from a GST would not affect the benefits of taxation reform, but I would like to look at some of the employment aspects of the amendments before us. Indeed, the exclusion of food would have a positive effect on employment. We have seen this in evidence to the various committees. In particular, evidence provided to the Senate select committee by Econtech and Monash University demonstrated that exempting food from the GST would promote the creation of something like 8,000 to 12,000 extra jobs, primarily due to the change in the tax mix between direct and indirect taxes. Senator Lees, Leader of the Democrats, has just referred to the impact the exemption would have on reducing the inflationary effects of a GST. 
We found through the Senate select committee process that the inclusion of food in the GST would be very likely to have a dramatic and deleterious impact on employment prospects, specifically in rural Australia. Again, we have not heard a lot of discussion about some of the concerns raised not only at the Senate select committee but at the other committees about the impact of a GST on those areas. I heard much evidence to the employment and education committee from rural and remote regions about their fears and concerns regarding the impact of a GST on their areas, in particular in relation to employment.
Increases in the price of food due to the imposition of a GST would be likely to lead to dramatic changes in the pattern of consumption of fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and cereals. In particular, this could lead to a reduction in domestic sales. In the short term this could lead to the loss of around 10,600 jobs in the food and agriculture industries, the reduction of incomes of rural producers in many sectors, the loss of 2,500 jobs from outer rural regions to the cities, and an increase in the compliance cost for farmers. A food-free GST would have a dramatically different effect, particularly with the model proposed by the Australian Democrats. Modelling has estimated that there would be a doubling of the long-term economic benefits to agriculture and an increase in the consumption of fresh foods—obviously due to lower prices—and extra jobs in food and agriculture industries would be generated.
While I am addressing the issue of employment and the exclusion of food, I briefly remind the Senate of the impact of a GST on those who are currently unemployed. Clearly, this is one of the big questions in the debate before us and it is no doubt one that is going to be explored a lot later as the debate progresses. But I note that while there are some positive effects, particularly associated with the exemption of food from a GST, the overall employment impact of this package is not positive. We only have to look at the impact on the tourism sector to see some of the deleterious impacts of this package on employment. But it is quite clear 
 that the government's main interest in introducing a goods and services tax has not been employment opportunities or decreasing our levels of unemployment.
Indeed, there are some very simple measures that could have been pursued but have been ignored by the government in their so-called taxation reforms. Perhaps the single most important taxation reform which could have brought a significant positive impact to the employment situation is the reduction or abolition of payroll tax. And yet payroll tax reform has been largely ignored in this package. I hear this government, and particularly the Assistant Treasurer, referring to submissions from various chambers of commerce and industry in evidence to the committees which theoretically support the government's case. Certainly, in evidence before the employment committee the government's neglect of changes to payroll tax was roundly condemned.
Excluding food from the GST is jobs friendly. And it does not have an impact, as already explained by my colleagues, on the economic benefits which could be obtained from taxation reforms. I would like Senator Kemp to address some of those issues. Does he acknowledge that there is a difference between opinion and evidence in the committees? Does he acknowledge the positive and beneficial effects that could come as a result of the exemption of food from the GST—specifically in the employment area and in particular in rural areas? The Democrats are not hugging a GST—as Senator Sherry may have suggested in the chamber. It is not a case, as Senator Margetts suggested, of us hugging our GST `when all else fails'. Far from it. I reiterate what my colleagues have said. The proposed taxation of food is the most regressive and unfair part of the package.
The current form of this package is not sustainable. I think it is an incredibly unfair package, especially in relation to areas like education which, contrary to government claims, is not entirely exempt from the GST. Again, that explains why the Democrats, in the set of amendments, are moving for an exemption for school tuckshops. We believe 
 this will actually minimise the compliance costs for school P&Cs. There will be no need to collect or refund GST in tuckshops. Also, tuckshop revenues will not be counted in deciding whether P&C associations exceed the $100,000 GST threshold. So we think we have adopted quite a sensible approach to food and education, in particular to the treatment of tuckshops. We have grave concerns about this package, not only in relation to food. I would like to specifically hear from the Assistant Treasurer in relation to the impact of a GST on food in relation to employment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-13,"—I want to come back to Senator Lees's response to my very important question about the impact of the Democrat amendment on people buying food in Australia. We have established that it will make a difference to lunch as to whether you buy a prepared roll or whether you buy the ingredients to make your own roll. I think the impact is bigger than has been indicated by the Democrats. A really important trend in Australia is that towards people going out and buying prepared meals—including breakfast on their way to work—and taking the kids with them, very often.
We can say whether we like that or not, but it will not make any difference to that trend, as you will know, Mr Temporary Chairman. I want to hear from the Democrats, who have proposed this motion which effectively says, `You pay the GST if the food is prepared but you do not if you prepare it yourself,' whether they have done the homework to show what the projected rate of increase of buying prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner is going to be on average families over the next decade or two.
This is quite crucial because it is not a simple choice of whether it is taxed or not that is going to determine whether people buy their meals outside of the home. It is going to be a whole range of circumstances that are in many cases going to force that option on people. What I want to hear from the Democrats is the homework they have done to see how much this increasing impact of the 
 GST on the food consumed by average Australians will be under their amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-13,"—I probably need to be advised by Senator Brown as to where he is coming from, so that I can understand how to respond. As I recall, Senator Brown was a participating member of the Select Committee on A New Tax System. Unfortunately, I had to miss a couple of the hearings, but I attended nearly all of them. I do know that Senator Margetts participated in them, but I cannot recall whether you attended any, Senator Brown, and whether you did your homework as well on this very important question.
I put that to you because at present we have a taxation system which has a series of indirect taxes, including taxes on goods and services and on food consumed by the poor, the disadvantaged and those in the lower income levels—which is what we are trying to attend to. If your philosophical proposition is that you do not believe that there should be any taxes at the indirect level at all, that I could understand. If your suggestion is, however, that some taxes are all right and some are not, I would like to know that. If you are suggesting that all food should not be taxed or that you should move through the range of definitions that we have examined and that are in the reports, then I would like to know where your definition would fall; and you haven't proposed an amendment.
You see, the problem for us all, Senator Brown, is that you do not have the numbers, we do not have the numbers and the Labor Party do not have the numbers. This tax bill could go through opposed by the Democrats, the Australian Greens, the Greens (WA) and the Labor Party. Our purpose in putting through a change is indeed to make this bill better. Really, if you agree with us that food should not be taxed and you are arguing about the limits at which taxation occur, I can understand that. But what we did was to go away and do the research on the various kinds of options and work out the definition, which we drew from international precedent.
If your question is, `Will there end up being definitional problems?' yes, there will. There 
 are always definitional problems with any kind of tax. We know that; it is just a fact of life. Not everything that emerges in this six-page amendment will clear up every issue.
To return to the nub of your question, we have made a judgment that we can reach somewhere between 83 and 88 per cent of all food purchased by poorer Australians at present. Your question is, `If their patterns of consumption change, what will happen?' The trend is for a change, but we have not seen any evidence—Senator Cook was the chair, and perhaps his memory may stretch a little further than mine—which extrapolates forward what the Australian expectation is of the prepared food question you have asked. I cannot recall that evidence having been presented.
What was presented to us was what it is at present and what it is in other countries, but I do not know that you can automatically assume that that is what it will become in Australia. My difficulty in answering your question—and I have been very general in answering it—is that I have not got that evidence and I am not therefore able to deal with your question in the important sense that you have phrased it. And you might be right: it might well increase exponentially. `I do not know,' is the answer. I can only deal with the facts I have before me right now.
Our understanding and estimation of the effect of our amendment is that it will reach between 83 and 88 per cent of the food take at present and make that food GST free. It is true that we have arrived at a narrower definition, but we had to design a definition which might have, in our view, achieved acceptability in any package that the government might have wished to change. We know this is academic. They are going to vote against it, and Labor are going to vote against it because they are voting everything down. It is just not going to get up. It was our best attempt to make the package far fairer and far more progressive and make it meet the needs of poorer, disadvantaged and lower income Australians. If you wish to put up an amendment to widen the definition, obviously that could be considered on its merits.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-13,"—My amendment, and I believe that of Senator Margetts, is sitting here. We oppose the GST, right across the board. We do not have to move any refinements to it. The Democrats have got into this business of divining which bits of food should be taxed and which bits should not. The point I have established here is that that is without a proper analysis of the impact of the tax they want on food on average Australians coming down the line. What we can say, and the Democrats will not be able to countermand this, is that there is an established trend, which will continue into the future, for Australians to buy processed food, prepared food, outside of the home. That will increase. As that increases, the people who buy that food—that is right across the board, poor people included—will be taxed the GST under this Democrat amendment. It is not going the other way. It is going to weigh against them into the future.
Here we have an amendment which is going to be regressive in that it will increasingly be an impost on poorer Australians. I do not think it will affect people on high incomes; they are spending more of their money on other things, and we would all agree on that. The Democrats' arguments against the government's GST, across the board, apply—maybe to a lesser degree—to the Democrats' amendment here. This will increasingly be an impost into the future on average income and low income Australians disproportionate to the rest of the community. It does not matter which committee we sat on or did not sit on; that is an established trend in Australia which is going to harm low income earners under this Democrat amendment.
That is why I think it is perilous for the Democrats to get into the business of, firstly, saying that they will oppose the GST on food and then, recognising that is not such a good thing, trying to divine a line somewhere down the middle, with all of its contradictions and traps, that would fit the status quo. It will increasingly be an impost on poorer Australians as we move into the future. This committee is establishing that fact here and now in 
 this debate. It is a very important point that the Democrats' amendment will increasingly incur a cost on the very people they say they are defending; that is, poorer Australians. And they do not have any information about what degree that cost is going to be.
—And nor do you.
—It is not my amendment. You are moving this amendment. I am opposed to a GST on everything, including food. You are putting up this amendment, and you are responsible for the impact it has on Australians coming down the line. We have established here that that will be an increasing impact on Australians.
—No, you have not established that. Spell out your argument. Where is the evidence?
—We have established that you have no evidence. The trend established in Australia towards people buying prepared food will increase into the future and it is illogical to argue—
Senator Murray interjecting—
—Senator, if you want to argue that that trend ceases with this Democrat amendment and that, in some way or another, it is going to instantly plateau or go back, do so. But I do not think anybody out there will believe you. That is the problem you have.
Senator Stott Despoja said that the Democrats had evidence that exempting food would create 8,000 to 12,000 jobs. Is that the advantage of this amendment? Is that the established fact as far as food, as now redefined by the Democrats, is concerned? Is it going to create 8,000 to 12,000 jobs to have the tax apply only to processed food but to exempt only non-processed food? If it is not, what are the facts? It is not good enough to say, `We are here creating jobs,' if you cannot specifically say what your amendment is doing. I ask the movers of this amendment: what is the job impact of your amendment as it stands, not of the exemption of food across the board?
The third question I put to Democrats is the business of tuckshops. As I read it—and I 
 would be happy to be corrected on any of this because it is not my amendment—food will be input taxed in tuckshops and food selling facilities run by tuckshop committees, school committees, parents and friends and so on, but will be exempt from the GST. Why is the food going to be input taxed? What will be the effect of that as against exempting food sold in tuckshops from input GST costs?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-05-13,"—I think the chair would admit, and probably most members of this chamber would admit, that I very rarely attack people in this chamber, because I think we should deal with issues. But, Senator Brown, you are an issue in this Senate because you are irrelevant. When you keep saying, `I have a very important question,' that very important question is important to you but not to anyone else. You are quite irrelevant in this chamber, Bob, and you are going to become more irrelevant. That is the problem, and we are spending time answering your questions.
I never attack people, but you have made yourself an issue. Although I am not attacking you, I do want to deal with the issue of your questions, as an issue in itself. You make reference to the last election; the Democrats at the last election put on the table a tax package, as did the ALP and as did the government. Where was the Australian Greens' tax package? Nowhere to be seen. The only contribution that Bob made to the last election was to try to become an ornament on the bonnet of the Prime Minister's car. That was his contribution to the last election.
The tragedy of the last election was that the wrong Green got voted out. Senator Margetts has made a tremendous contribution to this Senate, and I will certainly be saying that when she leaves. It is a tragedy that she lost her seat, and I am sad that she lost it to a Democrat—although we are certainly not going to reverse it. But the Green voters made a mistake: they voted out the wrong Green. The problem is that the Greens did not win one seat at the last election—they lost one—and, after 1 July, they will have one seat in this Senate.
Senator Brown, you said that at the last election the Democrats helped the government to get elected. The Democrats won two extra seats, so the people of Australia made their choice about tax packages very clearly. They are not interested in the questions that you put to this chamber because they know that you are irrelevant, and they know that there is nothing to be said for the propositions that you are putting forward. Not only have we done the modelling but we have done the work, as we always do. Senator Margetts also does the work for any debate in which she takes part in this parliament, but, unfortunately, you make the same speech every time you come in here. You do not do any work. You listen for a word from somebody, you fasten onto that and make the same speech you made last time, changing only a couple of words.
I do not think we need to answer any of your questions, even though there are answers to them, because you have made yourself an issue. I think it is about time that this Senate and the people of Australia realise that the contribution you have made and the contribution you are making is of no interest to this Senate or to the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-13,"—I am rather disappointed with that very personal response from Senator Woodley. I would like to point out that both in Tasmania and Western Australia, the Greens were one of the few parties in the Senate whose vote did not drop.
There are outcomes of elections, but I think it is very personal and churlish to suggest that one person ought to be in the chamber and another person ought not. I want to put on the record that everybody in this place has a contribution to make, and I do not think it is for anybody to suggest that somebody ought not have their views taken into consideration, or that somehow or other someone who was voted in—correctly—is irrelevant simply because that person belongs to a party that is not theirs. Everybody in this chamber has the ability to vote according to their conscience. It does not happen in this chamber because of a lumpy, outdated and, I believe, undemocratic party structure—mostly in the major 
 parties  but also sometimes on the crossbenches.
The party structure makes the votes of most people—especially in the major parties—irrelevant. The way the parties are represented in the Senate means that their vote becomes irrelevant, simply because they vote as one. If the Democrats, the Labor Party and the coalition vote in the same way all the time, then all but one of their votes become irrelevant. That is how the party system has contorted the democratic system in the Senate of Australia, and that ought to be changed. Individual senators should not be attacked for voting according to their conscience. All of us should take the individual responsibility to represent our conscience, our principles and our states, which is the way the system has been set up.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-13,"—I think it is appropriate that the Labor Party join the debate at this stage. I do not want to interfere in the argument going on at the other end of the chamber, and I am happy to yield if that argument is not completed, but seemingly—to me at least—it has developed a circular motion and appears to be going around and around without arriving at a conclusion. I am sure honourable senators will seize the opportunity to defend their honour, but perhaps I can move on to some questions I have of the minister, acknowledging, as always, that honourable senators will do what they deem necessary and that is beyond my control.
Before the chamber now is a set of amendments moved by the Australian Democrats to exempt food from the GST. It is worth recapping that in this chamber there are, essentially, four positions on the GST. The position of the government is that a GST should be as broadly based as possible—but notably not completely broadly based because it makes some exemptions, and the government no doubt will argue that those exemptions are appropriate. The government's view of what is appropriate does not extend as far as the elimination of food from the package. A broadly based GST is a regressive tax which hurts those at the middle and lower 
 income level more harshly than those at the upper income levels in our country. Therefore, there is a compensation package to offset that. There is an elaborate but fraudulent mechanism to pretend that the GST will never rise, and there is a bribe of tax cuts—which will vanish—to encourage people to think there is some advantage in going for the cash and ignoring the principle. That is the government's position.
There is the position of the Australian Democrats, which as I understand it, is to accept the principle of a GST but to turn their attention to the necessities of life by eliminating food from the package, by addressing the diesel fuel rebate in such a way as to diminish the greenhouse gas effects of increased consumption of diesel fuel, by changing the package so that the GST is not a tax on learning by taxing books and literature, and by removing some quite important elements of the package as they relate to the medical and pharmaceutical areas.
There is the Senator Harradine position, in which he has nominated a range of areas he describes as including the necessities of life. His definition is much wider than food—it goes to clothing, shelter, transport and, in his own state of Tasmania, to heating costs in winter for pensioners and a range of other matters. If one wants to take an economists' view of the Democrat or the Harradine positions, the Democrat position is to structurally modify the package and the Harradine position is to seek greater compensation for the injury the package will give to those at the lower end of the income scale.
Then there is the Labor Party position, which is, I acknowledge, shared by the Australian Greens. They would claim originality for it, and I am quite happy to concede their independent commitment to it from us. But we both share the same view, which is that this GST is intrinsically unfair, that it is unable to be remedied, that the package should not pass and that we are opposed to it.
So, to put it in a constructive way: I agree with the Australian Democrats that food 
 should be out of the GST—but I do not think that there should be a GST at all. As a consequence, we have formed our view. But when we turn to the debate about food as an issue, which is the debate in chief now going on in this chamber, I believe that a number of quite important elements dredged up through the Senate select committee inquiry and by public participation in the debate on the GST—the debate that we are now allowed to have but could not have before the election—ought to be raised and the government should be made accountable for its position.
There has been a great deal of cant and, dare I say it of the coalition government, hypocrisy in this debate on the subject of food, which leads me to my first question to you, Minister. It is a direct question to you and I would be delighted if you would answer it. That question is: would the government now, please, set out for the benefit of this chamber what food, under its own package, is exempt from a GST?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-05-13,"—I thank Senator Margetts for that very dignified response a moment ago. I do agree with Senator Woodley in one respect—that is, on his comments about Senator Margetts; we have unanimity there. Otherwise, I am not going to respond to what he had to say because it is not germane to the issue, which is one about the impact of imposing a tax on food or otherwise on the Australian people. I think, however, that Senator Woodley said that the Democrats would not respond to my questions. I do not know that his colleagues will agree with that.
I want to put a couple of those questions again because they are quite important to this debate. We are here to determine whether or not to support the Democrats' amendment, and that means that we have, presumably, the correct expectation to know about some of the outcomes of that amendment. The question I put was about the impact on jobs. Can the Democrats inform the committee what impact their amendment will have on jobs? Senator Stott Despoja earlier talked about the impact on jobs of exempting food but not about the impact on jobs of the amendment. I did ask specifically about why tuckshop foods were 
 going to be input taxed and why the Democrats had decided to allow that input tax to be put on foods in tuckshops, which is obviously going to increase the price of food in tuckshops and food amenities around the country.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-13,"—I think the issues that Senator Brown raises, particularly in relation to employment, are an important part of why this series of amendments is so crucial. There was a lot modelling done as a part of the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System on the employment impacts of various models, including exemptions of food. The figures that my colleague Senator Stott Despoja gave previously, about the job benefits of this particular food definition contained in these amendments, of between 8,000 and 12,000 are generated from those modellings.
The whole issue of a GST on food has obviously dominated a lot of the public debate although, in saying that, I do not in any way suggest that there are not many other issues that are important in relation to the overall tax package. Of course, there are many other Democrats amendments dealing with many of those other issues. The core issue of equity, which we have already gone into in detail, is a crucial one. The impact on employment is also a crucial reason why this amendment is so important.
We would like to reiterate the request from Senator Stott Despoja earlier to the minister concerning the government's response to the Democrats' amendments as they affect employment, and particularly employment in rural and regional areas and in food production, et cetera. I would be interested in the minister's response to that. We have gone down a few other paths since that question was asked, so he may have either forgotten it or thought he had been relieved of the requirement to respond. I would like him to respond to that because employment is of course a key issue.
There are broader issues as well in relation to the GST and food. Let us again look at what some other organisations have said. In a media release of April this year, the Public Health Association of Australia indicated their 
 support for the Democrats' stance on food and our fight to leave food GST free. They said:
Price is one of the most important factors contributing to food choice. A GST will establish a price disincentive for Australians to purchase the nutritious foods that form the foundation of a healthy eating program.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The PHA believes a GST on food is inequitable and will impede efforts to improve nutritional health.
The health aspect of these amendments should not be ignored. I take on board comments made by previous speakers about the impact that tax signals can have on public behaviour, and  obviously that impact cannot be predicted down to the last person. But the Democrats support the principle that I think Senator Margetts has outlined of using a tax system to assist in encouraging positive behaviour and discouraging negative behaviour. It is not the only thing that you use a tax system for, but the Democrats certainly believe that is a legitimate role and purpose for a taxation system, and that is one aspect of what these Democrat amendments are aimed at.
The Australian Consumers Association, in response specifically to the Democrats' proposals in relation to food, said:
The Democrats' revamped proposal to exempt fresh food from the GST is a positive way of encouraging healthy eating.
. . .              . . .             . . .
All the Government's strategies to get people to eat healthy food would get steamrolled by a marketplace which is counter healthy eating, if there was no change [to the GST legislation].
ACOSS has, of course, spoken often about food being the largest essential item—about a quarter of the weekly budget of low income Australians. Again, let us remember that these amendments are specifically aimed at ensuring that there is not an extra excessive burden on low income Australians.
The modelling that has been done indicates that, for the people in the lowest 20 per cent of the socioeconomic bracket, these amendments will exempt about 83 per cent of foods, and that proportion decreases for high income earners, which again relates to the issues of progressiveness and equity. ACOSS has 
 repeatedly talked about how unfair it is to make the poor pay more for their food so that the better off can have a larger tax cut, and that is something that needs to be remembered in the context of the amendments that we are putting forward.
I will quote what was said by one other group. The Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation, in a media release that they put out in April, said:
The . . . Democrats' stance on GST exemption for healthy, basic foods should be applauded. Their stance encourages and provides incentive for Australians to make healthy food choices.
. . .              . . .             . . .
. . .. the compliance burden [of exempting basic food] would appear to be minimal on the basis of international research and the current undue focus on the compliance issues tends to detract from the more significant health and social aspects of the Democrat's policy.
So there is a range of different reasons from a number of community organisations that focus on issues such as fairness, equity for lower income earners, public health and employment—all of which are crucial and all of which are addressed by these amendments.
The Democrat component of the Senate select committee's report goes into a lot of detail in respect of the basis for the figures in the employment suggestions that we have put forward. As well as looking at the overall figures, we also look at the employment impacts in different parts of the community—areas such as rural and regional Australia. I seek the minister's response to some of the issues that were originally flagged by Senator Stott Despoja an hour or so ago and revisited by me.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-13,"—Senator, thank you for the invitation. I always try to respond. I think I may have some faults, but a lack of willingness to get up in the chamber is not often one which is pointed to by senators around the chamber.
—That was a very introspective comment.
—It was a bit of a reflective at this time of the debate—why not? I was actually going to respond immediately to 
 Senator Stott Despoja's question but as I was about to rise to my feet she walked out of the chamber. It was not clear just how urgent the response was, so I naturally decided to let the debate flow. 
Some interesting points were made. Senator Brown would be in blazing agreement with me when I say that he and I do not often agree on many issues—and before he gets too excited, let me say that there were quite a few things that he said which I did not agree with. But I think he did draw together some useful points. I will come back to the modelling, but he did ask a very significant question. With modelling, as all of us know—particularly after this process—you feed your assumptions in and that can obviously alter the nature of what is produced. It is the old GIGO rule. I think Senator Murray would know what that means; it is often applied to some cases—garbage in; garbage out. Senator Stott Despoja, it is very nice to see you back in the chamber.
—I was listening intently from my office.
—I am very glad to see that you were pinned to your TV set rather than being on the TV set in one of the shows that are displayed.
—Your loss, Senator Kemp.
—Nonetheless, I make that point, and we are all exceedingly envious of that.
—Don't I know it!
—Senator, the first point that Senator Brown made was a very good point. I do not think the model that you quoted was the model which relates to the amendment, but I will have some of my very talented advisers check this out for me. Of course, models were mixed on this. I am aware that the Dixon model showed a small gain and, from memory, the Murphy model showed no gain. I will check on that but, as I said, that is from memory. That is the first good point that Senator Brown made.
The second good point Senator Brown made was in drawing the attention of the chamber to the great complexity which can 
 occur. He quoted his famous example of the bread and the banana sandwich. I do not think it was directly and clearly answered; others will judge that. I have a whole list here of anomalies that tend to support the position that Senator Brown raised on the complexity issue. I will quote a couple of examples, and these tie in with some of the equity issues. Fresh crayfish would be GST free but frozen fish fingers would be taxable. Fillet steak would be GST free but frozen hamburgers would be taxable. We can go through a whole host of those issues, but I think that Senator Brown, in his inimitable way, did highlight the great complexity that this issue deals with.
I am a listener to this part of the debate. After all, this is not an amendment I have moved—it is an amendment someone else has moved. I am intrigued that I am suddenly being asked questions in relation to somebody else's amendment. Nonetheless, as a good-natured person I come back into the ranks. From my perspective, I do not think the Democrats dealt with the equity issue at all. It is one thing to keep on saying that this has more equity but, as Senator Brown usefully pointed out, this has not been modelled. With regard to the proposal that you have put, the redistributive effects simply have not been modelled. As I said, there is an overwhelming weight of evidence that more of the benefits of this will flow to higher income groups than to lower income groups.
Senator Brown drew a different conclusion to what I would have drawn in the end about the whole package but, if I understand Senator Brown's point correctly, I just do not think that the Democrats can avoid that issue. You cannot avoid the complexity issue; it is one which is relentlessly raised all the time. I will not take up the time of the chamber, but I am happy to give to the Democrats a list of some of the anomalies that the government sees in this and the complexities which would inevitably occur as a result of this particular amendment.
On the modelling issue, the government takes great comfort from a range of models which have been done, looking at the effects of economic reform. There has been a whole host of people who have done some work on 
 this. For example Access, in their December 1998 AEM forecast, said that the good news was that the tax cuts sweetening the GST were expected to stimulate renewed job growth, perhaps sending employment down to seven per cent in 2001. They further said that, in the long run, the impact of the package would raise national output by 2.5 per cent and that there would be an additional 190,000 jobs.
It is true that we will have a frank exchange of models. If you feed certain assumptions in, you get certain results. The question is: are those assumptions fair and reasonable? We have had this debate in this chamber at length and we have discussed this at question time. I do not accept the position that Senator Stott Despoja has put forward. As I said, we can provide a list of other models that have been done. I do not think the figures she quoted relate to the amendment before the chamber. Indeed, as I understand the Murphy model, it did not actually endorse the position that Senator Stott Despoja stated to us.
There was an issue raised by Senator Cook. He asked if there were any examples of where food was provided GST free in the government's package. If Senator Cook is a student of the ANTS package—his advisers clearly are—he will know that food is only GST free where it is provided as part of a GST-free service. For example, food that is provided as part of a medical service or a residential care service is eligible for GST-free treatment. Clearly the government has done this because food is provided to patients when they are in hospitals. They do not typically seek out medical treatment in hospitals to get their meals GST free. That is a sensible and practical approach, and I think that would be endorsed by this chamber. That is a very different matter to the sort of amendment that we are considering here.
I have listened carefully to the debates and I have listened, as have all senators who have an interest in this matter, to the evidence that was provided to the committees on this issue. My feeling is that the Democrats have adopted a very early position on this particular matter. It is a somewhat inflexible position—a non-negotiable position, as I think has been 
 emphasised again and again. For those who want negotiations, this is a non-negotiable position. A fair reading of the evidence given to the committee by groups that were not unsympathetic to some of the things that you were saying, Senator, would be that there was very little comfort in that evidence. Senator Bartlett quoted groups of some people that he felt supported the position. That is fine; my judgment—and I think it is a fair judgment—is that the overwhelming weight of evidence does not support that.
Let me quote, for example, the Wesley Mission, who gave some evidence. They provide services to over a quarter of a million people in the community each year. They said:
The Wesley Mission supports the GST because we believe it provides a greater resource to fund the ever increasing cost of administering government within Australia, particularly in the welfare sector.
We can argue that point, but they went on to say:
Wesley Mission would be sympathetic towards a no exemptions GST, partly because there are too many `me too' illustrations being brought forward which provide a whole range of complexities to legislation that is designed to replace an already complex and difficult to administer set of legislation. So we would be sympathetic in some respects to that.
We can all quote examples, but in the end a balance has got to be made. Governments have got to make decisions and, as I said, this food issue has been extremely well canvassed. I do not think the Democrats have dealt effectively with the equity issue. I think the international comparisons can easily be used to counter the Democrats argument. I know that Senator Bourne made some points, but I am unpersuaded by them because I think you could equally argue, from what seems to be almost the same table, a quite contrary position: that most countries in fact impose a GST on food. Then you people bring in refinements, and we can have a debate on that. But to suggest that that is an overwhelming weight of evidence is not sustained in terms of the tables which have been produced.
The complexity argument has not been dealt with by the Democrats, and I think it is very difficult to do it. Once you move down this 
 route, you introduce a whole range of complexities and you get a whole host of anomalies. Senator Brown's contribution this morning has been quite interesting to show very briefly the anomalies which occur. I do not think you dealt with that issue. I therefore indicate—this will not surprise you, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Murray, but stay tuned—that the government will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-13,"—I must respond to a few of the questions put to us, since it was our amendment. Thank you for your questions, Senator Brown. I actually think they are quite helpful in fleshing out a couple of issues. Let me try to respond to you.
One of the questions you asked related to item 6, which is that a supply of goods and services by a school tuckshop or canteen is input taxed. At the moment what happens with a school tuckshop or canteen is that they cop whatever taxes are there, for example, wholesale sales tax on cool drinks that they sell. The government proposes that they be taxed if they exceed the $100,000 level, as I understand it. We did not want them to be taxed on food and we discussed the matter. It was put in evidence, as you are probably aware, to the committees. We looked for a measure which would be most likely to keep them below the $100,000 level and would be most likely to reduce compliance costs, and the best way we could work out to do that was in fact to make them input taxed so that they did not charge a GST and did not make any GST claims. It simply kept them pretty well clear of all the admin and everything else that has to go with this. We saw that as the easiest way to deal with it. You may have a different view, but that was our best method of keeping their prices down and keeping them free of having to charge GST to their students.
The jobs issue is a key one. The Australian Democrats are not a well funded political party. It might be of interest to note that we get one seat for every 375,000 votes that are recorded for us, so we tend to be very under-represented in relation to our public support.
—Oh!
—It is true. The number of seats for the Labor Party, by comparison, is about one for 80,000 or 90,000 votes, so that gives you an idea. Despite that great support, we do not have great funds. That is simply a longwinded way of saying that we have not got the funds to do the modelling. So we did not develop this definition prior to the select committee's considerations, we developed it after the select committee's considerations. It was the select committee that did the modelling. Plainly, our definition could not be exactly modelled. What was modelled was the following. Again I will use the presence of the chair of that committee, Senator Cook, as a reference point in case I slip up with my memory. Professor Dixon, using the Monash model, modelled a very basic definition of food which he costed at around $2.5 billion. Mr Murphy, using his model, modelled a slightly wider definition than we are using, which I recall was costed at around $4.5 billion. Anyone knows that the consequence of modelling is that you cannot be exact, and Mr Murphy's figures were that there would be an 8,000- to 12,000-job improvement in the short term from making food GST free.
—What about the long-term effects?
—He said that the long-term effect was that it evened out, and he said that for the entire GST package. That is why I qualified it with `short-term'. The point to make is one which all economists would make, and those with economic training in the chamber would know that. If prices go up, jobs fall. That is why people argue against major increases in wages, in prices of goods, in prices of services and so on.
It is accepted by all the modellers and commentators that, for instance, raising the prices of the tourism sector, which will happen, will result in a fall in jobs. It is accepted that a fall in prices in the manufacturing sector will actually increase jobs. So the six to seven per cent increase in food prices will result in a loss of jobs and, if you take that increase away, which is our intention, obviously the potential loss of jobs falls away and there is a possible job increase. 
 You want a specific, modelled answer to this definition. There is not one. This definition was not modelled. A narrow definition was—by Professor Dixon—and a slightly wider definition was modelled by Mr Murphy, and the best I can do is refer you to the evidence accordingly.
Senator Kemp, you made a number of remarks about the OECD and the fact that most of its members do in fact tax food. You are accurate in that assessment, but on equity grounds they differentiate, in the taxation of food, from the standard rate. Belgium: basic food is six per cent; the standard rate is 21 per cent. The difference is 15 per cent, which is greater than the 10 per cent you seek to impose, Minister. Germany: the basic food rate is seven per cent and the standard rate is 15 per cent; the difference is eight per cent. So you can see in each of these cases that a major differential is offered. It is offered on equity grounds; that is why it is there.
The Greeks tax basic food at eight per cent; the standard rate is 18 per cent—a 10 per cent difference, so that would be just the same in our society as giving your rate of 10 per cent and giving food nought, the same difference. Spain: the basic food rate is four per cent; the standard rate is 16 per cent—a 12 per cent difference, greater than your 10 per cent rate. France: the basic food rate is 5½ per cent; the standard rate is 20.6 per cent—only the French would rather have 0.6 when everybody else's is a straightforward number—and the difference there is 15 per cent, which is 50 per cent greater than your 10 per cent.
Ireland: the basic food rate is nought and the standard rate is 21 per cent—a 21 per cent gift on equity grounds. Italy: the basic food rate is four per cent, the standard rate is 19 per cent; the difference is 15 per cent, again 50 per cent greater than your 10 per cent. Luxembourg: the basic food rate is three per cent; the standard rate is 15 per cent—a 12 per cent difference. The Netherlands: the basic food rate is six per cent, the standard rate is 17½ per cent; the difference is 11½ per cent—greater than your 10 per cent. Austria: the basic food rate is 10 per cent and the standard rate is 20 per cent, a difference of 10 per cent. That is exactly what we are 
 suggesting in Australia: a difference of 10 per cent between a standard rate and zero rated food.
Portugal: the basic food rate is five per cent; the standard rate is 17 per cent—a difference of 12 per cent. That is a greater gift to equity than your rate. Finland: the basic food rate is 17 per cent; the standard rate is 22 per cent—a difference of five per cent. It is less than yours. Sweden: a basic food rate of 12 per cent and a standard rate of 25 per cent; 13 per cent is the difference. Great Britain: a basic food rate of nought per cent and a standard rate of 17½ per cent; the difference is 17½ per cent. Canada: a basic food rate of nought per cent; the standard rate is seven per cent, so the difference is the full seven. Iceland: a basic food rate of 14 per cent and a standard rate of 24½ per cent, a difference of 10½ per cent—again greater than your 10 per cent.
Mexico: a basic food rate of zero and a standard rate of 15 per cent, a difference of 15 per cent. Switzerland: a basic food rate of two per cent and a standard rate of 6½ per cent, a difference of 4½ per cent. Turkey: a basic food rate of one per cent and a standard rate of eight per cent, a difference of seven per cent. Poland: food is zero rated and the standard rate is 22 per cent, a difference of 22 per cent. The Czech Republic: a basic food rate of five per cent and a standard rate of 22 per cent, a difference of 17 per cent. Hungary: a basic food rate of 12 per cent and a standard rate of 25 per cent, a difference of 13 per cent. Korea: food is zero rated and the standard rate is 10 per cent, a difference of 10 per cent.
I have taken you somewhat painfully through all of that to indicate that, whilst it is true that out of the countries I have listed only six zero rate food, all the others apply a differential which in nearly every case is greater than the differential between the 10 per cent you are proposing for the GST and the zero rating we are proposing. The reasons they do that are that it does not harm the economy, it is not overcomplex and it produces greater equity. So that is my answer to that remark of yours.
The second thing that I have found intriguing throughout this debate, Minister, and perhaps you would like to answer this question a little later, is this: I would like to know if in 1993 Mr John Howard, Mr Peter Costello and you were parliamentarians, if you fought the election in 1993 and if you went to that election arguing that food should not have a GST on it. If you did, I want to know if you publicly supported that position or if you publicly opposed that position and why you and the other two individuals would think it perfectly acceptable to fight an election in 1993 on food not being taxed when suddenly in 1999 this is an unbearable evil. That is an important issue.
—The unbearable likeness of being.
—Yes.
—We lost that election with food out.
—Yes, but it is an interesting idea, isn't it? Here is something which you find so appalling in 1999—you say we will gut the package, we will ruin the economy and send us all into doom and disaster—but which the rest of the world coped with quite well and for which in 1993 you went to the people and said, `Yes, let's not have food taxed.' That is a very strange approach. I will leave it there. I think there was a major question on equity and I will deal with that at length further on. I think, Senator Cook, you might have wanted to follow on with additional questions.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-13,"—There are a few minutes remaining before we adjourn for lunch so I will return to my question to the minister. My question was based on the key argument of the government that the Democrat amendments are unreasonable in part because they introduce a higher degree of complexity than is necessary. My question was: would the minister point out where food is exempt from the GST in the government's own package? In answering that question, Minister, you used the example of patients in a hospital because the medical field is exempt from a GST, in part but not in whole. 
 Hospital patients who are fed while undergoing attention in a hospital get their food GST free, but those who visit them and take a meal in the hospital canteen do not. Those who serve their needs, the nurses and medical staff, do not. They pay a GST for their food. I have a series of questions which you may care to answer. If a patient is an outpatient but has been prescribed a particular diet by the doctor, is their food GST free or do they have to pay the GST? 	 Your example was in the medical field only and I do not want to be unfair to you so I will describe the way I heard it and you can correct me if I am wrong. You made it appear that this was the only or predominant area.
—No, it was an example.
—Okay. Would you agree with me that passengers on inbound international flights get their food GST free? Would you agree with me that, for owners of greyhounds or horses whose business is racing greyhounds or horses, the food for the greyhounds or horses—or for that matter any farm animal—is GST free, but the food for the human owners is not? Would you agree with me that, in the case of some of those animals, particular diets are necessary and those diets consist of food which a human could consume, but if the humans in the family consume any of the animals' food they would have to rush down to the shop and pay a GST on it because it is GSTable? If anyone buys more food for their animals than is necessary and the family consumes part of that then they have to pay a GST. Isn't that a complexity and how do you detect it in those circumstances?
They are examples of complexity that you have not gone to in your own package. More importantly, if you turn to page 91 of the ANTS package, this lavish document printed at taxpayers' expense as government propaganda and sent to all of us before the election to explain your GST package, you will see on the outside column the heading `Import tax credits'. Since we are coming up to time, you may give some thought to this in the break and reply to this in greater detail when we resume. In the `Input tax credits' 
 column there appear these words at the end of the second paragraph:
Input tax credits will not be allowed for the GST paid on certain inputs that are essentially private in nature (for example, meals and entertainment expenses).
Let me emphasise some of those words: `will not be allowed for the GST paid on certain inputs that are essentially private in nature'. It then gives an example.
Isn't it true, Minister, that a business person attending a business convention on, say, the Gold Coast and claiming the business convention as an input to their production will have their airfares to get there, the accommodation to stay there and the food they eat while they are there GST free? As I read your tax package, those expenses are regarded as an input to production. If you were a lawyer attending a legal conference on the Gold Coast you would not pay GST on your airfares or your hotel and you damn sure would not pay GST on the food. Isn't that a degree of complexity? In fact, if the average Australian wanted to see people consuming GST-free food they should just rock on down to the nearest five-star hotel on the Gold Coast and watch business travellers consume a GST-free high-class piece of tucker while they have to go down to McDonald's and pay a GST on their hamburgers.
Isn't this a degree of complexity that is hidden, much like your high-roller tax was hidden, in this package? Isn't this a degree of complexity to which publicly you have not referred? Isn't this a degree of complexity which is embarrassing to the government when it maintains that there is no complexity on the food issue? They are the questions I have for you, Minister. Perhaps you may care to answer them.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-05-13,"—We are running out of time, but I would be delighted to answer the questions. I want to briefly comment on the intervention that Senator Murray made. Senator Murray read out at very great length a table; it may have been easier if the table had been incorporated into Hansard  and we could have saved some time. It does not deal with the central argument that was put by the 
 Democrats—that it supported the argument for GST-free food. The fact of the matter is that most of the cases Senator Murray showed in that table, from memory, showed that in most countries there is a GST on food. I am unpersuaded by that point that Senator Murray made.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-05-13,"—The Criminal Code Amendment (Bribery of Foreign Public Officials) Bill 1999  in effect amends the crimes legislation of Australia. It arises out of an OECD convention on combating bribery and the implementing of legislation. It makes it an offence for an Australian citizen or an Australian resident to bribe or attempt to bribe an official in an overseas government.
I will say a couple of words about the convention. The convention went through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, as Senator Schacht knows. Since becoming a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, he has become a very vocal member of that committee. The inquiry carried out by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was chaired by Senator Coonan, who is very knowledgeable in the field of law. I think tribute ought to be paid to her for the work she did in this respect, as well as to the secretary of that committee.
This is a first step. The countries who are members of the convention are OECD mem 
 bers. Perhaps a lot of the corruption that goes on does go on outside that particular organisation, although I am not saying that there is none within that organisation. Certainly a lot of it goes on outside the OECD.
What is being sought here is to begin a cultural change so that business can be conducted around the world as it ought. We hear about performance enhancing drugs in sport. People are down on those sorts of drugs because they allow people to compete above and beyond their merit. In other words, merit does not become the test of who wins, but untoward conduct does. In the same way, this particular legislation is aimed at ensuring that the recipient of any contract around the world is the best person to have contended for it. In other words, it is an attempt to have business around the world conducted on the basis of merit, not on the basis of nepotism whereby people might get a contract because they are related to the person who has the ability to give it; not on the basis of the payment of money; not on the basis of the giving of services, but very much on the basis of merit: who is the best person to get this contract in terms of his or her ability?
That is a very important move because, if business or trade or the transfer of money, services or otherwise is corrupted, then it is to the disadvantage of everybody, not only in terms of the moral outrage that that presents—that is one of the foremost issues—but also in the practical effects that that has. The corruption of trade or business leads to a situation where business is less able to be as successful as it might otherwise be.
Perhaps if I read some of the headings to the bill, the flavour of it will be seen. Division 70, `Bribery of foreign public officials', is followed by definitions of particular terms such as `benefit', `benefit advantage', `control' and so on. There are other headings: `Bribing a foreign public official', `Defence—conduct lawful in foreign public official's country', `Defence—facilitation payments' and so on. It defines the areas that are to be covered.
It deals only with people who are in government. Trying to bribe somebody in a country outside Australia in private enterprise 
 does not fall within this bill. That becomes an issue as governments tend to outsource things, but it is not dealt with here. It is a start of a regime that happily will extend so that corruption, not only in terms of the corruption of government officials but the corruption of anybody around the world, will become a criminal offence in this country.
It also shows the need for countries to undertake responsibility for their own citizens and for those who reside within the country. You can have world courts but the only problem there is that world courts cannot enforce their decisions; whereas, if you had domestic courts enforcing laws which cover the international scene, what is done in other countries, then I think much more effect can be obtained, and that is what is done here. It is a good piece of legislation. I commend the treaty which gave rise to it. As a matter of prejudice, being a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I commend it and I commend Senator Coonan for her effort in this regard.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (BRIBERY OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-05-13,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Criminal Code Amendment (Bribery of Foreign Public Officials) Bill 1999 . We are glad to see that the government has reached an agreement with the Labor Party in relation to their amendments. I concur with Senator Cooney's comments in relation to the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and the ministerial response that was tabled in this place a short time ago.
The Democrats have previously put on record our concern about the ongoing use of bribery in business internationally; and specifically in our region, with the political and economic developments of the last year, we are very conscious of these issues needing to be resolved. We are very concerned and hope that Australia will provide a leading example of the long-term strengths of honest international business. As a country, we enjoy an excellent reputation internationally and our legislative response should not allow for any other possibilities.
We have put on record before our concerns in relation to the use of facilitation payments. Anecdotally, the use of facilitation payments by some businesses have been responsible for some of the distortions in business processes within the economic systems of some of our nearest neighbours. It seems that on occasions all that is required for a bribe to become legal is that an official assures you that the business deal would go ahead. Any money offered after that moment is a facilitation payment after a bribe, rather than a bribe. I have made these comments in the chamber before, so I am glad to see that amendments in relation to that section have been proposed and accepted. The Democrats will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (BRIBERY OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-05-13,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that the Labor Party strongly supports the Criminal Code Amendment (Bribery of Foreign Public Officials) Bill 1999 . Corruption is a scourge on many countries throughout the world. Research carried out by the IMF shows that corruption gives bureaucrats an incentive to increase needless red tape, and it further saps the confidence of investors. Countries in which corruption flourishes are the countries which invest least in education.
Over the past decade, the issue of bribery has come under the microscope as never before. Corruption has played a part in the dismissal of governments from Zaire to Brazil and from Indonesia to the UK. The OECD convention on bribery, and hence this bill, emanated from these and other experiences.
The opposition will be moving four amendments to the bill. We have discussed them with the government, and we understand that the government intends to support all four amendments. On behalf of the opposition, I would particularly like to thank Senator Vanstone and her staff, who have played a very constructive role in relation to this process. As Senator Stott Despoja said, I think both sides recognise the importance of the bill and of getting it right the first time. The differences in our discussions were not ideological. We were all working towards the common goal of making this legislation as good as it could possibly be at this point. On behalf of the opposition, I would also like to 
 thank Transparency International—and, in particular, Peter Willis and Peter Rooke for their helpful comments in relation to this legislation.
The first amendment to be moved by the opposition is to insert in clause 70.2, after paragraph (3)(a), the following words:
(aa) the value of the business advantage;
Clause 70.2(1) sets out the primary offence. Clauses 70.2(2) and 70.2(3) then go on to state that, when determining what is a `benefit that is not legitimately due' and what is `business advantage that is not legitimately due', certain things should be ignored. One would expect that the same matters would be ignored in both cases but, as currently drafted, the matters to be ignored are not the same. Clause 70.2(2) includes `the value of the benefit', but clause 70.2(3) does not include `the value of the business advantage'.
The risk is that a court interpreting the legislation might take this to mean that, by omission, the value of the business advantage was a relevant factor in deciding whether the business advantage was legitimately due. This is obviously not the intention of the explanatory memorandum and this amendment is simply designed to clarify that.
The second amendment we are moving is to clause 70.4, inserting before paragraph (1)(a) the following:
(aa) the value of the benefit was of a minor nature; and
Clause 70.4 is the facilitation payment defence. It sets out conditions under which a person will not be guilty of bribing a foreign official. As the OECD convention envisaged, one of the conditions of that defence is that the amount of the bribe be small. As paragraph 44 of the explanatory memorandum puts it:
Use of the term `minor nature' ensures that the legislation achieves the intention of the OECD Convention that the quantum be small . . . Use of the term `minor nature' will enable the court to take all appropriate circumstances into account and to decide whether the nature of the payment in a particular case is minor.
The opposition's view is that this is not achieved by the present legislation. As it 
 reads now, the first part of clause 70.4(1) says:
(1) a person is not guilty of an offence under section 70.2 if:
(a) the person's conduct was engaged in for the sole or dominant purpose of expediting or securing the performance of a routine government action of a minor nature; and . . . 
As presently drafted, this clause does not achieve the intention of the explanatory memorandum, and the term `minor nature' goes not to the quantum of the payment but only to the nature of the government action. This amendment will remedy that and ensure that the legislation reflects the aims of the explanatory memorandum.
I will not read the text of amendments 3 and 4—probably much to the relief of the chamber. Their effect is to extend the legislation from Australian citizens to Australian residents. This is not groundbreaking. The legislation making overseas paedophilia illegal also applied to Australian residents.
The amendment also contains a restriction: proceedings against an Australian resident cannot be commenced without the Attorney-General's written consent. This is appropriate given the somewhat looser ties that bind residents to Australia as compared with those that bind citizens to Australia. I commend all four amendments to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (BRIBERY OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-05-13,"—Senator Stott Despoja has already indicated that the Australian Democrats welcome the government's Criminal Code Amendment (Bribery of Foreign Public Officials) Bill 1999  and the Labor Party's amendments to that bill. This bill has appeared relatively quickly. The convention which initiated it was concluded in December 1996. In the ways of legislatures, to get it into play three years later is relatively quick. However, we should recognise that there has been business resistance to it and that has somewhat delayed the government's introduction of it. I am very grateful that the government has seen fit to resist business pressure not to introduce this.
A marvellous organisation called Transparency International Australia, which circulates its newsletters to all parliamentarians, keeps 
 a watching brief on this matter. In October 1998, it provided to the Economist magazine a corruption index for 41 countries. Transparency International is an anti-corruption organisation based in Berlin but, of course, it has an Australian chapter. Scores from the organisation range from 10, which they describe as `squeaky-clean', to nil, which they describe as `corrupt'. In their list of 41 countries, the most squeaky-clean was Denmark and the least squeaky-clean, or the most corrupt—whichever way you want to look at it—was Cameroon. I do not think it is very good for a country to be right at the bottom.
Where did Australia fit? Australia fitted at No. 7. Speaking for myself, and probably for the other senators here, I would rather that we were at No. 1. In other words, there is room to improve our own performance in this regard. The top seven were: Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Singapore, the Netherlands, Switzerland and then Australia. I am pleased that we were in the top 25 per cent of those 41 countries spelt out.
I should indicate that we trade with a number of countries which feature very much in the bottom sector of that list. Among those in our own region are South Korea and then, getting more corrupt, the Philippines, then getting more corrupt after that, Thailand, and, more corrupt after that again is Indonesia, which is only third from the bottom of the list. I draw this to your attention because much of our trade and international business activity is with countries whose standards are not high. I think it is absolutely vital that we promote a culture of morality through our businesses operating in foreign countries.
I am very grateful to the government for reinforcing that message, because I want to draw attention to a mind-set which still exists in business. This is an extract from the ACCI Review of April 1998. The ACCI represents many hundreds of thousands of businesses. This is what it said in its leading paragraph:
The OECD convention and related legislation on bribery are likely to compromise the capacity of businesses to compete in a number of markets. The better approach to deal with these problems is to develop a multilateral agreement on corruption under the WTO. The treaties committee of the 
 parliament should recommend against accession to the convention for the time being.
Thank goodness the treaties committee did not listen to them either! What does that say to you about the morality of these people? It says that economics, markets and competition come first for them. These are the same people who say: it is in the interests of Australia to do away with unfair dismissal applications; it is in the interests of Australia to apply youth rates right across the market; it is in the interests of Australia to have the lowest wages possible; it is in the interests of Australia to tax food. They are also saying, `By the way, it is in the interests of Australia not to have a law that prohibits the bribery of foreign public officials.' I am really grateful that the government has rejected that attitude; it is a credit to it. The message to us is that we need to be alert to and to resist the attitude that bribery is sometimes acceptable if practised by others, both domestically and internationally.
I draw your attention to another article, which was in the Business Review Weekly of 15 February 1999. It led in as follows:
British crime authorities claim that accountants are turning a blind eye to the establishing of complex structures by money laundering clients. Accountants gave authorities only 44 tip-offs in 1997 compared with 7,000 from banks and 14,000 from all sources. Peter Jolly, chairman of the Australian Institute of Chartered Accountants task force on fraud, says conferences here have made accountants realise that their forensic skills are valuable to the authorities.
I draw your attention to this because the previous government introduced the Austrac method of picking up money laundering activities through financial institutions. The banks have been very cooperative and have greatly assisted in that matter.
However, it is only recently that professionals such as lawyers, accountants and valuers—people who know things are going on—have started to blow the whistle a little more. I encourage the government to examine corporate law and other forms of law to ensure that people who have a position of trust in our society act in favour of Australia by exposing money launderers, tax avoiders, people who bribe and people who are corrupt.
The government has made an important step along a chain of activity which would increase and improve Australian accountability. One of the reasons I am speaking here is because I have the Democrats' business and corporate affairs portfolio. I will be looking for ways to encourage corporate law to encourage accountants, valuers and lawyers to expose issues which they otherwise might regard as professionally privileged when, in fact, they are matters of corruption. I look forward to getting the support of other members of the chamber in that regard. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the government have had a lot of compliments from me in this speech. I think they deserve them. I thank the government for introducing the bill.",SENATE,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (BRIBERY OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-05-13,"—I thank all senators for their cooperation on and interest in the Criminal Code Amendment (Bribery of Foreign Public Officials) Bill 1999 . The passage of this legislation will enable Australia to fulfil an important obligation that it undertook when it signed the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions on 7 December 1998. The government is appreciative of the exhaustive examination of the draft legislation by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and of the work of Senator Coonan, who chaired the subcommittee of that committee, and of all the members who participated. The government is very grateful to those people.
The bill agreed to by the Senate includes three amendments which were raised by the opposition following introduction of the bill in the Senate. The government is happy to accept the opposition amendments. Also, I appreciate Senator Mackay's comments. It is not often that you hear a comment of gratitude towards a minister. I remember doing that when Senator Tate and Senator Richardson were very cooperative when I was in Senator Mackay's position of taking legislation through. It is the sort of thing that the public does not often see. When they see us 
 champing at the bit across the chamber, they do not see the cooperative effort that goes on behind the scenes to get amendments that will make legislation better. Governments should always be grateful to oppositions for identifying problems. I know I was most pleased when Senator Richardson acknowledged my contribution to a social security bill. I think it is appropriate that it be acknowledged, and I thank Senator Mackay for her comments.
The government looks forward to reporting to the OECD that Australia has passed the implementing legislation with the support of all the groupings in our parliament. The message that is sent to the international community about our attitude to corruption is very important in a world where trade between different countries is increasingly influencing domestic policy. I thank honourable senators for their comments. I thank Senator Murray and Senator Stott Despoja for their complimentary comments, and I thank all senators for their respective contributions to the passage of this important piece of legislation through the Senate.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-05-13,"—On Tuesday, Senator McKiernan—in a most charming fashion—asked me a question. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard —in just two days.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator VANSTONE: on Tuesday 11 May 1999 Senator McKiernan asked me a question, in my capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General, about jury service. The question was as follows:
Does the Government consider the obligation for a citizen to serve on a jury as a community service obligation? Has the Attorney-General's Department provided any advice to the Government, or ever been consulted, as to the probable impact of the removal of jury service as an allowable matter from industrial awards? What impact is the removal of leave from awards likely to have on people's willingness to undertake jury service?
Does the Government consider the obligation for a citizen to serve on a jury as a community service obligation? Has the Attorney-General's Department provided any advice to the Government, or ever been consulted, as to the probable impact of the removal of jury service as an allowable matter from industrial awards? What impact is the removal of leave from awards likely to have on people's willingness to undertake jury service?
In my reply at the time I indicated to Senator McKiernan that I would refer his question to both the Attorney-General and also the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business for their views.
I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business that the removal of jury service from the list of allowable matters is part of an evolutionary process which was foreshadowed in the document More Jobs Better Pay,  and which reflects the underpinning principles of the Workplace Relations Act.
Minister Reith advises that the award simplification process should continue so that awards are simple, flexible instruments that do not impede agreement making, workplace efficiency, organisational effec 
 tiveness, or act as barriers to employment growth. Instead, awards should be focused on providing a genuine safety net of minimum wages and conditions for low paid and disadvantaged workers. Accordingly, it is not necessary to include in awards matters that are dealt with elsewhere in Legislation or are more appropriately dealt with at the workplace through agreements. Such matters do not form part of a minimum safety net.
Minister Reith also advises that jury service is not widespread in awards. Only about one quarter of all federal awards contain jury service provisions. In addition, all States and Territories provide some form of payment or compensation for jury service. Therefore, jury service is not part of a genuine minimum safety net of common conditions for low paid and disadvantaged workers.
My colleague the Attorney-General advises that the Attorney-General's Department was consulted as a matter of routine on a set of proposals which included the proposal to remove jury service as an allowable matter in industrial awards, but was not asked to provide advice on the probable impact of that proposal and did not do so. The maintenance of an adequate pool of jurors within each of the respective Australian jurisdictions and any related arrangements for remuneration or compensation of jurors are matters for the States and Territories.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Jury Service</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-05-13,"—by leave—I table the statement and the report by the Director of Meteorology on the Bureau of Meteorology's forecasting and warning performance for the Sydney hailstorm of 14 April 1999. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Between 7.15 pm and 9.25 pm on 14 April a hailstorm of unprecedented magnitude for that time of year moved across the eastern suburbs of Sydney. The storm caused untold damage across a wide area. Measured in economic terms, it was one of our most damaging weather events ever Fortunately, the loss of life and injury counts were not as high as in other severe storms. Nevertheless the Government does appreciate that the storm has caused significant cost, distress and severe dislocation to many people which is very much regretted.
This was an unusual storm in many respects. Not in the 204 years of recorded meteorological history of Sydney has there been a  hailstorm of such ferocity in April, and only a handful in the summer 
 months have produced such large hail. Furthermore the storm approached Sydney from the south, moving in from the sea off Wollongong through the Royal National Park and over Bundeena, rather than taking the more usual eastwards path from the Blue Mountains to the coast.
The Bureau of Meteorology did not predict the intensity of the storm, nor did it issue a severe thunderstorm warning to the public.
The expert advice of the Director of the Bureau of Meteorology, Dr John Zillman, is that the professional judgments of the Forecasters that the storm would move off shore and abate were not unreasonable on the evidence before them. The climatological record and synoptic meteorological conditions did not suggest the combination of circumstances that would support a storm of such severity.
Dr Zillman believes that the technology available to the Bureau's officers was appropriate and functioned effectively. Similarly, the Director advises in his report that the staffing of shifts involved was adequate.
He has, however, noted in his report that the advanced radar systems becoming operational in Sydney is not available in other capitals. To this extent at least our systems are not as comprehensively technologically advanced as those available in the United States—a country which faces more severe weather events than face Australia's major population centres. The Bureau will engage an eminent US severe weather expert to examine our systems and make any recommendations for upgrading those systems appropriate to the risks faced by our major population centres.
While I accept the Director's advice that the staffing of the Sydney Regional Forecast Centre was appropriate, I have asked that the Auditor General extend the scope of the performance audit of the Bureau that he is currently carrying out to examine the allocation of resources against the management of known and likely severe weather risks in the Sydney region and more widely In particular, I have asked him to examine the policies in relation to the number and deployment of severe weather experts, as well as the practices in relation to the training of staff on new high technology equipment as it comes into service.
In addition, the Director of Meteorology will:
.	 accelerate an ongoing program of training its forecasters in new techniques for using radar to monitor severe thunderstorms.
.	 implement additional ""silent"" telephone lines between key operational centres to overcome difficulties caused by callers overloading the telephone system of their forecast offices.
.	 upgrade the radar data display capability of the Bureau's core regional systems and re-configure 
 the communications between the operational radars in the Sydney basin and the Bureau's forecast offices in Sydney and at Mascot to ensure small delays in data reception at Mascot are overcome.
The Director of Meteorology will also commission a review by an expert in human factors management to evaluate the operational procedures and associated training adopted in its Sydney office, and more broadly. It is not sufficient that our forecasters have the best appropriate technology and professional training it is also necessary that the operational procedures and protocols that they are expected to follow are those that will ensure the best protection for the Australian public.
The intention of conducting these external evaluations is to ensure that in the future all Australian cities can benefit from the best scientifically sustainable standard of forecasting for severe thunderstorms appropriate to the risks faced.
Experience with the Sydney storm has also heightened appreciation of the critical interface between the Bureau and the media when intense and relatively short duration storms threaten life and property. Even if the storm had been forecast, it might not have been broadcast. I will ask the Bureau and the media, including the television media, to discuss arrangements through which real time advice of Bureau severe weather warnings can be given to viewers and listeners.
Madam President, this Government has increased the funding for the Bureau of Meteorology by $4.6m per annum over the past three years. This is a reversal of a trend of declining appropriations. We are proud of our weather service, which is recognised internationally as being of a high standard. Dr Zillman, the Director of Meteorology's, international eminence as a meteorologist has been recognised by his appointment as the President of the World Meteorological Organization. The steps that the Bureau is taking in response to this event should reassure the Australian public that those standards, hard won, will not be lowered, and will be improved under this Government.
That said, Madam President, the Director wisely cautions that severe storms are by their very nature difficult to predict, particularly when they occur, as they will from time to time, in apparently benign climatological and synoptic meteorological conditions. Regrettably, there is much still to be done in understanding the science of extreme weather events such as that which struck Sydney with such devastating force on 14 April.
I commend the report to the Senate.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-05-13,"—On behalf of Senator MacGibbon, I present an advisory report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to incorporate Senator MacGibbon's tabling statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I am delighted to be tabling a report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO entitled, An Advisory Report on the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. 
This report contains the results of our consideration of the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill, which was referred to us by the Attorney-General on 13 April 1999.
While the short timeframe available to us limited the scope of our review, it is important to acknowledge the significance of the fact that the review occurred at all It is a rare event that the legislation giving effect to our national security and intelligence agency is exposed to public scrutiny.
In the report we express broad support for the purpose and form of the Bill.
We believe that the Bill generally achieves an appropriate balance between public and private interests:
.	 the public interest being to ensure that ASIO has access to the surveillance tools and techniques needed to safeguard Australia against security threats in the modern world; and
.	 the private interest being to ensure that ASIO's activities do not impinge unduly on individual rights and liberties—principally, the right to privacy.
Nevertheless, we do believe the Bill can be improved upon. Accordingly, we have made a number of recommendations aimed at clarifying the intent of the Bill and further enhancing the accountability and reporting regimes surrounding ASIO. 

One of the main issues raised in submissions was a concern that the Bill proposed to relax the test to be applied by the Attorney-General in considering whether to issue a search warrant to ASIO. We have recommended that a supplementary explanatory memorandum should be issued to make it clear that while the Bill rewords the test, it does not lessen the test.
A number of submissions also expressed concern about the provision, which allows ASIO to `add delete or alter' data stored on a computer. We have recommended that the Bill, and/or the explanatory memorandum, should be amended to make it clear that ASIO is not empowered to add, delete or alter data stored in a target computer, except for the purposes of gaining access to the computer.
In relation to accountability and reporting we have made three recommendations:
.	 first, that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security report annually on the frequency with which ASIO recovers listening and tracking devices outside normal warrant periods;
.	 second, that the memoranda of understanding regulating ASIO's access to tax and financial transaction reports (and any future modifications to these memoranda) be considered and cleared by the ASIO Committee before coming into effect; and
.	 third, that the frequency of ASIO's access to financial transaction reports information be disclosed in the annual reports from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (known as AUSTRAC).
We also recognise the strength of the argument, put to us in submissions, that community confidence in ASIO and its operations would be enhanced if it were more open in its reporting of activities. While there are clearly competing tensions to be addressed, we have suggested to the Attorney that the nature and scope of ASIO's public reporting should be considered further, perhaps by way of reference to the ASIO Committee.
I believe that our review has been a valuable exercise and I look forward to the resumption of debate on the Bill and the Government's response to our recommendations.
On behalf of the Presiding Member of the Committee, Mr Jull, I would like to thank all the members of the Committee for their efforts in producing this unanimous report.
I commend the report to the Senate.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-05-13,"—I take this opportunity to make some brief comments on this, and Senator Sandy 
 Macdonald is going to follow. The Attorney-General referred the legislation to the ASIO committee for comment. Probably the only weakness in this process was the timing which the committee was given to bring in its report. One would have to say that, not by any deliberate intent on the part of the Attorney, the timing was very tight. It did enable the committee to fully cross-examine the various agencies concerned but did not give the various interested groups in the community sufficient time both to put in their refined submissions and to appear before the committees. Again, this was unfortunate, but it was in no way intentional. However, I think it would be appropriate if this legislation, when it comes before the Senate, were referred to the legislation committee to give those groups their one day on which to raise further comments on this bill and to give them an opportunity, through this process with more timing involved, to put their views.
What is involved in this ASIO legislation is the classic example of trying to properly balance the security needs of this country with people's civil rights. In this case that is a formula that is extremely difficult to assess because, let us face it, ASIO's operation are basically covert. It is not easy for civil liberties groups or even this parliament to assess whether ASIO is getting the balance right. Nevertheless, all you can bring to bear on this is your own experiences. I am probably uniquely advantaged because I have been a member of the security committee for six years. I have been in charge of two of the five security apparatuses in this country—DIO and DSD—and on various occasions I have had dealings with ONA, with ASIO and with ASIS. The security committee always took its duties extremely seriously—I am sure it is exactly the same with this government—and made sure its scrutiny of the activities of those agencies was at the highest possible level. What you need when you are dealing with security agencies is the right checks and balances.
There have been examples in Australia, but more often overseas, where these agencies have gone beyond their brief and have in fact been caught up in the internal dynamics of 
 their own being, to the detriment of the country. I think ASIS and the Sheraton raid was one example of that. I stress that these are the aberrations; they are not the norm with regard to Australian security organisations. They are rare. Certainly, after the Hope royal commission and the Samuels report many of the problems of the past that may have been institutionalised have been eliminated.
I think these organisations have also become more balanced in their outlook. We are no longer dominated by the Cold War and the polarities that that developed in our society and what some people would see as entrenched biases in our security apparatus. I do not detect that they exist at all.
Over and above all that, we do have a major protective device on all the powers of these agencies in the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. This office is given the power to oversight the five agencies to make sure they are working within their legislative charter. I would have to say that governments, when appointing inspectors-general, have always done it on the basis of appointing someone of independence. This government has had the opportunity of appointing only one Inspector-General, and that is Mr Bill Blick, whom most of us involved in the Senate estimates committee process would recognise as a very capable public servant, a fairly fearless public servant and someone who will carry out his duties in this particular job without fear or favour. As such, that is the most reassuring thing we can tell the Australian public when we are looking at the checks and balances that exist.
There are basically three key issues in this legislation that will be of concern to people. Firstly, the access by ASIO to tax records and AUSTRAC records. This is something they have not had in the past, but I would certainly deem it something they need to use, albeit sparingly, in the course of their duties. With regard to tax, they do not have direct access to records under this legislation proposed. They will have to approach the Commissioner of Taxation, explain the purpose of their request and it will be up to the tax commissioner, under the powers in the tax act, as to whether he allows access to those records. 
 The evidence given by Mr Richardson, the head of ASIO, was that he did not think he would need to do that on a regular basis. The access to AUSTRAC is also limited because they do not have direct, online access. They have to go Sydney, use a PIN number and access those records to assist themselves. So, in both cases, ASIO is not proposed to have unlimited access.
But I do notice this criticism around: why give ASIO this increased power? I look at it from the point of view of who already has this power. If the critics are right, they should be a lot more worried about other agencies having this power than ASIO, who have a fairly good track record when it comes to probity. You already have a couple of the more unsavoury, at times, state institutions like ICAC and the CJC that have direct access into AUSTRAC, and you have several other agencies with no better proven track records—federal agencies—with access to tax records. So if indeed people want to argue that ASIO should not have this sort of access, they really should go back and look at all the other statutory abilities for other agencies to have access to these records which have a far less commendable track record than ASIO itself has.
The second major area of reform here is to do with the timing of warrants. It is not possible for ASIO to meet the same timing as to the issuing and ceasing of warrants as law enforcement agencies. Why? Because it is covert, and it is not always possible to get the timing right if you want to keep the covert aspect to it. But again the act, as proposed by Attorney-General Williams, does detail various restrictions on ASIO's ability to issue warrants. I think they have the balance right.
The third area that will cause some concern is the right of ASIO to go into computers to access information. Again, they have to do it in a covert way. I think the clause that has people most worried is the one that gives ASIO the right to alter information in order to continue the activity as a covert action. It does not have the right to just go in willy-nilly and change information. It only has the right to change a computer set-up to the extent to which they need covert entrance into 
 it. Again, this is a modernising of the act. When the ASIO acts were first written, people did not think information to that extent would be kept on computers. We all know what has happened, even in the last 10 years, since the ASIO Act was last changed.
So, on the whole, I do not regard the legislation as getting out of balance the rights of the Australian community to expect a security apparatus to operate with full and sufficient powers as opposed to the balance required for civil liberties. One thing we should always remember: whatever value ASIO is to us now, it has to keep its residual capacity, its techniques and its abilities there for time of crisis. We hope that time of crisis never comes, but it must be in a position to respond to it.
I should say, finally, that the views I have expressed today are ones I have come to by listening to the witnesses and assessing the act myself. It does not bind my party; everyone should know that. This act will go through the normal Labor Party processes and, in turn, the Labor Party will either support or oppose it and, being a collectivist, I will abide by whichever decision they make. But I must say that, having examined the act with the other committee members, I think it has the balance right. I think the Attorney-General has drawn up an act that meets the modern requirements without being excessive, and I think that in terms of the civil liberties implications of it, the very defence of all this is the existence of a competent Inspector-General who will enforce the provisions with fairness and rigorousness.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,1999-05-13,"—Following Senator Ray's very balanced comments, I want to make some comments on this tabling of the advisory report on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. This legislation revolves around the necessity for ASIO's powers to be extended and varied to meet not only the technological change but also the times in which we live and, in one particular sense, the security requirements of the Olympics next year. 
As Senator Ray has said, we have had a short time frame for our review and some people who wished to have the opportunity to come before the committee and make submissions may have been excluded because of the time constraints. But, in general terms, the committee supports the purpose and form of the bill. The bill proposes to allow ASIO such access to tax and financial transaction report information as is relevant to the performance of security intelligence functions. We support this access, provided appropriate safeguards are in place. These safeguards are to be described in the memoranda of understanding being negotiated between the Director-General of ASIO, the Commissioner of Taxation and the Director of AUSTRAC. We think it is important that these memoranda not come into effect until after they have been considered and endorsed by the ASIO committee.
This is an important accountability measure. The bill proposes to extend the duration of search warrants from seven to 28 days and to allow the Attorney-General to delay the commencement of warrants. These provisions will allow a degree of flexibility in the execution of warrants that is appropriate for an agency that needs to execute warrants covertly. ASIO is not like a law enforcement agency that can execute search warrants in public.
The bill also proposes to allow ASIO to remotely access computers. This is an appropriate extension of ASIO's surveillance powers and enables ASIO to make use of available technologies. We have, however, made a recommendation to make plain that ASIO cannot `add, delete or alter' data stored in a computer except for the purposes of gaining access to that computer. This means that ASIO can unlock the door to information, so to speak, but it cannot tamper with that information.
We also support the extension of the time frames within which ASIO can recover listening and tracking devices. While we think it is far preferable that such devices are recovered within the period that they are active, we accept that it can be difficult to retrieve such devices covertly and within warrant periods. As an additional safeguard in this area, as Senator Ray has mentioned, we 
 have recommended that ASIO's accountability watchdog, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, report annually on the frequency with which listening and tracking devices are recovered outside normal warrant periods.
Finally, it is worth saying that it is no easy task to achieve a balance between protecting national security interests and individual rights and liberties. We consider that this bill, as completed by our recommendation, strikes an appropriate balance.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-05-13,"—Madam President, during the election campaign, we said this government did not have a plan for our nation; it had a plan for a tax. This budget shows we were right. Instead of investing in our future, it invests in its own obsession. And the price of its folly will be borne by the generations to come, because without the investments needed to make our nation and our future work force smarter and more productive, we 
 will not have the high wage, high skill future the people of this nation deserve.
The good growth recorded in this budget stems from the industry and resilience of the Australian people, and hard decisions taken by this government's predecessor over a decade ago. We enjoy prosperity today because, more than a decade ago, government saw the priority of restructuring the Australian economy to secure our nation's future.
Back then, a strong national government with an eye to the future saw the need to diversify our economy because global economic trends were promising a brighter and more prosperous future in new industries. We saw the need to broaden our industrial base from our reliance on cyclical industries, such as resources and agriculture, and get into areas like elaborately transformed manufactures to boost trade, growth and jobs.
But the game has moved on yet again. Today, global economic trends are rewarding those nations supplying high knowledge content products. The new competitive landscape is about software, pharmaceuticals, communications and information technology, biotechnology, education exports and the like. We have no choice but to engage. Our capacity to do so means the life or death of jobs in this country.
What we achieved in the past was not done with words or by an accounting result. It was achieved by government investing for the future: in education and training; in research and development; in export incentives; and in industry plans. So, too, as we look forward, our success in today's global economy demands investment in the future. Nothing short of a quantum leap in the education levels, skills and training of the Australian work force, and the national resources devoted to new industries, will see Australia join the emerging global prosperity. This, surely, should be the test we set this budget.
What we needed from the budget was a strategy for a nation making its way in the world and an understanding of the challenge before us and how together we can rise to it. This is what the times demand of national government. These are the commitments a budget must show. Firstly, there must be a 
 commitment to fairness for future generations, which demands strong fiscal discipline. It is centred on a golden rule that governments do not borrow to finance current spending and save in the good times so that over the cycle the budget balances.	It must show a commitment to making every Australian family feel more secure in terms of the income they enjoy, in terms of their jobs, in terms of educating themselves through life and in terms of their ability, if unemployed, to get back into the work force.
But it must also show a commitment to fairness as the centrepiece of our economic progress. It must show an iron determination that none of our fellow citizens is left behind as part of the bargain of our economic progress in a new century. Both of these ideas—fairness and progress—demand the same thing. They demand a commitment to a high wage, high skill future and an opportunity for all Australians to share in that future by developing their talents to the full. Only by pulling together, by pooling our talents, will we progress with fairness to all our fellow citizens.
A good budget for these times must also demonstrate a commitment to the goal that good home-grown ideas fall on fertile soil here rather than go overseas and be lost to Australian business and Australian jobs in the future. These are the tests that Australians, in 50 or 100 years looking back, will apply to this generation.
On Tuesday night, these were the tests before this Treasurer. He was asked to answer them on television just minutes after his speech. He was asked on budget night what the vision was beyond the GST. He was asked for the vision, and what he gave us was, `Ummm'. He gave us `Ummm'. He then gave us the mouth opening and shutting—for once soundlessly. He gave us the mouth opening and shutting, and then he gave us multiple circular hand movements. And then he just started in again on the GST.
No performance, Madam President, could have been more eloquent.	No performance could have illustrated more completely the real failure of this budget. It is not about investing for the future; it is just about a 
 GST.	How, indeed, could it be about anything else? We have now seen the cost of this GST. It is a cost which means this government can't afford anything else. It can't afford what the nation really needs.
The Treasurer announced on Tuesday surpluses of $5.4 billion, $7.2 billion, $5.2 billion and $11.4 billion over the next four years. What he didn't announce was that the attempt to sell the GST has cost the surplus $5 billion next year, $5 billion the year after that and $7 billion the year after that. That is $17 billion, and that is the real price tag of this GST.
Now leave aside for one moment whether you're a supporter or not of the GST. Leave aside the merits for and against. Ask yourself this: is it wise, is it prudent, is it strategic to spend over $17 billion to secure one public policy objective, when the nation faces so many challenges, requiring many different responses, across a range of fronts? Because that $17 billion is not just black ink.
That could be the foundation of a new nation, and still see a decent surplus maintained—still see all the surpluses announced on Tuesday night maintained. But it is to become just so much spun sugar around a failing tax. What should a mature nation do with such a strong budgetary position—squander it on measures that feed into consumption and do nothing for investment—economic fairy floss? Spend more on new computers for the tax office's GST enforcement than on labour market programs for the unemployed? No, a mature nation would invest a portion of that in building the knowledge-based economy, and still leave larger surpluses than this government.
The GST is a waste of a strong budgetary position. It is a waste of a surplus built with a tax system claimed to be broken.
—Come on Cookie—get him wagger wagger.
—Don't worry; wagger wagger's here.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There are too many interjections.
—A surplus built on cuts in past years to our national investment in innovation; to our household savings which are now less than one per cent of household income, compared to six per cent when this government came to power; and to decent industry policy—all of which lie at the heart of a strong future for this country. It is a surplus wasted on a tax the rest of the industrialised world is trying to escape.
The European Commission today—recognising that they have been locked in by their past agreements—is desperately trying to work out ways to break out of their GST and restore job growth in the services sector. Analysts of Japan as serious as the Reserve Bank of Australia say that the principal problem of the international economy today is the inability of the Japanese to get consumer spending going and growth back in their economy; a problem stemming in part from the raising of Japan's GST, which in any case is only half of the one proposed for Australia. And even with all the money the government is spending on trying to sweeten its GST, it still can't deal fairly with low income Australians. These budget papers show its pensioner compensation has an in-built self-destruct mechanism. If you care to do the maths, they show that pensioner compensation will now be completely eroded within 4 years. By 2003-04, the pension will be worth around $426 a fortnight under the GST—exactly the same amount pensioners would have got without the GST.
But let me return, Madam President, to the dimensions of this budget's failure in providing a strategy for our nation to make its way in the world. The Prime Minister wishes this to be seen as an education budget. It makes you shudder to think what a bean counter's budget would have looked like.
Let's understand where we start from in this. Thirty-seven per cent of our labour force did not finish high school. This compares to 19 per cent in the United Kingdom, 14 per cent in Germany, and just 11 per cent in the United States.	Fifteen per cent of Australians have at least a university level education, compared to 26 per cent of Americans. We 
 start from behind in the education race, and we have a lot of catching up to do.
The place to start is with our children. Modern governments should understand that lifting the educational attainment of children is an investment, both in our society and in the future productivity of our economy. You cannot achieve this simply by spending a little extra on a minority of children, and you certainly don't achieve it by giving to some children at the expense of others. But this is the current government's approach. The government's view on education is that its responsibility ceases when it has changed the funding equation of the private school system supporting 30 per cent of our kids.
Let me make this clear: we do not have a problem with more funding for non-government schools. But when you are a national government, your responsibility is to all schools, not just to some. Prime Minister, do you mean to tell me that when next Kim Beazley goes to Safety Bay Primary School in his electorate—as he did a few weeks ago for their Anzac Day ceremony—that the kids he sees there are not deserving of decent attention from their national government?
Let me tell this parliament something: ever since Kim Beazley's father lanced the boil of the sectarian divide which had crippled Australia's education system since Federation, the national government has accepted that all kids are our kids—the responsibility to meet their needs is shared by us all. He offered the opportunity for all kids from all backgrounds to exercise freedom of choice and freedom of conscience. Ever since then, we haven't seen blazers or sweatshirts, we have seen the kids themselves. How can this government now say that a child at Safety Bay Primary is worth one-twentieth the amount of extra funding of a child at a non-government school?
We have never divided Australian children into federal government ones and state government ones. Have those on the other side never heard of Jeff Kennett, or John Olsen, or Richard Court? Perhaps they endorse their special brand of care and attention to government schools? We know this: just in case a Liberal Premier had a fleeting inclina 
 tion to do the right thing by kids in government schools, in the 1996 budget this government's new formula meant that, regardless of increasing numbers in government schools, their Commonwealth contributions would be cut.
Prime Minister, you are responsible for every schoolchild in this country. You are responsible for their education now, and their opportunities later in life. You cannot wash your hands of any of them, let alone two-thirds of them. But the attitude on schools is of a piece with everything else this government has done on education.
This budget celebrates an outcome which delivers $800 million a year less in direct Commonwealth higher education funding than in Labor's last year in office. The minister and his Prime Minister had one fig leaf between them to say that they ever cared at all for the smart kid from the bush or for a poor family who deserved a place at university. That was the merit scholarship scheme. It was paltry, it was parsimonious, and now it is past tense.
And what is the government's argument? It doesn't have $6.8 million for scholarships for smart poor kids: `We have a $5.4 billion surplus, but gee, $6.8 million, we haven't got that kind of money!' This government thinks it has done its job for the education of this country, when it restores just $150 million of the $2 billion it cut from the higher education system in 1996. It declares itself relaxed with the idea of students doing science and engineering—the degrees which perhaps more than any others will build a knowledge-based society in this country—paying more than those doing arts. The government thinks its job is done when it leaves TAFE funding where it is. This government's job is not done.
Similarly, the government paints itself as the saviour of Australia's research effort. But know this: taken together, all the Commonwealth support for education and training and for both public and private research and development activity has fallen from three per cent of GDP—not enough—when we were in office, to 2.5 per cent in this budget; and, in all probability, to 2.3 per cent at the end of 
 this four-year period. And those figures include the government's one lifebelt in this budget—its spending on medical research.
Let me make a few points about that. Firstly, the very Wills review which has prompted this spending says that restoration of the 150 per cent R&D tax concession is more important. Secondly, $600 million for medical research over six years compares to $6,000 million over four years you are spending on an ineffective failing private health insurance initiative. Finally, this small increase in medical research grants will scarcely compensate (if at all) for the cash-strapped public hospitals which used to invest in this area dragging their research dollars out, and for the universities, who used to do this research from their operating grants, hauling back their medical research grants as their funding has been cut.
Which brings me, Madam President, to health. We all remember the John Howard of the 1970s: a new health plan every year. Now we have the ultimate in political nostalgia: a new health plan every year from the John Howard of the 1990s. This government claimed to have solved the problems with private health care when it spent the initial $700 million on private health insurance in 1996. Remember how that was going to lift membership from 30 per cent to 40 per cent? But it didn't. Then it was $1.5 billion a year for a 30 per cent rebate. They thought they had solved the problem then but, when questioned in parliament by us and forced to confess, said it was really about lifting it from 30 per cent to 33 per cent.
Now we are told—this time for sure—that the problem will be solved, except the $1.5 billion is now just to tread water. Just treading water, when half of that $1.5 billion—half of it—would fully meet every single state demand: reopen all the wards closed in public hospitals; reopen the regional hospitals that have closed wards or closed altogether; put on the nurses; put on the doctors; and perform the procedures. Half of the $1.5 billion would have been enough to fix the system everyone uses.
And that is the point. We have in this budget the end of community rating in reality and the introduction of so-called lifetime community rating. I have already indicated we will look at this fairly, but looking at it fairly also means protecting universal health care—not letting it become the next sacrifice to this government's public policy failures.
One thing we will seek in scrutinising lifetime community rating is a commitment from the government to guarantee universal access to public hospitals. We will not let the next step—the fifth health plan—be means testing for public hospital access.
In the meantime what about some mutual obligation here from the health insurance funds? Has this government got them all to close the gaps? Has it got them to control the premiums? Has it got them to hold their premiums in the middle of this year at least? Has it got them to do any of that? No, nothing at all. It has demanded nothing of the health insurance funds—nothing whatsoever—except to be the cheerful recipients of a Commonwealth blank cheque.
But we know what kind of mutual obligation the Prime Minister has in mind for Australians. Yesterday on television he said that families simply had to re-order their spending priorities to afford private health insurance, and I quote:
You might say to yourself `Gee, it's more important to stop that and go into private health insurance now than to add another country to my next overseas trip.'
Gee, indeed! So, workers of Australia, if you are having trouble affording private health insurance, what with all the cuts to government services and a GST around the corner, I have the solution for you: just knock off the stopover in Tahiti on the way back from your skiing holiday in Austria. Just knock that off and you too can afford private health insurance, don't you know?
So we say to the Prime Minister and to this government, `You have not done your job. You've not done your job, above all, for the families of Australia. You have forced them to be responsible for their young unemployed adults and you have cynically failed—despite your promises and undertakings to the Senate 
 and Senator Harradine—to give them the relief they need.' And why on earth not? To build back in the money that Senator Harradine demanded would require an extra $50 million a year from your budget surplus of $5.4 billion. Here is your challenge: the youth allowance legislation is before this parliament now. Amend it now. We will support you.
And, finally, as with every budget this government has produced, its greatest failing is on jobs. The budget forecasts unemployment stuck at 7.5 per cent through to the year 2000. But, of course, 7.5 per cent is not really 7.5 per cent. It has only been achieved off the back of thousands of Australians giving up the search for work, and continuing to do so in future. If this government had not pushed so many people out of the work force entirely, the unemployment rate today would be over eight per cent.
Unemployment in this country should be well on the way down to five per cent. Even the Treasurer himself briefly flirted with decency on a five per cent target, but has come over all agnostic again. We are nowhere near five per cent and with no hope in sight, because employment growth is forecast to fall in this budget. That is the fault of a government which cares not a jot for employment, and so is this: long-term unemployment is higher today than when the coalition began to cut jobs programs, despite three years of economic growth in between.
It is higher because this government has actively determined against sharing the benefits of economic growth with all Australians. The so-called `new' spending on labour market programs in this budget is a calculated insult to unemployed Australians. Firstly, it is a tiny, tiny fraction of the $1.8 billion cut from labour market programs since 1996. Secondly, it is not new money at all but an undignified recycling of money cut from the government's failed Job Network and hastily re-badged. Thirdly, the so-called `new' spending on jobs programs is less than the amount spent on new computers for the tax office for GST enforcement. And, finally, the government chose employment to break 
 another election promise in this budget. It promised $90 million for Dr Kemp's New Apprenticeships, but has lost $40 million of that along the way.
But know this, Madam President. I know that people look to the opposition for an alternative strategy. Well, we are offering one. I return to what I said at the beginning about what this budget could have achieved. If the GST were not implemented, contemplate the investments among which you could choose for a better future. With no GST, you could provide balanced funding for government and non-government schools—not $210 per student in non-government schools and $10 for government students, but fair and balanced treatment for all Australian kids, and a bit of relief for those schools suffering under coalition state governments. That would cost just a fraction of the GST compensation and the benefit would be not miserly compensation for an unfair tax but better educated children.
With no GST, you could provide planned pension increases that would last, rather than compensation which disappears within four years. With no GST, you could double what the government has merely recycled from its failed Job Network into Work for the Dole. You could make it real new funding, and a real labour market program while you were at it—with training and in-work benefits and the hope of a job at the end of it: some hope, perhaps, for the 200,000 long-term unemployed in this country, including those in regional Australia and the citizens of Wagga Wagga.
With no GST, you could have kept the university scholarship scheme for disadvantaged kids which this government axed in the budget. Indeed, you could even make it a little more generous. You could start to redress this government's failure on private saving. The average 35-year-old worker has lost $100,000 from his or her eventual super payout through government cuts alone. A new superannuation co-contribution would lift national savings and improve retirement incomes.
You could contemplate tax reform without a GST. Remember, we are supporting propos 
 als by this government to ensure people pay their fair share of tax not involving a GST. You could deliver fairer tax cuts and implement the tax credits that this country so badly needs. You could reform business taxation so that it rewarded innovation and investment in new industries. The R&D tax concessions could be restored.
You could do most of these things, and still have a surplus greater than this government announced on Tuesday night—greater than the surpluses it expects in the coming years. You could spend far less than this government, and achieve far more for our nation.
I say all of this to highlight the road not taken: the real cost of a GST, even before it arrives—the real cost in terms of the national ambition we are about to lose. This—as much as the unfairness of the GST—is what Labor, and Australia, have at stake in this tax debate. This is why we are keeping our election promise to oppose the GST.
But we are keeping something else, too. And that is the idea that a budget is about all Australians—about a national ambition which we used to have and which still burns brightly among our fellow citizens. We are about keeping that ambition alive. It will not die these three years, and it will return again to those government benches.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-05-13,"—Madam President, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I rise tonight to reply to the Treasurer's 1999 budget speech. Compared with many countries in our immediate region, and indeed many well beyond our borders, Australia is a lucky country. Our problem is that more and more Australians are not able to share in the luck and fully enjoy the benefits. These Australians are falling further and further behind, despite the Treasurer's `magic set of numbers' and despite the delight of the international financial markets with Australia's economic performance.
The budget was delivered by the Treasurer on Tuesday night with great gusto, great pizazz and great style. But, really, it was more of the same, admittedly with a few elements that are to be welcomed. Style is 
 one thing; content is another. Frankly, I do not quite understand why the Treasurer is so excited about his budget.
It is a budget where the gaping social deficit caused by underfunded education, health and social programs is allowed to grow and keep growing. This is despite huge revenue driven surpluses. It is a budget of narrow vision from an uncaring government, from mean-spirited leaders in pursuit of `a beautiful set of numbers' at the expense of decent levels of community service. It is a budget of style without much content. As I said on budget night, this is a nouvelle cuisine budget—a few dainty, well-presented morsels that fail to satisfy. Having said that, I do welcome the very modest loosening of the purse strings that has allowed a few positive spending measures to be implemented.
This evening I propose to do three things: firstly, I shall briefly address overall fiscal policy; I shall then address specific budget measures; and, finally, I shall look beyond the budget to the wider tax debate.
This budget proudly proclaims a surplus of $5.4 billion. This, we are told, is the great turnaround from the so-called $10 billion black hole. But, as I have pointed out before, the black hole was largely a figment of the Treasury's imagination in doing the bidding of its political masters—a Treasury which is always keen to find an excuse to slash support for ordinary Australians, for students, for the disabled, for the aged and for the unemployed. But looking back over the budget papers, we can see just how wrong Treasury was. Indeed, half of the budget cuts were not necessary once the conservative bias of Treasury estimates was taken into account.
Then we get to the 1999-2000 surplus, which will be $3.8 billion higher than at the mid-year review. Why? Well, the ever compliant Treasury model upped the revenue estimates by $4.4 billion. So Peter Costello's surplus is essentially revenue driven. Revenue flows because the economy is strong. Revenue has risen by $19 billion since Peter Costello became Treasurer. Even if there really was a black hole, the economy could have and would have filled most of it without any action on the part of the Treasurer.
The Treasurer has made much of his claim that this budget keeps $1.2 billion of election promises. But what about the $1.8 billion of non-core promises that were broken in his earlier budgets? What about those massive and unnecessary cuts to education, health, employment, industry and social welfare programs? He might have conveniently forgotten them but we have not, and neither have the millions of ordinary Australians who were hurt by the savage cuts.
The Melbourne Institute did a major study on the distributional effects of those cuts and they found that the cuts cost the average Australian household $7 a week. Worse, for families living on less than $400 a week, the cuts set them back $14 per week. The government argues that these families will get their bonus next year with the tax cuts. But they won't! A two-income couple on $400 a week with two children will get only $9.85 a week from the tax package. So they are still worse off because of this government's failure to keep their promises in 1996.
The Treasurer persists with the furphy that all this pain was necessary to retire debt. What a nonsense. Anyone with even a limited knowledge of economics must know that Australia does not have a public sector debt problem. We have the fourth lowest level of government net debt as a percentage of GDP in the OECD. Our debt level, as a percentage of GDP, is 40 per cent of that of the UK, 38 per cent of that of the US, 26 per cent of that of Canada, half the debt of Japan and 28 per cent of that of European Union countries.
Since 1996 the government has reduced debt by around $24 billion. I liken it to paying off a very manageable home mortgage ahead of time but not feeding or clothing the kids properly. Yet, despite all this much vaunted debt retirement, the current account deficit has almost doubled. This is because of the continuing build-up of private debt. There is simply no causal relationship between the current account deficit and public sector debt. No competent, realistic economist would own up to believing that there is.
The government has moved to accrual accounting; and I welcome the move, particularly as it adds weight to my argument that 
 we do not have a debt problem. With the accrual accounting regime and with realistic valuations it is clear that Australia's public sector is very close to being debt free. We can see this because of the government's balance sheet. For the first time, we have included estimates of assets and liabilities. At page 4-8 of the budget papers, the Treasury estimates the Australian government's net assets/net liabilities position as minus $63.8 billion, or about 11 per cent of GDP. This is the shock-horror debt we are trying to get rid of—as little as that.
But this figure is misleading. It includes Telstra as an asset, but marks it at book value only. The book value of Telstra is $11 billion, whereas the market value of Telstra is about $100 billion. So the true value of the government's share of Telstra is understated in the balance sheet by about $60 billion. There goes the net liability—it vanishes, evaporates, it is gone. It was that easy.
But wait, there is more! The balance sheet includes an unfunded superannuation liability of $70 billion, a figure calculated by the Australian Government Actuary. This is the gross cost to government of future superannuation liabilities. But the Actuary noted in his report that this is overstating the government's real costs. This is because the payment of superannuation reduces future social security pension payments. He calculated the actuarial value of this at about $30 billion. So the real cost to government of its employees' superannuation is not $70 billion but closer to $30 billion. If we take the real value of Telstra and the real value of superannuation liabilities into account, the net liability of the government is not minus $63.8 billion but plus $26.2 billion. In short, we have no public sector debt problem.
By all means, the government should aim for fiscal balance in times of plenty and not add to debt, but I stress again: we do not have a debt problem. I believe that a surplus of $5.4 billion this year, rising to $12 billion in three years, is frankly obscene when social services are not being adequately funded, when pensioners have to wait two years for basic dental treatment and when, over the past six months, 65 per cent of welfare agencies 
 reported significant increases in demand for their services.
This hard-right economic rationalism flows through to other economic parameters. Unemployment is forecast to stay at 7.5 per cent for the next 18 months. There is not a single measure in this budget to do anything about it, to actually try to accelerate jobs growth. We are told labour market reform will fix it. But it will not. The most recent OECD Economic Outlook summarises the most recent research on this issue and demonstrates quite clearly that cutting minimum wages and lowering employee protection does not provide more jobs.
Modern economic theory and prominent economists like Paul Romer, Paul Krugman, Lester Thurow and Robert Reich map out the policies that governments should follow to maximise economic opportunities in a global economy. They are education, training, research and development and spending on infrastructure. These are the keys to jobs growth. Making the tax system more jobs friendly is something that we are trying to do at the moment. All these things have to be done, but this budget, in all its stylish splendour, does absolutely nothing. I believe this is the greatest failing of this budget—the failure to address unemployment. The unemployed have paid the price of the government's fiscal restraint policies, and indeed in many ways they have bought the surplus. By any measure, they should have been the first beneficiaries of the any surplus, and they were not.
I now turn my attention to the actual content of the budget. I was very pleased to see at last a substantial injection of funds for medical research, the additional funding for indigenous health, and the government keeping its promises for more funding for rural health and the hepatitis C program. I will not dwell on the new private health insurance initiatives. I guess we can now say with certainly that the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion injection did not work—so here we go again with yet another attempt.
On education, the Democrats welcome the increased funding for literacy and numeracy programs, languages and teachers' profess 
 ional development. But we do question why additional funding is provided to the 30 per cent of students in private schools—some $561 million over four years—but nothing for the seriously underfunded public school system.
On the environment, the Democrats reject the continuing link between the sale of Telstra and funding for the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. The case for such a link was always flimsy and, with a $5.4 billion surplus, there is absolutely no case for treating environment spending any differently from other core government activity. Tying funding for the environment to the sale of Telstra is, quite simply, blackmail. It is unconscionable for government to abrogate responsibility for our significant environmental debt in this fashion.
I note that the government has allocated $5 million for monitoring toxic air, and that will certainly be needed if the cost of diesel comes down as a result of the tax package getting through unchanged. It is ironic that this program will highlight the considerable increase in pollution which will arise from cutting the price of this toxic fossil fuel. I also note with dismay that funding for environment groups will be conditional on those groups complying with government policy. This government's determination to muzzle policy debate in the community sector is just breathtaking. Environment groups and individuals in them play an important role in exposing the full horrors of government decisions that have a profound impact upon the environment.
The Democrats welcome the government's new commitment to regulate biotechnology, but we are concerned that the `integrated strategy' announced in the budget could amount to little more than an attempt to muzzle community opposition through one of the government's legendary `education' campaigns.
As I indicated, the Democrats are disappointed at the lack of action on employment. While we welcome additional funding for indigenous employment initiatives, we question the merit of extending the Work for the Dole scheme. The government's own analysis shows that only 32 per cent of participants get 
 jobs as a result. I would suggest to the government that just allowing the unemployed to do however much voluntary work they wanted to do would get about the same outcome.
But let us compare Work for the Dole with the success rates of some other programs. It does not stand up very well. Jobstart had a 50 per cent success rate, traineeships had an 80 per cent success rate and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme had a 90 per cent success rate. These schemes were either not continued or not expanded by this government.
Yet again there is more slashing of public sector jobs. Now we see another 2,000 going. This is in addition to the 28,000 Public Service jobs abolished in the first three years of Costello budgets. Centrelink, incredibly, is the big loser with 900 more jobs to go. That is on top of the 8,000 slashed already from this agency in previous years. Slashing jobs will do nothing for the already appalling levels of service available to Centrelink clients.
The major social security initiative in this budget was the great youth allowance concession, granting the 41,000 families who lost up to $80 a week just $19 a week in extra family payments. But this miserly concession will be made available only if this chamber passes the government's tax reform package.
—More blackmail.
—You are quite right, Senator Woodley. Senator Harradine described the measure as too little, too late and as improperly tied to the tax debate, and I have to agree with him. We can now add the youth allowance to the list of $1.8 billion worth of broken promises, all under the umbrella of Mr Howard's ironclad guarantee in 1995 that he would not undermine the social safety net.
This government seems to pride itself on the hundreds of thousands of people it throws out of the social security system—around 161,000 in 1997-98 alone. Five of the 13 budget press releases that we have seen come across our desks so far are from the Minister for Family and Community Services announ 
 cing new crackdowns to get even more people out of the social security net. One would have thought they had dreamt up every possible means of getting people off social security, but we see they have found some more.
Given its failure to keep promises to maintain the safety net, I cannot see how anyone can trust this government to compensate people fully for the impact of a GST. Mr Costello has already said that he will not accept anything that costs in the billions, yet the cost of making sure that no-one is worse off under a GST will be upwards of $5 billion. Mr Costello clearly will not meet that, so it follows that 4.9 million Australians will still be worse off under the GST unless food is exempt. This is why we do not trust the government's compensation approach. This is why we will not be backing down on our insistence that food stay out of the GST net. Keeping food out eliminates three-quarters of the price effect of the GST and therefore three-quarters of the need for compensation.
The Treasurer continues to misrepresent the Democrats' approach to tax reform. He accuses us of wanting to destroy the tax plan, of wanting to plunder his precious surplus. Simply, he is wrong. Our approach is fully funded and, if adopted, would not draw one extra cent from that precious surplus.
Keeping food out of the GST net would cost $3.6 billion in 2000-01. We propose that this be paid for by paring back the tax cuts to high income earners by $3.6 billion. Other Democrat amendments to the GST would cost $700 million. We propose that these be paid for by a combination of paring back the off-road diesel tax credits and the lower inflation and higher employment flowing from a food free GST. We propose that the $500 million needed to eliminate poverty traps be paid for by closing the FBT concessional treatment of motor vehicles. Our changes to the road transport diesel excise are fully self-funded as we reallocate the savings from road transport to rail and also to gas vehicles.
These are the facts. With the Democrats' proposed changes to improve the tax package, the surplus is unaffected. The tax system is fairer as low income earners will pay less tax 
 and high income earners will pay more tax, and the worst effects of the GST are minimised. All this is done without compromising the economic benefits of tax reform or the budget's bottom line. I must say that it would be much easier to negotiate with the Treasurer if he actually took the time to read our proposals before making ill-informed statements. He might even be a bit more relaxed once he understood our position and realised that we will not touch that precious surplus.
The looming tax debate has already overshadowed what is essentially a do-nothing, tunnel vision budget. After all the pain endured by ordinary Australians during the last four years of economic reform, they have a right to expect more from the government than this. They have a right to expect that those who bore the pain of economic reform will be the first to share the gains. That has not happened and people are disappointed—but I do not think that they are surprised.
Mr Costello's nouvelle cuisine budget is long on style and short on content. It fails the very people who most need a helping hand from government and, like nouvelle cuisine, it fails to satisfy.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 1999-2000</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-05-13,"—This budget says a lot about what makes up this government's picture of reality. The government's reality is one that favours a free market economy over an economy that supports all elements of the community. It is a reality that prioritises financial statements over more comprehensive indicators of wellbeing in a society; it is a reality that prioritises profits over people; and it is a reality that favours the private over the public.
It is a reality that favours those who do well in the free market economy, such as those in the big end of town, over those who do not do so well in the free market economy, such as the unemployed, low income earners, rural and regional communities, non-profit community groups, immigrants and small business. It is a reality of social conservatism and economic liberalism that the Prime Minister has branded `the Australian way'. 
 Presumably, those who do not fit into this reality are unAustralian.
So, in fact, the government's reality goes further than just privatising and favouring the free market economy, the private sector and those who prosper in it. The government's reality actually demonises those who do not do so well—indicating that they are unAustralian, saying that they should pull themselves up by their bootstraps and be self-reliant. This demonising process is evident in the mutual obligation philosophy, the obsession with cracking down on so-called welfare cheats.
In speaking in response to this year's budget, I would like to highlight the aspects of the budget that reflect the government's reality, and also stress where the government's reality diverges from what is really happening in the Australian community. In doing so, I would firstly like to address whether the economic and financial aspects of the budget reflect reality. Secondly, I would like to focus on whether specific budget measures are adequate for what is really happening. I would finally like to focus on the push towards privatisation and the private sector that is evident in this budget.
What is really happening in the Australian community? This budget shows a fiscal balance of $5.4 billion. It forecasts low inflation, growth at around 3 per cent, export volume growth, a slight reduction in imports and a current account deficit of $32 billion. Do these figures really reflect what is happening on the ground? Clearly, no. When you look at the comprehensive indicators rather than at the narrow financial and economic indicators, the deficiencies of the government's priorities are manifest. It is clear that we are in deficit.
Let us look at accrual budgeting, which we believe is a lost opportunity. The changes in this budget to accrual budgeting and to an outcome-outputs framework are a lost opportunity to expand the available indicators. While it is a positive step to incorporate some range of costs, such as superannuation, other employee entitlements, capital depreciation of assets and the cost of replacing assets, this does not accurately reflect the full costs of 
 transactions. If the principles behind accrual budgeting had been properly implemented, then there would have been a proper costing of social capital, human capital and environmental capital. If these elements had been incorporated and costed properly, we would have seen a budget in deficit, and it would have been in accord with the reality of what communities are feeling on the ground.
While comprehensive statistics may be difficult to gather, it is really a matter of priorities and political will. The government is already appropriating money to the Australian Bureau of Statistics—as well they should—to produce comprehensive environmental accounts. Many of them have already been published and would provide a useful basis for incorporation. But it is fairly easy to see why the government would be reluctant to include these kinds of figures. There have been a number of studies which indicate that the incorporation of these statistics would decimate the nice bottom line and the handsome $5.4 billion surplus.
For instance, in 1996 the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories produced a report entitled Subsidies for the use of natural resources in which it was estimated that the government was underpricing its annual environmental capital depletion to the tune of between $7.746 billion and $8.866 billion per annum. This was in addition to the $5.732 billion in financial subsidies to use natural resources. These are reasonably conservative estimates; the study did not even include subsidies for mining. That was obviously too much of a hot potato. In addition, if the reduction in human and social capital had been accounted for, the nice bottom line would have looked even more miserly. Remember that this is annual depletion.
Social capital relates to the possession of sound and stable political, legal and commercial institutions, and cohesive, supportive and trusting communities. Human capital represents the accumulation of health, skills, knowledge and experience in humans. Again, some of these issues are difficult to quantify, but there have been some real advances made in attempts to quantify these 
 intangibles. For instance, there has been an attempt to develop genuine progress indicators around the world that more accurately reflect the reality of national well-being.
Some elements of the genuine progress indicator for Australia developed by the Australia Institute include income distribution, which can show whether the hailed gains are being shared evenly among the community; value of household and community work; costs of unemployment, including loss of output; loss of human capital because of a decline in skills, declining levels of health and increased levels of suicide; increased levels of crime; increased rates of family breakdown, psychological impacts on the families of the unemployed, trauma, stress and loss of self-esteem; and the costs of overwork.
In 1997 Australian research by Buchanan and Bearfield indicated that there were 1.7 million people who worked unpaid overtime and 900,000 people who worked paid overtime. There are often health implications associated with overwork. A recent example, in a 1998 survey conducted by the ACTU on stress at work, discovered that more than 60 per cent of people reported a range of health effects from stress at work, such as headaches, continual tiredness, anger and sleeplessness. These examples highlight the fact that the government's textbook budget analysis is reductionist and that it does not reflect the reality of environmental destruction and social dislocation in Australia. It should be obvious to this government because similar things are happening where similar policies are being implemented in other countries.
The Greens (WA) have always taken a keen interest in the budget process and have attempted to broaden the agenda around the budget to emphasise community participation and the interconnectedness of the economy, the community and the environment. The Greens (WA) believe that it is important to reduce the mystique surrounding the budget and economic policy in general. This still remains a serious obstacle to the community's ability to understand and to play an active role in the formulation of spending priorities in the budget. Developing a more realistic set of measures that the community can relate to 
 is a step in the right direction—or it would be if the government thought more carefully about what they were doing. It could also provide a comprehensive basis for transparent and informed policy making. Wouldn't that be a nice surprise?
Let us look at the budget measures themselves and whether they are adequate for the community. Let us look at what is notable and what is missing rather than at any of the specific positive measures. There was a deafening silence on the issue of the environment this year. The word was not muttered in the Treasurer's second reading speech, nor at all in the media coverage. But the figures speak for themselves. Department of the Environment and Heritage funding will be reduced in the out-years from $393.4 million this year to $344 million in 2002-03. The budget documents highlight the fact that, after 2002, we will only have funds allocated to environment protection if the parliament agrees to sell off more of the family silver. The money for Natural Heritage Trust programs will drop from $390 million to $8 million in less than four years.
Do the Prime Minister and the Treasurer really believe that this is an appropriate method of funding environmental protection in this country? Would it be acceptable, for example, if the purchase of new defence equipment or social security payments were contingent on further asset sales? How about cake stalls and raffles for the next frigate? And what happens to the environment when we run out of family silver?
Another travesty for the environment is the cuts in funding to voluntary environment and heritage organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation and a range of state conservation councils. Perhaps worse than the cuts per se is the commentary in the portfolio budget statement—this has been mentioned also by Senator Lees, but it is worth mentioning again—that funding is dependent on whether their activities contribute to government environment and heritage priorities. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage thought this was a cute statement because at some stage that statement had been made by a previous 
 minister—but it had not been put as a budget output. That is the problem. It means funding is contingent on people being gagged. It doesn't take Einstein to work out that this is code for, `If you do what the government wants, if you agree with the government and toe the line, then you will be a winner.'
Who does that leave us with? How could environment groups possibly meet this criterion? We have a government which is planning on spending $3.5 billion to $4 billion on pure environmental destruction if the tax package goes through with its cuts to the diesel excise. That is apart from the other elements in the package which are detrimental to other elements of the environment. We have a government which prefers to support uranium mining rather than protect world heritage property. We have a government which is supporting the logging of old-growth forests over their conservation. How could environment groups possibly contribute to the government's environment and heritage priorities? Who will be left?
It is also important to realise that these most recent cuts and warnings are the continuation of a comprehensive process of defunding any groups that criticise government priorities. Indeed, just two weeks ago the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition was forced to close, after struggling for nearly 12 months after their $350,000 funding was slashed to nothing. AYPAC branded the slashing as `politically motivated and bloody-minded'. And the situation continues for all of those groups in our community who dare to speak out and criticise government policy. They cannot comment on it unless they praise it. Then they get credits for that.
Unemployment was another area where the budget was poignantly silent. While groups such as ACOSS and the ACTU argue that unemployment should be at the centre of the budget, the Treasurer has refused to set any targets for the level of unemployment. The budget provides no extra funding for proper labour market programs and training, and the unemployment rate is set to stay at 7.5 per cent officially, though that is a figure which 
 disguises considerable underemployment and, of course, the working poor.
Labour market services were slashed by $1.8 billion in the government's first term and essentially were replaced by the famous Work for the Dole scheme. Now, despite an equivocal evaluation, the program has been expanded so that 25- to 34-year-olds will be given the privilege of being conscripted for forced labour at the expense of real training and job prospects. The government also short-changed rural apprenticeships by underfunding them to the tune of $40 million. In addition, funding to Centrelink has been decreased by $1 billion over the next six years, despite the fact that it has been plagued with problems and has overworked staff.
Expanding programs such as Work for the Dole is a tactical and ideological manoeuvre by the government to shift the parameters of the problem from unemployment as a social and economic phenomenon to the unemployed as individuals. It plays on and promotes the imagery of the `dole bludger' in a deeply insidious way. Where is the corresponding concept of corporate mutual obligation? On this ground, the government is going the other way and giving corporations a range of rights with no responsibilities in supporting international treaties such as the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, which foundered only because other countries, not Australia, spoke up. In addition, the government is still cruelly targeting social security recipients by cracking down on their receiving rent assistance. In stark contrast, there are no measures to crack down on multinational corporate tax evaders.
The budget measures in the area of health again provide a clear reflection of the government's priorities. We have seen private health insurers receive a $4 billion windfall with the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, and now they are being given the green light to erode the principle of community rating. Contrast this with the glaring hole in public health funding and the funding cuts to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service of $91 million over four years, and to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, ANZFA, of $2.5 million in 2000-01, which 
 could severely impact on community health standards, with increased risk of disease. At a time when the government is also set to introduce more genetically modified food, you would think we would need more resources and not less. This is further evidence of the government's commitment to self-regulation for industry and the decimation of the public sector.
Another area of deafening silence was the area of overseas aid. The Australian Council for Overseas Aid has expressed concern that the current funding is at an all-time low as a percentage of gross domestic product. But I am sure Australia will be looking at what we can do to help solve the problems when many of these local economies implode when other stresses cause internal ructions which end up being a so-called defence and foreign affairs issue. It is very short-sighted on behalf of this government.
Any reasonable policies in relation to our current account deficit or initiatives that address the current level of our current account deficit are also completely absent. The government's answer is greater savings and keeping the budget in surplus. The Greens have often spoken out about the `twin deficit theory' myth. International evidence shows up the government's cries that the current account deficit has a strong relationship to savings or to the budget. Thailand is a perfect example. Thailand was a casualty of the Asian crisis despite good savings and a budget surplus. All through the 1990s Thailand ran its budget at a two per cent surplus, which would be a surplus of around $11 billion a year if Australia were to run a surplus at the same level. In addition, Thailand had one of the highest national savings as a proportion of gross domestic product, at about 40 per cent in 1999. The issues are about structure, about the way we operate our economy and about our priorities, and the government is blind to the structural problems that it has ignored over the last few years.
The final issue I would like to raise is the clear theme in the budget which is the push to the private sector. I have already commented on the windfall for private health 
 insurance funds. There is also increased funding for non-government schools by $561 million over four years and for Catholic schools by $553 million, which totally swamps the comparatively minor amount of $131 million for public students' literacy and numeracy. In addition, we have the further sell-off of assets including Telstra, the commercialisation of the Department of Finance and Administration's property portfolio and an extension of the information technology outsourcing program for all public departments. There are also savings from competitive tendering and contracting principles.
In light of this Government's clear preference for the private sector, the Greens (WA) are sceptical of how the government will use its newly found transparency with accrual budgeting. I am waiting for the time—in fact we have had elements of it—when the minister will come to this chamber and say, `I can't tell you the answer to the way public money has been spent in my portfolio because it is subject to commercial-in-confidence.'
In the budget documents, the government emphasised that one of the major benefits of the moves to accrual accounting was that the public sector would be operating more like a business. There is a danger that the government will use the greater transparency in relation to the capital assets of agencies to pressure agencies to sell off assets and outsource services requiring significant assets. Outsourcing has massive negative implications for transparency as service providers use the `commercial-in-confidence' term that I mentioned as a banner to undermine public accountability.
They are putting in a 12 per cent capital use charge as a further pressure on agencies to take this route. It is amazing how you can have a 12 per cent capital use charge when you relate it to the current interest rates, but that is what they are charging. The government has also indicated that agencies will have to get down on their hands and knees to beg for further assets. In one of the `fact sheets'—loosely named—produced by the Department of Finance and Administration 
 called Accrual appropriation framework it is stated that:
. . . new capital provided by Government . . . will be appropriated separately as an equity injection or loan. They are not generally expected to occur frequently.
This means that government services and programs will have to act as if they are a business on a profit basis. What does that mean for the expectation of people in the community that the government be able to do those things which are not provided generally by the private sector? Indeed, some of the `fact sheets' issued by DOFA specifically comment that the new framework will support competitive pricing and facilitate choice. This obviously relates to increasingly pushing for government departments to outsource and to aim for `competitive neutrality' with business.
—Perhaps they will tender out their grandmother soon.
—Probably. I have mentioned the government's reality and I would like to conclude with a vision that reflects the Greens' reality.
The Greens' vision is of a happier and more balanced society where work and incomes are more equitably distributed and there is less emphasis on consumption in favour of increased leisure. That should be the vision. In this vision people feel a greater sense of belonging to a local community; culture and diversity are respected and celebrated; work is a satisfying expression of self and an opportunity to cooperate with others; opportunities are open to all; and poverty and environmental degradation are minimised. This is what we mean by a sustainable economy.
