Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:43):  When I was speaking earlier on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018, I was recounting the history of the GST legislation.


I mentioned that the GST was first introduced in 2000, but we know that Mr Howard, the former Prime Minister, indicated in 1995 that there was:


… no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy. … Never, ever. It's dead.


But we know that after he was elected, the Liberals changed their tune, with Mr Howard describing the GST in the year 2000 as 'something the country has needed for more than 20 years'. Of course, this issue goes to the heart of our concerns about this government's propensity to backflip on its promises.


The Liberal Party has more form on changing its mind in relation to the GST. During the 2013 election campaign, Mr Abbott said:


Let me be as categorical as I can, the GST will not change. Full stop. End of story.


And:


… the GST simply can't change unless all of the states and territories agree …


And yet, here we are debating the coalition's changes to the GST that the states and territories have reservations about. A letter from the Treasurer of Queensland makes it quite clear that this is a unilateral change by the Commonwealth.


The reservations that we have expressed stem partly from the fact that the new arrangements mean that, while states and territories not performing as well economically as the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria will be topped up, those who outperform the benchmark will keep their surplus funds. That means that there will need to be more money to distribute, hence the need for an injection of Commonwealth funds to the overall GST money pool. Other reservations of the states and territories centre on the ministerial discretion in decision-making written into this legislation. 


There are still questions to be answered by the coalition: Where is the money coming from? How will the new system address economic volatility? What is proposed after the seven-year guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off expires? What will the terms of reference be for the Productivity Commission review? Will the states and territories be guaranteed input into that process? These are questions that I hoped would be answered when the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, of which I'm the deputy chair, inquired into this bill last month. That committee received evidence from all states and territories, the Treasury, the Minerals Council of Australia, Rio Tinto, the Institute of Public Affairs, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia through a public submission process and through our public hearing in Canberra. 


There was evidence, particularly from Western Australian business and resource groups, that the proposed change in distribution method would encourage states and territories to work harder to develop their own economies in order to retain a greater share of the benefits, if outperforming the benchmark state. There was evidence from other states and territories that the current system of HFE is adequate and not broken, and in some cases, as in the case of the South Australian submission, there was an argument that it should be retained.


Labor senators made additional comments in that Senate inquiry report that echo the reservations that I've outlined to the Senate. We pointed out that, once again, the coalition dragged its feet on an important financial reform and, once again, it took Labor action, through announcing our policy, to get the government moving. It was Labor who announced that we would legislate a floor for GST relativities—action that was eventually copied by the Morrison government after they had said in July that 'there's no need to do that'. That was in the committee report. The flip-flopping marketing man, our new Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, soon recognised that Labor was right, just as we were right to fight for the no-state-worse-off guarantee to be enshrined in legislation—another element initially rejected by the Morrison government, with new Treasurer Frydenberg suggesting administration costs would be too high. I note from the report that Mr Frydenberg said: 


Because what some of the states are wanting us to do is to run two parallel systems. They're wanting us to run an old set of books based on what is the current system and a new set of books, which is based on the new system with the floor and the additional $9 billion.


Based on that, the Treasurer had previously expressed his opposition to the no-state-worse-off guarantee. But it was only a week until Mr Frydenberg flip-flopped his way back to Labor's position—a position quite vocally shared by the states and territories. 


So it's clear that only Labor can stand up for the states and territories when it comes to unfair coalition legislation. And we echo their call for transparency around the top-up funding and where that will come from. We want to know how this government, which is consistently big on headlines and thought bubbles and short on detail, intends to find the $9 billion that it is promising to top up the funding pool. Labor shares the real concerns of the states and territories about whether other funding sources will be cut to offset the Commonwealth contribution to the GST pool. That's why Labor senators recommended in our additional comments to the committee's report:


That the letter from the Federal Treasurer to the State and Territory Treasurers stating that 'any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states' be tabled during the Parliamentary debate.


I'm grateful Minister Cormann did provide that letter—I believe he tabled that yesterday. I see that we have a letter from the Treasurer to the Treasurer of Queensland. I just want to read into the Hansard the very important commitment.


I also confirm any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states.


So, that, I think, goes some way to addressing some of the concerns that we have.


A number of the states and territories made reference to this letter in their evidence. In my home state of Queensland, the state government's submission said:


The Australian Treasurer gave assurances in his letter to the Deputy Premier and during the second reading in Parliament that the updated system will not be to the detriment of other payments to states. However, this is not reflected in the Bill or the Explanatory Memorandum.


… … …


The Bill (and Explanatory Memorandum) should be amended to require that pool top-up and additional financial assistance will not come at the expense of other payments to the states.


I want to take a minute or two to look at the Queensland government's submission. For Queenslanders, it highlights some of the concerns that we have. We know that Queensland has the most decentralised population of all the Australian states and is uniquely exposed to arbitrary changes to the GST system when we abandon the principle of full HFE. This is reflected in the Queensland government submission. The system that we've had has meant that Queensland has received less than its population share of GST revenue in some years and more than its share, depending on the economic circumstances. Queensland is particularly exposed in this matter because the GST revenue for Queensland in 2018-19 represents about one-quarter of the state's total revenue. We really need to get this issue right. The Queensland government submission said:


Despite promises of consultation and opposition from states to proposed changes, the Morrison Government introduced the … bill in October 2018. The Bill will permanently change the system of distributing GST revenue … 


The Palaszczuk government in its submission acknowledged that the government has taken, as I said, a unilateral decision to amend the legislation. The Queensland government does welcome the recent amendments to the bill, in particular the 'no state will be worse off' guarantee and the Productivity Commission inquiry, but there are still some concerns. The Queensland government made seven recommendations, which, I think, are all eminently sensible.


One of the things that I was concerned about in relation to the revised GST arrangements is that under the government's preferred model, in the year 2023-24, Queensland was going to be the only state over the transition period that would be financially disadvantaged in comparison to the existing arrangements. During the course of the Senate hearing, I sought clarification from Treasury officials, and they made it very clear that the no-worse-off guarantee applies to individual years over the course of that transition period. Ms Phipps said: 


… we would look at what the difference was between what a particular jurisdiction had got over the course of the previous years under the updated system. If, in the example Queensland gave, they were $100 million worse off in 2023-24, but, for example, were $80 million better off in the updated system across the years prior to that, then the top-up would be $20 million to make sure that, in that year, Queensland was cumulatively in the better of the two systems—was better off.


It has been clarified that those top-up payments do occur within the transition period.


We forgive the state and territories, particularly Queensland, for their cynicism or scepticism about this issue. My home state has been the victim of vicious coalition cuts at both the state and federal levels—devastating cuts to health and education. In most recent times, we've had the Newman government that sacked 14,000 workers, and we've seen cuts at a federal level to public hospitals and penalty rates, and there are less apprentices. We know that it's Labor that have done the hard yards on economic management. We've announced hundreds of policies in the lead-up to the federal election. Our policies are researched and they're costed. We're absolutely up-front about where the money's coming from with our election commitments.


I want to conclude today by mentioning some of the points that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, has written about in an opinion piece. Mr Bowen has said, 'You can trust us with the economy,' because on this side of the chamber we take a holistic approach to economic growth, encompassing tax, infrastructure, connectivity, entrepreneurialism, foreign policy, and, most importantly, investment in human capital. While the coalition cancels COAG and prioritises campaigns, but not campaign bus trips, and covert fundraising efforts, Labor are getting on with the job. We are developing the policies Australia needs to prepare for the future and to bring back the fair go. Labor are stable and united. Labor have listened to the Australian people. We have the policies and the drive. Labor are ready to govern.

"Georgiou, Sen Peter",PHON,2018-11-13,"



Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (12:56):  I've been a passionate advocate for GST reform. I am pleased that the government has finally listened to my calls on behalf of all Western Australians for a fairer slice of the GST pie. This bill is long overdue and will finally make an attempt to correct some of the wrongs of the horizontal fiscal equalisation and its effect on successful economies like that of Western Australia. The extra money will allow the state government to fund schools, hospitals, road upgrades and other infrastructure as needed and hopefully pay down some of our huge debt in Western Australia. It is clear from the Productivity Commission report that Western Australia generated more state sourced revenue than any other state and, as a result, has been penalised for its achievements over the last decade.


Horizontal fiscal equalisation provides a disincentive that spins off in relation to the approval and exploitation of mineral resources located within states and territories. This is the main problem here in WA. Under the existing system, the vast bulk of the additional royalties associated with new mining developments leaks to other states and territories within two or three years. Under the current system, Australian states do not need to strengthen their own natural-resource industries because they know they can sit back and wait for GST redistribution to equalise their capacity every year. If New South Wales and Victoria developed their offshore-gas sectors, they could create billion-dollar industries and inject millions into their own state government revenues. Under the current unfair system, we have effectively removed the incentive for states to develop all their resource industries, and the nation as a whole suffers.


The key question is: why would a state or territory take all the political heat associated with facilitating new mines only to have most of the additional royalty income shared with other states and territories that have not had to face similar political problems? Another critical question I'm asking is this: how is it possible that the revenue from gambling taxes is not included in the GST distribution formula? Western Australia's decision to limit pokie machines means the state has relatively little gambling tax revenue but is penalised for this in the distribution of GST.


The thing about the GST distribution is that it's a win/lose scenario. Giving more to WA must involve giving less to other states, particularly those that are typically overfunded—South Australia and Tasmania, in particular. It's time to get real. Instead of trying to keep everyone happy, the government should announce that the distribution of GST will move to a per capita basis over a five-year time frame, for instance, and in the short term those states that lose out would be partly compensated.


When it comes to the principal of HFE, all citizens should have access to similar services. The federal government should make this happen with specific grants to the states and territories. This would add accountability to the system. The way the GST is currently distributed completely lacks accountability. At the same time, I'm concerned that the government will be dipping into its own coffers to the tune of billions of dollars to ensure no state is worse off. The Treasurer said that all states would be better off with the Commonwealth injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29. The states of South Australia and Tasmania and also the Northern Territory should suck it up. They've had it too good for too long at the expense of other states. They may even lift their game as a result.


In reality, the Commonwealth is doing the minimum as a step towards genuine GST reform. This bill is not perfect. There are still other issues that need to be changed as well. It will take about 10 years to reach full implementation. The date of effect for the updated HFE system, along with a boost to the GST revenue pool, is transitioned into effect from 2021-22, with the new arrangements applying in full from 2026-27. The GST floor is introduced in two stages, with an initial floor introduced for 2022-23 and then raised for 2024-25. The short-term transitional payments apply for three financial years, starting in 2019-20. The Productivity Commission inquiry is to be completed before 31 December 2026. Given what I mention here, I remain unconvinced about the government's desire or intent to pay off the nation's rapidly rising debt and I have concerns about its budgetary and fiscal management skills. I will be supporting this bill despite its many failings for a long-term solution. At least it's a small step in the right direction.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:01):  I also rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018—a bit of a mouthful. What an absolute dog's breakfast the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has made of this debate. Who could forget that in September this year, just weeks after ascending to the prime ministership of this country—an ascendancy he still cannot explain—Prime Minister Morrison is reported to have called the Tasmanian Treasurer, Mr Peter Gutwein, a mendicant for questioning the PM's original fix? The Tasmanian Treasurer, a mendicant for sticking up for his state! If this is the language that Mr Morrison uses to describe fellow Liberal treasurers, imagine what he says about the rest of us! He tries to hide his elitist attitude with his rolled up sleeves and silly hats, but we all know that, while the PM represents a seat in Sydney's southern suburbs, his true affinity is with Sydney's leafy eastern suburbs, exactly the same as the man that he deposed. The arrogance of the man, throwing around 'fair dinkum' more than Russell Coight, Alf Stewart and Steve Irwin to try to speak to us 'normal people' and then barking down the phone at the Treasurer of Tasmania, saying that over half a million Australians are mendicants, as if to say we're not entrepreneurial, not hardworking and not looking to grow.


It hits right at the core of Tasmanians. It's a smaller state, a little island at the bottom of this big country, but we produce. For over 20 years as a union official with the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, I worked day and night with hardworking Tasmanians to get a good deal at work, to continue to grow jobs and opportunities and to secure more investment in Tasmania. To say that our shipbuilders, our heavy vehicle manufacturers, our food manufacturers, our farmers, our component manufacturers, our miners, our foresters, our fishers and all our service providers are mendicants in this nation is an absolute disgrace. Why, Mr Morrison, are hardworking Tasmanians less worthy of good schools, great hospitals and decent roads? Why are we less worthy? And why, Mr Morrison, are hardworking Tasmanians less worthy of strong public services, decent housing and secure jobs?


His statement to the Tasmanian Treasurer and subsequent denials go to the heart of Mr Morrison's values. They go to the core of his elitist attitude to the country. And, worse, they demonstrate again that, when flustered, Mr Morrison buckles under pressure. In the face of legitimate questions from a fellow Liberal treasurer, he wouldn't seek to work through their differences but resorted to cheap abuse, demonstrating his inability to do the job and his disdain for hardworking Tasmanians.


Of course, it didn't have to be this hard for Mr Morrison. This robust debate, as we all call it now, with the Tasmanian Treasurer was about ensuring that no state was worse off. Mr Morrison denied for months that such a guarantee was necessary, even though politicians from all sides, including his own Liberal Treasurer and the Premier of Tasmania, were clear that the guarantee was crucial to ensuring that no state was left behind. So poorly did this ATM government handle this debate that they caved and announced a limited guarantee only after their own Liberal senators finally realised the problem and threatened to cross the floor to support a Labor amendment to protect every state's and territory's share.


If Mr Morrison really cared about Tasmania, really cared about supporting our students and patients and supporting our future prosperity, he would have committed to a guarantee back in July. We're not talking about a few thousand dollars here—a few days' bus hire or a few hundred trucker hats. Respected forecasters estimated that, at worst, Tasmania could lose $248 million without a guarantee. That's almost a quarter of a billion dollars. This would have been a massive hit to our health system, which is already in crisis after years of Liberal cuts and inaction. It would have further stretched our schools, leaving more Tasmanians behind after years of under-resourcing by the Liberals. Instead, Mr Morrison performed a last-gasp backflip, just days after ruling out a guarantee in Hobart. He held on for months. Why?


Tasmanians cannot afford a deal on GST that would impact on our state's ability to deliver the best possible essential services both now and into the future. Was it because Labor sought the guarantee? Is it pure politics for this Prime Minister? He saw a way to try to solve the issue, but he failed to account for some basic concerns. Faced with legitimate questions, he bunkered down for months and months, only relenting when his own senators couldn't stand by him anymore. 


It continues this GST saga to which Labor provided a clear answer years ago—a saga in which Mr Morrison, as Treasurer, delayed releasing the Productivity Commission's report until after the Tasmanian and South Australian state elections in March in a desperate ploy to help his Liberal counterparts. It is a saga that continued for three-quarters of the Braddon by-election. As Mr Morrison dodged questions from all sides about how he would find a way through without leaving Tasmanians worse off, in July he announced the first part of his GST reform—and I say 'first part' because he neglected to include a provision that no state would be worse off. His announcement was flashy. It was the typical big-spending, carefree approach to budget management that we've come to expect from the Liberals. Every state and territory would be better off, with the top-up payment a sweetener. A flashy Facebook post on the Tasmanian Liberals' page claimed, under the Turnbull government. 'Tasmania's GST funding secured—$112 million better off,' and then in brackets it said 'over the next eight years'. The word 'secured' was underlined with a big, brash, gold line—or was this a big, brash golden lie, to try to rebuild some faith with the Tasmanian people ahead of the Braddon by-election, just a few weeks later?


If we fast-forward three months, the same people whose officials had authorised that Facebook post—the Tasmanian Liberal Premier and the Treasurer—said, 'We're now calling into question whether Tasmania's GST funding had been secured after all.' The Treasurer and the Premier had performed a shameless backflip and were seeking greater protections for Tasmania, a problem entirely of Mr Morrison's own creation, a problem that this bill goes some way to fixing but, in many respects, a problem that Mr Morrison has kicked down the road to the next Treasurer and the next Prime Minister, leaving much up to their discretion. He sought to fix the GST debate that he thought he could sell to everyone, but the fix was flawed. It relied on changing the horizontal fiscal equalisation model from the strongest state or territory, currently Western Australia, to the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria, with top-up payments to flow to massage any losses incurred under the new model. It takes a lot to unite the treasurers of the states and territories, particularly on this issue that has divided the country for more than a decade, but core to the concerns raised by the state and territory treasurers was that no jurisdiction be worse off in terms of direct GST receipts and, critically, that these direct top-up payments would not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states or territories. 


Independent economist Saul Eslake has warned that the $9 billion top-up funding could be pooled from specific purpose payments made from the government to the states. As he notes:


After all, that's what the Abbott government sought to do in its first budget ... put its budget back into surplus by cutting payments to the states.


These specific purpose payments are used to fund vital services such as schools and hospitals, services that this government continues to gut, making their delivery unviable and unsafe in some instances. In Tasmania, we see the same occurring at a state level, as our state Liberal counterparts continue to rip money from schools and hospitals under the flawed logic that cuts, cuts and more cuts will deliver their utopian budget surplus. Teachers and nurses are protesting unfair work conditions—stressful and dangerous conditions—by walking off the job, and rightly so. Under Mr Morrison's GST fix, things in Tasmania are only going to get worse if the current state and federal Liberal governments are allowed to cut essential services at every turn. Labor's model of keeping the current system and providing a top-up payment that would not come from ripping money back off the states specific purpose payments or national partnership payments is a fair and equitable system that ensures states and territories have the ability to provide the much needed services for the people.


At the heart of the current GST system is the foundational idea that all states should be able to provide a standard level of services to its people. This takes into account states like Tasmania, which has to spend more to provide the same standard of services as other states due to disadvantage and isolation. Tasmania is the only state in the country that has the majority of its population living outside its capital city. We are the most geographical dispersed state. This makes the delivery of services increasingly difficult, and we have seen the current state government failing miserably with the delivery of such services. We have bed blocks in every hospital, ambulances that spend more time ramped at the entrance of a hospital emergency department than they do out on the road and a mental health crisis that sees patients seeking urgent medical care sleeping on the floors of our waiting rooms. Let that sink in. Patients are sleeping on the floors of our hospital emergency rooms. 


We see them ripping money off the states' specific purpose payments or national partnership payments, which is a fair and equitable system that ensures states and territories have the ability to provide services for the people. Our state health and education systems are at breaking point. Every year, the cost associated with putting on a nurse or a teacher increases. Every year, the price of consumables increases. As Tasmania's population continues to age—at the fastest rate in the country—the cost of our health system is going to continue to increase.


Will Mr Morrison's fix solve that? Will it deliver more specialists to isolated Tasmanians living on the west coast? Will it be funded by reducing other grants to Tasmania, thereby not fixing any of the problems that I've just outlined? This government must ask itself, 'What level of services do Tasmanians deserve?' The potential clawback of grants and payments that are specifically used to fund, for example, early childhood education programs, essential vaccines programs and family violence prevention programs to fund a top-up payment to states and territories is not what I would call a fair go. This is the question that Mr Morrison refuses to answer, and one that, in many respects, he can't, because, of course, so much power is afforded to the government of the day.


If Australia continues with governments like the ATM Liberal-National shambles—a government that cuts essential services at every opportunity, a government that slashed infrastructure spending across the country and a government that wanted Australians to work until they were 70 on lower wages and with a lower pension at retirement—then we know that they will cut grant funding to pay for part or all of this GST top-up fix. Past behaviour is the best indicator of future behaviour, and this ATM Liberal-National government has form. It's a government led by a man who says Tasmania is a mendicant state. If he is re-elected next year, we will have to beg for top-up payments and other grants to continue at the promised and current real levels. Tasmanians deserve a government that will prioritise essential services, and that government would be a Labor government. It's time to get rid of this ATM Liberal-National government before they do any more damage.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (13:17):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Labor supports every state and territory getting their fair share of GST, and Labor supports this legislation. In fact, we called for this legislation. When we announced our position of making the floor which will apply to every state and territory, the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister, said that it was unnecessary and it wasn't needed. But, true to form, the Liberals have backflipped yet again on another Labor position—and we welcome it.


I won't go into great detail about the long history of the GST distribution, but there are a few points that I would like to make. Labor welcomes the fact that the Morrison government have caved to pressure from states to provide legislative guarantee on the GST that no state will be worse off. Unfortunately, there is still no guarantee that Tasmania will not be worse off past 2026-27. This is perhaps one of the most important debates, where any changes could almost certainly damage and harm Tasmania. This ineffective Prime Minister pitted states against one another. He has made GST reform a battle between the states instead of bringing states together. Instead of bringing the country together, this Prime Minister's chaos and division not only wreaks havoc within the government; he would prefer that it did that in the community, too. The Commonwealth government should always be concerned about the long-term financial security of every state, not merely one state or the other that they call home. Tasmania's inept Liberal senators have remained largely weak and ineffective on this issue, and Tasmanians will not forget it. We saw for months how ineffective the Tasmanian Liberals were at the state and federal level in being able to lobby for a better deal for Tasmania over the long term. Again, I remind the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team: Tasmanians won't forget this. They expect you to stand up to your Prime Minister when he's dishing out a raw deal for Tasmania.


The Turnbull-Morrison governments have taken Tasmania for granted in more ways than one, and not merely on the issue of the GST. As Treasurer, Scott Morrison did not deliver one new dollar on infrastructure for Tasmania or one new Public Service job. Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg's first plan for the GST distribution would have seen Tasmania lose a reported $248 million, without any protection. After pleas from Labor, the Treasurer rejected a plan to include the legislative guarantee that Labor had been calling for.


Mr Morrison hasn't hidden his real feelings about Tasmania. In fact, he has openly insulted Tasmania and Tasmanians when it comes to their fair share of the GST. Mr Morrison was rightly condemned recently when he described Tasmania as being 'mendicant', essentially calling Tasmanians beggars. That is what this current Prime Minister thinks of Tasmanians. No leader or Prime Minister should openly insult a state or territory. It shows an ineptness in his leadership and, frankly, an arrogance that Australia cannot afford. This comment showed Tasmanians the contempt that Mr Morrison, as Prime Minister of this country, has for Tasmania and, more importantly, for Tasmanians in general. It explains perfectly why I can recall only three times, maybe, over the last five years—as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister—that he has visited my home state.


Any GST formula must be fixed as equitable in its end result. States need certainty over the long term to plan for the future. Politics needs to be taken out of the GST debate to ensure business confidence and confidence within regional communities so that people will stay in Tasmania and are not forced to move to the mainland. Labor makes no apologies for standing up for our state and fighting for the best possible share of the GST revenue. Regional Tasmania is already suffering as a result of this government overseeing growing inequity between cities and regions. Tasmanians need a strong leader to stand up for their interests, not a leader who has, clearly, argued for cutting Tasmania's GST receipts behind closed doors.


In July Mr Scott Morrison promised, as Treasurer, 'No state will be worse off,' under new GST distribution changes, but he has changed his mind on this issue more times than I can count. The government's policy on the GST is only a short-term reform. We know that they have their real plan in the bottom drawer and that it will harm states like my home state of Tasmania in the long term. Let's face it: a leopard never changes his spots. We know that the Prime Minister, even before he came to this place, did nothing about being open and transparent in his business dealings, particularly before he was sacked as the general manager of Tourism Australia. So his track record is not a good record. Tasmanians don't trust him and I don't believe they will change their view of him heading into the next federal election.


The government is only passing the buck to future governments by not guaranteeing funding for Tasmanian hospitals and schools over the 2026-27 commitments. Mr Morrison is the Don Draper of Australian politics, without the talent or the good looks. This Prime Minister is a man who was sacked, as I said, from Tourism Australia, and it has now been revealed why he was moved on. He was appointed by his mates in the Liberal Party, and he was sacked unanimously by the board of Tourism Australia and by the Liberal tourism minister of the day. Not even John Howard was prepared to stand up for him. That's the calibre of the man who has taken the chair in the big office as Prime Minister of this country.


These are serious findings by the Australian National Audit Office. It is not Labor saying these things; it was the Australian National Audit Office. The former Treasurer, and now Prime Minister, oversaw Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2006. Eighteen months into his contract he was sacked, terminated—with very healthy severance pay of $300,000, I might add. This has been revealed in recent days because I think it's important. It goes to the calibre of the man who is the Prime Minister. Tourism Australia and the deals that he did—that information was kept from the board. So, as he has proven to be as Prime Minister, he is not open and transparent. The procurement guidelines were breached, and private companies were engaged on contracts worth $184 million before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessment. That's the calibre—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, please resume your seat. A point of order, Senator Williams?




Senator Williams:
  My point of order is about the subject of discussion. We are talking about GST equalisation and fairness throughout the states, but Senator Polley is using this as a political session to throw mud at the Prime Minister. I think it is unacceptable, and you should bring her back to the topic.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley on the point of order.




Senator Polley:
  It is completely relevant to outline the character of the man who is charged with being Prime Minister of this country. It has everything to do with the GST.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, resume your seat. A point of order, Senator Reynolds?




Senator Reynolds:
  Senator Polley commented that the Prime Minister 'didn't have the good looks of Don Draper', which was clearly a reference to Mad Men. But had I or Senator Williams said that Senator Polley 'didn't have the good looks of Sally Draper', for example, she would have taken great offence at that. While it might be a small point, I think it is a significant point. She commented on the looks of somebody else in this place—in this case, a man. It would not be acceptable the other way around.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, although I do draw Senator Polley's attention to the subject matter at hand. I remind senators that, while the discussion may be free ranging, all courtesies to people in the other place should be observed. Senator Polley.




Senator POLLEY:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will continue. The procurement guidelines were breached, and private companies were engaged on contracts worth $184 million before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessments. This now disgraced ex-ad man used to be in charge of Treasury, and he is now the Prime Minister. No wonder he has been so inconsistent on the GST. This is a Prime Minister who is anti accountability and anti transparency. Clearly, he makes decisions on the run. He has thought bubbles without consultation. He actually became Prime Minister this way.


Tasmania relies heavily on the GST, and I will always stand up for my home state. The GST goes to the heart of how you can actually provide, through your governments, to the people of Tasmania. That includes the funding of our hospitals. As my good colleague Senator Urquhart outlined, we have people sleeping on the floor in our accident and emergency departments, in hospital after hospital, because of this government's cuts to hospitals. Our schools have been cut. All of this relates back to the GST. We have the most ageing population. We have a population with, unfortunately, some of the worst chronic diseases in this country. We rely on our portion of the GST. It is irrelevant whether it is a Liberal or Labor state government. We need that money for our residents, for all Tasmanians. So I will of course stand up and call out this Prime Minister for his backflips, his thought bubbles, his lack of consultation, his lack of empathy for those people who can least afford it. I will never apologise for standing up for my home state. That's what I was elected to do. If the Prime Minister and those opposite don't like to have his behaviour called out—it goes to good judgement, because leopards never change their spots—then I will do that. I will take a reprimand any day of the week when it comes to standing up for what I believe all Australians should know and understand about this Prime Minister and this government. 


He had another backdown only yesterday, where he cut the funding to Foodbank Australia. Why did he back down? Because he was getting political heat—even from the National Farmers' Federation. That's the calibre of this Prime Minister. He was trying to outscrooge Mr Scrooge on the eve of Christmas. I will never apologise for saying that. Any cuts to the GST revenue will have a devastating impact on service delivery in regional areas of my home state. They have already been struggling under the Abbot/Turnbull/Morrison government and their cuts to education and health, as I outlined earlier. There has been so much division from those opposite. Clearly, we know that they have tried to instil the infighting among themselves into the rest of the nation by pitting one state and territory against another. That's not the Australian way. A Prime Minister should be bringing the country together. 


Our hospitals are in crisis. Our schools are already under-resourced after years of Liberal cuts. Today we hear from the Institute of Health and Welfare that Tasmania has a higher prevalence of mental health risk, more than any other state in this country, and needs funding. We had an inquiry that outlined that—that 14-year-old Tasmanian having to wait 18 months to get psychological assistance and counselling. That's not good enough. That comes back to the lack of GST and the cuts made to health by this government. The funding for mental health in Tasmania is the worst of any state. Currently, Tasmania can't provide the national standard of care needed for people suffering a mental illness. 


I know that senators in this place have been working very hard through shadow responsibilities to make sure that Australians are aware of the need for more money to go into mental health. I was participating in the community affairs committee hearing in Tasmania. We know only too well that Tasmania needs another 50 psychiatric beds just to meet the national average. Tasmania just can't afford to lose even one dollar of GST. 


On this side, Labor is proud of its record on the GST. Tasmania's federal parliamentary Labor Party lobbied all four Liberal senators, calling on them to support this amendment which protected the legislation and our state's GST share, which they ultimately did. But during the whole lead-up to that the Liberal Senate team in Tasmania was silent. It seems that Mr Morrison and the Liberals have finally woken up to these concerns, despite repeatedly saying that they would not support a legislative guarantee. 


Labor still has reservations about what may occur post 2026-27 if a coalition government is on the Treasury benches after the next election. Can I say once again, Tasmania cannot afford a deal on GST that would impact on our state's ability to deliver the best possible essential services now and into the future. The community knows that Labor will always stand up and fight for our fair share of GST. We know and the community knows—Tasmanians know—that the Liberals won't, because, as shown by their hatred for Medicare, their DNA is not one that actually cares about everyday Tasmanians or Australians. They can't be trusted with the GST and we know they can't be trusted with the economy.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (13:35):  I welcome this long overdue change to the GST distribution scheme, which Western Australian Labor has been fighting for for a long time. I pay tribute to Premier Mark McGowan and his government on their advocacy and fighting for this change and working with federal Labor to get workable change on the national agenda—advocacy that I must say was sorely lacking from the Barnett government, but perhaps he knew at the time that it would fall on deaf ears. It has been unfathomable to me, with the number of WA cabinet ministers in the current government, why this issue remained unaddressed for so long. I commend Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen for putting forward solutions and for committing to a legislated floor. These strong commitments have helped induce action from the current government.


As we know, the GST was introduced in 2000 as a way to raise revenue to support the states and territories. The money raised has been distributed through the Commonwealth Grants Commission policy of horizontal fiscal equalisation. This is a method that attempts to ensure that all Australians benefit from the wealth of the country and that no state or territory is disadvantaged by circumstance. It is seen, in principle, as a fair and equitable way of ensuring that all Australians benefit from the wealth we generate as a nation. But the sad fact is that, 18 years on, the model of horizontal fiscal equalisation is not working as it should and some states, particularly my home state of WA, have been severely disadvantaged.


The Liberal government have been slow to recognise WA's needs and, in my view, have taken for granted the seats that they hold there. Our GST relativity fell from 0.98 on the commencement of the GST to less than 0.30 in 2015-16. It rose slightly in 2017-18. WA received the lowest amount of GST revenue per capita, at just $872 per person in 2017-18. That does not match the expenditure of Western Australians, who buy goods that are subject to the GST. The main reason WA's fair share has fallen has been the mining boom. WA was assessed as being able to raise significantly more revenue than other states. This is via mining royalties. Additionally, specific approaches from the Commonwealth Grants Commission in working out GST relativity work against WA.


At last the government listened to these concerns and last year commissioned a report to look at the distribution. In May the Productivity Commission released its findings on the current state of the GST and horizontal fiscal equalisation. It found that our system was failing to keep pace with the changing situation and economic circumstances that our states and territories find themselves in. It found in particular that resource heavy states, such as WA, were negatively affected by the current system. As resource prices are determined by the international market, they are very much prone to fluctuation, making it difficult to pre-empt how much revenue a state will get.


The current system fails to incentivise states to be creative with their taxation system to try to improve it. With the risk and uncertainty that surround today's economic climate, states and territories don't want to risk their GST revenue pool by looking at other innovative ways of raising revenue. When states try to improve their financial position, their share of GST decreases, and this has had a significant impact on Western Australia.


With this in mind, I very much support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 as proposed, because it sticks to the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation but does not distort that decision-making within government by punishing good innovation. I commend the state government of WA, and indeed the state's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, for putting forward solutions that have been adopted. The reason Western Australia's share in the mining boom has fallen is that the Commonwealth Grants Commission assessed WA improperly. It assessed WA as being able to raise significantly more revenue than other states via mining royalties. It did this because it has forward-projected those revenues without taking into account the actual drop in revenue prices from mining royalties to Western Australia. In addition—and this is a very perverse thing within the GST assessment—the exclusion of gambling revenues from GST assessment for all states penalises WA, because, unlike other states, we don't have a gambling industry.


As a result of all these factors, our GST share has fallen at times to a record low of 30c in the dollar, the lowest in the country. And while the share is projected to increase to 47c in the dollar for this financial year, it is still significantly lower than that of any state in the country. We previously raised concerns about the use of the three-year rolling average for the price of key commodities, including iron ore, particularly in the period following the end of the mining boom, when the price of iron ore and therefore the royalty dropped but the assessment of how much revenue Western Australia would raise did not. The revenue that was assumed simply did not exist. Frankly, it was obvious at that point that it wouldn't exist. But the formulas, according to the ask, couldn't be changed, because it might be a bit unpredictable. This is no way to assess state finances. Frankly, but for the floor, these problems still very much exist inside the assessment process.


This legislation and the major change in this bill is the introduction of a floor to prevent the share of the GST from falling to the kinds of record lows that Western Australia has seen. A floor of 75c is essential to ensure that this situation that has affected WA does not happen again. We did experience an enormous strengthening of our financial situation in WA during the mining boom. This might seem like a fair trade while the state is doing well, but the old GST formula was not designed to accommodate the rapidly changing economic environment in which the state currently finds itself. Just as people were saying that the Western Australian economy could reach no limit, that is was going to keep growing, the mining boom ended. Our share of GST has not recovered to pre-mining-boom levels, because of the lag in that assessment.


These assessments, while not changing in this legislation, will be mitigated by this new floor within the benchmark system. The benchmark for redistribution will be changed from the strongest-performing state—which is currently WA, but that is moving to change—to the strongest of either New South Wales or Victoria. There's good reason to do this. By changing it, we can ensure that these spikes are minimised, because these states have more-diversified and larger economies, so they're not as subject to a particular runaway phenomenon in a particular economic stream.


In short, Western Australia has not reaped the benefits of the mining boom. We've also had to contend with rapid population growth and remote service delivery. This redistributive effect through horizontal fiscal equalisation has been a very poor motivator for growing the wealth of the state and the nation. So, I don't object to the redistributive elements that ensure that we support the whole of our nation, but I don't want to see perverse outcomes in our GST situation.


I asked the Parliamentary Library to do some modelling on this, with the following example: if the mining states of WA and Queensland seek to raise royalty rates in order to increase revenues, the Commonwealth grant process causes them to lose almost as much GST revenue as they would gain in royalty revenue. I asked the Parliamentary Library to model this for me. Their example was to suppose that there were eight states, all of equal size, and that the states collectively raise $8 billion in mining revenue. When working out an average that each state should be able to raise from mining royalties, the Commonwealth Grants Commission would arrive at an average of $1 billion for each state. It would then provide the Commonwealth Grants Commission with the GST revenue to adjust up or to withhold revenue to adjust down to ensure that each state received exactly $1 billion of that value.


Now, suppose that, of the $8 billion raised, $7 billion was raised in just one state, with the remainder being raised equally across the remaining seven states. What incentive does it provide to those other states to raise revenue? Frankly, none. There is no incentive at all, because they have to take on the challenges of how to raise revenue. The impact of that is that it will just be redistributed to the other states.


And, as I highlighted before, there are problems with the way that the Commonwealth Grants Commission deals with gambling revenue. It considers that there are no material factors outside of the control of an individual state that change the amount each state could raise from gambling revenue. In the view of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, each state has the same capacity to raise gambling revenue, irrespective of whether they choose to do so or not.


There is great irony in this. Arguably, some states have made decisions to forgo revenue, with policies opposed to mining. But, in effect, they have not forgone revenue because of this; they have benefited from Western Australia's revenue. But Western Australia has chosen not to have a gambling industry, particularly poker machines, on policy grounds. We don't like the social implications of embedding pokies in social venues around the state and then mopping up the gap in social consequences later. But the Commonwealth Grants Commission's approach still assumes that WA could raise this revenue and the average amount of gambling revenue as for other states. This is, if you like, included in our assumed funding base for the state. This is completely perverse.


As a result of this, Western Australian people are missing out. For every one dollar they have spent at the shop on GST-taxed goods, they have sent up to 7c out of the state. Western Australians have, rightly, had enough. Linking the index of the redistribution to volatile and heavily-fluctuating resource markets, rather than to broader and diversified economies, has not lent itself to stability and fairness in the system. New South Wales and Victoria have well-performing and, more importantly, more stable and diverse economies. Linking this index to their performance ensures that our GST system remains consistent and predictable.


So I commend federal capital Labor for taking the lead on this and for recognising the needs of Western Australia. They started with the Fair Share for WA Fund, then a floor and committed to a legislative floor. I am keenly aware that states and territories need to be treated fairly under the new system, that sudden changes could put pressure on the states and territories and they could end up worse off as a result of this change. Western Australia has lived through this. We need plans that promote stability and ensure states and territory governments can plan for the future. The current system is highly susceptible to changes in economic circumstances, and, indeed, property taxes changes can also adversely affect the share of the GST received. These are areas that are also highly volatile in today's economic environment. So we do understand the concerns of other states in looking at this legislation. It has been extremely hard for WA to deal with this fiscal uncertainty, and I wouldn't wish that uncertainty upon any other state. To this end, we support the guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off during the six-year transition period while the new system is rolled out. I'm not going to go into detail, but I recognise the role that top-up funds will have during this critical time.


I note that the bill also requires the referral of our GST system to the Treasurer to refer it to the Productivity Commission to see whether the new system is working and that it will need to report by the end of the year, in 2026. Stability should be the purpose of this bill. Uncertainty about what happens next does not help our cause. This legislation is a good step in addressing the inequalities that exist in our GST system. The floor so desperately needed by WA will perhaps, in the future, benefit other states. It will ensure that states and territories receive a reliable and predictable share of the GST that is fair and equitable.


Western Australia has had a significantly difficult time, and we have been justifiably outraged by the lack of our fair share in GST revenue. All of this has happened at a time when Western Australia's net debt has grown per capita to the highest of any other state. Our own revenues dropped at the same time as our GST revenue dropped. At the same time, with the end of the mining boom, the labour force participation rate dramatically decreased, with a fall from 69 per cent in February 2016 to 57 per cent in 2016. We had an increasing population, increased unemployment and decreasing participation rates, and none of these things were good news for Western Australia. At the same time as all of this was happening, for every dollar spent in the consumption of GST goods, up to 70c went to other states. That's 70c for every dollar paid of GST. We only kept 30c in the dollar. That has improved. WA will foreseeably receive 47c in the dollar in 2017-18, so that has improved somewhat. But it still means that, for every litre of petrol a Western Australian buys—and we know that petrol prices are at record highs—we are sending 6.6c out of the state. This has gone on too long. This legislation is welcome and overdue.


I want to highlight that Western Australia's fight for a fair share will not end there. Given the size of our state and the many remote regional communities within it that are difficult to service, we are still getting a raw deal in many other areas. Western Australians are also concerned to know that, with 10.8 per cent of Australia's population, in other areas not including the GST we receive just seven per cent of the Commonwealth spend. This is less than every other state or territory by a significant factor. Today I'm pleased we can work together inside our Federation to improve cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth so that we can continue to be a competitive nation but also a compassionate nation that fairly distributes our resources to maximise the wellbeing of our nation. Thank you.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (13:55):  I'm certainly not going to mince words in the very short time I have for now on how very important this issue of the GST is to the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory is facing unprecedented falls in GST revenue, which is impacting on the government's ability to deliver core services. This impact is widening the gap on Indigenous disadvantage and infrastructure deficits.


NT GST revenue has fallen by $500 million per year. This $500 million shortfall is entrenched by the watering down of horizontal fiscal equalisation principles in this bill, remembering that the GST makes up 50 per cent of the Northern Territory's total revenue and the NT government's $6.5 billion budget. The NT has a relatively limited own-source revenue base, which is 30 per cent of total revenue, despite the new $37 billion INPEX LNG project coming online. I certainly want to remind senators that this project is also subject to the Commonwealth's 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax and 30 per cent company tax.


The NT's current sharp economic downturn is exacerbating the situation, with the debt-to-revenue ratio rising. Since 2016, the NT's GST revenue forecasts have seen a cumulative decline of $3.4 billion over the forward estimates. As a small, self-governing member of the Federation, with a limited own-source revenue base compared to the larger jurisdictions, it is disproportionately more difficult for the Northern Territory to absorb significant changes to its GST revenue. While all economies are subject to cyclical effects, as a small, open economy, the economic cycles in the Territory are more pronounced than in other jurisdictions. The NT's making some very tough decisions in its fiscal response to the economic downturn, and this includes over $800 million in savings and efficiencies and new own-sourcing revenue measures.


The Northern Territory, regardless of the government in power, has always been a strong supporter of the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation, so it's enormously disappointing to see the failure of the Northern Territory senator Nigel Scullion and his Country Liberal Party to stand up for the Territory around these changes to GST that will impact adversely on the Northern Territory. Senator Scullion failed to say a single word when the then Treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced last year that the government was slashing GST distribution to the Territory by an estimated $2 billion over the next four years, and he's certainly done nothing to get his colleagues to listen to the Northern Territory government's very reasonable argument about funding essential services, such as housing, education and roads. He's refusing to say, as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, what impact this new funding arrangement will have on efforts in the Territory to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. Every February we certainly talk about the need to look at the report card of Indigenous disadvantage and closing the gap, which the parliament admits that we're not doing. How then, when we know we desperately need extra resources and support in the Northern Territory, are we going to close that gap?


There's certainly been a parade of Liberal government figures through the Territory in recent months, all talking up their candidates in Lingiari and Solomon, but not once have any of them said what they'll be doing about this unprecedented financial situation facing the Northern Territory. They have not said one word about how they will be advocating for us, ensuring that we get our fair share. Not once have any of these candidates ever said what their plans are for dealing with this reduction in GST revenue which will impact the people of the Northern Territory the hardest. You cannot pretend to be standing up for the Territory, for the most disadvantaged communities in this country, and saying you're their voice, yet refuse to front the people who have made the decision to change the basis for GST redistribution.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator McCarthy, you will be in continuation when debate resumes.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:43):  When I was speaking earlier on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018, I was recounting the history of the GST legislation.


I mentioned that the GST was first introduced in 2000, but we know that Mr Howard, the former Prime Minister, indicated in 1995 that there was:


… no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy. … Never, ever. It's dead.


But we know that after he was elected, the Liberals changed their tune, with Mr Howard describing the GST in the year 2000 as 'something the country has needed for more than 20 years'. Of course, this issue goes to the heart of our concerns about this government's propensity to backflip on its promises.


The Liberal Party has more form on changing its mind in relation to the GST. During the 2013 election campaign, Mr Abbott said:


Let me be as categorical as I can, the GST will not change. Full stop. End of story.


And:


… the GST simply can't change unless all of the states and territories agree …


And yet, here we are debating the coalition's changes to the GST that the states and territories have reservations about. A letter from the Treasurer of Queensland makes it quite clear that this is a unilateral change by the Commonwealth.


The reservations that we have expressed stem partly from the fact that the new arrangements mean that, while states and territories not performing as well economically as the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria will be topped up, those who outperform the benchmark will keep their surplus funds. That means that there will need to be more money to distribute, hence the need for an injection of Commonwealth funds to the overall GST money pool. Other reservations of the states and territories centre on the ministerial discretion in decision-making written into this legislation. 


There are still questions to be answered by the coalition: Where is the money coming from? How will the new system address economic volatility? What is proposed after the seven-year guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off expires? What will the terms of reference be for the Productivity Commission review? Will the states and territories be guaranteed input into that process? These are questions that I hoped would be answered when the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, of which I'm the deputy chair, inquired into this bill last month. That committee received evidence from all states and territories, the Treasury, the Minerals Council of Australia, Rio Tinto, the Institute of Public Affairs, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia through a public submission process and through our public hearing in Canberra. 


There was evidence, particularly from Western Australian business and resource groups, that the proposed change in distribution method would encourage states and territories to work harder to develop their own economies in order to retain a greater share of the benefits, if outperforming the benchmark state. There was evidence from other states and territories that the current system of HFE is adequate and not broken, and in some cases, as in the case of the South Australian submission, there was an argument that it should be retained.


Labor senators made additional comments in that Senate inquiry report that echo the reservations that I've outlined to the Senate. We pointed out that, once again, the coalition dragged its feet on an important financial reform and, once again, it took Labor action, through announcing our policy, to get the government moving. It was Labor who announced that we would legislate a floor for GST relativities—action that was eventually copied by the Morrison government after they had said in July that 'there's no need to do that'. That was in the committee report. The flip-flopping marketing man, our new Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, soon recognised that Labor was right, just as we were right to fight for the no-state-worse-off guarantee to be enshrined in legislation—another element initially rejected by the Morrison government, with new Treasurer Frydenberg suggesting administration costs would be too high. I note from the report that Mr Frydenberg said: 


Because what some of the states are wanting us to do is to run two parallel systems. They're wanting us to run an old set of books based on what is the current system and a new set of books, which is based on the new system with the floor and the additional $9 billion.


Based on that, the Treasurer had previously expressed his opposition to the no-state-worse-off guarantee. But it was only a week until Mr Frydenberg flip-flopped his way back to Labor's position—a position quite vocally shared by the states and territories. 


So it's clear that only Labor can stand up for the states and territories when it comes to unfair coalition legislation. And we echo their call for transparency around the top-up funding and where that will come from. We want to know how this government, which is consistently big on headlines and thought bubbles and short on detail, intends to find the $9 billion that it is promising to top up the funding pool. Labor shares the real concerns of the states and territories about whether other funding sources will be cut to offset the Commonwealth contribution to the GST pool. That's why Labor senators recommended in our additional comments to the committee's report:


That the letter from the Federal Treasurer to the State and Territory Treasurers stating that 'any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states' be tabled during the Parliamentary debate.


I'm grateful Minister Cormann did provide that letter—I believe he tabled that yesterday. I see that we have a letter from the Treasurer to the Treasurer of Queensland. I just want to read into the Hansard the very important commitment.


I also confirm any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states.


So, that, I think, goes some way to addressing some of the concerns that we have.


A number of the states and territories made reference to this letter in their evidence. In my home state of Queensland, the state government's submission said:


The Australian Treasurer gave assurances in his letter to the Deputy Premier and during the second reading in Parliament that the updated system will not be to the detriment of other payments to states. However, this is not reflected in the Bill or the Explanatory Memorandum.


… … …


The Bill (and Explanatory Memorandum) should be amended to require that pool top-up and additional financial assistance will not come at the expense of other payments to the states.


I want to take a minute or two to look at the Queensland government's submission. For Queenslanders, it highlights some of the concerns that we have. We know that Queensland has the most decentralised population of all the Australian states and is uniquely exposed to arbitrary changes to the GST system when we abandon the principle of full HFE. This is reflected in the Queensland government submission. The system that we've had has meant that Queensland has received less than its population share of GST revenue in some years and more than its share, depending on the economic circumstances. Queensland is particularly exposed in this matter because the GST revenue for Queensland in 2018-19 represents about one-quarter of the state's total revenue. We really need to get this issue right. The Queensland government submission said:


Despite promises of consultation and opposition from states to proposed changes, the Morrison Government introduced the … bill in October 2018. The Bill will permanently change the system of distributing GST revenue … 


The Palaszczuk government in its submission acknowledged that the government has taken, as I said, a unilateral decision to amend the legislation. The Queensland government does welcome the recent amendments to the bill, in particular the 'no state will be worse off' guarantee and the Productivity Commission inquiry, but there are still some concerns. The Queensland government made seven recommendations, which, I think, are all eminently sensible.


One of the things that I was concerned about in relation to the revised GST arrangements is that under the government's preferred model, in the year 2023-24, Queensland was going to be the only state over the transition period that would be financially disadvantaged in comparison to the existing arrangements. During the course of the Senate hearing, I sought clarification from Treasury officials, and they made it very clear that the no-worse-off guarantee applies to individual years over the course of that transition period. Ms Phipps said: 


… we would look at what the difference was between what a particular jurisdiction had got over the course of the previous years under the updated system. If, in the example Queensland gave, they were $100 million worse off in 2023-24, but, for example, were $80 million better off in the updated system across the years prior to that, then the top-up would be $20 million to make sure that, in that year, Queensland was cumulatively in the better of the two systems—was better off.


It has been clarified that those top-up payments do occur within the transition period.


We forgive the state and territories, particularly Queensland, for their cynicism or scepticism about this issue. My home state has been the victim of vicious coalition cuts at both the state and federal levels—devastating cuts to health and education. In most recent times, we've had the Newman government that sacked 14,000 workers, and we've seen cuts at a federal level to public hospitals and penalty rates, and there are less apprentices. We know that it's Labor that have done the hard yards on economic management. We've announced hundreds of policies in the lead-up to the federal election. Our policies are researched and they're costed. We're absolutely up-front about where the money's coming from with our election commitments.


I want to conclude today by mentioning some of the points that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, has written about in an opinion piece. Mr Bowen has said, 'You can trust us with the economy,' because on this side of the chamber we take a holistic approach to economic growth, encompassing tax, infrastructure, connectivity, entrepreneurialism, foreign policy, and, most importantly, investment in human capital. While the coalition cancels COAG and prioritises campaigns, but not campaign bus trips, and covert fundraising efforts, Labor are getting on with the job. We are developing the policies Australia needs to prepare for the future and to bring back the fair go. Labor are stable and united. Labor have listened to the Australian people. We have the policies and the drive. Labor are ready to govern.

"Georgiou, Sen Peter",PHON,2018-11-13,"



Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (12:56):  I've been a passionate advocate for GST reform. I am pleased that the government has finally listened to my calls on behalf of all Western Australians for a fairer slice of the GST pie. This bill is long overdue and will finally make an attempt to correct some of the wrongs of the horizontal fiscal equalisation and its effect on successful economies like that of Western Australia. The extra money will allow the state government to fund schools, hospitals, road upgrades and other infrastructure as needed and hopefully pay down some of our huge debt in Western Australia. It is clear from the Productivity Commission report that Western Australia generated more state sourced revenue than any other state and, as a result, has been penalised for its achievements over the last decade.


Horizontal fiscal equalisation provides a disincentive that spins off in relation to the approval and exploitation of mineral resources located within states and territories. This is the main problem here in WA. Under the existing system, the vast bulk of the additional royalties associated with new mining developments leaks to other states and territories within two or three years. Under the current system, Australian states do not need to strengthen their own natural-resource industries because they know they can sit back and wait for GST redistribution to equalise their capacity every year. If New South Wales and Victoria developed their offshore-gas sectors, they could create billion-dollar industries and inject millions into their own state government revenues. Under the current unfair system, we have effectively removed the incentive for states to develop all their resource industries, and the nation as a whole suffers.


The key question is: why would a state or territory take all the political heat associated with facilitating new mines only to have most of the additional royalty income shared with other states and territories that have not had to face similar political problems? Another critical question I'm asking is this: how is it possible that the revenue from gambling taxes is not included in the GST distribution formula? Western Australia's decision to limit pokie machines means the state has relatively little gambling tax revenue but is penalised for this in the distribution of GST.


The thing about the GST distribution is that it's a win/lose scenario. Giving more to WA must involve giving less to other states, particularly those that are typically overfunded—South Australia and Tasmania, in particular. It's time to get real. Instead of trying to keep everyone happy, the government should announce that the distribution of GST will move to a per capita basis over a five-year time frame, for instance, and in the short term those states that lose out would be partly compensated.


When it comes to the principal of HFE, all citizens should have access to similar services. The federal government should make this happen with specific grants to the states and territories. This would add accountability to the system. The way the GST is currently distributed completely lacks accountability. At the same time, I'm concerned that the government will be dipping into its own coffers to the tune of billions of dollars to ensure no state is worse off. The Treasurer said that all states would be better off with the Commonwealth injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29. The states of South Australia and Tasmania and also the Northern Territory should suck it up. They've had it too good for too long at the expense of other states. They may even lift their game as a result.


In reality, the Commonwealth is doing the minimum as a step towards genuine GST reform. This bill is not perfect. There are still other issues that need to be changed as well. It will take about 10 years to reach full implementation. The date of effect for the updated HFE system, along with a boost to the GST revenue pool, is transitioned into effect from 2021-22, with the new arrangements applying in full from 2026-27. The GST floor is introduced in two stages, with an initial floor introduced for 2022-23 and then raised for 2024-25. The short-term transitional payments apply for three financial years, starting in 2019-20. The Productivity Commission inquiry is to be completed before 31 December 2026. Given what I mention here, I remain unconvinced about the government's desire or intent to pay off the nation's rapidly rising debt and I have concerns about its budgetary and fiscal management skills. I will be supporting this bill despite its many failings for a long-term solution. At least it's a small step in the right direction.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:01):  I also rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018—a bit of a mouthful. What an absolute dog's breakfast the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has made of this debate. Who could forget that in September this year, just weeks after ascending to the prime ministership of this country—an ascendancy he still cannot explain—Prime Minister Morrison is reported to have called the Tasmanian Treasurer, Mr Peter Gutwein, a mendicant for questioning the PM's original fix? The Tasmanian Treasurer, a mendicant for sticking up for his state! If this is the language that Mr Morrison uses to describe fellow Liberal treasurers, imagine what he says about the rest of us! He tries to hide his elitist attitude with his rolled up sleeves and silly hats, but we all know that, while the PM represents a seat in Sydney's southern suburbs, his true affinity is with Sydney's leafy eastern suburbs, exactly the same as the man that he deposed. The arrogance of the man, throwing around 'fair dinkum' more than Russell Coight, Alf Stewart and Steve Irwin to try to speak to us 'normal people' and then barking down the phone at the Treasurer of Tasmania, saying that over half a million Australians are mendicants, as if to say we're not entrepreneurial, not hardworking and not looking to grow.


It hits right at the core of Tasmanians. It's a smaller state, a little island at the bottom of this big country, but we produce. For over 20 years as a union official with the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, I worked day and night with hardworking Tasmanians to get a good deal at work, to continue to grow jobs and opportunities and to secure more investment in Tasmania. To say that our shipbuilders, our heavy vehicle manufacturers, our food manufacturers, our farmers, our component manufacturers, our miners, our foresters, our fishers and all our service providers are mendicants in this nation is an absolute disgrace. Why, Mr Morrison, are hardworking Tasmanians less worthy of good schools, great hospitals and decent roads? Why are we less worthy? And why, Mr Morrison, are hardworking Tasmanians less worthy of strong public services, decent housing and secure jobs?


His statement to the Tasmanian Treasurer and subsequent denials go to the heart of Mr Morrison's values. They go to the core of his elitist attitude to the country. And, worse, they demonstrate again that, when flustered, Mr Morrison buckles under pressure. In the face of legitimate questions from a fellow Liberal treasurer, he wouldn't seek to work through their differences but resorted to cheap abuse, demonstrating his inability to do the job and his disdain for hardworking Tasmanians.


Of course, it didn't have to be this hard for Mr Morrison. This robust debate, as we all call it now, with the Tasmanian Treasurer was about ensuring that no state was worse off. Mr Morrison denied for months that such a guarantee was necessary, even though politicians from all sides, including his own Liberal Treasurer and the Premier of Tasmania, were clear that the guarantee was crucial to ensuring that no state was left behind. So poorly did this ATM government handle this debate that they caved and announced a limited guarantee only after their own Liberal senators finally realised the problem and threatened to cross the floor to support a Labor amendment to protect every state's and territory's share.


If Mr Morrison really cared about Tasmania, really cared about supporting our students and patients and supporting our future prosperity, he would have committed to a guarantee back in July. We're not talking about a few thousand dollars here—a few days' bus hire or a few hundred trucker hats. Respected forecasters estimated that, at worst, Tasmania could lose $248 million without a guarantee. That's almost a quarter of a billion dollars. This would have been a massive hit to our health system, which is already in crisis after years of Liberal cuts and inaction. It would have further stretched our schools, leaving more Tasmanians behind after years of under-resourcing by the Liberals. Instead, Mr Morrison performed a last-gasp backflip, just days after ruling out a guarantee in Hobart. He held on for months. Why?


Tasmanians cannot afford a deal on GST that would impact on our state's ability to deliver the best possible essential services both now and into the future. Was it because Labor sought the guarantee? Is it pure politics for this Prime Minister? He saw a way to try to solve the issue, but he failed to account for some basic concerns. Faced with legitimate questions, he bunkered down for months and months, only relenting when his own senators couldn't stand by him anymore. 


It continues this GST saga to which Labor provided a clear answer years ago—a saga in which Mr Morrison, as Treasurer, delayed releasing the Productivity Commission's report until after the Tasmanian and South Australian state elections in March in a desperate ploy to help his Liberal counterparts. It is a saga that continued for three-quarters of the Braddon by-election. As Mr Morrison dodged questions from all sides about how he would find a way through without leaving Tasmanians worse off, in July he announced the first part of his GST reform—and I say 'first part' because he neglected to include a provision that no state would be worse off. His announcement was flashy. It was the typical big-spending, carefree approach to budget management that we've come to expect from the Liberals. Every state and territory would be better off, with the top-up payment a sweetener. A flashy Facebook post on the Tasmanian Liberals' page claimed, under the Turnbull government. 'Tasmania's GST funding secured—$112 million better off,' and then in brackets it said 'over the next eight years'. The word 'secured' was underlined with a big, brash, gold line—or was this a big, brash golden lie, to try to rebuild some faith with the Tasmanian people ahead of the Braddon by-election, just a few weeks later?


If we fast-forward three months, the same people whose officials had authorised that Facebook post—the Tasmanian Liberal Premier and the Treasurer—said, 'We're now calling into question whether Tasmania's GST funding had been secured after all.' The Treasurer and the Premier had performed a shameless backflip and were seeking greater protections for Tasmania, a problem entirely of Mr Morrison's own creation, a problem that this bill goes some way to fixing but, in many respects, a problem that Mr Morrison has kicked down the road to the next Treasurer and the next Prime Minister, leaving much up to their discretion. He sought to fix the GST debate that he thought he could sell to everyone, but the fix was flawed. It relied on changing the horizontal fiscal equalisation model from the strongest state or territory, currently Western Australia, to the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria, with top-up payments to flow to massage any losses incurred under the new model. It takes a lot to unite the treasurers of the states and territories, particularly on this issue that has divided the country for more than a decade, but core to the concerns raised by the state and territory treasurers was that no jurisdiction be worse off in terms of direct GST receipts and, critically, that these direct top-up payments would not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states or territories. 


Independent economist Saul Eslake has warned that the $9 billion top-up funding could be pooled from specific purpose payments made from the government to the states. As he notes:


After all, that's what the Abbott government sought to do in its first budget ... put its budget back into surplus by cutting payments to the states.


These specific purpose payments are used to fund vital services such as schools and hospitals, services that this government continues to gut, making their delivery unviable and unsafe in some instances. In Tasmania, we see the same occurring at a state level, as our state Liberal counterparts continue to rip money from schools and hospitals under the flawed logic that cuts, cuts and more cuts will deliver their utopian budget surplus. Teachers and nurses are protesting unfair work conditions—stressful and dangerous conditions—by walking off the job, and rightly so. Under Mr Morrison's GST fix, things in Tasmania are only going to get worse if the current state and federal Liberal governments are allowed to cut essential services at every turn. Labor's model of keeping the current system and providing a top-up payment that would not come from ripping money back off the states specific purpose payments or national partnership payments is a fair and equitable system that ensures states and territories have the ability to provide the much needed services for the people.


At the heart of the current GST system is the foundational idea that all states should be able to provide a standard level of services to its people. This takes into account states like Tasmania, which has to spend more to provide the same standard of services as other states due to disadvantage and isolation. Tasmania is the only state in the country that has the majority of its population living outside its capital city. We are the most geographical dispersed state. This makes the delivery of services increasingly difficult, and we have seen the current state government failing miserably with the delivery of such services. We have bed blocks in every hospital, ambulances that spend more time ramped at the entrance of a hospital emergency department than they do out on the road and a mental health crisis that sees patients seeking urgent medical care sleeping on the floors of our waiting rooms. Let that sink in. Patients are sleeping on the floors of our hospital emergency rooms. 


We see them ripping money off the states' specific purpose payments or national partnership payments, which is a fair and equitable system that ensures states and territories have the ability to provide services for the people. Our state health and education systems are at breaking point. Every year, the cost associated with putting on a nurse or a teacher increases. Every year, the price of consumables increases. As Tasmania's population continues to age—at the fastest rate in the country—the cost of our health system is going to continue to increase.


Will Mr Morrison's fix solve that? Will it deliver more specialists to isolated Tasmanians living on the west coast? Will it be funded by reducing other grants to Tasmania, thereby not fixing any of the problems that I've just outlined? This government must ask itself, 'What level of services do Tasmanians deserve?' The potential clawback of grants and payments that are specifically used to fund, for example, early childhood education programs, essential vaccines programs and family violence prevention programs to fund a top-up payment to states and territories is not what I would call a fair go. This is the question that Mr Morrison refuses to answer, and one that, in many respects, he can't, because, of course, so much power is afforded to the government of the day.


If Australia continues with governments like the ATM Liberal-National shambles—a government that cuts essential services at every opportunity, a government that slashed infrastructure spending across the country and a government that wanted Australians to work until they were 70 on lower wages and with a lower pension at retirement—then we know that they will cut grant funding to pay for part or all of this GST top-up fix. Past behaviour is the best indicator of future behaviour, and this ATM Liberal-National government has form. It's a government led by a man who says Tasmania is a mendicant state. If he is re-elected next year, we will have to beg for top-up payments and other grants to continue at the promised and current real levels. Tasmanians deserve a government that will prioritise essential services, and that government would be a Labor government. It's time to get rid of this ATM Liberal-National government before they do any more damage.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (13:17):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Labor supports every state and territory getting their fair share of GST, and Labor supports this legislation. In fact, we called for this legislation. When we announced our position of making the floor which will apply to every state and territory, the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister, said that it was unnecessary and it wasn't needed. But, true to form, the Liberals have backflipped yet again on another Labor position—and we welcome it.


I won't go into great detail about the long history of the GST distribution, but there are a few points that I would like to make. Labor welcomes the fact that the Morrison government have caved to pressure from states to provide legislative guarantee on the GST that no state will be worse off. Unfortunately, there is still no guarantee that Tasmania will not be worse off past 2026-27. This is perhaps one of the most important debates, where any changes could almost certainly damage and harm Tasmania. This ineffective Prime Minister pitted states against one another. He has made GST reform a battle between the states instead of bringing states together. Instead of bringing the country together, this Prime Minister's chaos and division not only wreaks havoc within the government; he would prefer that it did that in the community, too. The Commonwealth government should always be concerned about the long-term financial security of every state, not merely one state or the other that they call home. Tasmania's inept Liberal senators have remained largely weak and ineffective on this issue, and Tasmanians will not forget it. We saw for months how ineffective the Tasmanian Liberals were at the state and federal level in being able to lobby for a better deal for Tasmania over the long term. Again, I remind the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team: Tasmanians won't forget this. They expect you to stand up to your Prime Minister when he's dishing out a raw deal for Tasmania.


The Turnbull-Morrison governments have taken Tasmania for granted in more ways than one, and not merely on the issue of the GST. As Treasurer, Scott Morrison did not deliver one new dollar on infrastructure for Tasmania or one new Public Service job. Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg's first plan for the GST distribution would have seen Tasmania lose a reported $248 million, without any protection. After pleas from Labor, the Treasurer rejected a plan to include the legislative guarantee that Labor had been calling for.


Mr Morrison hasn't hidden his real feelings about Tasmania. In fact, he has openly insulted Tasmania and Tasmanians when it comes to their fair share of the GST. Mr Morrison was rightly condemned recently when he described Tasmania as being 'mendicant', essentially calling Tasmanians beggars. That is what this current Prime Minister thinks of Tasmanians. No leader or Prime Minister should openly insult a state or territory. It shows an ineptness in his leadership and, frankly, an arrogance that Australia cannot afford. This comment showed Tasmanians the contempt that Mr Morrison, as Prime Minister of this country, has for Tasmania and, more importantly, for Tasmanians in general. It explains perfectly why I can recall only three times, maybe, over the last five years—as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister—that he has visited my home state.


Any GST formula must be fixed as equitable in its end result. States need certainty over the long term to plan for the future. Politics needs to be taken out of the GST debate to ensure business confidence and confidence within regional communities so that people will stay in Tasmania and are not forced to move to the mainland. Labor makes no apologies for standing up for our state and fighting for the best possible share of the GST revenue. Regional Tasmania is already suffering as a result of this government overseeing growing inequity between cities and regions. Tasmanians need a strong leader to stand up for their interests, not a leader who has, clearly, argued for cutting Tasmania's GST receipts behind closed doors.


In July Mr Scott Morrison promised, as Treasurer, 'No state will be worse off,' under new GST distribution changes, but he has changed his mind on this issue more times than I can count. The government's policy on the GST is only a short-term reform. We know that they have their real plan in the bottom drawer and that it will harm states like my home state of Tasmania in the long term. Let's face it: a leopard never changes his spots. We know that the Prime Minister, even before he came to this place, did nothing about being open and transparent in his business dealings, particularly before he was sacked as the general manager of Tourism Australia. So his track record is not a good record. Tasmanians don't trust him and I don't believe they will change their view of him heading into the next federal election.


The government is only passing the buck to future governments by not guaranteeing funding for Tasmanian hospitals and schools over the 2026-27 commitments. Mr Morrison is the Don Draper of Australian politics, without the talent or the good looks. This Prime Minister is a man who was sacked, as I said, from Tourism Australia, and it has now been revealed why he was moved on. He was appointed by his mates in the Liberal Party, and he was sacked unanimously by the board of Tourism Australia and by the Liberal tourism minister of the day. Not even John Howard was prepared to stand up for him. That's the calibre of the man who has taken the chair in the big office as Prime Minister of this country.


These are serious findings by the Australian National Audit Office. It is not Labor saying these things; it was the Australian National Audit Office. The former Treasurer, and now Prime Minister, oversaw Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2006. Eighteen months into his contract he was sacked, terminated—with very healthy severance pay of $300,000, I might add. This has been revealed in recent days because I think it's important. It goes to the calibre of the man who is the Prime Minister. Tourism Australia and the deals that he did—that information was kept from the board. So, as he has proven to be as Prime Minister, he is not open and transparent. The procurement guidelines were breached, and private companies were engaged on contracts worth $184 million before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessment. That's the calibre—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, please resume your seat. A point of order, Senator Williams?




Senator Williams:
  My point of order is about the subject of discussion. We are talking about GST equalisation and fairness throughout the states, but Senator Polley is using this as a political session to throw mud at the Prime Minister. I think it is unacceptable, and you should bring her back to the topic.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley on the point of order.




Senator Polley:
  It is completely relevant to outline the character of the man who is charged with being Prime Minister of this country. It has everything to do with the GST.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, resume your seat. A point of order, Senator Reynolds?




Senator Reynolds:
  Senator Polley commented that the Prime Minister 'didn't have the good looks of Don Draper', which was clearly a reference to Mad Men. But had I or Senator Williams said that Senator Polley 'didn't have the good looks of Sally Draper', for example, she would have taken great offence at that. While it might be a small point, I think it is a significant point. She commented on the looks of somebody else in this place—in this case, a man. It would not be acceptable the other way around.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, although I do draw Senator Polley's attention to the subject matter at hand. I remind senators that, while the discussion may be free ranging, all courtesies to people in the other place should be observed. Senator Polley.




Senator POLLEY:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will continue. The procurement guidelines were breached, and private companies were engaged on contracts worth $184 million before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessments. This now disgraced ex-ad man used to be in charge of Treasury, and he is now the Prime Minister. No wonder he has been so inconsistent on the GST. This is a Prime Minister who is anti accountability and anti transparency. Clearly, he makes decisions on the run. He has thought bubbles without consultation. He actually became Prime Minister this way.


Tasmania relies heavily on the GST, and I will always stand up for my home state. The GST goes to the heart of how you can actually provide, through your governments, to the people of Tasmania. That includes the funding of our hospitals. As my good colleague Senator Urquhart outlined, we have people sleeping on the floor in our accident and emergency departments, in hospital after hospital, because of this government's cuts to hospitals. Our schools have been cut. All of this relates back to the GST. We have the most ageing population. We have a population with, unfortunately, some of the worst chronic diseases in this country. We rely on our portion of the GST. It is irrelevant whether it is a Liberal or Labor state government. We need that money for our residents, for all Tasmanians. So I will of course stand up and call out this Prime Minister for his backflips, his thought bubbles, his lack of consultation, his lack of empathy for those people who can least afford it. I will never apologise for standing up for my home state. That's what I was elected to do. If the Prime Minister and those opposite don't like to have his behaviour called out—it goes to good judgement, because leopards never change their spots—then I will do that. I will take a reprimand any day of the week when it comes to standing up for what I believe all Australians should know and understand about this Prime Minister and this government. 


He had another backdown only yesterday, where he cut the funding to Foodbank Australia. Why did he back down? Because he was getting political heat—even from the National Farmers' Federation. That's the calibre of this Prime Minister. He was trying to outscrooge Mr Scrooge on the eve of Christmas. I will never apologise for saying that. Any cuts to the GST revenue will have a devastating impact on service delivery in regional areas of my home state. They have already been struggling under the Abbot/Turnbull/Morrison government and their cuts to education and health, as I outlined earlier. There has been so much division from those opposite. Clearly, we know that they have tried to instil the infighting among themselves into the rest of the nation by pitting one state and territory against another. That's not the Australian way. A Prime Minister should be bringing the country together. 


Our hospitals are in crisis. Our schools are already under-resourced after years of Liberal cuts. Today we hear from the Institute of Health and Welfare that Tasmania has a higher prevalence of mental health risk, more than any other state in this country, and needs funding. We had an inquiry that outlined that—that 14-year-old Tasmanian having to wait 18 months to get psychological assistance and counselling. That's not good enough. That comes back to the lack of GST and the cuts made to health by this government. The funding for mental health in Tasmania is the worst of any state. Currently, Tasmania can't provide the national standard of care needed for people suffering a mental illness. 


I know that senators in this place have been working very hard through shadow responsibilities to make sure that Australians are aware of the need for more money to go into mental health. I was participating in the community affairs committee hearing in Tasmania. We know only too well that Tasmania needs another 50 psychiatric beds just to meet the national average. Tasmania just can't afford to lose even one dollar of GST. 


On this side, Labor is proud of its record on the GST. Tasmania's federal parliamentary Labor Party lobbied all four Liberal senators, calling on them to support this amendment which protected the legislation and our state's GST share, which they ultimately did. But during the whole lead-up to that the Liberal Senate team in Tasmania was silent. It seems that Mr Morrison and the Liberals have finally woken up to these concerns, despite repeatedly saying that they would not support a legislative guarantee. 


Labor still has reservations about what may occur post 2026-27 if a coalition government is on the Treasury benches after the next election. Can I say once again, Tasmania cannot afford a deal on GST that would impact on our state's ability to deliver the best possible essential services now and into the future. The community knows that Labor will always stand up and fight for our fair share of GST. We know and the community knows—Tasmanians know—that the Liberals won't, because, as shown by their hatred for Medicare, their DNA is not one that actually cares about everyday Tasmanians or Australians. They can't be trusted with the GST and we know they can't be trusted with the economy.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (13:35):  I welcome this long overdue change to the GST distribution scheme, which Western Australian Labor has been fighting for for a long time. I pay tribute to Premier Mark McGowan and his government on their advocacy and fighting for this change and working with federal Labor to get workable change on the national agenda—advocacy that I must say was sorely lacking from the Barnett government, but perhaps he knew at the time that it would fall on deaf ears. It has been unfathomable to me, with the number of WA cabinet ministers in the current government, why this issue remained unaddressed for so long. I commend Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen for putting forward solutions and for committing to a legislated floor. These strong commitments have helped induce action from the current government.


As we know, the GST was introduced in 2000 as a way to raise revenue to support the states and territories. The money raised has been distributed through the Commonwealth Grants Commission policy of horizontal fiscal equalisation. This is a method that attempts to ensure that all Australians benefit from the wealth of the country and that no state or territory is disadvantaged by circumstance. It is seen, in principle, as a fair and equitable way of ensuring that all Australians benefit from the wealth we generate as a nation. But the sad fact is that, 18 years on, the model of horizontal fiscal equalisation is not working as it should and some states, particularly my home state of WA, have been severely disadvantaged.


The Liberal government have been slow to recognise WA's needs and, in my view, have taken for granted the seats that they hold there. Our GST relativity fell from 0.98 on the commencement of the GST to less than 0.30 in 2015-16. It rose slightly in 2017-18. WA received the lowest amount of GST revenue per capita, at just $872 per person in 2017-18. That does not match the expenditure of Western Australians, who buy goods that are subject to the GST. The main reason WA's fair share has fallen has been the mining boom. WA was assessed as being able to raise significantly more revenue than other states. This is via mining royalties. Additionally, specific approaches from the Commonwealth Grants Commission in working out GST relativity work against WA.


At last the government listened to these concerns and last year commissioned a report to look at the distribution. In May the Productivity Commission released its findings on the current state of the GST and horizontal fiscal equalisation. It found that our system was failing to keep pace with the changing situation and economic circumstances that our states and territories find themselves in. It found in particular that resource heavy states, such as WA, were negatively affected by the current system. As resource prices are determined by the international market, they are very much prone to fluctuation, making it difficult to pre-empt how much revenue a state will get.


The current system fails to incentivise states to be creative with their taxation system to try to improve it. With the risk and uncertainty that surround today's economic climate, states and territories don't want to risk their GST revenue pool by looking at other innovative ways of raising revenue. When states try to improve their financial position, their share of GST decreases, and this has had a significant impact on Western Australia.


With this in mind, I very much support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 as proposed, because it sticks to the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation but does not distort that decision-making within government by punishing good innovation. I commend the state government of WA, and indeed the state's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, for putting forward solutions that have been adopted. The reason Western Australia's share in the mining boom has fallen is that the Commonwealth Grants Commission assessed WA improperly. It assessed WA as being able to raise significantly more revenue than other states via mining royalties. It did this because it has forward-projected those revenues without taking into account the actual drop in revenue prices from mining royalties to Western Australia. In addition—and this is a very perverse thing within the GST assessment—the exclusion of gambling revenues from GST assessment for all states penalises WA, because, unlike other states, we don't have a gambling industry.


As a result of all these factors, our GST share has fallen at times to a record low of 30c in the dollar, the lowest in the country. And while the share is projected to increase to 47c in the dollar for this financial year, it is still significantly lower than that of any state in the country. We previously raised concerns about the use of the three-year rolling average for the price of key commodities, including iron ore, particularly in the period following the end of the mining boom, when the price of iron ore and therefore the royalty dropped but the assessment of how much revenue Western Australia would raise did not. The revenue that was assumed simply did not exist. Frankly, it was obvious at that point that it wouldn't exist. But the formulas, according to the ask, couldn't be changed, because it might be a bit unpredictable. This is no way to assess state finances. Frankly, but for the floor, these problems still very much exist inside the assessment process.


This legislation and the major change in this bill is the introduction of a floor to prevent the share of the GST from falling to the kinds of record lows that Western Australia has seen. A floor of 75c is essential to ensure that this situation that has affected WA does not happen again. We did experience an enormous strengthening of our financial situation in WA during the mining boom. This might seem like a fair trade while the state is doing well, but the old GST formula was not designed to accommodate the rapidly changing economic environment in which the state currently finds itself. Just as people were saying that the Western Australian economy could reach no limit, that is was going to keep growing, the mining boom ended. Our share of GST has not recovered to pre-mining-boom levels, because of the lag in that assessment.


These assessments, while not changing in this legislation, will be mitigated by this new floor within the benchmark system. The benchmark for redistribution will be changed from the strongest-performing state—which is currently WA, but that is moving to change—to the strongest of either New South Wales or Victoria. There's good reason to do this. By changing it, we can ensure that these spikes are minimised, because these states have more-diversified and larger economies, so they're not as subject to a particular runaway phenomenon in a particular economic stream.


In short, Western Australia has not reaped the benefits of the mining boom. We've also had to contend with rapid population growth and remote service delivery. This redistributive effect through horizontal fiscal equalisation has been a very poor motivator for growing the wealth of the state and the nation. So, I don't object to the redistributive elements that ensure that we support the whole of our nation, but I don't want to see perverse outcomes in our GST situation.


I asked the Parliamentary Library to do some modelling on this, with the following example: if the mining states of WA and Queensland seek to raise royalty rates in order to increase revenues, the Commonwealth grant process causes them to lose almost as much GST revenue as they would gain in royalty revenue. I asked the Parliamentary Library to model this for me. Their example was to suppose that there were eight states, all of equal size, and that the states collectively raise $8 billion in mining revenue. When working out an average that each state should be able to raise from mining royalties, the Commonwealth Grants Commission would arrive at an average of $1 billion for each state. It would then provide the Commonwealth Grants Commission with the GST revenue to adjust up or to withhold revenue to adjust down to ensure that each state received exactly $1 billion of that value.


Now, suppose that, of the $8 billion raised, $7 billion was raised in just one state, with the remainder being raised equally across the remaining seven states. What incentive does it provide to those other states to raise revenue? Frankly, none. There is no incentive at all, because they have to take on the challenges of how to raise revenue. The impact of that is that it will just be redistributed to the other states.


And, as I highlighted before, there are problems with the way that the Commonwealth Grants Commission deals with gambling revenue. It considers that there are no material factors outside of the control of an individual state that change the amount each state could raise from gambling revenue. In the view of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, each state has the same capacity to raise gambling revenue, irrespective of whether they choose to do so or not.


There is great irony in this. Arguably, some states have made decisions to forgo revenue, with policies opposed to mining. But, in effect, they have not forgone revenue because of this; they have benefited from Western Australia's revenue. But Western Australia has chosen not to have a gambling industry, particularly poker machines, on policy grounds. We don't like the social implications of embedding pokies in social venues around the state and then mopping up the gap in social consequences later. But the Commonwealth Grants Commission's approach still assumes that WA could raise this revenue and the average amount of gambling revenue as for other states. This is, if you like, included in our assumed funding base for the state. This is completely perverse.


As a result of this, Western Australian people are missing out. For every one dollar they have spent at the shop on GST-taxed goods, they have sent up to 7c out of the state. Western Australians have, rightly, had enough. Linking the index of the redistribution to volatile and heavily-fluctuating resource markets, rather than to broader and diversified economies, has not lent itself to stability and fairness in the system. New South Wales and Victoria have well-performing and, more importantly, more stable and diverse economies. Linking this index to their performance ensures that our GST system remains consistent and predictable.


So I commend federal capital Labor for taking the lead on this and for recognising the needs of Western Australia. They started with the Fair Share for WA Fund, then a floor and committed to a legislative floor. I am keenly aware that states and territories need to be treated fairly under the new system, that sudden changes could put pressure on the states and territories and they could end up worse off as a result of this change. Western Australia has lived through this. We need plans that promote stability and ensure states and territory governments can plan for the future. The current system is highly susceptible to changes in economic circumstances, and, indeed, property taxes changes can also adversely affect the share of the GST received. These are areas that are also highly volatile in today's economic environment. So we do understand the concerns of other states in looking at this legislation. It has been extremely hard for WA to deal with this fiscal uncertainty, and I wouldn't wish that uncertainty upon any other state. To this end, we support the guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off during the six-year transition period while the new system is rolled out. I'm not going to go into detail, but I recognise the role that top-up funds will have during this critical time.


I note that the bill also requires the referral of our GST system to the Treasurer to refer it to the Productivity Commission to see whether the new system is working and that it will need to report by the end of the year, in 2026. Stability should be the purpose of this bill. Uncertainty about what happens next does not help our cause. This legislation is a good step in addressing the inequalities that exist in our GST system. The floor so desperately needed by WA will perhaps, in the future, benefit other states. It will ensure that states and territories receive a reliable and predictable share of the GST that is fair and equitable.


Western Australia has had a significantly difficult time, and we have been justifiably outraged by the lack of our fair share in GST revenue. All of this has happened at a time when Western Australia's net debt has grown per capita to the highest of any other state. Our own revenues dropped at the same time as our GST revenue dropped. At the same time, with the end of the mining boom, the labour force participation rate dramatically decreased, with a fall from 69 per cent in February 2016 to 57 per cent in 2016. We had an increasing population, increased unemployment and decreasing participation rates, and none of these things were good news for Western Australia. At the same time as all of this was happening, for every dollar spent in the consumption of GST goods, up to 70c went to other states. That's 70c for every dollar paid of GST. We only kept 30c in the dollar. That has improved. WA will foreseeably receive 47c in the dollar in 2017-18, so that has improved somewhat. But it still means that, for every litre of petrol a Western Australian buys—and we know that petrol prices are at record highs—we are sending 6.6c out of the state. This has gone on too long. This legislation is welcome and overdue.


I want to highlight that Western Australia's fight for a fair share will not end there. Given the size of our state and the many remote regional communities within it that are difficult to service, we are still getting a raw deal in many other areas. Western Australians are also concerned to know that, with 10.8 per cent of Australia's population, in other areas not including the GST we receive just seven per cent of the Commonwealth spend. This is less than every other state or territory by a significant factor. Today I'm pleased we can work together inside our Federation to improve cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth so that we can continue to be a competitive nation but also a compassionate nation that fairly distributes our resources to maximise the wellbeing of our nation. Thank you.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (13:55):  I'm certainly not going to mince words in the very short time I have for now on how very important this issue of the GST is to the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory is facing unprecedented falls in GST revenue, which is impacting on the government's ability to deliver core services. This impact is widening the gap on Indigenous disadvantage and infrastructure deficits.


NT GST revenue has fallen by $500 million per year. This $500 million shortfall is entrenched by the watering down of horizontal fiscal equalisation principles in this bill, remembering that the GST makes up 50 per cent of the Northern Territory's total revenue and the NT government's $6.5 billion budget. The NT has a relatively limited own-source revenue base, which is 30 per cent of total revenue, despite the new $37 billion INPEX LNG project coming online. I certainly want to remind senators that this project is also subject to the Commonwealth's 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax and 30 per cent company tax.


The NT's current sharp economic downturn is exacerbating the situation, with the debt-to-revenue ratio rising. Since 2016, the NT's GST revenue forecasts have seen a cumulative decline of $3.4 billion over the forward estimates. As a small, self-governing member of the Federation, with a limited own-source revenue base compared to the larger jurisdictions, it is disproportionately more difficult for the Northern Territory to absorb significant changes to its GST revenue. While all economies are subject to cyclical effects, as a small, open economy, the economic cycles in the Territory are more pronounced than in other jurisdictions. The NT's making some very tough decisions in its fiscal response to the economic downturn, and this includes over $800 million in savings and efficiencies and new own-sourcing revenue measures.


The Northern Territory, regardless of the government in power, has always been a strong supporter of the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation, so it's enormously disappointing to see the failure of the Northern Territory senator Nigel Scullion and his Country Liberal Party to stand up for the Territory around these changes to GST that will impact adversely on the Northern Territory. Senator Scullion failed to say a single word when the then Treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced last year that the government was slashing GST distribution to the Territory by an estimated $2 billion over the next four years, and he's certainly done nothing to get his colleagues to listen to the Northern Territory government's very reasonable argument about funding essential services, such as housing, education and roads. He's refusing to say, as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, what impact this new funding arrangement will have on efforts in the Territory to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. Every February we certainly talk about the need to look at the report card of Indigenous disadvantage and closing the gap, which the parliament admits that we're not doing. How then, when we know we desperately need extra resources and support in the Northern Territory, are we going to close that gap?


There's certainly been a parade of Liberal government figures through the Territory in recent months, all talking up their candidates in Lingiari and Solomon, but not once have any of them said what they'll be doing about this unprecedented financial situation facing the Northern Territory. They have not said one word about how they will be advocating for us, ensuring that we get our fair share. Not once have any of these candidates ever said what their plans are for dealing with this reduction in GST revenue which will impact the people of the Northern Territory the hardest. You cannot pretend to be standing up for the Territory, for the most disadvantaged communities in this country, and saying you're their voice, yet refuse to front the people who have made the decision to change the basis for GST redistribution.

After Prime Minister Morrison was sacked as managing director of Tourism Australia, sources close to the board said in relation to the decision, 'There was no dissent whatsoever.' The board was absolutely unanimous. If the Prime Minister was a competent managing director of Tourism Australia, why was he sacked only a year and a half into his contract by a unanimous decision of the board, without any dissent whatsoever?

Martin Ferguson was a very strong and vocal supporter of the outstanding performance of Prime Minister Morrison.

The PRESIDENT:  That is a point of humour, maybe, Senator Sterle, but not a point of order. Senator Cormann.




Senator CORMANN:
  Thank you very much, Mr President. I'm just pointing out the obvious flaws in the premise of the question by pointing out the strong support by the subsequent tourism minister, Martin Ferguson. The other point I would make is that the highly distinguished former chair of Tourism Australia, the former Prime Minister Tim Fischer, was also on the public record indicating what an outstanding job the Prime Minister did as the managing director of Tourism Australia. And I also would refer the Senate to my letter to the President, which was copied to Senator Wong, where I pointed out that I could confirm that the flagship campaign, 'So where the bloody hell are you?' developed under the stewardship of the Prime Minister as managing director, contributed to an additional $2.1 billion in the industry's bottom line over 2007—

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cameron and Sterle and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) today relating to the Prime Minister (Mr Morrison).


I have to say the responses to questions today really go to the nature of the muppet show known as the Morrison government—that is, answers that deal with questions related to the Prime Minister's fundamental lack of judgement and competence. It's really no wonder that the Prime Minister chose to use the words 'muppet show' to describe his own government, because in actuality words to this effect were used to describe his performance during his time at Tourism Australia. 


What we've seen from revelations only this week is that not only was the decision to dismiss Mr Morrison from the independent agency 'unanimous by the board and the minister' but the Auditor-General described the Prime Minister's time at the helm of the agency as having 'numerous anomalies and concerns over contracts worth $184 million'. These decisions reflect a serious breach of procurement guidelines and they are significant indictments on his judgement. They show that the current Prime Minister is frankly not suited to the role. He is unable to manage an independent agency, and he has now been promoted to run the nation, regardless of the fact that he has shown an appalling lack of judgement. 


There is plenty of evidence around the lack of judgement in his time at Tourism Australia. We heard that today in the question that was asked by Senator Cameron to Senator Cormann today. The fact is that the entire Tourism Australia board, former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, the former Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Fran Bailey, and former Prime Minister Howard refused to step in and save Mr Morrison, because he was incompetent. He lacks judgement. 


It's not only in his time in Tourism Australia. He has been the Prime Minister since 24 August. What has happened in that time? What has he shown about his competency and judgement? Obviously, we've got the issue that he raised about moving the Australian embassy. That was an issue he raised that has overwhelmingly backfired on the Prime Minister. He raised that issue, an important issue, just to try to score political points in the by-election in the seat of Wentworth. 


Yesterday, we had the issue around Foodbank. His own colleagues came out against him on Foodbank. He's had to backflip—thankfully—on cutting that funding. He has also now been caught out around the briefing he gave the former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, when he sent him off to Indonesia to represent the government. He got caught out telling a different story than Mr Turnbull told. He had to backtrack on that. And we have his bus—his bus that is going around the country, but he's not on it. He gets on and off just for the photo opportunity. He's flying around. And, of course, who could forget the hip-hop song that he had to come out and apologise for: 'Scott Morrison removes cringe-worthy social media video over inappropriate rap lyrics.' 


I've just sat down here and gone through some of the things that this Prime Minister has done that he's had to backflip on, that he's had to apologise on. There are very many serious issues that the Prime Minister just doesn't get. He's got an appalling lack of judgement, not only around the Great Barrier Reef and the grant that was given—he's taken responsibility for that as well—but we all know that he was Minister for Social Services for less than 10 months. He really must go. (Time expired)

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (15:10):  It fascinates me that the party of Latham, Rudd, Gillard, Rudd, Shorten and almost Albanese wants to open up a discussion about competency in leadership. Take nothing I say as a reflection on Prime Minister Morrison. Fifteen years you've waited to raise an issue so compelling that it dominates everything in your debate at the moment. It just shows, as is always the case when these lightweight attacks come from the Australian Labor Party, that they've got nothing else substantive to talk about. Question time is that valuable time in this place that allows the opposition—in this case, the Australian Labor Party—to highlight and explore critical issues to this nation around the economy, around social services, around support we're putting in place for agriculture. What do they choose to take that time up with? What do they choose to spend time on in the take note opportunity? They choose such a featherweight issue on events that have not occupied their minds for 13 years and, suddenly, are now writ large. 


I'll tell you why they're attacking Prime Minister Morrison. They realise the risk that Mr Shorten and the Labor Party face at the next election on the question of competency. Mr Morrison secured our borders after years and years and years of neglect—hundreds of thousands of arrivals, 1,200 people. It always fascinates me that, when we're talking about matters of national security and security of our borders, the Labor Party never once mentioned that their policy directly led to the loss of life of 1,200 individuals, many of whose names will never be known—men, women and children. And you want to have a discussion about competency? Your current leader was in your leadership team at the time those policies were in place. Prime Minister Morrison came along and fixed it, and fixed it good. He resecured the borders of this nation to this day. We inherited the legacy of Manus and Nauru, and there's an enormous amount of effort put in by you featherweights and those in the Greens to try and plaster this current administration with the event of children in custody in Nauru and the other centre. 


So, if you want to have a discussion about competency, I'll have the discussion with you every day, and so will everyone from the coalition. We'll talk about competency to run the economy. The Prime Minister, no matter what happens in the future, will be remembered for arresting the deficiencies that came with the deficits that you left us with—structural deficits that have gone on for years—and future deficits. He will take credit for arresting that and returning us to surplus, along with the efforts of our current leader in the Senate. So, if you want to have a talk about competency in relation to Prime Minister Morrison, we're just the right people. If you want to talk about the honesty of Prime Minister Morrison, let's have a discussion about Shorten and Gillard and all the very dark allegations that remain writ large and have never been answered about their conduct back in the trade union movement—building houses, materials, donations going—

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:15):  I too rise to take note of answers to Senator Cameron's question and to put some more contemporary facts on the table. I accept that the coalition is attempting to say that this was all so long ago that it's not relevant and it doesn't matter. But I think it's entirely superficial to say that what happened in those times is no longer relevant. If you go to the record of the parliament, you will find that the Select Committee on the Recent Allegations relating to Conditions and Circumstances at the Regional Processing Centre in Nauru found a glaring example of the lack of governance and due diligence of this particular minister.


The Leader of the Government in the Senate, sitting at the table today, was the only person, as the Minister for Finance, who was able to grant an expediency motion to the department of immigration to authorise the expenditure outside the public works committee of this parliament. That never, ever happened. There was no expediency motion through the House of Representatives. There was an incredible amount of expenditure in Nauru which did not go through the proper probity and governance of the parliament. Minister Morrison walked straight around the oldest standing committee of the parliament. And, when the department was asked about it, they conflated this view that 'it's aid to a foreign country and we don't have to refer it'. That was a subterfuge; that was not correct. If that is correct, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade do not have to notify when they're building a new embassy in Nairobi, in Jakarta or in Bangkok, and we know that they do all of those things.


Minister Morrison spent, over a period of his early ministership, $1.3 billion in Nauru. Four hundred and fifty million dollars was spent in 10 months; $2,000 was spent per day per asylum seeker; $1.3 million was spent a day; and $610,000 per asylum seeker was spent to live in a mouldy tent. No, I take that back—it was a marquee. But, after 402 days, it was a mouldy tent. If that expenditure of $36 million to build those mouldy tents had gone through the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, proper probity and scrutiny would have probably ensured that that wasn't a really good idea—to take people in the tropics, akin to Darwin, and stick them for 402 days in a mouldy tent at the cost of $36 million. It's detrimental to their health and detrimental to the people who are looking after them in that area. It was really poor governance and due diligence.


It doesn't stop there. They went and spent hand over fist, citing urgency and citing expediency but not following the due diligence for probity of parliament. None of it went through the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. The government response to that Senate select committee was, 'The department provided a response to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 14 August 2015.' That was a letter saying, 'We've got this legal advice that we don't have to come your way.' The next part is, 'The department will continue to ensure that future public works in the Republic of Nauru are referred.' So there's a clear example of this person purporting to be an exemplar of due diligence—an exemplar of public probity and governance hasn't got clean hands.


In the earlier parliament—the first parliament when they came in—they had a clear example from the Gillard-Rudd government where an expediency motion granted by the finance minister passed through the House of Representatives, and there was feedback to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on progress. They didn't do any of that. It is as simple as this: they didn't realise that, because the old parliament had lapsed, they had to do the process again. So, in the process they were supposed to do in their rush to do whatever, they didn't follow due process. That relates directly back to Prime Minister Morrison. It's never been rebutted in this place. This speech is in the Hansard. It was never rebutted by the finance minister. It was never rebutted by any of those on the other side. It stands to be true.

 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  For those that might be listening or watching at home, I think it's important to be clear that the House of Representatives is not sitting this week, which means that Labor senators have to operate independently of their House colleagues. And boy, haven't we seen where the real power, the real authority, the real skill is—I'm stretching it a bit there. The real skill is not in the Australian Senate for the Australian Labor Party; it might be in the House of Representatives. What we have had this week is a very lacklustre and weak attempt at trying to undermine—



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator DEAN SMITH:
  Senator Brown, I thought your contribution was particularly lacklustre. You were trying to undermine the credibility of the Prime Minister—the evidence is there and I'll come to it in a moment—on what was a very successful marketing campaign aimed at encouraging visitors to Australia. It was so successful that Kevin Rudd, when he was the opposition leader, said it was 'great'; you won't be surprised to learn that, when he became the Prime Minister, he changed his tune. I will just take people back down memory lane for a bit. This was the 'Where the bloody hell are you?' marketing campaign. It featured an outback pub, fireworks on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and a bikini-clad young woman called Lara Bingle. It was successful.


Senator Cormann has drawn to the attention of the Senate in his contribution today that this campaign contributed an additional $2.1 billion to the tourism industry's bottom line over 2006-07. He also shared with the Senate that the Australian National Audit Office itself has said that the accounts were found to be a true and fair view of its final position. Senator Cormann said that the Prime Minister, in his role at Tourism Australia, met all the requirements and that people were fully satisfied. The number of nights stayed by international visitors increased by 12 per cent as a result of the marketing campaign. The tourism spend in Australia increased by 10 per cent, and there was an increase of three per cent in the economic value of inbound tourism to $18.8 billion. Having presided over the Tourism Australia 'Where the bloody hell are you?' campaign is a demonstration—not a criticism—of the Prime Minister's acumen. 


We've heard a lot over the last two days about what Tim Fischer, the former Deputy Prime Minister, had to say. What did Tim Fischer have to say? You'll have to trawl back through the archives, but on 26 July 2006, in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald, he praised Mr Morrison's performance. He said: 'I acknowledge the dedicated contribution Scott Morrison has made to Tourism Australia—in particular, with the development and launch of the new international marketing campaign.'


Lacklustre and dispirited—that is the way Labor has prosecuted a very lame attempt at trying to undermine the community's confidence in the Prime Minister. So you might well ask yourself: where the bloody hell have you been? I know where the coalition has been. It's been out there developing and implementing a campaign for personal income tax reduction. It's been out there building confidence in the Australian economy. It's been out there driving economic growth in our country. It's been out there negotiating with the states and territories for a fairer share of the GST, a deal that no-one thought could be done. That is a deal that not only rewards Western Australia and corrects the great anomaly in regard to the GST issue but also benefits every state and territory. I know where the coalition has been; it has been out there working and building confidence in the Australian economy for families and for small businesses.



So, where has Labor been? Where the bloody hell has Labor been? I know where you've been. You've been building a plan for higher taxes. You've been building a plan for slower economic growth. You've been building a plan to dismantle all of the economic growth and prosperity that this country has seen over many, many years. That's where you've been. You'll have to lift your game. The House of Representatives will be back in a few days time. You've got a chance. (Time expired)

 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:25):  Deputy President, I seek leave to table the documents referred to by Senator Carr in question time today.


Leave granted.




Senator DAVID SMITH:
  I also rise to take note of the answers from the Minister representing the Prime Minister in question time today. The answers by the minister in question time today cannot disguise the repeated lack of judgement and transparency shown by the current Prime Minister. His lack of judgement has been on display for all to see since the leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull. It was on display in his previous role as minister and it was there during his tenure as head of Tourism Australia. The Prime Minister has done his best to try to hide the details of his sacking from Tourism Australia and the reasons for his dismissal. Apparently we're meant to believe that he was supremely competent. We don't know if his sacking was because of maladministration. We don't know if his sacking was because he was seen as a malcontent. We don't know if his sacking was because of a cringe-worthy campaign. Maybe it was because he was spending too much time doing the numbers. What we do know is that, in the words of the minister at the time, 'it was a unanimous decision to get rid of Mr Morrison by the board and the minister.' It was a decision that was backed by the Prime Minister, John Howard. We also know that nothing less than the Auditor-General's report from that time outlined information being kept from the board, government procurement guidelines being breached and contracts of up to $184 million being awarded to private companies without any assessment of value for money. It all sounds way too familiar.


We also know that the Prime Minister's approach to our relationship with our neighbours might also appear by some to be cringe-worthy and lacking judgement. The declaration in the days before the Wentworth by-election, that Australia would consider moving our embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, showed a complete and utter disregard for the sensitivities of one of our most important relationships—that with our largest neighbour, Indonesia—and all in a vain attempt to win a by-election. Well, we know how that worked out. It's not surprising that this thought bubble burst as soon as the polls closed in Wentworth. But the damage had been done, and it's clear that this is impacting on our trade relationship, as reported in the news today. We know that this is true. What we also know is that Australians deserve the opportunity that the Tourism Australia board and the former Minister for Tourism had all those years ago at Tourism Australia: the opportunity to terminate the Prime Minister's employment by going to an early election.


Question agreed to.

  The former minister for education, Senator Birmingham, did not explain why he vetoed 11 grant applications for humanities and social science research projects recommended by the ARC. He still has not done so, apart from sneering at project titles. The applicants only found out what happened when the ARC confirmed the former minister's decisions at Senate estimates. They are all eminent scholars, but the arbitrary rejection of their work affects their reputations and career prospects. The present minister, Mr Tehan, has proposed a national interest test for applicants, without explaining why a further test is needed beyond that already contained in the application process. As all the research community has recognised, political interference threatens the independence and integrity of the peer review grants process. It is an established principle that politicians should not decide on funding of individual grant projects. The government should recommit and prevent further harm to the standing of Australia's research institutions. (Time expired)

  Labor agrees with parts (a) to (d) of this motion and would also like to recognise the importance of regional tourism, commend Outback Queensland Tourism and congratulate all category winners of the 2018 Outback Queensland Tourism Awards. However, Labor opposes part (e) of this motion as the Tourism 2020 strategy was in fact an important initiative of the former federal Labor government. Moreover, the current coalition government has only cancelled programs aimed at supporting tourism. It cancelled the T-QUAL program and the Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund upon coming into office. So we ask that this motion be split.

   (i) encourage all religious institutions within states and territories which are currently signed on to the National Redress Scheme, to opt in, and


   (ii) withhold any government funding and deny charity tax concessions to religious institutions within those states and territories that fail to opt in by 28 February 2018.

Senator HINCH:
  In moving this motion, I need to point out that it is in my capacity as a senator for the Justice Party and not in my position as Chair of the National Redress Scheme committee. I'm doing it, to steal from Gough Whitlam, because it's time—it's actually past time. Institutions named in this motion are dragging the chain—some, I suspect, deliberately. Several thousand applications have been lodged, but fewer than 10 have been settled. Cases are on hold and ageing survivors are dying without their redress. It wasn't too complicated for church branches to use the umbrella system for the royal commission. Surely that is a blueprint for how redress should be addressed now. We've used the carrot; it's time for the stick.

Senator CHISHOLM:
  Labor agrees with the sentiments contained in the majority of this motion, including the frustration with the slow rollout of the National Redress Scheme. Victims should not be dying before receiving the compensation and recognition they are owed. However, it is not Labor policy to withhold charitable status or government funding from any religious institutions, and therefore we are forced to oppose this motion.

  The government continues to carefully consider the best way forward to further strengthen and improve the national integrity framework. It is important that changes in this area improve upon the current system rather than adding complexity and confusion. In contrast, the opposition has made a policy announcement about a federal anticorruption commission with absolutely no detail of how it will work. Calling by motion for a commitment to the establishment of an organisation without any detail whatsoever as to the jurisdictional powers or legal and administrative operation of that organisation is not a sound policy approach.

   (ii) the Government's plans to establish an NDIS Special Account did not pass the Parliament and have now been abandoned – demonstrating that they were an unnecessary ploy to hold people with disability ransom to social security cuts,


   (iii) the NDIS has the potential to transform the lives of disabled people, their families, and carers, but it is still in the process of being rolled out and has a long way to go to meet the needs of disabled Australians,


   (iv) disabled Australians continue to face discrimination created by the physical, cultural, and governmental barriers present in our society and the current implementation of the NDIS is failing to adequately meet their needs,


   (v) the entire state of New South Wales has been declared to be in drought, as well as parts of Queensland, South Australia and Victoria, and it is a matter of national importance that we assist farming families in these regions, to help them through this tough time, and

(b) calls on the Government to:


   (i) ensure that not only is the NDIS fully funded, but that it is working as intended by adequately meeting the needs of disabled Australians and supporting them to fully participate in all aspects of our society; and


   (ii) give disabled Australians certainty that the NDIS will not be treated like a political football.

Our prudent economic management has allowed us to fully fund the NDIS and at the same time establish a $5 billion future drought fund that guarantees support against future droughts faced by farmers and communities in rural and regional Australia.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:38):  If ever there was a clear difference between this rabble of a government, this government that their own Prime Minister called the muppets, this government that their former Prime Minister calls mad, then it's the position Labor is taking on standing up for workers and their families. What we have said clearly is that we will restore the penalty rates of 700,000 workers across this country. These are some of the poorest and most disadvantaged workers in the country. What we have seen has been a process of pressurising the Fair Work Commission. There was minister after minister of this coalition government who stood up and said we needed more flexibility on penalty rates. We had member after member of the coalition government talking about the need to get into a modern economy and get rid of penalty rates. The pressure was put on publicly by this government and by business. Unfortunately, the Fair Work Commission made an amazing blunder by taking penalty rates away from some of the poorest workers in this country. Labor will restore those penalty rates because we understand how important penalty rates are to working families across this country. 


When I first came to Australia in 1973, as a maintenance fitter, without my penalty rates I would not have been able to put food on the table, pay the rent and look after my family. It was my penalty rates that actually put me in a position to be able to pay the rent in Kingsford in Sydney, which was pretty high by any standard, and then put food on the table and actually do a little bit for my family to get ahead. It was penalty rates that did it. Without penalty rates, I would have been in all sorts of trouble. My basic wage in those days was $87 a week and I was paying $50 a week in rent. It was my penalty rates that allowed me to actually live a basic life, a decent life, when I first came to Australia. 


This is a problem for 700,000 workers across this country. I can't believe that the National Party would have been party to this push against penalty rates, because in many regional economies—and I was in Albury-Wodonga recently and down in Bega the week before last—working people were saying they're doing it tough and small businesses were saying they're doing it tough. When the money from the penalty rates comes out of our local economies, businesses do it tough. We are saying we will restore penalty rates. There are good economic reasons to do it, there are good social reasons to do it and there are reasons of fairness in this country. So we will restore penalty rates. This is Labor standing up for workers. 


We will also provide a tax break to workers at the lower end of earnings in this country. We'll provide a tax break of up to $1,063 per annum. That's in sharp contrast to the coalition, who wanted to hand $80 billion to the big end of town in tax cuts and wanted to hand $12 billion in tax cuts to the banks. How crazy can you get? How ideologically driven can you get that when workers are doing it tough, when workers are having their penalty rates cut, you want to hand billions of dollars over to the banks and the big end of town?


We've said that we'll crack down on dodgy labour hire companies. Labour hire companies are still out there forcing workers onto individual contracts. They are forcing workers who are not self-employed into self-employed positions. That is unacceptable. The labour hire companies that are out there behaving badly need to be brought under some control and under some regulation. We need workers to get a fair go if they're working for a labour hire company. Labour hire companies should be registered so that we know only legitimate labour hire companies are going to operate. 


We want to ensure that Australian workers get access to jobs and are not replaced by overseas workers on 457 visas unnecessarily. Labor has always taken the view that there is a need for overseas labour. I am a product of Labor's previous policies of bringing workers in from overseas, but I came into this country as a permanent migrant and I think I brought some skills, through my trade, to this country, and that is a legitimate position. But now we've seen 457 visas being used unnecessarily. Under the mining boom, sure, there was a massive increase in the number of 457 visas. That's because the country needed those skills. Now that we don't need those skills as much as we did, there should not be the use of 457 visas unnecessarily. 


Workers are not getting their fair share in this country. We've had decades of economic growth in this country. But what is it for workers? Stagnating wages. You hear all these arguments about jobs being created. It's not the coalition that's created the jobs; it's business that has created these jobs. Business has created these jobs, but the workers are not getting a pay rise. The workers are not getting a cent more. Workers' wages are stagnating, and that is a massive problem for the living standards of working families. Their standards of living are declining. They're battling to pay their mortgage; they're battling to pay their rent. Many, many workers can't afford to go on a modest holiday in this country. They're cutting back on small luxuries. Battling workers can't take their kids to the movies. They can't send their kids on school excursions. Once in a blue moon, they might be able to get a takeaway—that's a luxury for many working people in this country.


It's so far from the reality of the coalition members, who are living a life that many workers do not understand and could never contemplate. Yet these people on a $200,000-a-year basic wage are saying to workers: 'You must get rid of your penalty rates. Your wages should stagnate. Just believe in us and somehow you'll get a pay increase.' It's absolute ideological nonsense from this government. Workers are battling to pay their electricity bills. After five years of this coalition, there is no certainty for investment in the power industry. That's because you've got the extremists on the other side who don't believe in climate change, who are simply trying to push an extreme ideological agenda on this country that has left investment in renewables stagnating. Investment in renewables should be massively growing, as every modern economy is looking to do. This is a position of: we need a consistent policy. The coalition are incapable of providing a consistent policy on power and on climate change, and that means that workers are paying the price. It's because of the incompetence and lack of policy from the coalition government.


Private health care is beyond the reach of the majority of low-paid workers. They can't afford private health care. These prices are going up more and more. This is just another example of the problems for working people. The Centre for Future Work have done an analysis. They've looked at it, and they've come up with a view that workers are getting about $16,800 less pay a year due to the labour share of the gross domestic product declining. More money is going to the big end of town, more money is going to employers and less money is coming to workers. That has resulted in a $16,800-a-year less share of the economy for every worker. The OECD has seen the highest incidence of temporary work. CEO remuneration as a multiple of medium wages in Australia was 15 to one. It is now 180 to one over a 40-year period. The big end of town is doing okay; executives are doing okay. Workers' wages are stagnating. The government have got no answers; the government are on their last legs. No wonder that their own people describe them as 'muppets' and as 'mad', because they are the 'M and Ms'. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-11-13,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (16:48):  That last speech should have been finished with the words, 'Written, spoken and authorised by the ACTU.' That's because, really, that is all that the Senate has been subjected to—the nonsense of the lobotomised zombies. Senator Cameron himself described his colleagues in the Labor Party as 'lobotomised zombies'. They're not my words but Senator Cameron's words, and how true they are a descriptor of not only the Labor Party but also, of course, Senator Cameron himself.


Let's have a look at the facts. First of all, let's go to the very end of the motion or proposition put forward by Senator Cameron. It's about cracking down on dodgy labour hire 457 visas. All I would ask the Australian people listening to this debate to do is look at what Labor does, not at what Labor says. That's because when Mr Shorten was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, 457 visas grew from 48,000 to 68,486. The coalition came to government, and within the first year we were able to peal it back to around about 52,000. Today, it stands at 12,000, which is about 20 per cent of what Mr Shorten presided over. Yet we have the audacity of an Australian Labor Party frontbencher coming into this place suggesting that our 80 per cent reduction of 457 visas from when Mr Shorten was the responsible minister to now is somehow a great discredit to us, because Senator Cameron and the Labor Party protect workers. I don't think so. Their record speaks so much louder than their rhetoric today. 


It is this Liberal-National Party government that promised to create, through economic stimulus, an extra one million jobs in this country if we were to have been elected in 2013. We were ridiculed by the ACTU. We were ridiculed by their senators in this place for making such an assertion. We came in on that promise well before time. And, indeed, we have been able, through our economic stimulus, to assist the private sector to create, in one year alone, 400,000 new jobs for our fellow Australians. That is 400,000 households that today are able to be self-sufficient, which otherwise they would not have been. We all know that the benefit of employment is better mental health, better physical health, better self-esteem and better social interaction. The social good of employment, I would argue, nearly outweighs the economic benefits of employment. This is the social good and the economic good that we as a government have been able to deliver. That is why the welfare bill in this country has been able to be reduced, because the best form of welfare is the provision of employment. That is what we as a government have sought to deliver. 


Turning to my home state of Tasmania, when the Greens-Labor government was in power with Mr Shorten as a minister, the unemployment rate in my home state was 8.1 per cent. Today, it is below six per cent. That means thousands of my fellow Tasmanians have been taken off the welfare system and gone into employment, where they have self-sufficiency and where they have certainty. 


Now let me expose the monstrous lie that the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party seek to peddle about penalty rates. Penalty rates have not been abolished. Penalty rates in four awards were reduced, not by the government but by Mr Bill Shorten's handpicked Fair Work commissioners. They made the decision, five Fair Work commissioners, and they were all appointed by the Australian Labor Party government under legislation that Mr Shorten deliberately amended prior to the demise of the Labor-Greens government, forcing the Fair Work Commission to have a look at penalty rates on a regular basis. So who's the architect of the reduction of penalty rates in these four awards? None other than Mr Bill Shorten of the Australian Labor Party. Yet they have the audacity to come in here and seek to claim, and blame, the coalition for a decision made by the Australian Labor Party's mates. 


Even worse, when Mr Shorten was asked on radio if he would accept the decision of the independent umpire—and that is what the Fair Work Commission is; you have to accept their decisions—Mr Shorten was asked: 'Will you accept their findings, given this is an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sunday, if you're Prime Minister?' Mr Shorten: 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell: 'You'll accept them?' Bill Shorten: 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell: 'Even if they reduce Sunday penalty rates?' Bill Shorten: 'Well, I said I would accept the independent tribunal.' That is what Mr Shorten said he would do. Now, for cheap political opportunism, he has changed his mind. So I say to my fellow Australians who might be concerned about their penalty rates: this is the man that engineered your reduction in penalty rates. He is the man that then said that he would 'accept the decision if it were to reduce your penalty rates'. And today, hand on heart, he says, 'Believe me, I'm going to change it'—when he was the one who ensured this reduction in penalty rates would actually occur. Mr Shorten was the architect. He is responsible. He needs to bear the blame. And it is the height of audacity, the height of duplicity, the height of speaking with a forked tongue, for the Australian Labor Party to come to this chamber and assert that somehow the coalition are responsible for a reduction in penalty rates.


But why did Labor's hand-picked Fair Work commissioners come to the determination that it might be a good idea to reduce Sunday penalty rates in a few areas? Because they accepted that it mitigated against the prospect of employment for our other fellow Australians. And so the Fair Work Commission said that, if you were to reduce the Sunday penalty rates by a relatively small margin, it would create extra employment opportunities. Senator Cameron, the ACTU and the Labor Party will never talk about the 400,000 jobs that have been created in recent times, because they know the economic policies we have pursued and the reality that made the Fair Work Commissioners come to the decision that the penalty rates regime was costing jobs.


Here we are with an extra 400,000 Australians in employment. Under an Australian Labor Party government, going by their record—not what they say but what they actually do—we would have another 50,000 or so 457 visa holders displacing Australian workers and we would undoubtedly have more of our fellow Australians unemployed. When it comes to looking after workers, the Liberal-National Party record shows that it has not amended the legislation—like Mr Shorten did— and did not appoint the commissioners that led to the reduction in penalty rates. In fact, we are the party that has presided over 400,000 more jobs in Australia in just one year and the creation of over one million jobs since we came to government. More importantly, we have seen the shattering of the 457 visas that were given to people by 80 per cent compared to when Mr Shorten was in government. So the party for the workers is in fact the Liberal-National Party government, which has a record—unlike Labor, which only has rhetoric.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-11-13,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:58):  As Senator Cameron would recall, One Nation supported his fair work amendment bill in 2017 to protect take-home pay and penalty rates for Australian workers. It would appear that the Labor Party either has a short memory of my support and the support of all One Nation senators or these are disgraceful untruths designed to discredit One Nation because we're having a huge impact on your vote in blue-collar regions like Capricornia, Maranoa, Herbert and other electorates across the country. The hypocrisy of Labor is laughable, when you say Labor is protecting Aussie jobs and weekend penalty rates. The Labor Party happily undermined Australian workers less than a month ago by supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP-11. This free trade agreement has given away at least 5,000 Australian jobs to countries like Mexico, whose workers are prepared to slave their guts out for $6.07 a day. Under the TPP-11, passed by Labor and the coalition, you gave away Australian jobs to Vietnamese workers who don't mind working for $2.70 a day in their home country. Honestly, Labor sicken me with their hypocrisy and cock-and-bull stories about being a party for the workers. I'm sorry, but you've never been a party for the workers. These days the Labor Party are about themselves.


What credibility Labor had left as a party went up in smoke last month when they all voted in favour of the TPP-11 free trade agreement. Let me read you a little excerpt from a letter I just received yesterday from the national secretary of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union, Michael O'Connor. I think the Deputy President and my Senate colleagues know who I'm referring to here. He's not only the big boss of the CFMEU but also the brother of Labor's shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, Brendan O'Connor. Listen to what the CFMEU national secretary says to me in his letter. It's very kind. I almost blushed when I first read it. For the sake of our snowflake Labor members, I'm giving you a trigger warning just in case you want to block your ears. Here we go. Just remember these are words from Michael O'Connor, the national secretary of the CFMEU: 'Dear Senator, I write to you to firstly acknowledge your efforts and thank you for the principled position that you took by voting against the enabling legislation for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, TPP-11. The TPP was and is bad for workers and bad for the country.' This is Michael O'Connor writing to me. The CFMEU national secretary then says: 'The A Fair Go for Australians in Trade Bill 2018 is due to, in no small part, One Nation's great work.' Isn't it lovely of the CFMEU's national secretary to write to little old me, Pauline Hanson?


I can't believe the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union is telling me One Nation is the best friend workers have in Australia—not Labor. What a kick in the guts to Labor. How do you feel? You sold out the CFMEU and their members, for what? I'll say it again: One Nation is officially the best friend to workers, and I've got it in writing from the biggest union in this country. The CFMEU says, 'One Nation takes a principled stand on jobs in this country.' That sounds to me like the national secretary of the CFMEU is saying, 'Labor don't have principles, but One Nation does.'


Already Mark Latham has joined One Nation as state leader ahead of the New South Wales state elections. Labor better get used to more One Nation members being elected across every state in this country. We are, as the CFMEU say, principled. I welcome anyone who shares my support of Australian jobs to join me as we fight the two failed parties who continue to sell out workers in this country.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (17:03):  Can I just ask Senator Hanson and Senator Georgiou to hang around. I'm not going to have a crack at you. I think there's something else you need to hear, while you're being the best friends of workers. I would request your support on what I'm going to talk about now.


We're worried about 457-class visas, but let me tell you there's a bigger plague in this nation. Border protection are very well aware of this, because of the road safety inquiry that I chaired three years ago—I think that was when we put it up. Senator Williams is very supportive of our concerns here, because I wrote a report that was bipartisan. He's my co-chair. He's my partner in the work that we did here. I'll tell you where the problem is. The problem we have in this nation is the exploitation of the foreign visa system. This is where we really have to start concentrating. It should come as, and would not come as, a surprise in this chamber here that this started. There was an incident on the M5—I believe it's the highway in Sydney that goes under the airport—where a K&S B-double, on a Friday evening, pulled up. It shouldn't have been on there. It was over height. It couldn't get under the bridge. Fortunately, it's a very rare occurrence because most of our truckies are very well trained and traversed in where they should be and where they shouldn't be. The problem was that, when the RMS turned up and the police turned up, there were two drivers in the cab. One wouldn't get out of the cab and the other one got out and said that, between the pair of them, they couldn't back out the B-double. For those who aren't trucking operators like me, part of your training is having to actually back the bucket of nuts and bolts out. You have to be able to do that. You have to be able to couple it all up and take it off safely without it falling apart. Not only could they not back out the B-double but they couldn't uncouple the B-double so they could do a U-turn. We're talking about a company—K&S—that was one of the most respected companies in Australia when it was under the ownership of Allan Scott, a very, very decent employer. The RMS had to uncouple it while one driver refused to get out. Both of the drivers weren't Australian drivers; they were from overseas. Before anyone has a crack at me, I've made it very clear: this is not about attacking people from overseas; it's about attacking the mongrels who exploit our visa system, and they happen to be of the same race. They get them here, offer them a house and say, 'If you open your mouth, you're out and you're deported back.' That was bad enough.


What made it worse was that, when Senator O'Sullivan and I wrote to RMS and the police and asked, 'What happened when the truck was put back together?' they said they waved them goodbye and wished them safe travel to where they were going. The good folk of RMS and the police were only operating under the crappy laws they have in New South Wales. The minister at the time went missing. It was a man, and he got the 'big A', and then a woman took over. It was the same woman who thinks you should put electric shocks through steering wheels to keep truck drivers awake. I'm not making this stuff up.


Anyway, lo and behold, I was in Sydney last week. I had the pleasure of being with 500 transport workers at the TWU's New South Wales conference. There were 500 men and women in that room from all facets of the transport industry, whether it be road transport, warehousing, aviation or buses—it didn't matter; they all had the same objective: they want to be safe and they want other road users to be safe. That's great. I was informed of an accident at a place called Fairy Meadow. They tell me that Fairy Meadow is on the way to Wollongong. I don't know. But, to cut a long story short, there's a big hill, and a rigid truck came along at 7 o'clock in the morning. The rigid truck driver was a foreign truck driver. Anyway, the brakes failed through an intersection. Thank Christ, no-one was killed. He ploughed into a McDonald's car park. Can you imagine that, at 7 o'clock in the morning at McDonald's? Thank God, no-one was killed. There were a couple of people injured. Now Border Protection are involved because the driver, allegedly—are you ready for this; Senator Hanson, I'll need your help in the next parliament—was on a student visa. The investigation is on.


This mob are called Hari Om. Try to Google them and, if you can find out who they are, please help me out. They're a massive company in India and they've got some dealings here. They have 11 trucks here in New South Wales—one smashed up, of course. RMS grabbed the other 10. Every single one of them was defected. They were defected through bald tyres, seatbelts not working and brakes not working. I spoke to the head inspector of RMS today, and he told me that, of the 10 vehicles still on the road, six of them have been grounded. Hari Om, whoever the hell they are, nearly went broke a couple of times. There are notices of proposed deregistration from ASIC that I found from 2013 and 2016. They actually do a heck of a lot of work for Toll and TNT. In fact, I'm told they do more TNT.


One of the biggest problems we have in this nation is chain of responsibility. Senator O'Sullivan and I wrote a magnificent report after two years of hard work. I'm running out of time. I want to be very quick. One of the recommendations we addressed said:


The committee recommends that, if not adequately addressed through the recommendations of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection comprehensively review visa arrangements to address systematic or organised abuse in the transport industry.


Senator O'Sullivan and I addressed another recommendation, which said:


The committee recommends that all visa holders with heavy vehicle driving licences undergo driver skill tests before their heavy vehicle driving licences are recognised in Australia.


We said a lot more. We know there's a problem. We know that the visa system is being exploited. Like we said, we are seriously of the opinion that these poor devils are recruited from India, come over here—they may be studying something at university. They may come up with the cure for cancer—I don't know; I hope they do. They'll start doing part-time B-double operations between Brisbane and Sydney because they have nothing better to do, or drive trucks for this other company, Hari Om.


If we're going to get real serious, this is the squeeze on the supply chain. Let's make this very, very clear. You're not from trucking stock, but you have worked this out. If a transport company has bald tyres, they've got foreign drivers on student visas, their brakes aren't working and the seatbelts aren't working, yet they're the third link in the supply chain—no, they're the fourth. There's the customer, whoever the customers are. I'd love to know whose freight they're carting, because I'd love to contact the company and say, 'Did you know your freight's on the back of these buckets of crap?' That's the first thing I'd love to know. Then there's the transport company, being TNT—I'm told TNT is one of the worst, with this Hari Om. I'm ex-TNT, so that wouldn't surprise me. I became a unionist because of TNT, not because I was born one. They made me one, so I'm not going to let TNT off the hook. Then you have this other transport company—and I've spoken to the manager today—DSE, who subcontracts to the Indian, Hari Om. There are four in the supply chain, so what the heck are these people being paid, for crying out loud? Hari Om is exploiting the visa system, putting dangerous vehicles out on the road and trying to dodge the TWU. The TWU are now doing the investigation. Can you believe that? Border Protection is just checking on the visa and the immigration stuff. The TWU is out there wanting the time and wages, the safety management plans and the fatigue management plans. This is not the work of the TWU; this should be the government. You can't wait to put your claws in when taxing those from the transport industry. You steal 40 cents a litre off us in the fuel tax excise; it doesn't go back into the roads.


Senator Hanson, across the chamber to you and Senator Georgiou, this is a serious problem for our nation. It's not brand new. The supply chain is being squeezed. We all have children, grandchildren or allies out on the road. We want them to be safe. We have to absolutely work together to put a system in place where you cannot squeeze the supply chain. At the end of the day, the companies have to be responsible. It's all very well having a chain of responsibility and all very well having fatigue management, but, if you turn a blind eye as soon as something like this happens—you go and whack over the couple of truck drivers and you still let that rotten system go on—what the hell are we doing in terms of road safety, let alone protecting other road users and protecting a valuable industry that, I can tell you, is really highly disregarded in this building?


That is just one tiny little complaint—well, not tiny; it's not tiny. What I'm trying to say is that we wrote this report in good faith. This is a joint report from Senator O'Sullivan and myself. We presented an interim report. We tabled it on 3 May 2016. We took this damn seriously. We did a final report on October 2017. Since then, we've had three ministers. We've not even had a response to say, 'Hey, for crying out loud, not only must we make the roads safer for everyone on the roads but also, please, Border Force, get in there and tighten up on the exploitation of foreign workers.' It's not good enough to have these poor buggers being promised the world, brought out from other countries and employed by some grubby labour hire person who's from the same country who turns a blind eye—and TNT keeps employing these other ratbags.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2018-11-13,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (17:13):  It's always a pleasure to speak on these matters of reference put forward to the chamber by the Labor Party. Unlike the other speakers, I won't concentrate a lot on what the problems are, because I've got a solution. I think we should form—and I'm talking about the penalty rates—an independent commission. That's what we should do. We should form a commission completely independent of government. No government influence or input. Sit this commission way out of arm's reach of government. We'll allow them to make the decisions to meet the national interest tests and the industry tests. They can make the decisions around workers' terms and conditions, particularly around the application of penalty rates.


Of course, unfortunately for me, someone else thought of that before I did. The Australian Labor Party formed an independent commission at arm's length from government. There was no interference from government, either their government or the current coalition government. In 2009 the former Labor government put together the Fair Work Commission. That was their solution to this problem. Of course, as is the case with most things, when you've had a change of chairs, from opposition you will criticise the government of the day over these issues even though you were responsible for the architectural framework that was put in place to deal with such matters independently and completely at arm's length from the government.


When I realised that this wasn't an original thought, I thought I need to come up with another solution. Of course Labor's solution is to make Prime Minister the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Mr Shorten. Surely to God he'll look after the workers. Surely to God he'll make sure that penalty rates and terms and conditions are looked after. I thought I didn't capture it with my first thought, but I've captured it with my second. Surely having Mr Shorten put in charge of terms and conditions for workers, particularly around penalty rates, will get bipartisan support. Alas, when I raised that with my staff and advisers, they said: 'Hold on a minute, big feller. There's a problem with that too.' I said, 'What's the problem with that?' They said that the last time Bill Shorten was in charge of things like enterprise bargaining agreements—and Labor senators who take an interest in this should google 'Bill Shorten 1998 enterprise bargaining agreement'—




Senator Molan:
  AWU.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  'AWU'—it cost 5,000 workers more than $400 million in lost wages over a decade. I should sit down now. I've put forward two solutions. Both of them I imagine would be unacceptable to the Australian Labor Party. 


Of course, the burn on this is that the Australian Labor Party of my father's generation and of my youth was interested in workers. They were the ones who were interested in workers. They were the workers' party. I have said here before—and it's worth repeating—that my dear old dad was a devotee of the Labor Party. I have said before that he would punch his hand through his coffin lid tomorrow and mark their box, irrespective of who the candidate was. That was his and my mother's lifetime pattern of voting. But they were supporting a different Labor Party. They would not have supported a Labor Party who entered into enterprise bargaining agreements that cost 5,000 workers $400 million in lost wages over a decade. Of course, this conduct by Mr Shorten was repeated with employees of Target and Just Jeans. If you do the maths, the loss to workers through their terms and conditions, particularly around penalty rates, is probably by now in the order of $1 billion.


I will go back just to make a point on that. In 1999 the public holiday award rate for a level 1 cleaner was $36.38. That was reduced under that enterprise bargaining agreement to $16.28. They lost a clear $20 an hour. I don't want to reflect on cleaners—I myself have done a bit of that over time—but, if you want to identify a blue-collar worker who is working in not the most appealing job and who is probably lower on the socioeconomic strata than most other blue-collar workers, it would be the cleaners. How do you go to bed as a Labor man after you've reduced their public holiday award rate by $20.10? How does that work? How do you say to the workers, who have looked to that party for decades, 'Stick with us. We're the party of the people. We're the party of the workers, particularly blue collar workers and the like. Stick with us and we'll improve your terms and conditions of employment,' only to reduce them?


Let's recap on my two failed ideas. The first was thinking I'd have bipartisan support. The other was to establish a Fair Work Commission, and I must confess my ignorance to that until my staff alerted me to it. There is a Fair Work Commission that was put in place by the Australian Labor Party to be arm's length and to govern such matters. Now we hear in this place constantly their criticism of the independent commission, which they formed, because they're not happy with what's happening there. Now their alternative is, for the Australian people and Australian workers, to give Mr Shorten the top job. He'll fix this for you. He will see, in the blink of an eye, reductions in your wages, and it won't affect his sleeping patterns because he's got a long chronic history of doing just that.


Things have improved for workers in this country under this coalition government. I attach myself to some of the remarks of Senator Sterle. He was right about the incidents that we've talked about, and there's no question in my mind that there are issues around our 457 visa system that need to be tidied up, particularly in circumstances that he related. And there is exploitation of some workers under this system in agricultural industries, where the brokers who present them as a workforce treat some of them very poorly and, in fact, unlawfully. So I attach myself; I don't walk away from those remarks. I've been very vocal on it up to this point in time. I've made representations to the relevant ministers and I'm satisfied that the efforts that they have underway will eventually mitigate those circumstances.


But I've got to tell you: to have the Australian Labor Party come and start to lecture us on terms and conditions for workers in this country, when this government has provided so many more people with a job under Abbott and Turnbull—and I'm sure that will continue under Morrison, to fix an economy that was failing as a result of the legacies of the Australian Labor Party—I find it a bit rich. But I know why it's happening. I said in an earlier contribution today those opposite have got nothing else worthwhile to talk about; otherwise they wouldn't come in here with these subject matters and give us the opportunity to belt them around the ears. They've been done over twice today. It's because they've got no substantive issue that they find the government vulnerable on that we'd find difficult to defend. They've got nothing else to say, and the Australian people who are watching this—I hope they're all having a snooze and not spending their time watching the Senate—need to take note just as we have here today.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:23):  I also rise to make a contribution to this debate on this matter of public importance. I specifically want to talk about the need for governments as employers at all levels to stand up for workers and actually bargain in good faith, actually care about their workforce, about their wages, about their working conditions, their health and safety, and about them as people, as critical members of our communities delivering vital public services. For five long years here in Canberra and in my home state of Tasmania, we have endured Liberal governments that actively seek to undermine and undervalue the vital work of our public servants. Their key tactic is very low wage offers that would see workers' pay not keep up with inflation. And they use the threat of job losses if workers don't agree to their cruel requests. This appalling behaviour leaves many public servants in a bind: take a small wage increase, or take industrial action. 


I'm extremely proud of the thousands of public servants across Tasmania who joined their union and together pushed for fairness. Of course, under the current system, the odds are stacked against workers, and a desperate Liberal government will do whatever it takes. They launch highly personal attacks on our public servants. Show me a nurse who doesn't want to care for a patient, a teacher who doesn't want to inspire a student or a public servant who doesn't want to make sure that our government functions. It's so easy for a minister to issue a threatening statement, to misrepresent the situation and to attack the workers.


We've seen a lot of it lately in Tasmania—desperate ministers are playing the worker rather than trying to negotiate in good faith or even to bargain at all. The Tasmanian Liberal government copied the federal Liberal approach to public sector wages, setting an indefinite wage cap below inflation and refusing to negotiate. After years of wages going backwards and as negotiations stalled, Tasmanian public servants reluctantly launched some industrial action. When the Liberal government refused to negotiate, the public servants, rightly, increased their industrial action. So far, all we've seen are personal attacks and misrepresentation of the industrial action.


Just this week, the Tasmanian Liberal police minister, Mr Michael Ferguson, launched a bizarre and untrue attack on workers in Forensic Science Services Tasmania, inaccurately claiming that their measured and sensible industrial action would make Tasmania less safe and allow crooks to get off scot-free, with up to 15 criminals unable to be pursued by police each week. He then said that victims of crime would suffer the most from the union's tactics. Of course, the facts couldn't be further from this. The public servants then cleared up the matter: their industrial action would simply create a backlog which could at any time be resolved with additional resources allocated by the government. What a pathetic beat-up by a desperate government, out of touch with Tasmanians.


Of course, it doesn't end there. The Tasmanian police minister is also the Tasmanian health minister. He has overseen a health crisis that has plagued our state for years and he's refusing to bargain in good faith with our state's overworked and underpaid nurses and midwives, who have also been forced to take industrial action. This is action which, of course, limits activity in our state's hospitals and action which the minister should recognise is entirely within the rights of the nurses and midwives, and which he should seek to end by presenting a fair pay offer to Tasmanian public servants—not a pay offer which is hundreds of dollars a year below the inflation rate, not an offer which undermines Tasmania's ability to attract new nurses and not an offer that would make our nurses the lowest paid in the country when our cost of living continues to rise.


This pattern is repeated across the state, with teachers, nurses, firefighters, cleaners, paramedics and others taking reasonable action in pursuit of a decent pay rise. I commend Tasmanian union members for their unity, their courage and their camaraderie across the movement. I say firmly to the Tasmanian government: end this impasse, recognise that your offer is too low, come to the table with a fair deal and negotiate—and I mean negotiate fairly and equitably with those who the workers have chosen to represent them. Tasmanians who are public servants deserve a pay rise and they deserve a decent pay rise.

Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (17:28):  I rise to speak today on two of the three issues that are raised in this MPI: standing up for workers and tax breaks for workers. I will conclude this debate by making a number of points. I will talk about certain histories that go back certain years and, if I have time, I will certainly talk about the tax aspect.


A number of points that I will make really go to what Senator Abetz would have called an 'inconvenient fact'. In 1998, and when head of the Australian Workers Union, the AWU, Mr Bill Shorten signed an enterprise agreement with Cleanevent. We all know this. This saw around 5,000 workers lose as much as $400 million in wages according to The Australian newspaper. This deal saw Cleanevent employees signed up to the AWU membership unless they explicitly opted out. It turns out that up to 90 per cent of Cleanevent employees were added to the AWU membership rolls without necessarily knowing that this had occurred. This was, by any stretch of the imagination, a dirty deal between Cleanevent's management and Mr Bill Shorten's AWU, made at the expense of ordinary workers. It was done to reduce the wages for Cleanevent, who were paying cleaners well below what they were earning in rival companies, while Mr Shorten's AWU benefited from additional members, many of whom were signed up without their knowledge.


But it wasn't only in 1998 that we saw this happen; it wasn't only under Mr Bill Shorten's AWU that such dirty tricks occurred. In 2010, after Mr Paul Howes took over from Mr Bill Shorten as head of the union, the AWU:


… struck a deal with major cleaning contractor Cleanevent in 2010 to keep casual cleaners on lower rates of pay and save the company $1.5 million in salary costs, the commission heard on Monday.


In return, Cleanevent would pay the AWU $25,000 a year as membership fees for casual cleaners.


The Cleanevent senior executive who gave final sign-off on the agreement, Julianne Page, at first told the commission she could not explain why an email from the company's head of HR said the union would not agree to having a trade-off for lower wages listed in the same document as a payment for membership.


In a May, 2010 email to Ms Page, HR executive Michael Robinson wrote: ""It would be crazy for the union to put that down on a page and to be honest I wouldn't feel happy with it being on the same document either.""


Ms Page told the court she supposed it ""would look bad for the union"".


""It would look like it was some sort of payoff,"" she said.


… … …


Cleanevent employees were not told of the arrangement, the court heard, and it was not explained in a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding that bound workers to the lower rates of pay of a 2006 agreement.


They were also not told they had been signed up as union members, the court heard.


… … …


Internal Cleanevent emails tendered to the commission also show Mr Robinson discussing structuring pay rises to ""make the AWU look fantastic to their members"".


""If we agree to a 0% increase for these casuals and then give them a hit in year 2 and 3 the union can claim that because of their membership they went into bat for them and got them an increase, which will make the AWU look fantastic to their members and won't hurt your bottom line,"" Mr Robinson wrote to colleagues including Ms Page during discussion of the agreement.


The commission has heard previously that increased membership is an indicator of a successful union and can give it greater influence within the Australian Labor Party.


So is this standing up for workers? How do you go to bed as a Labor man doing this? Why does the Labor Party always attack every institution whose role it is to actually stand up for workers when unions act so appallingly?

Dear Mr President


I write with regard to questions I took on notice from Senator Carr during Question Time on Monday, 12 November 2018 on the matter of the Member for Dunkley's eligibility to sit in the House of Representatives.


The Australian Research Council grant that has been referred to in media reports and on which the Senator's question is based, is a grant to the University of Melbourne. It is not a grant to any company. Under the relevant grant program, universities partner with the private sector on research projects.


The private sector entities do not receive the grants; in fact, they have to contribute in cash or in-kind to the relevant research projects.


I have copied this letter to Senator Carr.

Dear Mr President


I write with regard to a question I took on notice from Senator Farrell during Question Time on Monday, 12 November 2018, regarding the publication of contracts from Tourism Australia on the AustTender website.


Tourism Australia's response to the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) Report of 2008 made clear that the contracts referred to by Senator Farrell were entered into in 2005 and 2006. I have been advised that the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines 2004 did not apply to Tourism Australia prior to 2005.


The obligation for publishing contracts on the AusTender website is the date the procurement commenced, not the date the contracts were entered into. The Department of Finance is working with Tourism Australia to determine when the procurement processes for the contracts in question commenced.


I have directed the Department of Finance to work with Tourism Australia to ensure that it understands the obligations that applied to the procurements in question. The Department of Finance will continue to assist Tourism Australia as required to meet their obligations.


It is important to note that the 2008 ANAO Report referred to by Senator Farrell did not raise any concerns relating to non-reporting of the contracts audited.


I have copied this letter to Senator Farrell.


Kind regards

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-11-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:58):  I move:




That the Migration (IMMI 18/019: Fast Track Applicant Class) Instrument 2018, made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed [F2018L00672].



This motion seeks to disallow an instrument that the government is attempting to make which would expand the group of people who are subject to the fast-track application process for protection as refugees. The definition of 'fast track applicant' is set out in the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014. The term currently includes all unauthorised maritime arrivals. That is, of course, the government's language, not that of the Australian Greens. That group of people are those who arrived by boat in Australia without a valid visa—and I make the observation that there is no offence under Australian law and that these people were acting entirely within their rights under international legal covenants that Australia has signed up to—between 13 August 2012 and 1 January 2014 and were not taken to Nauru or Papua New Guinea for offshore processing. I'm using the government's language here when describing it as 'offshore processing', as anyone who has been watching what has been happening on Manus Island and Nauru will be very clear in their minds that what these people are being subjected to on Manus Island and Nauru is in fact indefinite offshore detention. So the group of people that are currently classed as fast-track applicants had to arrive by boat without a valid visa between 13 August 2012 and 1 January 2014 and were not exiled to Manus Island or Nauru, provided that the minister has allowed them to apply for a protection visa and the person has made a valid application.


The minister can also, by instrument, extend the definition of 'fast-track' to other classes of people seeking asylum—and, in fact, that is exactly what this instrument that we are seeking to disallow today seeks to do. So, not content with the misery, the uncertainty and the injustice to which people who are classified as fast-track applicants have been subjected by this government, the minister now wants to cast his net even further back. The instrument that we're seeking to disallow would, if it were not disallowed, apply the category of 'fast-track applicant' to people seeking asylum who arrived in Australia by boat before 2012, were assessed by the department as not engaging Australia's protection obligations and then challenged the department's assessments in the courts. Now what the government is seeking to do is to deny them the opportunity to fully explore challenges to the department's decision in the legal system. This is a significant denial of natural justice.


The government's instrument that we're seeking to disallow today is not only a significant denial of natural justice but also an undermining of the rule of law in this country. It creates different classes of people in Australia—some who have access to certain legal options and others who do not. It continues the demonisation of people seeking asylum by the Liberal and National parties in this place in order to try to extract electoral and political benefit for themselves.


The Greens are not prepared to take this lying down. That is why we have moved this disallowance motion that we are currently debating. I can put our case to the Senate very clearly. People who end up in the fast-track process are not given a fair opportunity to put forward their case for asylum and to deal with adverse information affecting their application. The fast-track process limits people's right to appeal adverse findings to the Immigration Assessment Authority—which, as Legal Aid Victoria said last year:


Rather than being focussed on providing fairness to people seeking asylum, and on making correct decisions, the IAA can conduct only limited review according to limiting rules.


This is creating situations where people seeking asylum are blindsided by issues and evidence which they had no idea they needed to deal with. And these are profoundly disadvantaged people, in desperate need, colliding with an extremely complex area of law.


That's a neat summary of what the government is trying to do here: to make decisions that adversely affect some of the most disadvantaged people in our country, who are in desperate need and have been enmeshed in an extremely complex area of administrative law. Ultimately, in the view of the Australian Greens, the fast-track process has been set up by a government and ministers who simply don't want people to have a fair chance to apply for asylum in Australia.


We have seen the human costs of this government's policy around people seeking asylum. We know that thousands of innocent people who are guilty of nothing other than fleeing persecution and seeking a better life for themselves, the overwhelming majority of whom have been found to be genuine refugees, have been exiled to Manus Island and Nauru for over five years now. Over five years of their lives have been lost because of this cruel, horrendous policy that has created a humanitarian calamity in our offshore detention system. We've seen murders, assaults, sexual assaults, sexual assaults of children, riots, abuses and the trampling of human rights. This is a humanitarian calamity that is occurring in our offshore detention system. Those who were not exiled to Manus Island or Nauru have progressively had their rights eroded.


The Greens don't support any element of the fast-track process, because we think people in this country should have equal access to the law. You wouldn't think that's a controversial position, but it is for the Liberal and National parties in this place, who want to create two classes of people in this country and two different opportunities to access justice through our administrative and legal system. At every step the Liberals have reduced rights of appeal and procedural fairness and have increased the power of the minister for immigration. They're doing this because the courts are doing a far better job of ensuring human rights are respected in this country than this government ever has. It's an ongoing demonisation of innocent and vulnerable people.


We are seeking to draw a line in the sand tonight and say: 'Enough is enough. You cannot simply go on making more and more punitive laws to deny more and more people access to justice and the rule of law.' The government doesn't like what the courts are doing here. It's worth pointing out that the overwhelming majority of the children who in the last couple of months have been brought from Nauru haven't been brought out of the goodness of the heart of the government, the minister or the Prime Minister; they've been brought here because the courts ordered it. The courts made those decisions and the government had no option other than to comply with those orders and rulings.


We know that there are still $20,000 bribes on the table to try to convince people who were on Manus Island and Nauru to return to face the persecution from which they fled. The Liberals are currently trying to deport people back to North Korea, would you believe it? They've continually sent people fleeing war and persecution straight back to their home countries. In some cases they've handed these people straight into the arms of their persecutors, the people whom they fled, and this government sends them back to goodness knows what fate.


We know that the Liberals want the power to deport children so they can continue to run the racist scare campaign that they're currently running in Victoria. It is worth pointing out that the instrument that we are seeking to disallow here confirms that children of people the government has classified as fast-track applicants will also be deemed fast-track applicants. This instrument that we are seeking to disallow denies children access to natural justice in this country. What the government is trying to do here is an absolute disgrace. It is trying to create a legal framework which supports its own prejudices and its hateful world view.


We are proud to stand against the government this evening. We led the fight in parliament against the Liberals' attempts to reintroduce the White Australia policy by stealth. It was a battle that we won. For the first time in many years the government lost control of the Notice Paper in this place, and the then minister for immigration's hateful changes to the citizenship act were struck from the Notice Paper in this place. We stood up and helped lead the charge against the government when it tried to water down protections against race based hate speech in this country by eviscerating section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We defeated its attempts to restrict family reunion visas to the very wealthy. We will keep on fighting this government until it is thrown out of office and these dreadful laws are struck from the statute book in this country.


If senators want to think about why they should support this disallowance motion this evening—it may come to a vote this evening or it may come to a vote tomorrow evening—I invite them to think about their values. If senators have got values about treating people equally, if senators have got values that support the rule of law as one of the absolute foundations of our civilisation and our society and if senators have got values around respecting people's human rights and treating people as they would wish to be treated themselves, then I invite them in the strongest possible terms to support this disallowance motion.


We as a parliament cannot continue to remove rights from desperate people, from vulnerable people, just because some people in this place think it will deliver them an electoral benefit. We cannot continue to remove fairness from our administrative and judicial systems. We cannot continue to create situations where vulnerable, desperate people are blindsided in the Immigration Assessment Authority by issues and evidence that they had no idea they needed to deal with. We cannot continue to profoundly disadvantage people who, in their hour of desperate need and vulnerability, collide with this extremely complex area of law. People in the fast-track process are not given a fair opportunity to put forward their case for asylum, and they're not given a fair opportunity to deal with the adverse information affecting their application.


The Australian Greens, in putting forward this disallowance motion today, are standing up for some of the most vulnerable, desperate and disenfranchised people who are currently in our country. If you don't look after the vulnerable, if you don't look after the disenfranchised, if you don't look after the desperate, that actually says more about you than it does about them. We want to give this Senate, when this comes to a vote this evening or tomorrow evening, the opportunity to show that the values that so many people claim as Australian—the values of a fair go, of mateship and of reaching out a helping hand to people who are in desperate need of help—are genuinely Australian values and values that are reflected in the parliament, which is here to represent the values of the Australian people and to make sure those values are reflected in our laws and our legislative instruments. That's why we bring on this disallowance tonight: so that every senator has an opportunity to do the right thing and every senator is given every opportunity to make sure that those values are real, true and reflected not just through Australian society but right into this building, into this chamber and into the heart of our democratic system. If we don't reflect those values in here, what does it say about us? I'll tell you what it says about us if we don't reflect those values; it says we're hypocrites and we're not doing our job to represent our nation's values.


There was a time, decades ago, when Australia was a shining light around the world for our global leadership on human rights. We have seen that consistently eroded. We saw that eroded in 2001 when the Tampa hovered over the horizon and, since then, it has been a race to the bottom in this place to try and deny as many desperate, vulnerable people as possible the legal rights that the rest of us enjoy.


We're not going to have a bar of it. We're standing here today and we are drawing a line in the sand. We are saying: 'Enough is enough. Stop demonising some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Stop trying to exploit desperate, vulnerable people for political gain. Stop trying to deny them the appeal opportunities and the review opportunities that the rest of us are lucky enough to have. Stop trying to undermine the rule of law in this country—one of the absolute foundations of our society. Stop trying to work around the courts because you simply don't like the decisions that they're making.' We're not going to stand up to reduce rights of appeal. We're not going to allow this reduction of procedural fairness to occur without fighting it all the way. We're going to stand up and we're going to give this Senate the opportunity to show that we can be better than what the government would like us to be.


We are here to hold this government to account; that is a core part of our job in this place. This vote will be an opportunity for senators to show whether they are prepared to stand up and hold this government to account or whether we are collectively going to roll over and allow this government, in its ongoing demonisation of desperate and vulnerable people who are seeking asylum in this country, to increase the group of people who will have their rights trampled by reducing their opportunities to challenge decisions made by the department with regard to their claims for asylum. I genuinely hope senators will join with the Australian Greens to disallow this instrument.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:19):  I just wish to indicate to the chamber Labor will be supporting this motion. On 5 December 2014, the parliament passed legislation to create what has now been labelled the fast-track assessment process for the protection of visa applications, and this legislation came into effect on 19 April 2015. The fast-track assessment process only applies to the legacy caseload, specifically people who arrived in Australia on or after 13 August 2012 and before 1 January 2014 who have not previously been in a regional processing country. The fast-track assessment process uses a review body which was established by the then Abbott government called the Immigration Assessment Authority—otherwise known as the IAA. 


The review body effectively limits the extent to which a claim for protection can be reviewed, especially compared to the previous review mechanism under the Refugee Review Tribunal. We should be clear about this: the successive Liberal governments have failed to treat asylum seekers and refugees living in a shared Australian community with the respect that they deserve. Asylum seekers and refugees are some of the most vulnerable people living in Australia. They have fled persecution, and that's the definition by which they are determined to be refugees. They have faced trauma and torment. With this instrument, this conservative government is trying to force more people who are part of the so-called legacy caseload into the fast-track process.


The government has provided information that the instrument before the Senate effectively affects approximately 108 individuals. It strikes me that this demonstrates that the government is completely out of touch. By forcing more people into the process which limits their rights to have their claims for protection reviewed, the government actually is undermining some pretty fundamental principles of human rights here. This instrument has done nothing with Australia's border security; these are individuals who are already in Australia.


So Labor took a commitment to the last election, as outlined in our national platform, that Labor would abolish the fast-track assessment process. Our national platform also makes it clear the existing fast-track assessment process under the auspices of the Immigration Assessment Authority and the limitation of appeal rights do not provide a fair, thorough and robust assessment process for persons seeking asylum. Labor is committed to ensuring these people found to be owed protection are treated with dignity and respect.


People who have been through the fast-track process and who are found to be owed protection have been placed on temporary protection visas by the current government. A temporary protection visa places refugees in an ongoing state of uncertainty and of limbo as they have their claims reassessed every three years. This prevents meaningful settlement and creates hardships for refugees. It actually denies Australia the benefit of their contribution to our society and to their communities. So Labor has announced that in government we will abolish the temporary protection visas and will place those on TPVs and found to be genuine refugees onto a permanent protection visa so they can be afforded the protection and certainty that they are entitled to in this country. Labor also took to the last election this policy to reinstate access to the Refugee Review Tribunal and abolish the IAA established by the Abbott government.


I note that the instrument was signed by Minister Dutton on 23 May 2018. This was when Minister Dutton was Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection but before he made that abortive attempt to actually engage in a coup against Prime Minister Turnbull. Let's not forget of course that there was considerable as to whether or not Mr Dutton was even qualified to sit in the parliament, and there still remains considerable doubt even today. That casts legal doubt over the decisions he made as a minister, from cancelling the visas for those actually involved in serious crimes to the signing of such instruments. And so it is apparent that the member's position ought to have been resolved by due process through the legal processes established by the High Court. So I make it clear: Labor will be supporting this disallowance motion.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:24):  I will be brief. I want to firstly acknowledge and thank the Australian Labor Party for their support for this disallowance. I believe that that means that in fact this disallowance will be successful this evening. I want to put very clearly on the record that, in voting for this disallowance, this Senate is actually doing its job to scrutinise the government. That's one of the primary reasons we get voted into this place: to hold the government to account and make sure that when the government overreaches, which they flagrantly have in trying to put this instrument through the parliament, we exercise our rights as senators to say: 'Stop. Enough is enough. You've gone too far.' 


The government has tried to go too far, and the Senate is about to stand up to it and make it very clear to the government that enough is enough. This demonisation, this exploitation of desperate, vulnerable people, has to stop. I hope that in drawing this line in the sand today, which will ensure that life does not get even more difficult for a large number of people who are currently resident in this country, we can see some ongoing improvements in the way that we deal with people who seek asylum in Australia—because one day there will be a reckoning for the way we've treated these people. There will be a reckoning for what's happened on Manus Island. There will be a reckoning for what's happened on Nauru. I'm very confident that there will be a royal commission one day into what's happened on Manus Island and Nauru and the way we've treated people seeking asylum in this country and that when that royal commission is concluded the Australian PM of the day will get up and offer a heartfelt apology for what we've done. Unfortunately, I think it will take the passage of a bit of time before that happens, because the architects of offshore detention—they are in both major parties in this place—will have to leave this parliament before we can come to our collective senses, get the truth out, have the royal commission, make our apologies and hopefully do everything we can to make sure that this shameful period in our country's history never happens again.


We are better than what we have shown over the last 20 years in regard to people who are seeking asylum in this country. We are better than what we have shown over the last 20 years to some of the world's most desperate and vulnerable people. I genuinely believe that support for the way we deal with people seeking asylum is eroding in our community right now. It's eroding because of the kids on Nauru. It's eroding because people in our community are becoming more and more aware of the humanitarian calamity of offshore detention and the denial of basic rights and natural justice to people who are seeking asylum while domiciled in this country. So I thank the Australian Labor Party, I thank the crossbenchers, who I understand are about to support this disallowance, and I commend it to the Senate. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, standing in the name of Senator McKim, be agreed to.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:58):  I move:




That the Migration (IMMI 18/019: Fast Track Applicant Class) Instrument 2018, made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed [F2018L00672].



This motion seeks to disallow an instrument that the government is attempting to make which would expand the group of people who are subject to the fast-track application process for protection as refugees. The definition of 'fast track applicant' is set out in the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014. The term currently includes all unauthorised maritime arrivals. That is, of course, the government's language, not that of the Australian Greens. That group of people are those who arrived by boat in Australia without a valid visa—and I make the observation that there is no offence under Australian law and that these people were acting entirely within their rights under international legal covenants that Australia has signed up to—between 13 August 2012 and 1 January 2014 and were not taken to Nauru or Papua New Guinea for offshore processing. I'm using the government's language here when describing it as 'offshore processing', as anyone who has been watching what has been happening on Manus Island and Nauru will be very clear in their minds that what these people are being subjected to on Manus Island and Nauru is in fact indefinite offshore detention. So the group of people that are currently classed as fast-track applicants had to arrive by boat without a valid visa between 13 August 2012 and 1 January 2014 and were not exiled to Manus Island or Nauru, provided that the minister has allowed them to apply for a protection visa and the person has made a valid application.


The minister can also, by instrument, extend the definition of 'fast-track' to other classes of people seeking asylum—and, in fact, that is exactly what this instrument that we are seeking to disallow today seeks to do. So, not content with the misery, the uncertainty and the injustice to which people who are classified as fast-track applicants have been subjected by this government, the minister now wants to cast his net even further back. The instrument that we're seeking to disallow would, if it were not disallowed, apply the category of 'fast-track applicant' to people seeking asylum who arrived in Australia by boat before 2012, were assessed by the department as not engaging Australia's protection obligations and then challenged the department's assessments in the courts. Now what the government is seeking to do is to deny them the opportunity to fully explore challenges to the department's decision in the legal system. This is a significant denial of natural justice.


The government's instrument that we're seeking to disallow today is not only a significant denial of natural justice but also an undermining of the rule of law in this country. It creates different classes of people in Australia—some who have access to certain legal options and others who do not. It continues the demonisation of people seeking asylum by the Liberal and National parties in this place in order to try to extract electoral and political benefit for themselves.


The Greens are not prepared to take this lying down. That is why we have moved this disallowance motion that we are currently debating. I can put our case to the Senate very clearly. People who end up in the fast-track process are not given a fair opportunity to put forward their case for asylum and to deal with adverse information affecting their application. The fast-track process limits people's right to appeal adverse findings to the Immigration Assessment Authority—which, as Legal Aid Victoria said last year:


Rather than being focussed on providing fairness to people seeking asylum, and on making correct decisions, the IAA can conduct only limited review according to limiting rules.


This is creating situations where people seeking asylum are blindsided by issues and evidence which they had no idea they needed to deal with. And these are profoundly disadvantaged people, in desperate need, colliding with an extremely complex area of law.


That's a neat summary of what the government is trying to do here: to make decisions that adversely affect some of the most disadvantaged people in our country, who are in desperate need and have been enmeshed in an extremely complex area of administrative law. Ultimately, in the view of the Australian Greens, the fast-track process has been set up by a government and ministers who simply don't want people to have a fair chance to apply for asylum in Australia.


We have seen the human costs of this government's policy around people seeking asylum. We know that thousands of innocent people who are guilty of nothing other than fleeing persecution and seeking a better life for themselves, the overwhelming majority of whom have been found to be genuine refugees, have been exiled to Manus Island and Nauru for over five years now. Over five years of their lives have been lost because of this cruel, horrendous policy that has created a humanitarian calamity in our offshore detention system. We've seen murders, assaults, sexual assaults, sexual assaults of children, riots, abuses and the trampling of human rights. This is a humanitarian calamity that is occurring in our offshore detention system. Those who were not exiled to Manus Island or Nauru have progressively had their rights eroded.


The Greens don't support any element of the fast-track process, because we think people in this country should have equal access to the law. You wouldn't think that's a controversial position, but it is for the Liberal and National parties in this place, who want to create two classes of people in this country and two different opportunities to access justice through our administrative and legal system. At every step the Liberals have reduced rights of appeal and procedural fairness and have increased the power of the minister for immigration. They're doing this because the courts are doing a far better job of ensuring human rights are respected in this country than this government ever has. It's an ongoing demonisation of innocent and vulnerable people.


We are seeking to draw a line in the sand tonight and say: 'Enough is enough. You cannot simply go on making more and more punitive laws to deny more and more people access to justice and the rule of law.' The government doesn't like what the courts are doing here. It's worth pointing out that the overwhelming majority of the children who in the last couple of months have been brought from Nauru haven't been brought out of the goodness of the heart of the government, the minister or the Prime Minister; they've been brought here because the courts ordered it. The courts made those decisions and the government had no option other than to comply with those orders and rulings.


We know that there are still $20,000 bribes on the table to try to convince people who were on Manus Island and Nauru to return to face the persecution from which they fled. The Liberals are currently trying to deport people back to North Korea, would you believe it? They've continually sent people fleeing war and persecution straight back to their home countries. In some cases they've handed these people straight into the arms of their persecutors, the people whom they fled, and this government sends them back to goodness knows what fate.


We know that the Liberals want the power to deport children so they can continue to run the racist scare campaign that they're currently running in Victoria. It is worth pointing out that the instrument that we are seeking to disallow here confirms that children of people the government has classified as fast-track applicants will also be deemed fast-track applicants. This instrument that we are seeking to disallow denies children access to natural justice in this country. What the government is trying to do here is an absolute disgrace. It is trying to create a legal framework which supports its own prejudices and its hateful world view.


We are proud to stand against the government this evening. We led the fight in parliament against the Liberals' attempts to reintroduce the White Australia policy by stealth. It was a battle that we won. For the first time in many years the government lost control of the Notice Paper in this place, and the then minister for immigration's hateful changes to the citizenship act were struck from the Notice Paper in this place. We stood up and helped lead the charge against the government when it tried to water down protections against race based hate speech in this country by eviscerating section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We defeated its attempts to restrict family reunion visas to the very wealthy. We will keep on fighting this government until it is thrown out of office and these dreadful laws are struck from the statute book in this country.


If senators want to think about why they should support this disallowance motion this evening—it may come to a vote this evening or it may come to a vote tomorrow evening—I invite them to think about their values. If senators have got values about treating people equally, if senators have got values that support the rule of law as one of the absolute foundations of our civilisation and our society and if senators have got values around respecting people's human rights and treating people as they would wish to be treated themselves, then I invite them in the strongest possible terms to support this disallowance motion.


We as a parliament cannot continue to remove rights from desperate people, from vulnerable people, just because some people in this place think it will deliver them an electoral benefit. We cannot continue to remove fairness from our administrative and judicial systems. We cannot continue to create situations where vulnerable, desperate people are blindsided in the Immigration Assessment Authority by issues and evidence that they had no idea they needed to deal with. We cannot continue to profoundly disadvantage people who, in their hour of desperate need and vulnerability, collide with this extremely complex area of law. People in the fast-track process are not given a fair opportunity to put forward their case for asylum, and they're not given a fair opportunity to deal with the adverse information affecting their application.


The Australian Greens, in putting forward this disallowance motion today, are standing up for some of the most vulnerable, desperate and disenfranchised people who are currently in our country. If you don't look after the vulnerable, if you don't look after the disenfranchised, if you don't look after the desperate, that actually says more about you than it does about them. We want to give this Senate, when this comes to a vote this evening or tomorrow evening, the opportunity to show that the values that so many people claim as Australian—the values of a fair go, of mateship and of reaching out a helping hand to people who are in desperate need of help—are genuinely Australian values and values that are reflected in the parliament, which is here to represent the values of the Australian people and to make sure those values are reflected in our laws and our legislative instruments. That's why we bring on this disallowance tonight: so that every senator has an opportunity to do the right thing and every senator is given every opportunity to make sure that those values are real, true and reflected not just through Australian society but right into this building, into this chamber and into the heart of our democratic system. If we don't reflect those values in here, what does it say about us? I'll tell you what it says about us if we don't reflect those values; it says we're hypocrites and we're not doing our job to represent our nation's values.


There was a time, decades ago, when Australia was a shining light around the world for our global leadership on human rights. We have seen that consistently eroded. We saw that eroded in 2001 when the Tampa hovered over the horizon and, since then, it has been a race to the bottom in this place to try and deny as many desperate, vulnerable people as possible the legal rights that the rest of us enjoy.


We're not going to have a bar of it. We're standing here today and we are drawing a line in the sand. We are saying: 'Enough is enough. Stop demonising some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Stop trying to exploit desperate, vulnerable people for political gain. Stop trying to deny them the appeal opportunities and the review opportunities that the rest of us are lucky enough to have. Stop trying to undermine the rule of law in this country—one of the absolute foundations of our society. Stop trying to work around the courts because you simply don't like the decisions that they're making.' We're not going to stand up to reduce rights of appeal. We're not going to allow this reduction of procedural fairness to occur without fighting it all the way. We're going to stand up and we're going to give this Senate the opportunity to show that we can be better than what the government would like us to be.


We are here to hold this government to account; that is a core part of our job in this place. This vote will be an opportunity for senators to show whether they are prepared to stand up and hold this government to account or whether we are collectively going to roll over and allow this government, in its ongoing demonisation of desperate and vulnerable people who are seeking asylum in this country, to increase the group of people who will have their rights trampled by reducing their opportunities to challenge decisions made by the department with regard to their claims for asylum. I genuinely hope senators will join with the Australian Greens to disallow this instrument.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:18):  I have a short statement on behalf of the senator responsible for government business. The government is aiming to resolve the legal error in the previous administrative protection assessments in a way that will facilitate status resolution activities and ensure removal can be affected in a timely manner where an unauthorised maritime arrival is found not to engage Australia's protection obligations.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:19):  I just wish to indicate to the chamber Labor will be supporting this motion. On 5 December 2014, the parliament passed legislation to create what has now been labelled the fast-track assessment process for the protection of visa applications, and this legislation came into effect on 19 April 2015. The fast-track assessment process only applies to the legacy caseload, specifically people who arrived in Australia on or after 13 August 2012 and before 1 January 2014 who have not previously been in a regional processing country. The fast-track assessment process uses a review body which was established by the then Abbott government called the Immigration Assessment Authority—otherwise known as the IAA. 


The review body effectively limits the extent to which a claim for protection can be reviewed, especially compared to the previous review mechanism under the Refugee Review Tribunal. We should be clear about this: the successive Liberal governments have failed to treat asylum seekers and refugees living in a shared Australian community with the respect that they deserve. Asylum seekers and refugees are some of the most vulnerable people living in Australia. They have fled persecution, and that's the definition by which they are determined to be refugees. They have faced trauma and torment. With this instrument, this conservative government is trying to force more people who are part of the so-called legacy caseload into the fast-track process.


The government has provided information that the instrument before the Senate effectively affects approximately 108 individuals. It strikes me that this demonstrates that the government is completely out of touch. By forcing more people into the process which limits their rights to have their claims for protection reviewed, the government actually is undermining some pretty fundamental principles of human rights here. This instrument has done nothing with Australia's border security; these are individuals who are already in Australia.


So Labor took a commitment to the last election, as outlined in our national platform, that Labor would abolish the fast-track assessment process. Our national platform also makes it clear the existing fast-track assessment process under the auspices of the Immigration Assessment Authority and the limitation of appeal rights do not provide a fair, thorough and robust assessment process for persons seeking asylum. Labor is committed to ensuring these people found to be owed protection are treated with dignity and respect.


People who have been through the fast-track process and who are found to be owed protection have been placed on temporary protection visas by the current government. A temporary protection visa places refugees in an ongoing state of uncertainty and of limbo as they have their claims reassessed every three years. This prevents meaningful settlement and creates hardships for refugees. It actually denies Australia the benefit of their contribution to our society and to their communities. So Labor has announced that in government we will abolish the temporary protection visas and will place those on TPVs and found to be genuine refugees onto a permanent protection visa so they can be afforded the protection and certainty that they are entitled to in this country. Labor also took to the last election this policy to reinstate access to the Refugee Review Tribunal and abolish the IAA established by the Abbott government.


I note that the instrument was signed by Minister Dutton on 23 May 2018. This was when Minister Dutton was Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection but before he made that abortive attempt to actually engage in a coup against Prime Minister Turnbull. Let's not forget of course that there was considerable as to whether or not Mr Dutton was even qualified to sit in the parliament, and there still remains considerable doubt even today. That casts legal doubt over the decisions he made as a minister, from cancelling the visas for those actually involved in serious crimes to the signing of such instruments. And so it is apparent that the member's position ought to have been resolved by due process through the legal processes established by the High Court. So I make it clear: Labor will be supporting this disallowance motion.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-11-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:24):  I will be brief. I want to firstly acknowledge and thank the Australian Labor Party for their support for this disallowance. I believe that that means that in fact this disallowance will be successful this evening. I want to put very clearly on the record that, in voting for this disallowance, this Senate is actually doing its job to scrutinise the government. That's one of the primary reasons we get voted into this place: to hold the government to account and make sure that when the government overreaches, which they flagrantly have in trying to put this instrument through the parliament, we exercise our rights as senators to say: 'Stop. Enough is enough. You've gone too far.' 


The government has tried to go too far, and the Senate is about to stand up to it and make it very clear to the government that enough is enough. This demonisation, this exploitation of desperate, vulnerable people, has to stop. I hope that in drawing this line in the sand today, which will ensure that life does not get even more difficult for a large number of people who are currently resident in this country, we can see some ongoing improvements in the way that we deal with people who seek asylum in Australia—because one day there will be a reckoning for the way we've treated these people. There will be a reckoning for what's happened on Manus Island. There will be a reckoning for what's happened on Nauru. I'm very confident that there will be a royal commission one day into what's happened on Manus Island and Nauru and the way we've treated people seeking asylum in this country and that when that royal commission is concluded the Australian PM of the day will get up and offer a heartfelt apology for what we've done. Unfortunately, I think it will take the passage of a bit of time before that happens, because the architects of offshore detention—they are in both major parties in this place—will have to leave this parliament before we can come to our collective senses, get the truth out, have the royal commission, make our apologies and hopefully do everything we can to make sure that this shameful period in our country's history never happens again.


We are better than what we have shown over the last 20 years in regard to people who are seeking asylum in this country. We are better than what we have shown over the last 20 years to some of the world's most desperate and vulnerable people. I genuinely believe that support for the way we deal with people seeking asylum is eroding in our community right now. It's eroding because of the kids on Nauru. It's eroding because people in our community are becoming more and more aware of the humanitarian calamity of offshore detention and the denial of basic rights and natural justice to people who are seeking asylum while domiciled in this country. So I thank the Australian Labor Party, I thank the crossbenchers, who I understand are about to support this disallowance, and I commend it to the Senate. 



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, standing in the name of Senator McKim, be agreed to.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-11-13,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (18:36):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Prime Minister Morrison is due to visit Darwin at the end of this week, and I certainly urge him to make sure that he has a copy of the city deal in his back pocket, ready to go. In May 2017, the Northern Territory government and the federal government signed an MOU for a city deal for Darwin. That's 18 months ago. The Townsville City Deal was signed after just one month and the Launceston City Deal was signed in seven months. There was not a cent in this year's budget for the Darwin City Deal, and it shows the lack of vision, support and foresight this government has for the future of the Northern Territory and, indeed, for northern Australia.


The mantra of developing the north seems to have been abandoned by the Morrison government. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund is really nowhere to be seen for the number of organisations and businesses that have put forward their hopes and expectations for assistance in the north. The glossy reports, the big promises, the ideas and the time and energy that stakeholders took in putting forward their projects, knowledge and enthusiasm to see northern Australia reach its full potential seem to have fallen by the wayside.


It takes more than a quick drive in a big blue bus to gain some serious insight and understanding of what needs to be done to stimulate the entirety of our north, let alone the Northern Territory. No-one wants to go cap in hand to the Commonwealth, seeking assistance, but there is no doubt that Commonwealth assistance will be required to restore the Territory's fiscal capacity. There are options that I submit need to be examined seriously around the relativity floor and excluding from Commonwealth Grants Commission processes the funding needed to address Aboriginal disadvantage, to address infrastructure deficits and to support enabling infrastructure to develop the north. The Commonwealth could look at the possibility of increased funding to the National Partnership on Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment and at using that avenue to provide capital for additional services to people living in remote communities in the Northern Territory. That would take a lot of pressure off the Northern Territory government's budget.


The Commonwealth's own projections indicate that this much-needed certainty for the Northern Territory is unlikely to be much of a cost burden. However, it would go a long way to restoring confidence in the Northern Territory, with the people of the Territory feeling the full effect of some of the biggest economic and fiscal challenges that the Territory has ever seen.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2018-11-13,"



Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:39):  It's hard to know where to start. Just 12 months ago I stood in exactly the same seat to introduce a private senator's bill that led to the introduction of same-sex marriage. Over the last few years as a senator for Western Australia, I've committed myself to the resolution of a number of issues that I have considered important not just to the make-up of our country but also to the future direction of Western Australia. I'm particularly proud to be able to stand here today as a member of the coalition government led by Scott Morrison, who was the Treasurer not so long ago, and to almost bring to a close this debate about legislation that will bring reform to the goods and services distribution arrangements in Australia and, in doing so, mark perhaps one of the most significant reforms to federal-state financial relations that the country has seen.


Before I provide a brief overview of the long campaign, the long road that has been GST distribution reform in this country, I thought I might just detail exactly what it is that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 seeks to do. This bill will amend the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 to give effect to key elements of the government's interim response to the Productivity Commission's inquiry report Horizontal fiscal equalisation. The key elements of the government's interim response include: transitioning the horizontal fiscal equalisation system from full equalisation, equalised to the strongest state or territory, to reasonable equalisation, equalised to the stronger of New South Wales and Victoria; introducing a minimum goods and service tax revenue-sharing relativity—or the GST relativity floor, as it's known—that may be determined by the Treasurer for any individual state or territory; and permanently boosting the GST revenue pool with additional Commonwealth financial assistance. The following elements of the government's interim response are given effect under existing laws: providing short-term transition payments to any state or territory with a GST revenue-sharing relativity factor below 0.7; and providing short-term transition payments to the Northern Territory if its revenue-sharing relativity falls below its determined relativity factor for 2017-18. The bill introduces a guarantee that each state and territory will get the better of the current distribution system and the updated distribution system during the transition period.


In the six years that I have been a senator, I think there have probably only been two moments more significant than this in shaping the framework of Australia's federal system of government. One, I would argue—others might differ—was the reforms to the Senate voting system that were introduced and agreed by the Senate in advance of the 2016 federal election. Of course, for those of us that can remember, it was the opposition that some coalition senators led to the Rudd plan to amend the Commonwealth Constitution to provide recognition for local government. That was a debate that raged inside the coalition under the leadership of Tony Abbott first. It was a debate that we had in this Senate chamber. If I recall correctly, eight coalition senators, including me, opposed that referendum proposition on the basis that it would undermine the federal nature of our system of government, not enhance it.


The debate that has been raging in regard to the GST distribution arrangements as they affect Western Australia is not a new one. What demonstrates the shallowness of Labor's understanding of this issue thus far is that they have failed to recognise the contribution of one important person, the person who called out this issue first in 2007. That was none other than Eric Ripper, the Labor Treasurer of the Western Australian state government at the time. The Hansard in the Western Australian parliamentary record makes it very clear that he drew the attention of Western Australians to this issue first. Then, over the next 10 to 11 years, the level of understanding and the level of anxiety started to grow in our home state of Western Australia because it dawned on Western Australians, at a time of tremendous growth in our state, that the GST system wasn't allowing Western Australia to be the best and strongest it could be.


Coalition senators, aided and supported by people like Colin Barnett and—I'll be the first to admit; I'm happy to say this—the chorus of Western Australians that built over the last number of years from Kununurra to Esperance in the north and the south out across to Perth and Kalbarri and all the suburbs in between, led this and deserve to have the fullest recognition given them for standing firm, standing strong and making sure that their voices were heard very loudly both in this Senate chamber and in the government at the time. John Howard himself has made it crystal clear that, while people absolutely expected there to be fluctuations in the GST distribution arrangements and the relativities that were borne out of that over time, no-one foresaw the magnitude of the variances that the GST distribution system would deliver and no-one could foresee the magnitude of the GST relativity as it would affect Western Australia during a time of tremendous economic activity.


It's worth reminding people of those relativities, which were most recently announced by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and approved by the government, and reflecting on them. It takes tremendous courage for senators from the Northern Territory and Tasmania to come into this Senate chamber and argue GST distribution issues, because the system quite rightly provides the most generous arrangements for them. What did the GST relativities in the most recent announcements mean for our country? For New South Wales the relativity fell from 88c to 86c in the dollar, but that still meant that New South Wales would get $18 billion, or 27.4 per cent of the GST pool. For Victoria the GST relativity meant that it would rise from 93c to 99c, meaning Victoria would get $16.8 billion, or 25.6 per cent of the GST pool. The Northern Territory is taking home $4.26, Tasmania $1.77, South Australia $1.48, the ACT $1.18, Queensland $1.10 and my home state of Western Australia went from 34c cents to 47c, meaning a GST revenue of $3.3 billion, or 4.9 per cent.


That's worth reminding ourselves of, because what makes this particular initiative so profound is that, when this debate started, much of the hand-wringing revolved around that almost intractable issue: how do you correct a very obvious anomaly in the GST distribution arrangements which left Western Australia with just 30c in the dollar without unnecessarily penalising other states and territories? It's a great testament to the creative thinking of Treasury officials and of this government that they were able to craft a solution that not only benefits Western Australia to the tune of $4.7 billion but also leaves no state worse off and has left many states in a slightly better position. When this debate started, that was an impossible dream, but since then over time we've seen some hard-headedness and persistence on the part of Western Australians and a willingness on the part of Scott Morrison as Treasurer and as Prime Minister to make sure this deal could work in the national interest.


I acknowledge the contribution of the Productivity Commission. I was someone that argued very early that the Productivity Commission should be trusted as the independent umpire over this issue. The Productivity Commission process was very transparent. It had demonstrated a great capacity to handle and come to conclusions on important macroeconomic and microeconomic issues across Australia. That Productivity Commission process of taking submissions, preparing a draft report, making that draft report available to the community and again using the contributions and submissions of others in coming to a final proposition made the Productivity Commission absolutely well suited to the task of trying to find a way through what many thought was intractable and many thought was an impasse.


It's important to acknowledge that this is not a campaign or an argument that only Western Australians have made. In fact, I argue that at critical points the great bulk of the country, led by the governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, was arguing for reform. You only have to look at the history and the submission processes and the various reviews that were undertaken prior to the Productivity Commission's inquiry to see that many states, under various political leaderships, had been arguing that the GST system, as it was then constructed, was not working for them. There were words like 'opaque', 'seriously flawed', 'inequitable' and 'perverse outcomes'. This was the language that other state governments were using to describe the GST distribution arrangements. So, rather than this being an issue of concern just to Western Australia, I argue that over the last few years other states also recognised that the GST distribution arrangements that had previously worked were not suitable for the future and were not fit for purpose in making sure that the Australian economy was as robust as it possibly could be.


In the contributions from Labor senators particularly—particularly those from Western Australia—in the course of this debate, we've heard a lot of commentary, a lot of partisan commentary, about the performance of the Barnett government and the financial management of Premier Barnett and his team at the time. It's important to understand the broader context in which Colin Barnett and the Liberal government were governing in Western Australia. It's only when you understand the broader context that you can properly understand the very real challenges that were facing Western Australia. Again, I highlight this particular point: Western Australia went to 30c in the dollar. Over the first 10 years of the distribution system, no state fell below 86c. In the last five years, no state has fallen below 88c. But, in the last five years, Western Australia has dipped to as low as 30c in the dollar. 


What is particularly concerning about that is not just that Western Australia went to 30c but that the Commonwealth Grants Commission itself said it was 'totally conceivable'—its words—that a relativity could fall to zero, and, in the Commonwealth Grants Commission's own words, the fairness of that would depend on where you sat. So here we have the Commonwealth Grants Commission performing its function very well, theoretically, but being blind to the real consequences that state governments would have to face as a result of serious dips or serious changes in their GST relativity—and heaven forbid that any state should ever have got to zero. The fact that the Commonwealth Grants Commission was unrelenting in that view that applied only a theoretical lens to the issue of distribution was, to me, significant cause for concern.


Claims by Labor, particularly Labor senators from my home state of Western Australia, that WA's budget was mismanaged by the former Liberal-National government fail to recognise the effect that the failed GST formula has had on Western Australian finances. During the period of the Barnett government, the population of the state of Western Australia grew by over 400,000 people. Putting that into a context that Tasmanian Senators Brown, Polley, Urquhart and Whish-Wilson will understand, that is nearly 80 per cent of the population of Tasmania. This led to a significant increase in demand on services provided by the state government and a need for major infrastructure improvements to ensure that services met community expectations. 


Between 2008-09 and 2015-16 the government invested over $51 billion in its Asset Investment Program, with the 2016-17 budget set to spend another $5.9 billion. You only need to look to the outer suburbs of Perth—I note that the Deputy President, Senator Lines, from Western Australia, is here—to see the expenditure on new schools and transport infrastructure; visit a regional town like Karratha, like I do, to see the transformation of health and education facilities; or drive past the new Perth Children's Hospital, the Fiona Stanley Hospital, the Midland hospital or the Joondalup Health Campus to see where that infrastructure money was spent by the Barnett government. I challenge Labor to point out which one of these major pieces of infrastructure shouldn't have been built, or doesn't need or deserve to be the focus of Western Australia's infrastructure build. 


In regard to recurrent expenditure, it's not too hard to see why the government ran a deficit of nearly $2 billion in 2016-17. In 2016-17, WA received less than $2 billion in GST, a share of just over 30c in the dollar, as I have already highlighted. In that same year, around $4.7 billion of GST revenue was being redistributed to other states. State governments, as senators would be aware, provide the majority of funding for health, education, and law and order. The government chose not to make massive cuts to these services, which would have been up to nearly 10 per cent across the board. It decided instead to run a deficit. This is not financial mismanagement but an understanding that the services could not sustain the cuts without significant reductions in the services that could be delivered. This GST solution ensures that the state will never face the same circumstances again. 


In the very brief time that's available to me, I do want to acknowledge the contribution of a few people who aren't in this Senate chamber any more. The only person to bring forward a private senator's bill to reform the GST was Senator Dio Wang from Western Australia, who is no longer here. I acknowledge Senator Dio Wang's contribution. The other is Senator Joe Bullock, Labor senator for Western Australia, who, early on, went on the public record arguing for reform of the GST distribution arrangements. In all fairness, I think it is important to acknowledge his contribution as well. 


As I like to say, this chapter is not the end of a debate about federal-state financial reform in our country but the beginning of that debate. What we have seen in this debate is a desire on the part of states and territories to have much greater independence and autonomy in how they raise money and spend money. As a very, very strong federalist I think that is a debate we need to have and continue to have in this country. The debate about the GST is not just about distribution, though that is the element of the debate that has occupied much of our time; it is also about the base and it is about the rate. I stand resolute that, by broadening the base of the GST, you can keep the rate low. As a senator who wants to see low taxes in our country I don't argue for an increase in the GST rate, but I do argue for a broadening of its base. 


This is a demonstration again of what the Australian Senate can do on behalf of the states and territories that senators represent. This should be a very, very powerful message to every senator that standing up for the interests of your state, your constituency, will not get you punished by your electorate but actually get you rewarded by your electorate. Western Australians want to make sure that their senators are vocal, and have a strong voice, in the Senate. This legislation is a demonstration that that can be done. This legislation deserves the fullest possible support, from every senator in this place.

As Tasmanians, we know the issues around the GST just as well as Western Australian senators do. I'm proud to speak in support of this legislation on behalf of my party and my state, because, after much advocacy from my fellow Labor colleagues—the member for Franklin, Julie Collins; the member for Bass, Ross Hart; the member for Braddon, Justine Keay; the member for Lyons, Brian Mitchell; and the Labor Senate team from Tasmania—the government has finally seen fit to meet, at least in part, our demands. 


While we're unfortunately all too familiar with how the current Prime Minister views my home state, what we weren't able to see until very recently was a guarantee that Tasmania's share of the GST would not be going backwards, at least in the short term. As Treasurer, the current Prime Minister opposed Labor's insistence that we have a legislative floor for the state's share of the GST. I have to say, as well, that we also acknowledge the issue that has been raised by our Labor Western Australian colleagues and of course the Western Australian senators opposite. The Prime Minister previously described the legislative floor as unnecessary. Since then, he's backflipped—following Labor's lead and the needs of Tasmania—for now. It took two weeks of tireless advocacy from the Tasmanian Labor representatives to drag the government to the point where they caved in on the GST, and the government keeps sending mixed messages about the future of the scheme. 


It's a fact that Tasmania relies on the GST a great deal. Commonwealth funds total over 60 per cent of our $6 billion state budget, and that's certainly above the national average. Labor invested heavily in schools and hospitals during its time in government, working to bring my home state up towards the national average. Since then, Liberal governments have unfortunately starved the state of funding. Our hospitals are again at breaking point and our schools are crying out for investment, and our public servants are underpaid and the government is arguing it can't afford to provide them with the pay rise they've been calling for. That's why this victory is a welcome one. It's welcome to see the government coming to accept the need for a GST floor, but it's worrying that it's taken such efforts to achieve this. It's worrying that, when it's as plain as day, the government somehow still manages to avoid legislating what is clearly in the national interest until it's dragged, kicking and screaming, to do so. 


It takes a great deal to unite state governments of all political persuasions. It's usually something that's fairly unique that unites Liberal and Labor governments alike, but on the matter of GST all states and territories came to the federal government asking for a legislative guarantee. All state and territory governments were united with the Australian Labor Party, and the government still considered it unnecessary. When the government finally came around, it was, quite frankly, clear that they simply couldn't avoid the necessity of this legislation. Consistent advocacy in campaigning showed that this legislation would ensure the wellbeing of Tasmanians and, indeed, all Australians protected under these changes to the distribution of GST revenues. 


These changes will ensure that the funds that Tasmanians rely on to fund their schools and hospitals do not go backwards. Thanks to the continual advocacy of so many other Tasmanians, we now have a commitment through to 2026-27 that our state's share will not go backwards. We do, however, remain concerned that a future Liberal government would act to ensure that after 2026 our GST share is no longer guaranteed. Yet, despite these concerns, it's unmistakable that we need legislation to put this debate to bed. That's why Labor supports this bill and that's why I'm rising to speak in support of the legislation. Labor's support of this legislation is needed to see much-needed certainty for all states and territories. That's why Labor will vote to support this bill and to ensure Tasmania gets its fair share of the GST.


I would like to endorse the contribution from Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, in the other House. She put the government on notice that, when we get to the transition in 2026-27, we will be fighting for Tasmania again and we'll be insisting that our state continues to be no worse off. Indeed, we want to see our state much better off. We hope to see the outcomes, particularly in health and education, for Tasmanians improve. So I'm pleased to say we're able to support this bill today because of Labor leading and demanding that no-one be worse off and because of the pressure that we put on the Liberal state government and the Liberal senators from Tasmania to insist that this clause be in the legislation.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-11-13,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:05):  A very delightful passage from one of Australia's greatest literary masterpieces, by Mr Norman Lindsay in 1918, called The Magic Pudding:


Onions, bunions, corns and crabs,


Whiskers, wheels and hansom cabs,


Beef and bottles, beer and bones,


Give him a feed and end his groans.


It is a tale of Bunyip Bluegum, who was seduced when walking through the bush by a pudding that he was quite unable to pass by. As the story goes, Bunyip Bluegum was seduced into eating the magic pudding, a pudding that never ended, a pudding that demanded eating. This tale has been popular with Australians and Australian children for nearly a century because, I think, we understand the intuition, the seduction, the attraction of a magic pudding—an endless source of nourishment.


That's what we see with the GST debate. The GST has recently become a magic pudding. Well, who would have thought, fixing the problem with the GST, that there's not enough money to go around the states? Who would have thought the fix to the problem is more money? What a revelation! We've heard in this chamber that, obviously, the Labor Party are claiming this was their idea. They've been talking about more money now for some time. The question is: where is the money going to come from? That's the question that hasn't been answered in this chamber here tonight.


It's fine to say that we can fix the problem with a floor rate on the GST at 70c initially and then 75c so that no state is worse off. Intuitively, that sounds great. That makes a lot of sense. But this pool of funds that's allocated and shared across the states, based on a principle of fairness, a principle of equity and a principle of efficiency, has been, like the magic pudding, a source of seduction for so many states. If you read the tale of The Magic Pudding—the Senate will adjourn in just over 10 minutes and you can get a copy of it online when you get home if you haven't read it for few years—you read the tales about the pudding thief. In fact, not just one pudding thief but numerous pudding thieves are all drawn to the seduction of the magic pudding. The idea of endless and limitless money is very, very relevant to this debate. I won't disclose straight away who I think the pudding thief is; I'll get to that.


Let's talk a little bit about why the GST has been so seductive and why it has led states such as Western Australia and New South Wales to claim they're not getting their fair share of the distribution. To go back a few steps, when the GST was brought in and the Commonwealth Grants Commission was set up, we had this principle—somewhat complicated and impressively named—of horizontal fiscal equalisation. The idea was that those states that didn't have the ability to raise revenue to pay for fair provision of services would be funded through the GST pool of contributions of other states. This principle is about our Federation, fundamentally. You can put all the technical and complex stuff aside; it was designed because we're a federation of states and territories in this country. As has been pointed out in this chamber, some states—for example, Western Australia—happened to be blessed and endowed with some of the world's greatest deposits of natural resources. Unlike Western Australia, my home state of Tasmania doesn't have such abundance of riches. However, we do have many other riches in abundance which I'll also get to a little bit later.


I was very impressed to hear from Senator Dean Smith that he hopes that this is just the beginning of tax reform in this country and especially of debate on federal roles and responsibilities on tax reform. I'm very glad to hear that because it is exactly the point that I was going to raise tonight. Where do we go next with tax reform? The reason we've seen these changes to GST distribution is the impact over time of state based policies affecting the fairness and equity of the GST distributions. In theory, the efficiency principle was designed so that these contributions shared amongst states would help equalise different taxes across different states so that we did get, for example, some states leveraging much higher rates of payroll tax. We've talked chamber during the debate in the about revenue from pokies and the gambling industry, but there are a number of other levers that states can pull. It was deemed to be more efficient if the federal government made allocations of GST revenue to try to take pressure off some states having much higher rates of, for example, payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty or a number of the other levers that they can pull. I think most people agree with the principle of equity. Even the Productivity Commission, although it made a number of recommendations, admitted that generally most stakeholders agreed with the idea that through Federation we would have a fair system of allocating the distribution of the GST.


I was outraged, as most Tasmanians were—and I'm sure Senator Colbeck here tonight also was outraged—when his Liberal state colleague Mr Barnett called my home state of Tasmania a 'mendicant' state. I note also, although it was designed I'm sure to get a headline, that Senator Leyonhjelm was out last night claiming that Tasmania and South Australia should be kicked out of the Federation because we can't pull our own weight. The whole idea is that we have a fair and equal Federation. At different times over the years different states have been net recipients of GST funds, and at other times they haven't been. It's well established that for a large number of years Western Australia was a net recipient of GST funds from other states. Then came the mining boom, and that situation changed. It's also been well established that it was actually the Western Australian government's policies around raising royalties that led to the rate of GST it received going down to 30 per cent. That's one of the issues that it has been claiming is a fundamental driver for changing the GST distribution.


If we're talking about more reform, as Senator Dean Smith has put on the table, especially around the role of the federal government and the Federation, when are we going to start having a proper debate in this place about superprofit taxes? When will we start talking about properly fixing the petroleum resource rent tax? There is $240 billion in tax credits that has been clocked up by some of the biggest, wealthiest corporations on the planet and is sitting there to be deducted against future tax—if they ever pay any of that future tax. We've got a system where we have uplift rates that I note the government is looking at reducing. They are very, very high—15 per cent for exploration expenditure and five per cent for operating expenditure—which means essentially these deferred tax credits are going to get to who knows where? I'm looking forward to the next estimates so we can get an update on where they're at now. I'm guessing there will be over $300 billion in deferred tax credits—in other words, tax that's not going to be paid—through this very generous system. What about our mining superprofit tax? For those who were in the chamber back in 2012 and 2013 we had what I would agree was a much watered-down version because of the politics of this place. But the idea behind a superprofit tax, which came originally from the Henry tax review, is still a very good one. It is a tax that essentially is levied by the federal government. It could also be used to pay for schools and hospitals and be shared amongst the states. I notice we've actually had no debate at all in this place on this legislation about where we're going to go with superprofit taxes. So I look forward to hearing Senator Smith's contribution on this and whether he agrees that there's an enhanced role for the Commonwealth in fixing the petroleum rents rort tax, the PRRT, and implementing a superprofits tax on the mining resources that are owned by all Australians.


That leaves me with, I think, the most critical part of this bill that needs to be digested. Once we go past the forward estimates, the next five to 10 years, where is the money going to come from? We know their top-ups to the GST pool—this magic pudding—are going to come from consolidated revenue. They're going to come from future governments, whoever they might be. It may be the Liberal Party or it may be the Labor Party. I don't know if it will be the Greens party, but it will come from a future government. We have to deduce that those contributions are going to come from somewhere because, as we know, it's a zero-sum game.


I look at the track record of this government since the zombie budget cuts of 2013 right through to the present day, where we've even seen in recent weeks a whole number of revelations around cuts to basic services, such as the coalition's cut to the Foodbank charity of nearly 25 per cent—which I'm glad that the Prime Minister backed off on today. It was an issue that was even raised by the farming federation body themselves, especially around the impact it would have on drought-affected families. That's just one particular issue. What about cuts to the ABC and SBS? These cuts were of course outlined on Four Corners last night, I suppose with the revelation that those cuts were tied to the political content and goings on within the ABC—something to be probed very shortly by a Senate inquiry. We have also seen an efficiency dividend in place across the Public Service. We've seen no decent pay rises for public servants. We've seen job cuts right across the service, including at Centrelink and the ATO, leading to massive service failures.


There are cuts to Landcare and threatened species budgets of around $200 million a year. So, to save the species in this country, we have to beg German charities for funding for some of our most endangered animals. In my home state of Tasmania these cuts are very serious. I know Senator Duniam and Senator Colbeck are working overtime as Tasmanian senators to get the funding in place for NRM South and NRM Cradle Coast, who have also lost their funding. Why is that, considering the importance of these NRM groups? They are especially critical in a place like Tasmania. We don't know; we've got no decisions.


The government have done everything they can to kick people with genuine needs off the disability pension and they have failed to raise Newstart. I'm wearing my $75 badge today. I didn't have large enough lapels to wear a larger badge, but that can be easily fixed when I get home and get one of my op shop suits. I warn senators that I have worn it once in here already and I'm prepared to do it again. For people who are living on the poverty line, $75 a week is not a big ask. Not only will it help these people who desperately need it; it will also help the economy—and we think that's a great priority. But the government are too stingy and too mean to raise Newstart at all. And let's not forget the revelations today about more devastating cuts to universities and the statements put out by the Tertiary Education Union. We are seeing cuts to schools, public hospitals and, sadly, more cuts to foreign aid. We've even seen money come out of the NDIS recently to go towards one of the government's pet projects.


So let's be honest: the magic pudding isn't so magic. There isn't an endless goodness in this pudding; it is limited. We know that the money has to come from somewhere once the GST top-ups start in a few years time. We have no idea where that money is going to come from, but I'll bet my bottom dollar that, if that money is allocated by a future Liberal government, it will come from the nation's most vulnerable and it will come from essential services. So it's not so magic after all.



While the Greens will be supporting this bill and the intention of it, we will be closely scrutinising and keeping a very close eye on future allocations of funds, where they are going to come from and how we are going to pay for this. The Australian people need to understand—

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (18:36):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Prime Minister Morrison is due to visit Darwin at the end of this week, and I certainly urge him to make sure that he has a copy of the city deal in his back pocket, ready to go. In May 2017, the Northern Territory government and the federal government signed an MOU for a city deal for Darwin. That's 18 months ago. The Townsville City Deal was signed after just one month and the Launceston City Deal was signed in seven months. There was not a cent in this year's budget for the Darwin City Deal, and it shows the lack of vision, support and foresight this government has for the future of the Northern Territory and, indeed, for northern Australia.


The mantra of developing the north seems to have been abandoned by the Morrison government. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund is really nowhere to be seen for the number of organisations and businesses that have put forward their hopes and expectations for assistance in the north. The glossy reports, the big promises, the ideas and the time and energy that stakeholders took in putting forward their projects, knowledge and enthusiasm to see northern Australia reach its full potential seem to have fallen by the wayside.


It takes more than a quick drive in a big blue bus to gain some serious insight and understanding of what needs to be done to stimulate the entirety of our north, let alone the Northern Territory. No-one wants to go cap in hand to the Commonwealth, seeking assistance, but there is no doubt that Commonwealth assistance will be required to restore the Territory's fiscal capacity. There are options that I submit need to be examined seriously around the relativity floor and excluding from Commonwealth Grants Commission processes the funding needed to address Aboriginal disadvantage, to address infrastructure deficits and to support enabling infrastructure to develop the north. The Commonwealth could look at the possibility of increased funding to the National Partnership on Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment and at using that avenue to provide capital for additional services to people living in remote communities in the Northern Territory. That would take a lot of pressure off the Northern Territory government's budget.


The Commonwealth's own projections indicate that this much-needed certainty for the Northern Territory is unlikely to be much of a cost burden. However, it would go a long way to restoring confidence in the Northern Territory, with the people of the Territory feeling the full effect of some of the biggest economic and fiscal challenges that the Territory has ever seen.

Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:39):  It's hard to know where to start. Just 12 months ago I stood in exactly the same seat to introduce a private senator's bill that led to the introduction of same-sex marriage. Over the last few years as a senator for Western Australia, I've committed myself to the resolution of a number of issues that I have considered important not just to the make-up of our country but also to the future direction of Western Australia. I'm particularly proud to be able to stand here today as a member of the coalition government led by Scott Morrison, who was the Treasurer not so long ago, and to almost bring to a close this debate about legislation that will bring reform to the goods and services distribution arrangements in Australia and, in doing so, mark perhaps one of the most significant reforms to federal-state financial relations that the country has seen.


Before I provide a brief overview of the long campaign, the long road that has been GST distribution reform in this country, I thought I might just detail exactly what it is that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 seeks to do. This bill will amend the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 to give effect to key elements of the government's interim response to the Productivity Commission's inquiry report Horizontal fiscal equalisation. The key elements of the government's interim response include: transitioning the horizontal fiscal equalisation system from full equalisation, equalised to the strongest state or territory, to reasonable equalisation, equalised to the stronger of New South Wales and Victoria; introducing a minimum goods and service tax revenue-sharing relativity—or the GST relativity floor, as it's known—that may be determined by the Treasurer for any individual state or territory; and permanently boosting the GST revenue pool with additional Commonwealth financial assistance. The following elements of the government's interim response are given effect under existing laws: providing short-term transition payments to any state or territory with a GST revenue-sharing relativity factor below 0.7; and providing short-term transition payments to the Northern Territory if its revenue-sharing relativity falls below its determined relativity factor for 2017-18. The bill introduces a guarantee that each state and territory will get the better of the current distribution system and the updated distribution system during the transition period.


In the six years that I have been a senator, I think there have probably only been two moments more significant than this in shaping the framework of Australia's federal system of government. One, I would argue—others might differ—was the reforms to the Senate voting system that were introduced and agreed by the Senate in advance of the 2016 federal election. Of course, for those of us that can remember, it was the opposition that some coalition senators led to the Rudd plan to amend the Commonwealth Constitution to provide recognition for local government. That was a debate that raged inside the coalition under the leadership of Tony Abbott first. It was a debate that we had in this Senate chamber. If I recall correctly, eight coalition senators, including me, opposed that referendum proposition on the basis that it would undermine the federal nature of our system of government, not enhance it.


The debate that has been raging in regard to the GST distribution arrangements as they affect Western Australia is not a new one. What demonstrates the shallowness of Labor's understanding of this issue thus far is that they have failed to recognise the contribution of one important person, the person who called out this issue first in 2007. That was none other than Eric Ripper, the Labor Treasurer of the Western Australian state government at the time. The Hansard in the Western Australian parliamentary record makes it very clear that he drew the attention of Western Australians to this issue first. Then, over the next 10 to 11 years, the level of understanding and the level of anxiety started to grow in our home state of Western Australia because it dawned on Western Australians, at a time of tremendous growth in our state, that the GST system wasn't allowing Western Australia to be the best and strongest it could be.


Coalition senators, aided and supported by people like Colin Barnett and—I'll be the first to admit; I'm happy to say this—the chorus of Western Australians that built over the last number of years from Kununurra to Esperance in the north and the south out across to Perth and Kalbarri and all the suburbs in between, led this and deserve to have the fullest recognition given them for standing firm, standing strong and making sure that their voices were heard very loudly both in this Senate chamber and in the government at the time. John Howard himself has made it crystal clear that, while people absolutely expected there to be fluctuations in the GST distribution arrangements and the relativities that were borne out of that over time, no-one foresaw the magnitude of the variances that the GST distribution system would deliver and no-one could foresee the magnitude of the GST relativity as it would affect Western Australia during a time of tremendous economic activity.


It's worth reminding people of those relativities, which were most recently announced by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and approved by the government, and reflecting on them. It takes tremendous courage for senators from the Northern Territory and Tasmania to come into this Senate chamber and argue GST distribution issues, because the system quite rightly provides the most generous arrangements for them. What did the GST relativities in the most recent announcements mean for our country? For New South Wales the relativity fell from 88c to 86c in the dollar, but that still meant that New South Wales would get $18 billion, or 27.4 per cent of the GST pool. For Victoria the GST relativity meant that it would rise from 93c to 99c, meaning Victoria would get $16.8 billion, or 25.6 per cent of the GST pool. The Northern Territory is taking home $4.26, Tasmania $1.77, South Australia $1.48, the ACT $1.18, Queensland $1.10 and my home state of Western Australia went from 34c cents to 47c, meaning a GST revenue of $3.3 billion, or 4.9 per cent.


That's worth reminding ourselves of, because what makes this particular initiative so profound is that, when this debate started, much of the hand-wringing revolved around that almost intractable issue: how do you correct a very obvious anomaly in the GST distribution arrangements which left Western Australia with just 30c in the dollar without unnecessarily penalising other states and territories? It's a great testament to the creative thinking of Treasury officials and of this government that they were able to craft a solution that not only benefits Western Australia to the tune of $4.7 billion but also leaves no state worse off and has left many states in a slightly better position. When this debate started, that was an impossible dream, but since then over time we've seen some hard-headedness and persistence on the part of Western Australians and a willingness on the part of Scott Morrison as Treasurer and as Prime Minister to make sure this deal could work in the national interest.


I acknowledge the contribution of the Productivity Commission. I was someone that argued very early that the Productivity Commission should be trusted as the independent umpire over this issue. The Productivity Commission process was very transparent. It had demonstrated a great capacity to handle and come to conclusions on important macroeconomic and microeconomic issues across Australia. That Productivity Commission process of taking submissions, preparing a draft report, making that draft report available to the community and again using the contributions and submissions of others in coming to a final proposition made the Productivity Commission absolutely well suited to the task of trying to find a way through what many thought was intractable and many thought was an impasse.


It's important to acknowledge that this is not a campaign or an argument that only Western Australians have made. In fact, I argue that at critical points the great bulk of the country, led by the governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, was arguing for reform. You only have to look at the history and the submission processes and the various reviews that were undertaken prior to the Productivity Commission's inquiry to see that many states, under various political leaderships, had been arguing that the GST system, as it was then constructed, was not working for them. There were words like 'opaque', 'seriously flawed', 'inequitable' and 'perverse outcomes'. This was the language that other state governments were using to describe the GST distribution arrangements. So, rather than this being an issue of concern just to Western Australia, I argue that over the last few years other states also recognised that the GST distribution arrangements that had previously worked were not suitable for the future and were not fit for purpose in making sure that the Australian economy was as robust as it possibly could be.


In the contributions from Labor senators particularly—particularly those from Western Australia—in the course of this debate, we've heard a lot of commentary, a lot of partisan commentary, about the performance of the Barnett government and the financial management of Premier Barnett and his team at the time. It's important to understand the broader context in which Colin Barnett and the Liberal government were governing in Western Australia. It's only when you understand the broader context that you can properly understand the very real challenges that were facing Western Australia. Again, I highlight this particular point: Western Australia went to 30c in the dollar. Over the first 10 years of the distribution system, no state fell below 86c. In the last five years, no state has fallen below 88c. But, in the last five years, Western Australia has dipped to as low as 30c in the dollar. 


What is particularly concerning about that is not just that Western Australia went to 30c but that the Commonwealth Grants Commission itself said it was 'totally conceivable'—its words—that a relativity could fall to zero, and, in the Commonwealth Grants Commission's own words, the fairness of that would depend on where you sat. So here we have the Commonwealth Grants Commission performing its function very well, theoretically, but being blind to the real consequences that state governments would have to face as a result of serious dips or serious changes in their GST relativity—and heaven forbid that any state should ever have got to zero. The fact that the Commonwealth Grants Commission was unrelenting in that view that applied only a theoretical lens to the issue of distribution was, to me, significant cause for concern.


Claims by Labor, particularly Labor senators from my home state of Western Australia, that WA's budget was mismanaged by the former Liberal-National government fail to recognise the effect that the failed GST formula has had on Western Australian finances. During the period of the Barnett government, the population of the state of Western Australia grew by over 400,000 people. Putting that into a context that Tasmanian Senators Brown, Polley, Urquhart and Whish-Wilson will understand, that is nearly 80 per cent of the population of Tasmania. This led to a significant increase in demand on services provided by the state government and a need for major infrastructure improvements to ensure that services met community expectations. 


Between 2008-09 and 2015-16 the government invested over $51 billion in its Asset Investment Program, with the 2016-17 budget set to spend another $5.9 billion. You only need to look to the outer suburbs of Perth—I note that the Deputy President, Senator Lines, from Western Australia, is here—to see the expenditure on new schools and transport infrastructure; visit a regional town like Karratha, like I do, to see the transformation of health and education facilities; or drive past the new Perth Children's Hospital, the Fiona Stanley Hospital, the Midland hospital or the Joondalup Health Campus to see where that infrastructure money was spent by the Barnett government. I challenge Labor to point out which one of these major pieces of infrastructure shouldn't have been built, or doesn't need or deserve to be the focus of Western Australia's infrastructure build. 


In regard to recurrent expenditure, it's not too hard to see why the government ran a deficit of nearly $2 billion in 2016-17. In 2016-17, WA received less than $2 billion in GST, a share of just over 30c in the dollar, as I have already highlighted. In that same year, around $4.7 billion of GST revenue was being redistributed to other states. State governments, as senators would be aware, provide the majority of funding for health, education, and law and order. The government chose not to make massive cuts to these services, which would have been up to nearly 10 per cent across the board. It decided instead to run a deficit. This is not financial mismanagement but an understanding that the services could not sustain the cuts without significant reductions in the services that could be delivered. This GST solution ensures that the state will never face the same circumstances again. 


In the very brief time that's available to me, I do want to acknowledge the contribution of a few people who aren't in this Senate chamber any more. The only person to bring forward a private senator's bill to reform the GST was Senator Dio Wang from Western Australia, who is no longer here. I acknowledge Senator Dio Wang's contribution. The other is Senator Joe Bullock, Labor senator for Western Australia, who, early on, went on the public record arguing for reform of the GST distribution arrangements. In all fairness, I think it is important to acknowledge his contribution as well. 


As I like to say, this chapter is not the end of a debate about federal-state financial reform in our country but the beginning of that debate. What we have seen in this debate is a desire on the part of states and territories to have much greater independence and autonomy in how they raise money and spend money. As a very, very strong federalist I think that is a debate we need to have and continue to have in this country. The debate about the GST is not just about distribution, though that is the element of the debate that has occupied much of our time; it is also about the base and it is about the rate. I stand resolute that, by broadening the base of the GST, you can keep the rate low. As a senator who wants to see low taxes in our country I don't argue for an increase in the GST rate, but I do argue for a broadening of its base. 


This is a demonstration again of what the Australian Senate can do on behalf of the states and territories that senators represent. This should be a very, very powerful message to every senator that standing up for the interests of your state, your constituency, will not get you punished by your electorate but actually get you rewarded by your electorate. Western Australians want to make sure that their senators are vocal, and have a strong voice, in the Senate. This legislation is a demonstration that that can be done. This legislation deserves the fullest possible support, from every senator in this place.

 (Tasmania) (18:59):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 as a Labor senator for the state of Tasmania. As Tasmanians, we know the issues around the GST just as well as Western Australian senators do. I'm proud to speak in support of this legislation on behalf of my party and my state, because, after much advocacy from my fellow Labor colleagues—the member for Franklin, Julie Collins; the member for Bass, Ross Hart; the member for Braddon, Justine Keay; the member for Lyons, Brian Mitchell; and the Labor Senate team from Tasmania—the government has finally seen fit to meet, at least in part, our demands. 


While we're unfortunately all too familiar with how the current Prime Minister views my home state, what we weren't able to see until very recently was a guarantee that Tasmania's share of the GST would not be going backwards, at least in the short term. As Treasurer, the current Prime Minister opposed Labor's insistence that we have a legislative floor for the state's share of the GST. I have to say, as well, that we also acknowledge the issue that has been raised by our Labor Western Australian colleagues and of course the Western Australian senators opposite. The Prime Minister previously described the legislative floor as unnecessary. Since then, he's backflipped—following Labor's lead and the needs of Tasmania—for now. It took two weeks of tireless advocacy from the Tasmanian Labor representatives to drag the government to the point where they caved in on the GST, and the government keeps sending mixed messages about the future of the scheme. 


It's a fact that Tasmania relies on the GST a great deal. Commonwealth funds total over 60 per cent of our $6 billion state budget, and that's certainly above the national average. Labor invested heavily in schools and hospitals during its time in government, working to bring my home state up towards the national average. Since then, Liberal governments have unfortunately starved the state of funding. Our hospitals are again at breaking point and our schools are crying out for investment, and our public servants are underpaid and the government is arguing it can't afford to provide them with the pay rise they've been calling for. That's why this victory is a welcome one. It's welcome to see the government coming to accept the need for a GST floor, but it's worrying that it's taken such efforts to achieve this. It's worrying that, when it's as plain as day, the government somehow still manages to avoid legislating what is clearly in the national interest until it's dragged, kicking and screaming, to do so. 


It takes a great deal to unite state governments of all political persuasions. It's usually something that's fairly unique that unites Liberal and Labor governments alike, but on the matter of GST all states and territories came to the federal government asking for a legislative guarantee. All state and territory governments were united with the Australian Labor Party, and the government still considered it unnecessary. When the government finally came around, it was, quite frankly, clear that they simply couldn't avoid the necessity of this legislation. Consistent advocacy in campaigning showed that this legislation would ensure the wellbeing of Tasmanians and, indeed, all Australians protected under these changes to the distribution of GST revenues. 


These changes will ensure that the funds that Tasmanians rely on to fund their schools and hospitals do not go backwards. Thanks to the continual advocacy of so many other Tasmanians, we now have a commitment through to 2026-27 that our state's share will not go backwards. We do, however, remain concerned that a future Liberal government would act to ensure that after 2026 our GST share is no longer guaranteed. Yet, despite these concerns, it's unmistakable that we need legislation to put this debate to bed. That's why Labor supports this bill and that's why I'm rising to speak in support of the legislation. Labor's support of this legislation is needed to see much-needed certainty for all states and territories. That's why Labor will vote to support this bill and to ensure Tasmania gets its fair share of the GST.


I would like to endorse the contribution from Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, in the other House. She put the government on notice that, when we get to the transition in 2026-27, we will be fighting for Tasmania again and we'll be insisting that our state continues to be no worse off. Indeed, we want to see our state much better off. We hope to see the outcomes, particularly in health and education, for Tasmanians improve. So I'm pleased to say we're able to support this bill today because of Labor leading and demanding that no-one be worse off and because of the pressure that we put on the Liberal state government and the Liberal senators from Tasmania to insist that this clause be in the legislation.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:05):  A very delightful passage from one of Australia's greatest literary masterpieces, by Mr Norman Lindsay in 1918, called The Magic Pudding:


Onions, bunions, corns and crabs,


Whiskers, wheels and hansom cabs,


Beef and bottles, beer and bones,


Give him a feed and end his groans.


It is a tale of Bunyip Bluegum, who was seduced when walking through the bush by a pudding that he was quite unable to pass by. As the story goes, Bunyip Bluegum was seduced into eating the magic pudding, a pudding that never ended, a pudding that demanded eating. This tale has been popular with Australians and Australian children for nearly a century because, I think, we understand the intuition, the seduction, the attraction of a magic pudding—an endless source of nourishment.


That's what we see with the GST debate. The GST has recently become a magic pudding. Well, who would have thought, fixing the problem with the GST, that there's not enough money to go around the states? Who would have thought the fix to the problem is more money? What a revelation! We've heard in this chamber that, obviously, the Labor Party are claiming this was their idea. They've been talking about more money now for some time. The question is: where is the money going to come from? That's the question that hasn't been answered in this chamber here tonight.


It's fine to say that we can fix the problem with a floor rate on the GST at 70c initially and then 75c so that no state is worse off. Intuitively, that sounds great. That makes a lot of sense. But this pool of funds that's allocated and shared across the states, based on a principle of fairness, a principle of equity and a principle of efficiency, has been, like the magic pudding, a source of seduction for so many states. If you read the tale of The Magic Pudding—the Senate will adjourn in just over 10 minutes and you can get a copy of it online when you get home if you haven't read it for few years—you read the tales about the pudding thief. In fact, not just one pudding thief but numerous pudding thieves are all drawn to the seduction of the magic pudding. The idea of endless and limitless money is very, very relevant to this debate. I won't disclose straight away who I think the pudding thief is; I'll get to that.


Let's talk a little bit about why the GST has been so seductive and why it has led states such as Western Australia and New South Wales to claim they're not getting their fair share of the distribution. To go back a few steps, when the GST was brought in and the Commonwealth Grants Commission was set up, we had this principle—somewhat complicated and impressively named—of horizontal fiscal equalisation. The idea was that those states that didn't have the ability to raise revenue to pay for fair provision of services would be funded through the GST pool of contributions of other states. This principle is about our Federation, fundamentally. You can put all the technical and complex stuff aside; it was designed because we're a federation of states and territories in this country. As has been pointed out in this chamber, some states—for example, Western Australia—happened to be blessed and endowed with some of the world's greatest deposits of natural resources. Unlike Western Australia, my home state of Tasmania doesn't have such abundance of riches. However, we do have many other riches in abundance which I'll also get to a little bit later.


I was very impressed to hear from Senator Dean Smith that he hopes that this is just the beginning of tax reform in this country and especially of debate on federal roles and responsibilities on tax reform. I'm very glad to hear that because it is exactly the point that I was going to raise tonight. Where do we go next with tax reform? The reason we've seen these changes to GST distribution is the impact over time of state based policies affecting the fairness and equity of the GST distributions. In theory, the efficiency principle was designed so that these contributions shared amongst states would help equalise different taxes across different states so that we did get, for example, some states leveraging much higher rates of payroll tax. We've talked chamber during the debate in the about revenue from pokies and the gambling industry, but there are a number of other levers that states can pull. It was deemed to be more efficient if the federal government made allocations of GST revenue to try to take pressure off some states having much higher rates of, for example, payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty or a number of the other levers that they can pull. I think most people agree with the principle of equity. Even the Productivity Commission, although it made a number of recommendations, admitted that generally most stakeholders agreed with the idea that through Federation we would have a fair system of allocating the distribution of the GST.


I was outraged, as most Tasmanians were—and I'm sure Senator Colbeck here tonight also was outraged—when his Liberal state colleague Mr Barnett called my home state of Tasmania a 'mendicant' state. I note also, although it was designed I'm sure to get a headline, that Senator Leyonhjelm was out last night claiming that Tasmania and South Australia should be kicked out of the Federation because we can't pull our own weight. The whole idea is that we have a fair and equal Federation. At different times over the years different states have been net recipients of GST funds, and at other times they haven't been. It's well established that for a large number of years Western Australia was a net recipient of GST funds from other states. Then came the mining boom, and that situation changed. It's also been well established that it was actually the Western Australian government's policies around raising royalties that led to the rate of GST it received going down to 30 per cent. That's one of the issues that it has been claiming is a fundamental driver for changing the GST distribution.


If we're talking about more reform, as Senator Dean Smith has put on the table, especially around the role of the federal government and the Federation, when are we going to start having a proper debate in this place about superprofit taxes? When will we start talking about properly fixing the petroleum resource rent tax? There is $240 billion in tax credits that has been clocked up by some of the biggest, wealthiest corporations on the planet and is sitting there to be deducted against future tax—if they ever pay any of that future tax. We've got a system where we have uplift rates that I note the government is looking at reducing. They are very, very high—15 per cent for exploration expenditure and five per cent for operating expenditure—which means essentially these deferred tax credits are going to get to who knows where? I'm looking forward to the next estimates so we can get an update on where they're at now. I'm guessing there will be over $300 billion in deferred tax credits—in other words, tax that's not going to be paid—through this very generous system. What about our mining superprofit tax? For those who were in the chamber back in 2012 and 2013 we had what I would agree was a much watered-down version because of the politics of this place. But the idea behind a superprofit tax, which came originally from the Henry tax review, is still a very good one. It is a tax that essentially is levied by the federal government. It could also be used to pay for schools and hospitals and be shared amongst the states. I notice we've actually had no debate at all in this place on this legislation about where we're going to go with superprofit taxes. So I look forward to hearing Senator Smith's contribution on this and whether he agrees that there's an enhanced role for the Commonwealth in fixing the petroleum rents rort tax, the PRRT, and implementing a superprofits tax on the mining resources that are owned by all Australians.


That leaves me with, I think, the most critical part of this bill that needs to be digested. Once we go past the forward estimates, the next five to 10 years, where is the money going to come from? We know their top-ups to the GST pool—this magic pudding—are going to come from consolidated revenue. They're going to come from future governments, whoever they might be. It may be the Liberal Party or it may be the Labor Party. I don't know if it will be the Greens party, but it will come from a future government. We have to deduce that those contributions are going to come from somewhere because, as we know, it's a zero-sum game.


I look at the track record of this government since the zombie budget cuts of 2013 right through to the present day, where we've even seen in recent weeks a whole number of revelations around cuts to basic services, such as the coalition's cut to the Foodbank charity of nearly 25 per cent—which I'm glad that the Prime Minister backed off on today. It was an issue that was even raised by the farming federation body themselves, especially around the impact it would have on drought-affected families. That's just one particular issue. What about cuts to the ABC and SBS? These cuts were of course outlined on Four Corners last night, I suppose with the revelation that those cuts were tied to the political content and goings on within the ABC—something to be probed very shortly by a Senate inquiry. We have also seen an efficiency dividend in place across the Public Service. We've seen no decent pay rises for public servants. We've seen job cuts right across the service, including at Centrelink and the ATO, leading to massive service failures.


There are cuts to Landcare and threatened species budgets of around $200 million a year. So, to save the species in this country, we have to beg German charities for funding for some of our most endangered animals. In my home state of Tasmania these cuts are very serious. I know Senator Duniam and Senator Colbeck are working overtime as Tasmanian senators to get the funding in place for NRM South and NRM Cradle Coast, who have also lost their funding. Why is that, considering the importance of these NRM groups? They are especially critical in a place like Tasmania. We don't know; we've got no decisions.


The government have done everything they can to kick people with genuine needs off the disability pension and they have failed to raise Newstart. I'm wearing my $75 badge today. I didn't have large enough lapels to wear a larger badge, but that can be easily fixed when I get home and get one of my op shop suits. I warn senators that I have worn it once in here already and I'm prepared to do it again. For people who are living on the poverty line, $75 a week is not a big ask. Not only will it help these people who desperately need it; it will also help the economy—and we think that's a great priority. But the government are too stingy and too mean to raise Newstart at all. And let's not forget the revelations today about more devastating cuts to universities and the statements put out by the Tertiary Education Union. We are seeing cuts to schools, public hospitals and, sadly, more cuts to foreign aid. We've even seen money come out of the NDIS recently to go towards one of the government's pet projects.


So let's be honest: the magic pudding isn't so magic. There isn't an endless goodness in this pudding; it is limited. We know that the money has to come from somewhere once the GST top-ups start in a few years time. We have no idea where that money is going to come from, but I'll bet my bottom dollar that, if that money is allocated by a future Liberal government, it will come from the nation's most vulnerable and it will come from essential services. So it's not so magic after all.



While the Greens will be supporting this bill and the intention of it, we will be closely scrutinising and keeping a very close eye on future allocations of funds, where they are going to come from and how we are going to pay for this. The Australian people need to understand—

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:20):  Yesterday I joined with Labor's shadow minister for justice, Ms Clare O'Neil MP, to receive a petition signed by tens of thousands of people from around the world who are calling on the Australian parliament to be a global leader against slavery by enacting a strong and effective modern slavery law. Presenting the petition was Fuzz Kitto, the national co-director of STOP THE TRAFFIK; and members of its Australian coalition. As some senators may be aware, STOP THE TRAFFIK is a coalition of over 30 organisations working together to prevent, disrupt and abolish modern slavery. STOP THE TRAFFIK has been actively engaging with members and senators on all sides of politics, as well as with business, industry, non-government organisations and consumers, regarding a modern slavery act for Australia. The petition, which I'll shortly present to the Senate tonight, is signed by 52,719 people from around Australia and the world, coordinated by Freedom United. It reads:


We commend the Australian Parliament for taking bold first steps toward creating a modern slavery law that could greatly impact the lives of millions of people working under conditions of forced labour.


We know all too well that many workers in Asia endure forced labour to bring us the garments, foods, electronics and other goods we enjoy. With nearly half of Australia's imports coming from the Asia Pacific, where an estimated 30 million people are living in slavery, you have an opportunity to ensure the law is strong, protects victims and holds businesses accountable.


Please don't let this be a missed opportunity to make a real impact on the global slavery problem. We urge the Australian government to be a regional and global leader against slavery by proposing a strong and effective modern slavery law that:


Ensures victims of slavery are provided their entitled human rights protections;


Establishes an accessible and centralized way for companies to report on modern slavery;


Sets a reporting requirement for all companies with a revenue of at least $25m, with an effective way to ensure


compliance;


Covers government procurement; and


Appoints an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner to make sure the law is implemented well.


Labor leads on the issue of modern slavery. Over a year ago we committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent anti-slavery commissioner, an announcement warmly greeted by business, union and civil society stakeholders. Whilst Labor believe there are improvements that could be made to the Modern Slavery Bill, we do call on the government to bring this bill on for debate in the Senate, as it is vitally important for it to pass into law without further delay. Australia has an important role to play in fighting modern slavery. There are an estimated 40.3 million people in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities such as manufacturing, construction and agriculture. As mentioned in the text of the petition, almost two-thirds of people trapped in slavery worldwide are reported to be in the Asia-Pacific region, and it is estimated that there are thousands of people who are currently trapped in slavery right here in Australia. 


As Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and shadow minister for foreign affairs I'm grateful for the opportunity to present this petition to the Senate on a critical global human rights issue. I also acknowledge again the work of STOP THE TRAFFIK and the work of the shadow minister for justice, Ms Clare O'Neil, and her staff, who have worked so hard to bring this issue to the forefront of national attention. I seek leave to table a nonconforming petition.


Leave granted.




Senator WONG:
  I table the petition and thank the Senate.
