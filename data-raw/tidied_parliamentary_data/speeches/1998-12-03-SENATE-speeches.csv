"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The opposition does not accept Democrat amendment No. 2. We think the attempt 
 by the Democrats to broaden the range of activities that would be covered by the legislation is well meaning but it does not fit within the structure of the scheme of which this legislation is certainly the most integral part.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 2:
(2)	 Clause 5, page 3 (lines 15 to 20), omit ""does not include:"" and paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of  activity , substitute ""does include the formulation of policy"".
The purpose of this amendment is to include the formulation of policy in the definitions. This bill relates to pollution on Commonwealth land and Commonwealth activities. Our amendment adds the notion that Commonwealth decisions and policies are also relevant and should be included. The Commonwealth makes decisions all the time that deal with pollution and we felt that it was important to include this in the definitions rather than exclude it.
—In light of the fact that Senator Hill is not here, I wonder whether Senator Allison could give the committee some further explanation in respect of that amendment.
—The definitions currently state that an `activity means a physical activity that has a direct effect on, or represents a substantial risk of damage to'. But the first part of clause 5 states:
. . . to avoid doubt, does not include:
(a) 	 the formulation of a policy; or
(b)	 the making of a decision by a Minister or by a person to whom a Minister has, under an Act or an instrument. . .
The amendment removes paragraph (b) and indicates that formulation of policy should be part of that activity.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

Amendment, as amended, not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 1 and 4:
(1)	 Clause 5, page 7 (line 8), before ""matter"", insert ""prescribed"".
(4)	 Clause 11, page 13 (lines 18 to 22), omit paragraph (b), substitute:
		 (b)	 that the application of that alternative Commonwealth regime is more appropriate than taking any action under this Part because the activity involves a specified matter of national interest.
The amendments go to the definition of national interest. Under this regime, matters of national interest can be exempted from the operation of the environmental laws. The opposition has a concern that matters of national interest as defined by the government are too extensive.
We have two concerns. One is that the government is seeking to exempt matters relating to telecommunications activity and aviation. We understand that there would be circumstances in which telecommunications and aviation would relate to the national interest. But we think that the blanket exemption that could be given as a consequence of the definition of matters of national interest in the government's legislation is too broad. So amendment No. 1 is designed to allow for the prescription of matters relating to telecommunications and aviation and, as a matter of construct, matters can be prescribed in these two areas if it is assessed that they are in the national interest. We are not embracing the concept that all telecommunications and aviation matters are in the national interest but we move an amendment to allow for the exemption of certain telecommunications and aviation matters that may be in the national interest.
Amendment No. 4 goes to the exemption capacity proposed by the government in clause 11, page 13. The government is seeking to allow exclusion from the effect of environmental protection measures for reasons of administrative efficiency. It is our view that the government is seeking to give itself a pretty broad blank cheque.
Amendment No. 4 is designed to delete the capacity the government seeks to give itself to exclude matters for reasons of administrative efficiency. On looking at these two amendments, it seems to me that maybe they should not have been handled together. But, 
 since we have given leave for them to be handled together and as I expect the vote will be the same on both, it is probably appropriate that we do handle them conjointly.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—We conceded at the second reading stage that the issue of national interest, as it is defined, and therefore the exclusions that follow from it under the scheme of this bill, is clearly an issue of contention.
What the opposition is seeking to do, as I understand it, in relation to the first amendment is to provide that it would need to be a prescribed national interest. We would argue that that would be unduly restrictive. We do set out here limitations of national interest in the scheme of this bill and that is adequate. The second proposal, again, is to further restrict the provisions that we have put in the bill which take into account administrative efficiency. Again, we would argue that that is a restriction that is not warranted.
The scheme is that, one way or another, the measure will be adopted, because that is what the ministerial council and the vote of the Commonwealth minister on it is determining. So the measure will be implemented at a Commonwealth level. The issue then is whether we do it through our own processes or whether we adopt a state law. We believe that the former more appropriately applies. It is a matter of national interest and there is, therefore, no risk in providing some flexibility within that definition. It is a safer course of action to provide that rather than be unduly restrictive at this stage.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The regime will be implemented anyway. It is just a matter of whether you do it or whether it is done under state law. Can you tell us how that applies, through which subsection or clause that will have effect?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—The scheme of any PC process is that a measure is determined by a ministerial council of Commonwealth and state ministers to provide a consistent level of environmental protection across a range of different areas. Part of the scheme under the previous act is 
 that it will then be implemented by both state and Commonwealth authorities. The issue for the Commonwealth, to which this bill relates, is whether it needs to be implemented through the internal processes of the Commonwealth or by adoption of a state law that purports to cover the field. In relation to national interest, we argue that the scheme of this bill has been so constructed as to provide that it go through the Commonwealth procedures rather than through the adoption of state law.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—Essentially, you are saying that there is no real requirement in legislation that we ensure that that happens, Minister. We will get back to national interest in a minute. I refer to the exemption for reasons of administrative efficiency. You have to concede that that is a pretty broad exemption. When you look at environmental decisions taken consistently across this country, there is always an argument to do the opposite—to allow development, fast-tracking or whatever—which are factors of administrative efficiency or economic efficiency and so on. Can you have another look at that exemption for reasons of administration efficiency? It is such a nebulous, or catch-all, clause that basically it will allow a gutting of the full impact of the legislation that we are talking about.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—I would concede that an exclusion for administrative efficiency does not perhaps have the same import as some others. On that basis, perhaps we could vote on the first amendment. I will give the second amendment a little more thought as this debate proceeds this morning and then we can come back to it a little later. I would be prepared to do that.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—In that case I seek leave to withdraw the earlier request that both amendments, Nos 1 and 4, be handled together.
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Watson)—You can divide the question.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. Minister, going back to the national interest definition, I am sure you would concede that not every Telecom activi 
 ty is in the national interest—for example, the digging up of roads for the purposes of cables, dishes or whatever in obscure places of Australia. It is a pretty broad sweep to argue that that could be in the national interest when, for instance, you compare it to more sensitive Telecom activities or more sensitive aviation activities. Do you not concede that there should be a distinction between those activities in the national interest and the broader sweep of telecommunications and aviation activities?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—I do concede it in a way, if I can put it in context. The trend over some years, and I think it will continue—and that is because it should—is that the Commonwealth is accepting that more of these state environmental laws should bind the Commonwealth now. It has taken us a while to reach that stage, but that is the trend and we actually believe that it is the correct way to go.
At this stage, however, we are in something of an interim status in that whilst the Commonwealth is approaching the issue of state environmental laws in a more constructive way in some areas, such as telecommunications and control of air services, there are clearly issues that are still, beyond doubt in our view, of national interest—issues such as our acceptance of a national responsibility to provide a framework within which a national system of air transport can operate. But within that framework there are obviously some subsets of responsibilities that may not be a state responsibility but are more appropriately a local government responsibility.
I am suggesting to the opposition that, whilst we are in the stage in which this concept of the Commonwealth accepting a greater proportion of state environmental laws is evolving, it would be better not to be unduly prescriptive, but to recognise that state ministers, pursuant to these changing attitudes, would interpret national interest in a way that reflects that change of attitude.
Senator Bolkus is seeking to limit the Commonwealth by having to regulate up front which aspects of national interest should apply under this part, whereas we are saying 
 that for the next few years anyway, that should rather be done through the administrative processes of a minister having that discretion.
I have no doubt that a little further down the track Commonwealth governments will be more willing to go to the next step, which might be to be more definitive about what parts of a particular area of responsibility are clearly national and what parts are clearly state or, ultimately, in some of these areas, it may pass the responsibility across to the states altogether.
I put it to Senator Bolkus that we are seeking the Senate's acceptance that we are in a state where we have an evolving regime in this area. We have sought, in this bill, to reflect that process of evolution and, therefore, not to be unduly restrictive at this stage.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I fear, Mr Temporary Chairman, that this might be one of those areas where, if the government had put up the proposal first they would probably be rusted onto it whereas, if the opposition puts it up, there may be some reluctance to accept it institutionally. I recognise that you are talking about an evolving area. It has evolved enormously over the last 10 years. But isn't it better to have a situation where that evolutionary process can be recognised in a way that allows you to wind down the areas of exemption by the mechanism that we are proposing?
Your proposal, basically, allows for a full sweep. Our proposal allows you to prescribe matters relating to telecom and aviation activities that may be deemed to be in the national interest. As you say, this changes. It is becoming more and more limited as time goes by. A regulatory mechanism is probably most appropriate to handle that diminishing area that would need to be exempted. I do not think you have persuaded us, Minister, but hopefully you can reflect on this during our continuing discussion of it.
In essence, if you look at the proposal we are putting up to you, it allows prescription of matters relating to telecom and aviation. Okay, it is by regulation; but the regulatory process is a pretty open one for government to access, as you know.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—It is a matter of preference, and the opposition is putting a slightly more radical proposal than what we have. Ours is slightly more conservative in terms of the Commonwealth coming to this acceptance of state laws cautiously.
Whilst I hear what Senator Bolkus says in relation to regulations, I do not think it is necessary at this stage. In 1999, there is going to be a review of the whole process and how it is working in practice. If this bill is passed today and we can start to implement national environment protection measures as they are made by the council, then within a couple of years we will be able to determine whether in fact the law as we seek to set it out today is working well or whether we can take the next step forward in further limiting the right of the Commonwealth to intervene. Ours is a more cautious approach, but we would still wish to see it adopted in those terms.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 3:
(3)	 Clause 5, page 7 (lines 16 to 18), omit:
	 ; or (c)	 any other matter agreed between the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories"".
This amendment takes out a clause under the definition of national interest that we would regard as being hugely discretionary. It allows the government to introduce any matter as a matter of national interest, provided it is agreed to between the Commonwealth, states and territories. I ask the minister: what kinds of matters might typically fall into this category? Since we have foreign affairs, national security and defence, national emergency, and telecommunications and aviation, it is hard to imagine another matter that might be regarded as being in the national interest beyond those already listed. So the Democrats do not regard this as being necessary and in fact believe that it provides an out that is not reasonable.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—I think the Democrats are a little 
 overly concerned. We are simply dealing with the definition of matters of national interest. We are saying that it is a matter of national interest if the Commonwealth and the states agree that it is.
Bear in mind that, as we said a little earlier, we are talking about a scheme for implementation at the Commonwealth level of national environment protection measures—a standard for measures across Australia—and when it is more appropriate for it to be implemented by the Commonwealth under its administrative or legal procedures and when it is more appropriate for the states. If the Commonwealth and the states agree that it is more appropriate that it be dealt with under the Commonwealth, on the basis that it is a matter of national interest, I cannot see how that could be of concern. It just strikes me as sensible to include this provision so as to cover circumstances that are not easily identifiable—and that is the whole point—but where the Commonwealth and the states at some time in the future believe that the Commonwealth processes are more appropriate. We do specifically refer to issues such as telecommunications and air transport. We know aspects of national interest that are involved within those, but there may be others where the Commonwealth and the states jointly agree that it is more appropriate to deal with them at a national level. It is simply to provide that flexibility that we have included the provision in the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—Does this then mean that any other matter which is agreed between the Commonwealth and the states would not have to come back to the parliament? Wouldn't it be better to leave the definitions as they are currently stated and, if something arises that means there is another matter that needs to be added to those prescribed matters, to alter the legislation at that point? Again, I wonder what kinds of things you had in mind. I do not know that it is good enough to say, `Well, we can't think of any at this point in time, but it's just there in case we do.' There must be some examples that come to mind.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—The point is that the safeguard is in the fact that the states have to agree, and the states do not readily agree with the Commonwealth that matters are of national significance and should be dealt with by the Commonwealth unless it is obvious in the extreme. I am saying that it is specifically designed to provide that extra flexibility in the future if the Commonwealth and the states agree.
What Senator Allison says is correct: you could leave it out and if such an event occurred in the future you could then seek to legislate to provide for it as a matter of national interest, but that is obviously a complex, time-consuming process. Bear in mind that this bill has been in the Senate for practically 18 months before being debated. We do not apologise for the fact that it is designed to provide that extra bit of flexibility, but the safeguard is in the fact that the states have to agree. I respectfully suggest that the safeguard aspect is something that Senator Allison is not taking into account.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—I would ask, then, about the process of the states agreeing. Does that mean that all states and territories would need to agree? It seems to me that that process would be just as lengthy as a process of bringing it back to the parliament.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—That is a question of interpretation. I would suspect it would be interpreted on the basis that a resolution of the National Environment Protection Council—which is the state and Commonwealth body in this matters—that a particular matter be dealt with at the Commonwealth level as a matter of national interest would be accepted to satisfy that provision. On the run, that is my best interpretation—that that would be in the spirit of what is there. It would be within the spirit of the whole of the scheme of implementing the national environment protection measures and would be an appropriate and timely vehicle to reach the conclusion that a specific matter should be dealt with as a matter national interest.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—Senator Hill sounds reasonable, but let us just analyse what the government is trying to do here and get a real fix on the mechanism that is being proposed. I suspect that people who may be listening to this debate outside may in fact be wondering what we are on about. We are talking about an exemption for matters of national interest. We are talking about an exemption from a scheme to ensure application of state environmental regimes to the Commonwealth—the environment protection measures. We are basically saying we need to recognise that there need to be exclusions for matters of national interest. We define them as Australia's relations with another country, international obligations, national security, national defence, national emergency—all those things are pretty well okay; they come within the normal definition of national interest.
The government then says, `We want two more huge catch-all clauses to allow exclusion'—and I note that Senator Hill is still considering this—`and we want to be able to exclude matters for administrative efficiency.' He has gone from national interest down to administrative efficiency. He then says, `But we also want to exclude matters on the grounds of national interest if it is any other matter'—not just a prescribed set of matters—`agreed between the Commonwealth, the states and territories.' I would have thought exclusion on the conventional grounds of matters of national interest would be sufficient. It is pretty broad as it is. It has all the consequences of the common law definitions that apply to it.
If we were to embrace what the state premiers may agree to as being a matter of national interest, without any parameters to it, we would be building a house with back doors and no walls, so people could get out of it. If you were to top it up with exclusions for reasons of administrative efficiency, you might as well write off the legislation altogether. Why do we need this legislation? Why don't we just sit down with the state premiers and try to find other ways of overturning Henderson's case in the High Court? If you want to give this legislation authority and respectability, you do not do it by defining 
 national interest as including any deal that is done overnight at the Hyatt Hotel at a get-together of premiers and the Prime Minister, and you definitely do not include reasons of administrative efficiency.

However, I have to say to you that the bells did not ring in my office. I just checked during that division, and they did not ring again, and then they started ringing, so there is some fault there.
—Is someone going to seek leave to have the question put again?

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-03,"—by leave—Rather than not grant leave, I would like to make a short statement on this matter. I would be interested to hear from Senator Woodley why he would vote for this proposition. Does he know what the proposition is?
Honourable senators interjecting—
—This is not funny.
—Probably for the same reasons you voted for it, Brian.
—Why did I vote for it? What if I missed a division? What if I wasn't here for a division and I came down here and sought for it to be recommitted? Would the government do it?
—Yes.
—Would the opposition do it?
—Yes.
—When I am in my office studying, very frequently I am en 
 grossed in what is there, or indeed I am engaged in important discussions about very serious questions on which the Senate is going to vote, for example, on the health measure that is coming up or a number of other measures, like the National Transmission Authority. It frequently happens that I am in the middle of those things. I have had to get across all the detail of the matters before us, particularly if it is legislation.
I do not think opposition or government frontbenchers or backbenchers have a clue what is involved, not only for me but for Senator Colston. I have got to the stage now where the list is regularly put up of notices of motion on very important matters and you expect it to go through by a nod, or be declared formal. It is all right for you people on both sides of the chamber. You are told what to do by your ministers and by your shadow ministers. You would not have a clue very often what you are voting for. But, so far as I am concerned, I need to go into detail, and some of those notices of motion require study of about two or three hours and getting material about them. I think that we ought to have a good look at that particular procedure whereby people come in and give notices of motion about all sorts of things. I am not suggesting that they are not important; of course they are important. But, if they are important, if I am going to vote I need to be on top of the subject.
That is why I am not inclined now to even come down to a vote when the matter is not debated. Unless one spends hours and hours on particular matters, how can one cast a vote? You don't have to spend those hours and hours on those particular matters, but I do—if I am going to vote. I again ask the government and the opposition: if I missed a vote in the same circumstances as Senator Margetts missed the vote, would I be given leave to have the matter recommitted and would the matter be recommitted?

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-03,"—by leave—In answer to Senator Harradine's question, the bill is the National 
 Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill. We meet every morning in our party room and all of the amendments are discussed there fully. I will admit to Senator Harradine that I am not necessarily on top of every detail of every amendment. But I am certainly aware that the amendment was to do with the definition, and I was in agreement with the opposition's amendment at that point. I owed Senator Harradine that explanation at least.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—by leave—Our attitude is that there has to be some discipline within this process, otherwise there would be no need to come down to vote in the first instance. We do expect an explanation that is credible. We expect the defaulting senator to humbly come before us, look contrite and all those things and ask for forgiveness. That is part of the disincentive to misbehave in this way.
—Are you defending Richard Alston?
—My deputy leader has had to do it several times.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—We have noted that it has been effective and that he's been doing a lot better lately. We would hope that it would have the same influence upon Senator Margetts. If the excuse is that the bells were not ringing or you got locked in the loo or something or other, there is not much doubt about it. If the excuse is `I was engrossed in my work', it becomes a judgment. If you were not a repeat offender, I would accept the excuse. I think it is possible to be so engrossed in work within this place, particularly if bells have been ringing regularly and you have to watch whether they are green bells or red bells, that—I am pleased to say this has not occurred to me in 17 years—you inadvertently miss a division even though you were taking reasonable care. That is the way that I would interpret it, so to Senator Harradine: yes, our practice would be so if there were a reasonable explanation. I would regard that as a reasonable explanation if you were not a repeat offender. In those circumstances I 
 would accept the explanation that Senator Margetts has made on this occasion.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-03,"—by leave—As I understand the issue before the chamber, Senator Harradine has raised the issue of whether it is appropriate to recommit a vote. He has asked the hypothetical question, in relation to a division that he might miss, whether in the ordinary course of events the government, the opposition or other senators would give leave for a vote to be recommitted. I outlined yesterday in the chamber the general approach that the opposition has taken. I think that even harsh critics of the opposition would have to acknowledge we have taken it consistently; that is, that the will of the Senate ought to be reflected in voting on the floor.
—So you are saying the same thing about Senator Margetts as you would say about Senator Alston?
—I don't know why you are bringing Senator Alston up.
—Because he's a habitual offender.
—I see. I wish Senator Macdonald wouldn't draw attention to the fact that Senator Alston is a habitual offender. We know that he misses a lot of divisions, Senator Macdonald. I am sure he appreciates the fact that you are continually drawing attention to the fact. One of the reasons the opposition has had to adopt this consistent approach of allowing the will of the Senate to be reflected in divisions is that Senator Alston has missed so many divisions over such a long period of time.
Yesterday there was another reason; there was an explanation made. I think that, as a general rule—and certainly one that I and the opposition have adopted—our approach is that if there is to be a recommittal, the senators involved do owe the Senate an explanation before a vote is recommitted. Again, that is a point I made yesterday to the chamber, and also made to the government whip in the Senate, who obviously acknowledged it to some extent because he expanded on the original explanation. He developed that 
 explanation a little later during the decision to recommit.
Yesterday the recommittal that we dealt with was about the very important issue, as Senator Harradine would know, of the production of documents on the goods and services tax. The vote was originally to support my motion. It was agreed to by the Senate and a recommittal was going to mean, of course, that vote would be lost on equal numbers. So these things can have quite a serious impact if a recommittal is taken.
But the principle is—and all you can do is try and consistently apply a principle—that the will of the Senate be reflected in these votes. If a senator has a reasonable explanation—which goes to Senator Harradine's point—or a whip has a reasonable explanation for why a division result may have been different, I believe it is appropriate for recommittal to be agreed to and for the will of the Senate to be reflected in the final count of any division.
I have the disadvantage of having been involved in another meeting while this particular debate has been carried on. I was paired for the last couple of divisions, I might say, but let me make that contribution in relation to the general principle that the opposition will apply to this situation.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—I note on the running sheet that Democrat amendments Nos 4, 19 and 25 have been grouped together.

—Could we proceed just with amendment number No. 4 at this stage?
—It is up to you whatever you move.
—I move Democrat amendment No. 4:
(4)	 Clause 10, page 10 (lines 14 to 16), omit subclause (2).
This is a way of making the Commonwealth liable. Pollution consequences are the same no matter who is responsible for them. The Democrats would argue that the laws that apply to corporations should also apply to the Commonwealth. I think it is fair to say that the community has expectations now that there ought to be punishment for offences against the environment.
There may be longstanding legal issues about the criminal liability of the Crown but, one way or another, these are being slowly whittled away by the High Court, and they are in other states as well. We think this is an important amendment, and we urge the Senate's support.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I say at the start that I am pleased Senator Allison has chosen not to proceed with all the amendments together and has singled out No. 4.
The issue before the parliament now is to what extent Commonwealth officials should be subject to the state laws as they apply to state officials and any other person living in the community. The government is seeking to exempt Commonwealth officials from the operation of state criminal law, and does so 
 by the substantive clause that we are discussing now.
The opposition does not support that sort of exemption. We believe an integral part of this legislation should be to allow the operation to its full effect of state law that is deemed to apply in the circumstances. We have had no real argument from the government as to why Commonwealth officials should be in a different position to state officials or should be in a different position to other members of the community.
One can go at length into a discussion about this sort of exemption from criminal law; the Commonwealth may, in fact, be anticipating technical breaches of criminal law. But, with the way that this exemption is drafted in the legislation, there are all sorts of unintended consequences in terms of the protection that would be given to Commonwealth officials. I think the government needs to have a sober reflection as to what it is trying to do here.
The reason I am pleased that the Democrats have not proceeded with Nos 19 and 25 together with No. 4, is that I think the Democrats try and go a bit further than what was originally planned in this legislative scheme. Not only do they, through amendment No. 4, rekindle the application of state criminal laws, but Nos 19 and 25 would bring in new criminal offences to the regime. The opposition is not prepared to go to that extent.
We recognise the merit of these sorts of offences, we recognise the merit of trying to tackle some of the conduct that the Democrats are trying to tackle. For us, instructional legislation is such that it would basically demand the continued application of state criminal law. But it does not mean the implementation of a new and broader regime on environmental protection. Desirable as that might be, and there are other ways of approaching it, this legislation, this mechanism, this state and Commonwealth arrangement, does not embody a new raft of criminal offences. To that extent we will not be supporting Nos 19 and 25, but we do say very strongly that No. 4 needs to be supported because all it really does is allow the continued application of state criminal law.
Basically, what the Commonwealth is doing with its proposal to exempt officials from state criminal laws is to put them in an even more superior position to diplomats, who have some minimal exemption from state legislation. But this particular provision in the government's bill goes much wider than that and, as I said earlier, has some unintended consequences. We think the measured way to go is to knock out the provision that amendment No. 4 seeks to knock out but not to go further and incorporate new offences.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—The government is opposed to the amendment. We believe that the provision we have inserted within the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998  reflects longstanding Commonwealth policy. I am a little surprised, because if my advice is correct it would have been the policy also of the preceding Labor government. During the long walk across the chamber, they may well have changed their mind on such a fundamental principle. We are not seeking to be as revolutionary as some others in the chamber but rather to reconfirm the situation which has been the case for a long time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The view of the previous Labor government was to allow the application of criminal laws to at least federal government authorities and, I suppose, GBEs and those categories of federal institutions. On reflection, we have recognised that, for instance, to allow exemption from criminal liability to officers of the Department of Administrative Services, as it was in one of its many manifestations, but to not allow it to other arms of the federal bureaucracy because they might have been corporatised is a distinction which is pretty hard to sustain.
Once again, if you look at the example of the old Department of Administrative Services, some of the arms of that department were traditional Public Service structures and some of the other arms of the department 
 have been corporatised. You would have got to a situation where the luck of the draw was such that, had you been corporatised, you may have been exempt from criminal liability but, had you not been corporatised, then you would not have been. So that sort of consideration has been one that we have reflected on, as you say, in the long march to this side of the chamber. As a consequence, we think, for the sake of consistency and fairness, the position we take now is more defensible. We do not embrace the concept of incorporating new offences and a wider range of offences that has been proposed in latter amendments.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1998-12-03,"—by leave—Madam Deputy President, you may recall that there was a recommittal of opposition amendment No. 1 due to the fact that Senator Margetts missed the call and consequently that amendment was resubmitted. I am afraid that, due to an error on our side, the absence of one of our senators, who was paired, was not notified through to the acting whip at the time. It was a genuine mistake on our part.
I am pleased to see that Senator Faulkner is here. I beg his indulgence to resubmit that amendment. My clerk admitted that she read the whip's letter incorrectly. The letter said `11.45' and she read it as `10.45'. Hence Senator Troeth was out of the building and paired. She did not come to the division and so was not counted. I ask the indulgence of the Senate to recommit opposition amendment No. 1. I believe it is a very important amendment. I do not believe that currently the true reflection of numbers has been given.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-03,"—by leave—No doubt we all await the humiliating backdown from Senator Hill after the contribution he made after the last vote was recommitted. This is why I think it is so important that we try to stick with the principle on these sorts of issues as opposed to making short-term partisan political advantage when—
—It is a long road that does not turn.
—That is exactly right, Senator Ray. The problem for the government at the moment is that the road is going round and round in circles. The proposition from Senator Calvert that the vote be recommitted is very embarrassing. The government has been humiliated here, having criticised non-government—not Labor Party—senators for missing the very same division which they have now fouled up. It is as simple as that. The opposition consistently applies the principle that the—
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—You cannot count, that is true. That is becoming more and more clear. We have consistently applied the principle that the will of the Senate should be assured in divisions and that the vote should reflect the will of the Senate. For that reason, as far as the opposition is concerned, leave will be granted. Whether or not Senator Margetts and the Australian Democrats will be as generous as the opposition, I do not know—having received that lecture from Senator Hill about their responsibilities in the chamber.
I think we can put that down to hubris on the part of Senator Hill—a bit of sanctimonious hypocrisy at 22 minutes past 11 on a Thursday morning of the second-last sitting week. I suppose you can be forgiven, Senator Hill.	We do not expect any more foul-ups from Senator Hill. We suggest that you sit down with your team, give them a lecture, tell them to come along to the divisions, and you would not have to put up with senators making the sorts of contributions that I have just made.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-03,"—by leave—Of course, this is an understandable error. It goes to the point that I have made before. One of the senators has been paired. In fact, there were 11 senators missing on the last occasion. One of the senators, Senator Troeth, is on very important business. She is able to get a pair, just as others are able to get a pair. It is all right for them; they do not have to come down to the 
 chamber. I do not know how much time we have spent in this chamber unproductively. I would have thought that each vote has taken at least seven minutes.
—Eight.
—Eight, is it? This is interfering with the very important work that a number of us have and which involves other people.
—It is what you are getting paid for.
—I am talking about getting on top of legislation that is forthcoming and discussing matters with people outside this chamber.
—That is your job.
—Of course it is my job. But you do not do it. You say that you give your people pairs when they have meetings with people outside this parliament. You say, `Oh well, we'll get you a pair. We won't have you in here.' I do not have the ability to do that. Or are you going to be able to give me a pair?
—As I understand it, your consistent position is that you do not want that.
—Order, Senator Faulkner!
—I ask you, through the chair: would you give me a pair if I asked for it?
—I will tell you what we ought to do: if you want to ask me that question, if you make some sort of formal—
—Senator Faulkner!
—I am asking it publicly and I am asking the government publicly about that matter. I take this opportunity of asking that question publicly.
—How do we know how you are going to vote?
—Because I will tell you beforehand. How do you know how your people are going to vote, because very often they don't know anything about the legislation? 
—We have a caucus decision, you see.
—Order! Senator Faulkner and Senator Harradine, please address the chair.

You could not get the numbers in Kyoto and you could not get them here. In light of the fact that the previous Democrat amendment was passed, opposition amendment No. 2 becomes somewhat redundant, so we will not pursue it.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments Nos 5, 6, 7 and 8:
(5)	 Clause 10, page 11 (line 23), after ""must"", insert "", within 28 days"".
(6)	 Clause 10, page 12 (line 12), omit ""may"", substitute ""must, within 28 days"".
(7)	 Clause 10, page 12 (line 26), after ""Environment Minister"", insert ""within 28 days of receiving the recommendation"".
(8)	 Clause 10, page 12 (line 28), omit ""(if any)"".
These amendments put a time frame on the reporting process and give, in each case, 28 days for each stage and ensure that those reports do not just sit on somebody's desk for a longer period. We would expect the government to be sympathetic to these amendments. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill certainly has time constraints in it. The minister is required, within a short time frame, to see that decisions get through the bureaucracy. I think this is consistent with that bill.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I move:
(3)	 Clause 10, page 12 (after line 32), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (8)	 Within 15 sitting days after receiving a report under subsection (6) or (7), the relevant Minister must cause a copy of the recommendations, comments and the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.
In the spirit of the agreement that was just reached, could I move this in a slightly amended form? What we seek to do here is to ensure some degree of accountability to the parliament by having the documents that are part of the process tabled in the parliament—not just the recommendations, but also the preceding report and the departmental secretary's comments in respect of that report.
The motion as proposed argues that, within 15 sitting days after receiving the report, the minister must cause a copy of the recommendations, comments and report to be tabled in each house of parliament. I seek leave to change that to 60 days as well to be consistent with the previous amendment that was accepted by the government.
As I say, there is a process that is embodied in clause 10 of the bill—that is, that a territory may report contraventions. Those contraventions, by way of a report from the state or territory, go to the environment secretary. He then gives written notice to the secretary of the department or the CEO of the authority setting out draft recommendations and asking for comments, asking for a response to those recommendations, and action is then taken or not taken as a consequence of that report and comments and recommendations. I probably do not need to explain it any further.
—Is it 60 days or 60 sitting days?
—I did say 60 days, but 15 sitting days, or maybe even 30 sitting days if the government is prepared to accept that 
 sort of proposal. They may argue that 15 sitting days is too short—though, as the assistant clerk says, `sitting days' basically gives us an extended regime. Can I reconsider on the run and suggest that we proceed with the proposal as circulated, 15 sitting days, but may I indicate to the government that, if they think we may need extra time, we are prepared to consider that.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—I do not think it is a question of the number of days; it is rather a question of the principle. This has been structured so that it is a ministerial responsibility to consider the reports rather than a parliamentary responsibility. I do not really see why the recommendations and comments and report should be tabled.
I would ask Senator Bolkus to take into account the fact that there is an annual reporting requirement in the principal act. The business that is pursued thereunder will become part of the annual report and subject to the scrutiny of the parliament, but the need to do it at each stage in relation to a recommendation that is made would seem to me to be somewhat excessive.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—It could very well develop into a situation where, between the actual offence or the activity taking place and the department reporting to parliament, you could have some 13, 14 or 15 months during which the activity could continue. We all know that heads of departments are busy people and quite often prioritise things. We do not want to be in a situation where, because of a report, because of a recommendation not being acted upon or not being sufficiently acted upon, or not being given sufficient priority, an activity which may be of concern to a state or a territory continues to drag on.
The offence or the pollution could be of a continuing nature and, as a consequence, we think it important that there be some sort of monitoring mechanism, some sort of public scrutiny capacity available to ensure not just that the parliament knows that this is happening, and that the parliament consequently has a capacity to address the issue, but also—as 
 I found when I was a minister—that public officials comply with their obligations. The best way is to ensure that they are aware of the fact that, at the end of the day, their compliance or non-compliance is made public. If they know, for instance, that this has to be tabled within 15 sitting days, then you can be sure they will be much keener to resolve the issue than if they knew that they could wait for some 15 months for the annual report to be tabled in parliament. So they are the reasons for urgency that we think are important in having a much more immediate tabling process than waiting for an annual report.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 10:
(10)	 Clause 11, page 13 (line 17), omit ""appropriate"", substitute ""improved"".
This amendment aims to insert the word `improved' processes rather than talking about `appropriate' processes. We should not just have a decision based on a loose definition of what is `appropriate', but we should agree that the Commonwealth action is `improved'. We should be working towards a better regime rather than one which maintains the status quo—or goes backwards, presumably.
I would be surprised if the government could not support us on this. I imagine it, too, would like to see that, given that the object of the bill is to improve the situation in relation to pollution and the environment. So this amendment seeks to substitute the word `improved' for `appropriate' environment outcomes.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—I will try to persuade Senator Allison that what she is proposing is not really `appropriate'—to use the expression in the bill. 	 Although the whole scheme is to provide for improved environmental protection, what this part is doing is, in effect, providing the circumstances when the meas 
 ure—that is, the standard that has been determined by the Commonwealth and the states—will be implemented through Commonwealth rather than state processes. One of the tests is whether there is an alternative Commonwealth regime which will achieve the appropriate environmental outcome. The appropriate environmental outcome is the standard that has been agreed by the National Environment Protection Council.
So, in relation to a particular standard, it may not be an improvement in that it might be a standard that has already been adopted by the Commonwealth. It might be that the Commonwealth standard is a higher standard, for example—which happens in some instances. But the word `appropriate' is designed to tie it to the measure that has been determined; whereas, if you talk about an `improved' environmental outcome, as opposed to an `appropriate' one, `improved' is not a word that links it to the standard at all.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—We might save time by the government ganging up with the Democrats in this instance and putting through the Democrats amendment instead of the opposition's. I have thought about it further, and I think Senator Bolkus's concern is misplaced. It can only occur when there is an alternative Commonwealth regime for implementation of the NEPM. Firstly, you have to have an alternative Commonwealth regime so you are not going to have a slippage, you are not going to lose as a result of it. Secondly, subparagraph (b) simply seeks to clarify the circumstances in which you would bring it in, and you would bring it in if there was an activity involving a specific matter of national interest or for administrative efficiency.
When you think about that, if it is administratively efficient to do it through the Commonwealth regime and the Commonwealth regime exists, then why not do it that way? Surely it amounts to sensible practice. I think that is the case, with respect, against the opposition's proposal. Whilst I regard the 
 words in the Democrats amendment as somewhat superfluous, I do not think they are fatal. If it would save time, I would be prepared to settle it on that basis.

These are pretty simple amendments. In many ways, they do not increase the obligation on governments, because the documents which we want tabled are documents which would appear in the Gazette . We think it is important for the process of parliament, and also for recognising the importance of environmental concerns in the administration of government, that the declarations not only be gazetted but also be tabled within 15 sitting days.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I ask Senator Allison to reconsider moving amendments Nos 12 and 13 together. The opposition cannot support Democrats amendment No. 13. We recognise that amendment No. 13 seeks to remove an exemption provision which basically only allows for regulations to be made when there are considerations relating to matters of national interest. We do not have as many problems with that as the Democrats do.
With respect to Democrat amendment No. 12, which goes to clause 13 on page 15, the Democrats essentially want to ensure continuation of state regimes with respect to the use of land, environmental impact and administrative review. Given the debate we had in this place on Wik native title and the government's long preaching to the parliament and the country about the use of land being in the domain of the states, it is quite ironic that we come here today and we see the government wanting to remove the application of state provisions as to the use of land in respect of the Commonwealth and its authorities. So I say to Senator Allison that we are prepared to support your amendment No. 12 but we are not prepared to support your amendment No. 13.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

There is within paragraph (c) an exception to the extent that the provision requires a licence, permit or other authorisation for the construction, alteration or demolition of a building or structure or for the installation, alteration or removal of any plant or equipment for the purposes of implementing a NEPM.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 8 and 9:
(8)	 Clause 17, page 20 (lines 5 to 12), omit paragraphs (a) and (b), substitute: 

		 (a)	 a provision of a law of a State (other than an excluded State) or of a law of a Territory (other than an excluded Territory) is necessary for the implementation of an NEPM; and
		 (b)	 apart from this subsection, the provision would not apply to the carrying on of an activity by the Commonwealth or a particular Commonwealth authority;
(9)	 Clause 17, page 20 (lines 23 to 26), omit subclause (2).
What we seek to do here with opposition amendments Nos 8 and 9 is to delete the clauses that the government proposes in respect of the general application of state provisions and to replace them with the clauses that were present in the 1996 draft of the bill, the bill of the previous government.
Basically, what we are addressing here is the concern of both the New South Wales and Victorian governments, the EPAs of those two states, and of some members of the Senate committee on the legislation. For instance, the New South Wales government, in its submission to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee earlier this year, said:
The bill appears to reflect a Commonwealth decision not to allow state laws to apply of their own force in accordance with Henderson's case but rather to set up an inconsistency between those laws and the Commonwealth law that will ensure, subject to Commonwealth law, that the Commonwealth law prevails.
There is concern in the states that the developments in the common law, particularly in Henderson's case, are being overridden by the government's provisions in respect of this particular clause. The concern is essentially, as the New South Wales government said, that the bill's various exclusions, often qualifications on the application of state laws to Commonwealth activities, give the Commonwealth great scope to pick and choose which, if any, state laws it will apply to Commonwealth activities. There is a risk that this will result in a piecemeal Commonwealth approach to implementation of NEPMs.
The concern there from New South Wales is that we are setting up a pick and choose regime contrary to and in fact curtailing the operation of the Commonwealth law. It is a 
 recipe for ad hoc decision making. It is not immediately clear from the legislation which parts of state legislation are implementing NEPMs. As I said, it was not only New South Wales but also Victoria and its EPA representatives who were concerned about this particular provision. What we would argue is that you allow a general application rather than by declaration of the state legislation, of course recognising that the Commonwealth has a myriad of measures through which to curtail such operation. The concerns raised by the two major states are important in this matter, and our amendment seeks to address those concerns.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—Senator Bolkus does put an alternative process, which was the previous Labor government's preference, and that is that the provisions would automatically apply. Our preference is that we do have this process of a declaration by the environment minister, so it would be on that basis that it would apply and the environment minister has got that responsibility to consider and make such a declaration. So there is quite a fundamental difference between the parties on this particular matter. I guess in some ways it also reflects a previous discussion we had, that we are in an evolutionary process with this bill in the extent to which the Commonwealth is now accepting that it be subject to state law. We think that the position of evolution that has been achieved to date is more appropriately covered by the declaration process that we have included within this bill. Again, I would say that, when the whole of the NEPC regime is reconsidered in 1999, it might be that we would be able to move on another step. But at the moment we think this is the right level.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I move opposition amendment No. 10:
(10)	 Clause 18, page 23 (lines 1 to 5), omit subclause (5), substitute:
Matters to be taken into account in making regulations
	 (1)	 Regulations may only be made for the purposes of subsection (3) or (4) if the Governor-General in Council is satisfied that it is necessary to make the regulations because of considerations relating to:
		 (a)	 in respect of regulations for the purposes of subsection (3)—a matter of 
 national interest or an emergency situation; or
		 (b)	 in respect of regulations for the purposes of subsection (4)—a matter of national interest.
This amendment by the opposition is a simple one. In essence, it provides for regulations to be made by the Governor-General in Council, as opposed to the government's approach, which is essentially to have them made by the environment minister. The other difference between our amendment and the government's proposal is that in picking up the 1996 provision we also allow for regulations to be made under subclause 3 in emergency situations. So it does allow the government an extra capacity to make regulations in emergency situations but the price of that is it to demand that the regulations be made by the Governor-General in Council as opposed to the environment minister.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-12-03,"—I do not think it is a matter of great consequence but we would prefer the provision that we put in the bill, which is that regulations may be made only if the environment minister is first satisfied that it is desirable et cetera. That is within the scheme of the bill we are debating in which the environment minister has these various responsibilities. Why we would seek to pass that to the Governor-General in Council, when it got to this stage of the scheme, I do not quite understand. In other words, I do not think Senator Bolkus's alternative really adds a lot. I think what we have in the bill is rather consistent with the whole scheme, which is a scheme which does require certain responsibilities of the environment minister; and I think it is a better way to go. I would oppose Senator Bolkus's amendment on that basis.

So I do not know that much would be gained by the Australian Democrats amendment in relation to (2)(a). In relation to (b), which is to delete the words `either wherever the activity is carried on or', again I am not sure that the added restriction that is the effect of the Democrats amendment serves any useful purpose.

	 (2)	 In deciding whether a person is a fit and proper person, the relevant Minister must have regard to:
		 (a)	 any conviction of the person, or any body corporate of which the person is a director, for contravention of any Australian environment protection or related law; and
		 (b)	 any suspension or revocation of any licence or other authority held by the person, or any body corporate of which the person is a director, under any Australian environment protection or related law.

	 (1)	 The environmental audit for the purposes of the implementation of the NEPM is to consist of a periodic, documented evaluation of an activity or activities (including an evaluation of management practices, systems and plant) for either or both of the following purposes:
		 (a)	 to provide information to the person managing the activity or activities about compliance with legal requirements, codes of practice and relevant policies relating to the protection of the environment;
		 (b)	 to enable the person to determine whether the way the activity is carried on can be improved in order to protect the environment and to minimise waste.
(20)	 Clause 27, page 34 (line 6), at the end of subclause (1), add:
	 ; and (c)	 a declaration signed by the Secretary of the relevant Department or the Chief Executive Officer of the rel

			 (i)	 have not knowingly provided any false or misleading information; and
			 (ii)	 have provided all relevant information;
		 to the environmental auditor.
These amendments allow for environmental auditors. Even these do not go as far as some state legislation does. They allow for independent people to become accredited to the auditors so there is some kind of tightened independent reporting mechanism. I think it is important that there are environment auditors who are accredited who seek and collect documentation and provide that in a reasonably short time frame. This is a way to ensure that the objects of the act are met and that it is not just an act that is a feel good and public relations tool, but one that is practical and actually works.
These amendments will also ensure that only the most appropriate people are appointed as auditors, and that would, I think, reflect community expectations as to the highest standard for environment protection. The Democrats believe that the community expectation is that environment offences are so serious that heavy action and strong disincentives are justified to try and prevent it occurring.
We note that the self-incrimination provision is strong and provides an indemnity.

Maybe it would be appropriate for you to reconsider your position.
I think the distinction you made earlier was probably the right one: the bureaucracy has a great faith in itself to do things right in accordance with the way they would like to 
 do them, but that is not always the way the public or the parliament would like to do it. So the extra level of scrutiny may, in fact, be appropriate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-03,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 24:
(24)	 Clause 32, page 39 (after line 4), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (6)	 For the purposes of this section, the Environment Minister may, after consultation with the Secretary of the relevant Department or the Chief Executive Officer of the relevant Commonwealth authority, direct any Department or Commonwealth authority:
		 (a)	 to do anything within the powers of the Department or Commonwealth authority which will, in the opinion of the Environment Minister, contribute to environment protection; or
		 (b)	 to cease doing anything which, in the opinion of the Environment Minister, is adversely affecting environment protection.
This amendment adds a power to the minister to direct any department to improve its performance and to be proactive. Fines go to industry, small business and individuals and we would argue that the Commonwealth should not only be a leader but also should be seen as a leader on this issue. We have put in `may' instead of `must', just for a change, and we think this will only add to the government's credibility and options on the environment. I would be interested in hearing from the minister, if he does not support this amendment, why that is the case.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The opposition supports passage of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . The bill has two functions. Firstly, it repeals the Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978 to end the equalisation of export returns received for dried vine fruits. With the repeal of that legislation, it continues the initiatives that were commenced by the previous Labor government back in 1991 which saw the 
 equalisation for the domestic market abolished.
The second purpose of the legislation is to amend the Pig Industry Act 1986 and, in doing so, takes account of the fact that the Australian Food Council's Processed Meat Forum has replaced the National Meat Processor's Association as the representative body for meat processors. The act provides some changes to the selection process for the committee which makes recommendations to the minister with regard to membership of the Australian Pork Corporation. The current term of members of the board of the Australian Pork Corporation expires on 30 June 1999. The amendments contained in this legislation will allow for a new board to be formed by that date. The opposition supports passage of the bill.",SENATE,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-03,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  because it is beneficial. However, it raises a lot of issues about the pork industry which the Democrats want to put on the record. I notice in the other place that also people were provoked to do that. The pork industry is haemorrhaging and still there has been no action from the government. In supporting this bill, the Democrats want to say that, while it does a couple of helpful things, there is an awful long way to go. The government must move much further than simply arranging a few changes to a few directors, et cetera.
Last week, the government released the report of the Productivity Commission which found that safeguard actions and industry assistance are warranted. The government released this report two weeks after receiving it. Now it is a week later and still we have heard nothing. I understand that the minister responsible is yet to meet with the pork industry to discuss the report. The Democrats certainly would urge him to do that as the highest priority. Although there are other commodities which all of us are concerned about at this time, this commodity is in crisis.
The pork industry has lost about $100 million this year and cannot hang on much longer. The industry and the Democrats are 
 anxious for meaningful discussions with the government. The pork producers are begging for prompt action. We are also aware that, according to some reports, the Canadian government is considering a package of assistance to its grain and pork industries of around $700 million. While it is not clear how much of that will be allocated to Canadian pork producers, clearly this sort of assistance puts to shame the $20 million allocated by this government to the Australian pork industry—very small bickies indeed. What I want to underline is the very point which this chamber has been aware of, that imports have been damaging this industry. People in the Labor Party and I have been saying this for many months; I am not sure whether the Labor Party have said it as strongly as I have. The Productivity Commission was in no doubt about that. In that report it said:
The industry as a whole has lost market share to imports.
That is pretty clear. It continues:
Pig prices have fallen significantly since October 1997 and in the June quarter of 1998 were well below production costs of many, probably most, pig farmers. Many pig producers reported losses for 1997-98. The Pork Council of Australia survey showed that for a sample of pig farmers profitability fell from 7.6 per cent return on capital in 1996-97 to a negative return of $3.5 per cent in 1997-98. These results are in contrast to variable but high profits relative to all agriculture in previous years.
The Productivity Commission went on to say:
The Commission has examined a wide range of factors which may have contributed to the injury described above and has concluded that increased imports were the dominant cause of low pig prices and reduced profitability.
So it is quite clear. In fact, the commission said it was unable to find any other factor capable of explaining the large fall in demand for local pig meat and the consequent fall in pig meat prices since October 1997. I will not delay the Senate, but the Democrats were very concerned to note that, in supporting this bill, the government has an awfully long way to go in terms of this industry.
In conclusion, I put on the record the four-point rescue plan that both the pork industry and the Australian Democrats hope that the 
 government might adopt: to immediately implement a quota on pork imports from Canada and Denmark until the Australian industry has recovered; to introduce a 10 per cent tariff on manufactured Canadian pork imports, which is legal and allowable under WTO provisions; to increase the pork industry assistance package to boost funds for researching export development opportunities and to implement a $4 million marketing program for Australian branded pork; and, finally, to use all upcoming trade forums to push for reciprocal access for Australian pork to overseas markets. If the government does these things, it will do a great service to a very great Australian primary industry.",SENATE,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-03,"—There are many aspects of what Senator Woodley said with which the Labor Party agrees. Of course, we differ as to the emphasis that he would give to his actions in this area as against those of the Labor Party because, as I recall, it was the Labor Party which repeatedly drew to the attention of the Senate the plight of the pork industry, sometimes even to the annoyance of not only members of the government but also others who thought that there were other issues that ought to be given some precedence.
The fact is that we were able to draw to the attention of the Senate the plight of this industry, to the point that the Senate, including government senators, supported resolutions calling on the government to take action to investigate the harm that was being caused to this industry, which subsequently led to the Productivity Commission inquiry, late though it was, to which Senator Woodley referred. I acknowledge that we did that with the support of the Democrats and give all credit where credit is due in that regard.
The  Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , which deals with an administrative matter relating to the pork industry but not with the substance of their problems, is obviously a piece of legislation which will be passed by the parliament and therefore it means that some action is being taken by the government in relation to the pork industry.
This morning a motion was moved in the Senate which dealt with aspects of the Productivity Commission report referred to by Senator Woodley, and also urged the government to consider the timely implementation of measures that provide an effective short-term remedy for the serious injury that the Australian pork industry has suffered as a result of the matters mentioned in the Productivity Commission report. The Senate defeated that motion. The record of the division will show that the government and Senator Colston voted against the motion and it was lost on a tied vote.
So in terms of action, we have not progressed beyond the point at which we started—that is, this industry is in serious trouble. We do now know—it is an incontrovertible fact—that the trouble is caused by imports. That is what has been found by the Productivity Commission. I suspect that many people were doubtful as to whether the Productivity Commission would make that finding. Certainly, it was suggested by the government earlier this year that the damage being caused to the industry was caused by its own levels of production rather than by a problem with imports. We have now given that notion the attention it is due. We have come to the point where action is necessary and where we are still seeing a frustration of that action by the government.
The opposition, as Senator Forshaw said, will support this legislation. It is a great pity that we are not receiving support for matters which have a much more dramatic effect on the future of this industry. In that regard, I agree with the comments by Senator Woodley about the plight of the industry and the need for urgent action.",SENATE,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1998-12-03,"—There are two aspects to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , as honourable senators have detailed. The repeal of the Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978 removes the equalisation of export returns for dried vine fruits. That has the total support of industry and the government is pleased to recognise 
 industry views on that. That will result in less industry regulation and will allow individual companies to realise benefits from innovation and marketing. The second act that is being dealt with in this legislation involves changes to the Pig Industry Act 1986. That will facilitate the operations of the pork industry through the activities of its marketing and promotion arm.
I point out to both Senator O'Brien and Senator Woodley that the government has acted on the perceived woes of the pork industry. So far, we have already given $19 million to the pork industry. The minister, as you know, is presently considering the action that he may take under the report of the Productivity Commission. I point out to Senator O'Brien that the $19 million goes some way towards facilitating export activities and, of course, the government is continually pressing, in every trade forum, for access to overseas markets for not only the pork industry but also the horticultural industry, the meat industry, the wheat industry and the wool industry. We will continue to do that at a multilateral level and at a bilateral level, as well as at the many forums which are held on that subject. So I say to Senator O'Brien: yes, we are doing that.
The government will be responding to the Productivity Commission report shortly. It deserves our direct consideration, and I assure you, Senator Woodley, it will be given due consideration. In spite of your remarks, the minister has considered the matter and realises that the Productivity Commission did not only speak about the remedies that you indicated; it also indicated that the woes of the pig industry were due to other factors. So you should not talk about the fact that tariffs or quotas are the only answer here. There are other answers, and we will be considering that in due course.
Senator Woodley is also right when he says that the minister does have many weighty matters to consider at the moment. I am sure honourable senators would agree that at the moment the wool industry needs due consideration and the wheat industry needs due consideration, as well as the pork industry. The minister will consider those in due 
 course. So I thank honourable senators for their consideration in passing this legislation and commend it to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  is very straightforward. The Telecommunications Act 1997 currently has a requirement for telecommunication carriers to notify the Commonwealth when a proposed activity affects a matter of Commonwealth environmental significance. At the time of its drafting, a sunset clause was inserted into the Telecommunications Act, because it was anticipated that this provision would be superseded by an identical provision in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998. The time plan has not come to pass. Hence it is necessary to extend the time periods in the Telecommunications Act. Accordingly, this bill extends the sunset provision from 1 January 1999 until 1 January 2001. It is hoped that the relevant environmental bill will have passed by that date. In terms of merit, the amending bill is a sensible extension of the sunset clause and will ensure that telecommunications carriers fulfil their environmental obligations to the Commonwealth. The bill is non-contentious and the opposition supports passage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998  contains a number of benefits for social security recipients and veterans. For that reason, the opposition will be supporting its passage. The bill makes it easier for self-funded retirees to qualify for the seniors health card. It removes the iniquitous two-thirds cap on rent assistance for people living in boarding or lodging houses, and it enhances foster families' entitlements for parenting payment and health care cards.
I turn first to the health care card and self-funded retirees. The bill makes it easier for self-funded retirees to qualify for and obtain a seniors health care card. At present, assessment of entitlements for self-funded retirees is based on a definition of ordinary income. Not many retirees are in receipt of maintenance income but the scope of the ordinary income definition is broad, and proving it has been found to be a somewhat complex and time consuming task. The bill would make application easier by basing entitlement on a new term `adjusted taxable income'.
I am particularly pleased that the government's definition of adjusted taxable income includes not only income from foreign income and from net rental property loss but also the person's fringe benefit value for that year. It is an issue that I took up with Senator Newman in the debate on the  Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  last week. I think it is very important that we have a broader definition of income and that we support this move to have income received in 
 the form of fringe benefits brought into the scope of the definition of income in the measures we are dealing with. As senators would be aware, there has been growth in this fringe benefits area, and I think it has resulted in some very serious problems and unfairness impacting on a range of measures in terms of government assistance. So I am very pleased to support that broadening of the definition.
Also, the government is seeking to ease the income test. Currently, the entitlement to the card is capped at $21,300 per annum for a single person; the bill raises that to $40,000 per annum. For couples, the bar is raised from $35,620 to $67,000. Federal and state Labor governments have played an important role in the past in initiating and developing senior cards programs, and we welcome the government's move here to extend the benefit to self-funded retirees.
In terms of rent assistance for people living in shared accommodation, the opposition was strongly opposed to the measure contained in the Howard government's first budget, which reduced by one-third the maximum rent assistance entitlement of single childless people sharing accommodation. We opposed it very strongly then as being an unfair measure and we are very pleased to see that the government has relented on that. We accept that shared accommodation may allow people to economise somewhat by pooling their expenses but for obvious reasons those economies of scale are only available to people in shared house types of arrangements and not to residents of boarding houses and hostels.
Labor welcomes this belated decision to exempt residents of boarding house type accommodation from the cap on rent assistance. We hope that they might choose to revisit some of the other areas where in the early Howard budgets such draconian measures were introduced. Maybe they should look to have a change of heart on some of those as well. Perhaps that may be a vain hope on my behalf.
In terms of the measures regarding foster families, we welcome the measures to enhance their entitlements for parenting payment and health care cards. Currently, a single 
 foster carer will not qualify for parenting payment until the child has been in his or her care for 12 months. The bill would remove this waiting period which does not apply to couples who are foster carers. The opposition recognises the need to assist families who take on the expense of caring for foster children and sees no reason to discriminate against single carers, so we support this measure as being one based on equity.
The government also argues that currently families caring for a foster child do not qualify for health care and pensioner cards for that child unless they are entitled to the maximum rate of family allowance for that child. The government claims this bill will assist foster families whose incomes are too high to qualify for the maximum rate of family allowance by allowing them to qualify, nonetheless, for concession and health care cards, provided that the foster child was entitled to these cards when he or she was in the care of the original family.
While we support the measure, the opposition is concerned as to whether or not the bill achieves what the government claims for it. As I say, we support the intent of the measure but we are not clear as to how the child rather than his or her parents becomes entitled to the card. We are not sure about the legal basis of this assertion that the child carries the right to the health care card and that this transfers over to the new family. So we would be keen on hearing from the government in responding to the debate an explanation as to how this works legally; how this entitlement to a health care card—which, as I understand it, is with the family—is somehow carried by the child to the foster family. As I say, while we do not have any difficulty with the concept, we do not understand how that is achieved by this bill and we would like some reassurance on that.
In conclusion, we support the modest increases and income support for foster families, the extension of the seniors health care card entitlements to self-funded retirees, and the government's backdown on its 1996 budget decision to cap the rent assistance payable to residents of boarding and lodging houses. We will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-03,"—Today the Senate is debating a number of social security measures that were announced in the 1998-99 budget. I am pleased to say that, unlike some social security legislation, all the measures before us today are positive ones that the government has put forward, and the Democrats will be supporting the Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998 .
Nonetheless, I would like to make a few comments about each of these measures and the context surrounding them, because it is a very important area of social policy, and I think it is important to raise the surrounding issues whenever the opportunity arises.
The first schedule of this bill, as Senator Evans has outlined, will relax the eligibility requirements for the Commonwealth's seniors health card and will also simplify the application procedure for the card, which is actually quite important. At the moment, the seniors health card is provided to people over pension age whose income is below the pension cut-out points but whose assets, or lack of residency, preclude them from an age pension. It is a very valuable card. It provides holders with concessional pharmaceuticals under the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, which means that cardholders pay $3.20 per script for the first 52 prescriptions in a year and any PBS scripts after that are provided free of charge. It is clear that is something of great significance to many people.
The two changes to the current arrangements that the bill makes raise the income limits on the card to $40,000 for singles and $67,000 for couples, and the income test will be based on an assessment of a person's taxable income. That is a change from the assessment of a person's current income which has been criticised as being both overly complex and overly intrusive. So, in the future, rather than having to provide detailed evidence of all their investments and income, most people will now simply need to show a copy of their latest tax assessment notice.
The Democrats very much welcome moves to simplify the application process for the seniors health care card. We have received 
 numerous letters in our offices from people who have been concerned about the detailed and complicated nature of the forms and the sort of information that is required. An issue that I and the Democrats have raised many times is the need for the forms used by Centrelink to be as simple and as clear as possible. We would like to see this principle applied more widely wherever possible. We urge the government to give further attention to this measure in relation to other application forms.
On the issue of concession cards in general, it is worth noting that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs presented a report to the parliament in October last year which looked at the availability and benefits of the various concession cards. That committee looked specifically at the seniors health care card and canvassed a number of options for extending eligibility. In the end, the committee's recommendation was for the income test to be increased to $29,000 for singles and $49,000 for couples, and that was costed at $13½ million per year. Clearly, the government's proposal goes well beyond that recommendation, costing close to three times that amount—about an additional $40 million per year.
Whilst the Democrats are not opposing this measure and welcome it, we would nonetheless make the comment that there are a number of areas in the social security portfolio more broadly that are crying out for additional support, such as the level of payments to single pensioners, to sole parents and to the unemployed. In terms of concessions, we believe the government should also give further attention to looking to extend some, if not all, of the pensioner concessions to unemployed people and to widows. There is a wide range of concessions that are available only to people on pensions and not to people on other forms of payments, allowances and the like.
Having said that, however, I do want to acknowledge very clearly the valuable contribution that Australia's self-funded retirees make in terms of relieving pressure on the public purse by providing for their own 
 retirement. The government—not surprisingly and quite rightly when people such as myself get up here and talk about the need to extend concessions and various other levels of payments—points to the impact on the public purse. That is obviously something that has to be taken into consideration. That again reinforces the value of all activity by people in the community that reduces the pressure on the public purse and enables more funds to be made available to meet needs out in the community.
For this reason, independent retirees must be encouraged to continue providing for themselves, and not, as has happened in the past, be penalised by our social security and taxation systems. Certainly, that is one issue that I will be looking at closely in the course of the valuable, extensive and much needed Senate committee's inquiry into the proposed new tax system. If people see no benefit in putting aside funds during their working lives to provide for their retirement, then, in the end, the burden on taxpayers to fund our pension system will simply be unsustainable. Of course, this is ever more critical in light of our ageing population. It is essential that there be incentives for people to plan for their retirement. This measure will play a valuable role by providing such an incentive.
The Democrats are happy to see that additional support being provided to our independent retirees, and we congratulate some of those groups out in the community on their efforts in securing this measure; groups such as the National Seniors, the Association of Independent Retirees and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, who have been fairly tireless in campaigning for the need for measures such as this. It is important to recognise the value of the work that they do when positive outcomes are achieved through the parliament.
Turning to schedule 2 of the bill, this schedule will partly reverse the decision made by the government back in its 1996 budget. That was a budget that took $1.4 billion out of the social security portfolio. The decision taken by the government in that budget was that the maximum rate of rent assistance payable to single people who share accommo 
 dation would be reduced by 33⅓ per cent—a reduction of around $25 a fortnight. Again, it is not hard to imagine what impact that measure had on the budgets of many thousands of people who were already living on an extremely tight budget.
The government argued that this was justified on the basis that single people reap economies of scale by sharing their accommodation. The Democrats opposed this measure quite strongly, and still do, on a number of grounds—the most important being, firstly, that people, particularly young people, are often forced to share accommodation because their social security payments are already below the poverty line. Secondly, the rent assistance scheme already takes account of economies of scale by making lower payments to those who pay less rent. Finally, while people sharing accommodation may achieve economies of scale other than rental costs, reducing rent assistance to account for those savings is not appropriate as rent assistance is not intended to meet non-housing costs.
Unfortunately, despite these concerns and the Democrats' opposition, the legislation was passed and has been in operation for over 12 months. The bill before us today seeks to soften the impact of that legislation in one small area by rectifying a defect in the exemption for boarders and lodgers.
Shortly after the original legislation was passed, a copy of a letter to the Prime Minister was reproduced in ACOSS's newsletter. It was from a person who lived in a rooming house. Hopefully, their position will be corrected by this bill before us. I think it is worthwhile to quote briefly from that letter simply as a way of illustrating the real impact on people of some of the measures that we consider in the parliament. It is easy to look at these things in terms of overall budgetary savings or costs, and it is appropriate that we do so, but it is equally appropriate that we do not forget the real impact on real people.
In this letter to Mr Howard in which this person outlined his circumstances, he stated:
I am one (presumably of thousands), on Newstart Allowance, who can only afford to rent accommodation in a rooming house. 

Prior to the initial reduction in payment, the maximum fortnightly benefit he received was $396.30 a fortnight.
The massive reduction (in poverty-level terms) has lowered this to $371.30 . . . 
The explanation given was that the person was now sharing accommodation. That was certainly not so.
As with people generally who are forced to rent cheap rooming house accommodation, this person did not have the convenience of a private bathroom. He was forced to use shower cubicles and toilets situated at the other side of a large rooming house. Because his individual accommodation lacked the convenience of any bathroom facilities, he was apparently to be penalised by over 30 per cent in rent assistance. And, he said:
I defy anyone either to justify that morally or to offer a rational explanation.
To quote him again:
. . . my rent now absorbs about 65 per cent of my income and I'm now left only about $65 per week in disposable income.
He also makes the point that this is a fraction of a politician's typical daily travel allowance claim, which I believe it is, and he has to live for a week on it.
It is important, I think, to emphasise the reality that many thousands of people have to live with. The man who wrote that letter has now had to endure a $25 per fortnight reduction in his social security payment for the privilege of having to go around to the other side of his building every time he wants to have a shower or go to the toilet. For all this time, he has been $25 a fortnight worse off under a policy which the government now concedes was unjust.
Now the government quite rightly would claim, and has claimed, that it has heard the concerns of such people and is moving to rectify the situation. Certainly, positive moves should be acknowledged and congratulated, but—
—We did tell them at the time.
—As I was about to say, it does remain the case that the situation should never have happened in the first place. 
 It cannot be claimed that the inclusion of such people in this way was inadvertent. Concerns were raised, not only by eloquent people such as myself and someone else in the ALP—I do not know if it was Senator Evans—but also by people in the community, about the community affairs committee that considered the legislation. National Shelter provided an extensive submission and pointed out this very problem.
There has been a lot of debate in this place in recent times about the value or otherwise of the Senate committee process, legislative review, et cetera. Whilst I do not deny the role of political manoeuvring in those things, that should not disguise the fact that the committees do do proper scrutiny of legislation and do provide an opportunity for people in the community to highlight their concerns based on their experience, their knowledge and their expertise—which are far in excess of what most of us have in many cases—so as to make these decisions about legislation.
It is very important that the process of legislative scrutiny through committees be taken account of by all of us, including the government, so that some of these issues which the government now says are inadvertent are addressed at the time, rather than having someone whose letter I quoted from enduring a $25 per fortnight cut for 12 to 18 months before the situation is reversed. Nonetheless, it is always good to have a reversal of a bad decision, and that should always be acknowledged and congratulated because it is not always easy to say, `We got it wrong.' All of us should be more willing to do that.
The whole issue of rent assistance and housing affordability is of major concern in the community. Last year the community affairs committee presented the Senate with its report on housing affordability in Australia. Evidence given to that committee by the Department of Social Security showed that 39 per cent of all rent assistance recipients are spending more than 30 per cent of their total income on rent. In Sydney, the proportion of such people is over 50 per cent, here in the ACT it is about 45 per cent, and in my home town of Brisbane it is just on 40 per cent. 
 These are very large numbers of people who are spending quite huge amounts of their total income just on paying rent. The Democrats believe, in the context of those figures, the government should be looking to provide far greater support through the rent assistance program than is currently the case. The figures should also be taken into account in terms of the federal responsibility that the government has in housing areas, and the current continual consideration of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.
In conclusion on this measure, it is important once again not to forget that, even after this legislation is passed and this improvement is included, there will still be a very large number of people who are being unfairly disadvantaged because of the shared renters measure. The Democrats still very much believe the whole measure needs to be overturned, and we believe the government needs to consider again the very negative impact this has on many people in the community, particularly young people.
Finally, on a more positive note, I want to congratulate the government, without qualification for once, for the measures contained in schedule 3 of this bill. The schedule will remove the 12-month waiting period which applies to single foster carers when they apply for parenting payment and will make the health care card available to more people caring for a foster child. Foster carers are another group in our community who play a very valuable role but seldom receive the recognition they deserve, and it is important to take opportunities such as this to voice that recognition. The Democrats fully support these two measures which will assist those who play such a vital role in the raising of some of our young people.",SENATE,<title>1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-12-03,"—I would like to thank all honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998 which will implement a number of the government's 1998 budget initiatives for the now family and community 
 services portfolio, previously the social security portfolio. I would like to compliment Senator Newman on the bill because it addresses a number of issues that have been of concern.
One of the issues that I have been most interested in is the extending of the Commonwealth seniors health card to an additional 220,000 self-funded retirees of age pension age who are not receiving a pension because their assets are above the cut-off and whose taxable income is less than $40,000 for a single person and $67,000 for a couple.
I want to remind honourable senators that we inherited from the Labor Party the difficulty with eligibility for the Commonwealth seniors health card. I think a number of times when I was on the other side of the house I raised the difficulty facing people applying for the seniors health card, and that concern has been vindicated because the current take-up rate for the seniors health card is only 15 per cent of the estimated 240,000 people potentially eligible.
Cardholders and retiree groups have claimed that the reason the take-up was so low is that the application process for a seniors health card was far too complex and intrusive compared with the benefits received. Removal of the complexity and intrusiveness of the claim process is expected to increase the take-up of the card by 70 per cent of eligible customers.
That is a good news story. It is good news for older people, many of whom often try to reorganise their finances in order to get a health care card. This will enable many of them to do that. As Senator Bartlett said, many of them are people who have saved and been frugal in order to try to provide for themselves.
Senator Bartlett mentioned that he was concerned about the sustainability of our social security system, and he praised self-funded retirees for taking measures to look after themselves as best they could in their older years. If he is as concerned about the sustainability of our social security system as he claims today, then I would urge him to look very closely at the tax package that was introduced yesterday, because that is about 
 sustainability of our health care services, our social security services and other issues that we need to address in the long term and into the future so that young Australians now will inherit a social security system and a health care system which is affordable.
Another part of the bill contains the sharers rule. This measure will exempt single people who live in boarding houses, hostels, rooming houses and similar accommodation from the sharers rule in recognition that people living in these types of accommodation do not receive the advantages normally received by people living in shared accommodation. The government has listened to those concerns and has acted.
There has also been an extension of the access for fostered children to the health care card. This measure is aimed at encouraging people to foster children by extending the access of fostered children to the health care card. A health care card will be available to foster carers who receive family allowance and who do not normally qualify for the health care card provided that the child being fostered was eligible for a health care card or a pensioner concession card when they were with their original family. It is expected that this measure will benefit about 4,400 foster children.
With regard to the concern that Senator Evans expressed about the issuing of the card, the issuing of the card is an administrative rather than legislative process. Therefore, it can be directed to the child. The concern that he raised is answered by that—it is an administrative process of deciding that the child is eligible for the card.
The other beneficial measurement in this bill is aligning the parenting payment for all foster carers. This is a further measure aimed at encouraging people to foster children, by removing an inequity in access to parenting payment currently existing in the legislation between single and partnered people. It is expected that around 900 single foster carers will benefit from the abolition of the 12-month waiting period.
This is a good news bill and I have much pleasure in commending it to the Senate. I 
 thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1998  and to indicate the Labor Party's support for it. It is also appropriate to give a brief history for those here. In February 1997 the Federal Court gutted the SCT's dispute resolution power—that is, its power to make binding decisions. The court defined those decisions as quasi-judicial and therefore unconstitutional, as the SCT is only an administrative body. This caused severe disruption in the superannuation industry. Its immediate consequence was that 250 to 300 cases could not be resolved. The government appealed this decision and it is due for debate in the High Court reasonably soon, but no decision is expected until mid-1999. This bill is a stopgap measure to maintain an effective, fast and affordable dispute resolution mechanism. It is something that we support wholeheartedly.
On 31 July last year Justice Northrop further gutted the remaining powers of the SCT. The government indicated an appeal and that process took place. On 13 February of this year a full Federal Court upheld Justice Northrop's decision. On that day, 13 February 1998, the opposition gave a commitment to fast-track the legislative changes needed to reinstate the powers. Ten months later this bill is before us. It is still only an interim measure.
The government and Minister Hockey tried to make a big thing in the other place of the 
 fact the Senate select committee had met with a round table of industry on 7 April and reported in July. Mr Hockey either was not told or was unaware that the government at no stage asked the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to examine this issue. In fact, it steadfastly refused. This was an initiative of the committee itself, and in particular of the chair of that committee, Senator Watson. The government's seeking to cover its own slothfulness and inaction on this issue by pretending it had anything to do with the Senate select committee's decision needs to be corrected immediately. Those who prepared the information for Minister Hockey should send him a note to explain that that is what has happened.
What did the government do between 13 February and 7 April? It did nothing. As is typical of this government, it allowed the situation to drag on and on and it was only after the Senate select committee took a decision itself to try to resolve the issue so that we could get those 250 to 300 cases which are still hanging in limbo sorted out that it finally then decided to move ahead with this legislation. As we see, it is now 3 December. We want to see this bill passed speedily, but we want to make it absolutely clear so that the Senate is aware that the government had every opportunity prior to this to bring a bill before us. It chose not too. It stands condemned for being so lazy and intolerant in getting this issue resolved for a range of ordinary Australians.
Having said that, I repeat that the opposition is supporting the bill. We would like to see it implemented immediately. We are hopeful that the High Court challenge is successful.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-12-03,"—As has been pointed out, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1998  delivers on the government's ongoing commitment to ensure that superannuation fund members have access to an effective dispute resolution mechanism for superannuation complaints. I do not want to hold up the chamber on this 
 bill, but I would like to respond to the criticisms of Senator Conroy about the government's delay.
Kelvin Thomson said, `This bill has been the victim of a history of government indecision and delay.' These are the facts. The Federal Court decisions were only handed down in February of this year. On 7 April 1998, the Senate referred the matter to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for inquiry and report. On 12 July 1998, the committee's report was tabled, recommending that the government investigate the feasibility of putting an interim solution in place. The parliament did not sit between then and the election. It resumed on 10 November and within three weeks of parliament sitting the legislation is now here in the chamber. When you look at it in that context the criticism that Senator Conroy has made is a little over the top.
Given that, let us move on with the bill. I thank Senator Conroy for his contribution—with tongue in cheek slightly—and thank the Senate for consideration of this bill.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-12-03,"—This is the bill dealing with the convention on antipersonnel mines. The scourge of landmines has a horrific effect on some of the poorest people in the world. It is difficult to overstate the devastation that they have caused and continue to cause in regions as diverse as Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The Red Cross estimates that 120 million landmines are still lying in wait for their unwary victims. It is estimated that they will kill or maim around 2,000 people each month.
The opposition welcomes this bill. It is a long overdue measure which will finally ensure that Australia washes its hands of the dirty business of landmines. It follows Australia's signing of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Protection and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction—that is, the Ottawa Convention—on 3 December 1997. Credit for the Ottawa Convention must go to tireless campaigners such as Sister Patricia Pak Poy and the various non-governmental organisations that maintained pressure on governments for the decade leading up to the signing. Australian agencies such as Austcare and Community 
 Aid Abroad can take pride in being part of this process.
One of the disappointments of Ottawa, however, is the failure of some of the key states to sign the convention. The United States, Russia, China, Israel, Egypt, India, Pakistan, North Korea, South Korea, Laos, Burma, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea and Singapore are among those not to have signed. Perhaps the most disappointing is the US, whose refusal to sign was due to a desire to maintain landmine use on the Korean Peninsula. I hope the government will maintain pressure on those nations that have not signed to encourage them to do so. One interim measure would be for these countries to at least agree not to transfer mines to other countries. It would be valuable if the government could exert some pressure on non-signatories to give such an assurance.
What effect will this bill have? To begin with, it will ensure that Australia destroys its stockpile of antipersonnel mines. This could have happened earlier. Labor first called for the unilateral destruction of the Australian stockpile in October 1996. In February this year, a bipartisan majority report of the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that we do so. If there ever was any justification for Australia maintaining antipersonnel mines, it no longer exists.
The bill will also make it an offence to, amongst other things, place, possess, develop, stockpile or transfer landmines—that is clause 7—and subsection (3) states:
This does not apply to anything done by way of the mere participation in operations, exercises or other military activities conducted in combination with an armed force . . . not a party to the Convention.
That could be interpreted as a loophole. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has given a public clarification to the effect that the words `mere participation' mean that this exemption will not protect Australian soldiers who actually engage in mine laying or other activities specifically prohibited by the convention. It would simply prevent them being convicted of an offence if they were part of a joint exercise where members of another armed force laid mines.
So do we now rest on our laurels? There is a clear temptation to do so, but it must be remembered that this legislation merely ensures that Australia does not participate in continued mine laying. It says nothing about the mines that are already out there. It is that problem to which I intend to devote the remainder of my remarks.
There are four main issues relating to Australia's involvement in mine removal. The first is that removing mines takes money. Quite how painstaking a process it is was brought home to me only when, in the course of preparing for these remarks, I saw a landmine for the first time. With your indulgence, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will hold up a replica of a small mine just seven centimetres across. It is designed simply to maim. I now hold up a replica of a larger version 11 centimetres across; it is made to kill. Both are light and almost entirely made of plastic. Honourable senators might wish them to be passed around the chamber. I am sure an attendant would do that.
—They are all replicas, aren't they?
—They are replicas. They are not live. They are made, as I said, almost entirely of plastic and senators can, I am sure, imagine how difficult it would be to sweep an area or an entire field for such mines.
The cost for those countries worst affected by mines is prohibitive. They can only continue to clear mines with substantial foreign aid grants. That is the first point. Secondly, over-reliance on foreign experts is undesirable. Whilst Australian aid is needed, the most efficient way to spend it may be simply by paying Australian salaries. As Professor James Trevelyn, head of the Community Liaison and Advisory Committee of the de-mining project of the University of Western Australia said:
We have . . . learned that nearly every de-mining program is entirely dependent on foreign aid funding, and most rely heavily on expatriate experts who cost between $200,000 to $300,000 a year, and often stay only a few months. Local de-miners know more about the mine problem than foreign experts but have mostly been denied the formal education we all take for granted and have limited 
 fluency in English. Their views are suppressed, leading to frustration and resentment. The Afghanistan mine action program was set up predominantly by Australians and is now recognised as being the best in the world. Over 4,000 Afghans work in the program, yet only four or five expatriate experts are involved in a monitoring and advisory role, and they are mostly on long-term appointments. All the major de-mining organisations are staffed entirely by Afghans. The only long-term solution is to build local capacity to handle the problems, which means rebuilding the economies and training people.
I have to say this is a fundamental principle that should underlie Australia's overseas aid programs. The best solutions are those that involve the local people as much as possible.
The third point I make is that de-mining is an excellent way of spending money abroad. Mine clearing can make a dramatic difference to the lives of ordinary people. Those who are most at risk of mines are the rural poor forced by poverty into using mine affected land. For those people, mine clearing can transform their lives, giving them a sense of security in their environment that we in Australia take for granted.
My fourth point is that, where possible, we should involve the Australian armed forces in mine clearing. At present any army has some involvement with mine clearing. But this is hampered by the fact that the Department of Defence insists upon full cost recovery from AusAID for all de-mining activities. Such a demand is wrong for two reasons: firstly, it is not appropriate at a time when the Department of Defence continues to be quarantined from the sorts of budgetary cuts that our foreign aid budget has been subjected to and, secondly, involving our soldiers in mine clearing is a valuable step in creating a better army. As Mr Bill van Ree, who oversaw the Afghanistan mine action program, has pointed out:
Australian Army staff have a well deserved reputation for excellence in mine clearance. They seem to have adapted to the challenge of working in this field gaining the support and respect of many working in the humanitarian aid sector, extremely difficult to achieve when you are a soldier . . . 
Most of the members involved see these projects as an extremely valuable training and staff development opportunity. Members have the opportunity to develop contaminated area clearance skills and a broader understanding on the employment and 
 eradication of landmines. They are exposed to opportunities to develop skills in battlefield analysis and exposure to countries in our region of strategic importance. We have the opportunity to make a very valuable contribution to mine action and development of our own army.
In short, Labor applauds the money that has been devoted to mine clearing, but we would make three requests. The first request is that the government establish a consultative committee of non-governmental organisations to advise on how best to spend the money allocated to mine clearing. These organisations are experienced. They have representatives in mine affected areas. The government should draw on their expertise in planning its own de-mining program.
The second request is that the government provide to this chamber some further detail about the way in which it intends to spend the $100 million that has been allocated to mine clearing between now and the year 2005. In the other place, Mr Edwards asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs a series of questions about this expenditure. Mr Downer did not give any satisfactory answer to those questions. I therefore repeat them now:
In relation to the $100 million, I would be appreciative if the minister in his response could give the House details of the following: (1) the proposed expenditure of the remaining money; (2) a breakdown of the money already spent; (3) in which department or departments will budgeted moneys be held; (4) what amounts will be budgeted on a yearly basis up to the year 2005; (5) who will decide how much, and where, the money will be spent, and against what criteria; and (6) if any, what part of the $100 million will be by way of resource rather than financial support?
My third request is that the government abandon the policy of demanding full cost recovery from AusAID for mine clearing operations carried out by the Australian armed forces and investigate the possibility of expanding such operations in the future.
This bill is a significant move toward a world free of landmines. But we must remember that it is only one phase and plenty of work lies ahead of us. I support the bill.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-03,"—My question is directed to the minister representing the Minister for Sport and Tourism. Can the minister confirm that under the GST all Australians will, for the first time, pay tax—an extra 10 per cent—when they register to play sport, when their kids go to little athletics on a Saturday morning, and when they pay the membership subscription of the under-10 netball league? Can the minister confirm that cricket and football fans will, for the first time, have to pay the federal government an extra 10 per cent of the ticket price to go and watch their favourite game, whether it be a test or the local reserves?

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-03,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Considering how important sport is to the health and wellbeing of Australians, how does the government justify as `fair' placing a new 10 per cent tax on every sporting activity from swimming lessons to club membership fees? Isn't it the case that the government's proposed GST will mean that it will cost all Australians 10 per cent more to enjoy sport, whether it be as a participant or as a spectator?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Sporting Activities</title>,Questions Without Notice,22,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-03,"—What is going to be fairly obvious to all of those families with children who involve themselves in sport is that they are going to have a hell of a lot more money in their pockets with which to do things. The Labor way is to tax people, because they think governments know best when it comes to what we should do with our money. The Liberal way is that we 
 want to have enough money to run essential services but we want to allow people to be masters of their own destiny. We want families to decide what they want to do with their money, which sport they want their children to become involved in and how they want their children to be brought up in this world. That is the major difference between us and the socialist thinkers opposite. They believe governments know best. We believe individual families know what is best for them and their children. That is one of the things that will happen with our tax reform proposals.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Why don't you get with it? Why don't you come up to date? Why don't you stop your Eastern European style of class warfare, your old Eastern European—
—Senator Macdonald—
—Even the Eastern Europeans have gone beyond you.
—Senator West, on a supplementary question?
—Madam President—
—I was trying to call you to order, but you went on.
—Am I to continue?
—No. First I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that you were addressing your remarks directly across the chamber, which is not in order, and secondly I wanted to draw the chamber's attention to the fact that there is far too much noise. Yesterday I received many complaints about the volume of noise in the chamber and the difficulty that people had in hearing on both television and radio. I think senators should have some regard for that fact.
—Madam President, I apologise for being distracted by those opposite. I find it very hard to hear as well because members of the Labor Party continually shout and yell. They do not want to hear the good news for Australians. They want to drown us out. They want to drown out, for those that might be listening or 
 viewing this, the great news for Australians. When I get distracted it is because members of the Labor Party, who are worse than the old-time Eastern Europeans, simply do not like the good news.
I was saying that the details of the government's historic tax reform plans were released in a very comprehensive policy document prior to the election. The Australian people, in their wisdom, returned the government with a mandate to implement our tax reform package. As I go around Australia people say to me, `You people won the election. Some of us didn't even vote for you, but you have the mandate. Why don't you implement it?'
—Madam President, I raise a point of order and it goes to relevance. Three questions were asked and none of them have been answered. There are 90 seconds left on the clock, which means 30 seconds per question. I do not think Senator Macdonald is going to do it but, Madam President, I think it would be proper to direct him to try to answer the questions that were put. They are about what real Australians will have to pay under a GST when attending sporting events in this nation.
—It is not for me to debate it, but it is my impression that Senator Macdonald is answering the question and what he is saying is relevant.
—Thank you, Madam President. Senator Cook should be aware that, when families and their children buy sporting goods, they will no longer pay Labor's wholesale sales tax. That will go. What is the sales tax on racquets and sporting equipment? Can someone tell me? Is it 22 per cent? Is it 32? I do not know. It is your tax; you should know what it is. You imposed that on families. The Labor Party imposed those taxes on young children and on families—people who wanted their children to participate in sport. The Labor Party continued and increased wholesale sales taxes.
The details of our tax reform package were introduced into the House of Representatives yesterday. There will be every opportunity for all honourable senators to canvass the details during the parliamentary debate. I remind 
 them now that the wholesale sales tax that Labor imposed on all sporting equipment impacted heavily on families, particularly parents with young children.

And the people that know that more than anyone are the Labor Party. Why they perpetuate these lies, I do not know. Every family will have so much more money in their pockets with which to send their children to sporting events. Senator West says we are imposing 10 per cent on the purchase of a tennis ball or a football or a cricket bat. Senator West, tell me what the wholesale sales tax was on them under your policy. It was 22 per cent on a tennis ball.
—You know about telling porkies. That's why you had three years on the back bench. You have public form.
—You tell us what you do about your tax.
—Order! There is so much shouting over there that I am having difficulty hearing what is being said. It is absolutely in breach of the standing orders and is totally unacceptable—and totally unacceptable for people who are trying to listen, which they are entitled to do.
—Those people listening will want to hear that under Labor there was a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on a tennis ball. Under us there will be a 10 per cent GST. That is the saving for those people, Senator West, and I just hope you will

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-12-03,"—Yesterday, Senator Stott Despoja asked me a question about youth allowance. I have some additional information for her. In addition, Centrelink have just advised me that they are in the process of contacting all school principals and asking them to encourage young people to 
 return their review forms, even if the students have been advised that their youth allowance payment has stopped. As well, those students unable to complete the forms are able to ask Centrelink for an extension of time to return the form. I seek leave to incorporate a copy of the additional information.
Leave granted.
The information read as follows—
YOUTH ALLOWANCE END OF YEAR REVIEW PROCESS
Background
The purpose of the end of year review is to obtain from student customers details of their study intentions for 1999 and, for all dependent young people, their parental income details for the 1997/98 financial year. This information is required to ensure continuing eligibility and that the correct rate of payment is made. The parental income details set the rate of payment from 1 January 1999. Without this information customers may not be eligible for continued payment of Youth Allowance or Austudy.
Additionally, the review is critical to ensure young people under 18 maintain their eligibility by returning to education, undertaking training or some other activity as outlined in their Activity Agreement. Under legislation these agreements must be in place by 1 January 1999.
Reviews
Review forms were sent progressively from 5 October to 16 November. Like groups of customers were sent forms at set times during this period. Groups were given between 2 to 4 weeks to return the forms. Suspension of payment for non return occurred up to 2 weeks after the due date. Customers were asked to contact Centrelink should they have difficulty in completing the form and Centrelink has been giving extensions where warranted.
This end of year review process is new to students and some unemployed. Therefore, considerable effort was undertaken by Centrelink to ensure that customers were aware of the review and the consequences of not returning forms. This included:
.	 fliers and outreach to schools and tertiary institutions;
.	 local media releases;
.	 personal reminder letters and phone contacts in some areas; and
.	 delaying suspension of payment to allow for late return of forms.
Senator Stott Despoja referred to aspects of the review from an internal Centrelink memo. The 
 figures contained in the memo were not quite accurate. In fact, of the 119,700 forms due to date 86,559 had been returned and 33,141 customers have had their payments suspended. Once payments are suspended, all customers are sent a letter explaining the reason. In most circumstances, payments can be restored promptly once the requested information is supplied by the customer, provided the customer still meets the eligibility criteria.
The Centrelink memo was to alert of officers to the poor response to the end of year reviews, the consequent cancellations and to encourage staff to help customers complete the form were possible.
Up to 2 December, a further 199,122 forms were due for return of which over 56% have been returned to date. With over 16,000 forms returned yesterday, and similar numbers expected today, suspension of payment for those who have not returned their forms will not occur until 4 December at the earliest.
For all groups Centrelink has delayed the suspension of payment beyond the due date to allow for the late return of forms.
Senator Stott Despoja also raised concerns over the content of the DETYA website regarding the end of year reviews. A check of the DETYA website has found no detailed reference to the review process but there is a link to the Centrelink site. Here customers are advised that their payments may be cancelled if they do not return their form by the due date. This terminology is used to allow customers with exceptional circumstances, who cannot complete their form and who have approached Centrelink, to not be cancelled on the due date. It also allows administrative flexibility in actioning the cancellation date. This flexibility has been utilised for this review to allow for late return of forms.
Senator Stott Despoja also raised the issue of the complexity of the forms. While the review forms seek detailed information from these customers and, in required instances from their parents, this is to ensure that Government assistance is directed to those in most need. Most customers have managed to complete and return their form by the due date.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Centrelink: Interview Review Forms</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,speech

The PRESIDENT,N/A,1998-12-03,"—Before proceeding with this debate, I suggest to senators that they should not canvas the merits of a particular case now the subject of a petition before the Court of Disputed Returns.
While the Senate's sub judice convention may not be applicable because there is no trial before a jury and therefore little possibility of prejudice to legal proceedings, it would not be desirable for senators to be telling the court what findings it should make.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-12-03,"—Madam President, thank you for drawing that to the Senate's attention. I only received notice of the lodgment of that petition this afternoon.
Senator Brown's private member's bill, the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) Bill, involving the qualification of candidates to stand for parliament, seeks to alter section 44 of the constitution in so far as it relates to the qualifications of persons to be members of the parliament.
The government's position on the proposition that section 44 of the Australian constitution be amended was set out by the Attorney-General on 4 December 1997 in the government's formal response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee delivered its report in July 1997. The Attorney indicated that the government was generally supportive of the proposition that section 44 be amended to overcome those shortcomings identified by the House committee. The government's detailed response to the 10 recommendations of the committee identified a range of issues that the government believed needed to be considered and determined prior to formally moving to amend section 44 of the constitution.
Notwithstanding its general support for reform, the government also indicated that it believed that it was important to ensure that any proposal for reform must have and retain bipartisan support. In this context, the government indicated that it believed that it was appropriate to bring forward a proposal to reform section 44 of the constitution to a 
 referendum only if it could be included with other proposals for constitutional reform. The government would not support a proposal to conduct a stand-alone referendum for reform of section 44.
While the government recognises the need for legislative reform of section 44, it does not believe the public interest in changing this section is so great as to merit the cost to the public of a referendum solely on this issue. This is particularly the case as the Australian Electoral Commission has amended the nomination form for candidates so that it contains a declaration to be signed by the candidate that explicitly states that the candidate is not disqualified by virtue of section 44 of the constitution. The form also includes a copy of the full text of section 44, a check list for candidates and a warning. Whilst these measures do not address the fundamental objection to the operation of section 44, they do remove the possibility of a person acting in ignorance by standing as a candidate when they are not qualified by virtue of section 44.
 There is also a number of matters which need to be looked at in relation to section 44 generally, matters such as: would other provisions need to be included in section 44 to supplement changes to subsections 44(i) and 44(iv)? In changing subsection 44(i), should some forms of foreign allegiance, such as membership of the armed forces of another country, preclude even Australian citizens from eligibility to be chosen as a member of parliament? Should parliament have the capacity to establish other grounds of disqualification relating to foreign allegiance?
In changing subsection 44(iv), is it important to preserve the basic principle embodied in that provision, that is, that a person should not hold two offices which may give rise to a conflict of duty or the appearance of such a conflict? If so, careful consideration needs to be given to the form of such amendments. The Constitutional Commission, for one, decided that subsection 44(iv) should be replaced with reasonably complex provisions to preserve this principle. 	Another aspect is: if there is no longer any general prohibition on holding an `office of profit under the Crown', would new provisions be required to 
 ensure that executive government does not come to exercise undue influence over the parliament by establishing a new remunerated executive position? This was a concern expressed by the 1997 House of Representatives committee.
Consideration must be given to the kind of amendment that would be appropriate to deal with criticism of subsections 44(ii), (iii) and (v) on that basis that they are uncertain in operation, inappropriately formulated or both. I can advise the Senate that the government is currently considering these issues and developing amendment proposals. Having in mind that  and the other matters that I mentioned in relation to the sentiments expressed in this bill, and whilst the government is generally supportive of those sentiments, in the circumstances I have outlined the government cannot support the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I want to say at the outset of my speech during this second reading stage of the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) Bill that I actually regret that the government does not feel able to sponsor legislation to deal with the anomalies arising from section 44 of the Australian constitution. In a way I regret, I must say, that it has taken a non-government initiative to get us into this debate.
I do believe that there is a strong view—I am not suggesting it is necessarily a bipartisan view, but it is necessarily a strong view—and acknowledgment that the sorts of anomalies that arise in section 44 of the constitution need to be addressed. From across the political spectrum there have been calls to introduce legislation to amend the Australian constitution in this way. The anomalies that I am referring to are contained within section 44 which provides for the disqualification of a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. In particular, section 44(i) states:
Any person who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power; 

And also, of course, section 44(iv) states:
Any person who—
(iv) Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth;
. . . shall be incapable of being chosen or sitting as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives.
The truth is that up to five million Australians hold dual citizenship and may therefore be ineligible to stand for parliament.
The difficulty arises that many people are ignorant of their dual nationality. Some countries extend citizenship to third generation or later descendants, and that causes quite a significant number of people to be unaware of the need to renounce their dual citizenship in order to comply with section 44(i) of the constitution. It may even, for all I know, apply to some sitting members and senators.
Section 44(iv) presents the problem of discouraging public sector employees from standing for parliament. A public servant must resign regardless of whether they contest a winnable seat or whether they have a chance of winning. The difficulty here is that this becomes a little unfair and discriminatory as they have to give up their employment and their source of income before they nominate, and they do not have the certainty of reappointment if they are unsuccessful in running for parliament.
So what does that mean in reality? It means you can have a swag of private sector lawyers nominating without resigning, but it does discriminate against teachers, police officers, Telecom workers and the like. A problem also exists for local government representatives who may have to resign their elected posts, run the risk of not being elected to the federal parliament and perhaps find themselves de-elected in one level of government and not elected in another.
These are the sorts of problems that have regularly faced candidates and political parties for a considerable period of time. It is quite obviously a very significant problem for senators-elect who cannot hold an office of profit under the Crown for the period from their nominations until they take their seats, 
 which again can be many months. If we take the example of senators-elect from the last election, it will be about nine months from their nominations before they take their seats in July 1999.
In recent years there have been a number of references to the Court of Disputed Returns arising from candidates being in conflict with section 44. Some that come to mind include the case of Senator Robert Wood in 1988 who was not an Australian citizen at the time of his election and Phil Cleary in 1992 who was a schoolteacher on leave without pay. I think in that election there were two other candidates who were found to be ineligible: Mr Kardamitsis held Greek citizenship, while Mr Delacretaz, I think, held Swiss citizenship.
There was, of course, the case of Ms Jackie Kelly in 1996 who was an officer of the Royal Australian Air Force at the time of her nomination. She resigned before the election, as I recall, but she was also a New Zealand citizen at the time of her nomination. And there was the case also of Senator Ferris who, in 1996, worked for—
—A notorious case it was, too.
—Yes, I think it was notorious. Thank you, Senator Schacht. There was the case of Senator Ferris in 1996 who worked for Senator Minchin following her election as a senator, but that was, of course, before her Senate term commenced.
There is currently the issue of Senator-elect Hill. That has come under question for her alleged failure to renounce her British citizenship before contesting the most recent election. I think there are rumours suggesting that she may have since quietly renounced her British citizenship, but those are matters for others to determine.
But, because of the number and the frequency with which members and senators have fallen foul of section 44, this is a matter which has caused considerable debate within the parliament and members and senators have given it consideration at great length.
After every election, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters considers issues arising from the election. Each time, I 
 think, on so many occasions, the committee has considered the matter of section 44 and its application to the Australian election process. In 1993, the report of the 1993 federal election by the joint standing committee recommended:
that the Government examine the introduction into the Citizenship Oath of a simple mechanism for the renunciation of a foreign allegiance.
In 1996, the report on the 1996 federal election by the joint committee made the recommendation:
that at an appropriate time, such as in conjunction with the next Federal election, a referendum be held on a) applying the ""office of profit"" disqualification in section 44(iv) from the start of an MP's term, rather than from the time of nomination, and b) deleting section 44(i) on ""foreign allegiance"" and otherwise amending the Constitution to make Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for membership of the Parliament.
Also in 1996, as a result of the challenge to the election of Miss Jackie Kelly in the seat of Lindsay, the Senate took issue with section 44 of the constitution. On 29 October 1996, the Senate unanimously passed a motion which states:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes:
(i)	 the High Court ruling of 11 September 1996 that the 1996 federal election result in the House of Representatives seat of Lindsay was invalid, and
(ii)	 that section 44 of the Constitution impedes many Australian citizens from standing for Parliament, including citizens holding dual citizenship, public servants and certain others who may be holding an office of profit under the Crown; and
(b)	 calls on the Federal Government to respond with a proposal for amendment.
The government did not respond and it has not responded since that time. But the most comprehensive and specific consideration of the issues that arise from section 44 was undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1997. Their report in July 1997 entitled Aspects of Section 44 of the Australian Constitution Subsections 44(i) and (iv)  concluded that the only effective way to address the problems and difficulties arising from section 44 was by constitutional amend 
 ment. On tabling the committee report, the deputy chair, Mr Kelvin Thomson, made the point that its recommendations were bipartisan. It is worth reminding the Senate of his words:
Having heard a great deal of evidence on this issue and having considered all the alternative options, we believe there is no satisfactory alternative to a referendum to change the Constitution. The committee has recommended that the present subsection 44(i) be deleted, to be replaced by a requirement that all candidates and members of Parliament be Australian citizens. The committee has recommended that at the same time Parliament would enact legislation which would disqualify members of Parliament who did not have a primary loyalty to Australia.
The government's response to that particular report was favourable. In regard to all the critical recommendations, the government offered its support, but I do not think that that has been followed through with action. This legislation is not complete and I do not think it is perfect, but we will support it, otherwise we may well be waiting forever and a day before the government takes action on this matter. In regard to dual citizenship, the bill proposes the omission of section 44(i) and substitutes:
(1) Is not an Australian citizen: or
This picks up the first two parts of the legal and constitutional committee's recommendation No. 2. It does not address the recommendation that parliament should also be empowered to enact legislation determining the grounds for disqualification of members of parliament in relation to foreign allegiance. I have concerns that the proposed amendments stray a little from the intended principle and spirit of the constitution that members of parliament should have a clear and undivided loyalty to Australia. The adoption of the further recommendation would have provided further clarity that members of parliament should not be subject to the influence of foreign governments.
In regard to office of profit under the Crown, the bill proposes the omission of the current section 44(iv), substituting the following:
(ii)	 Holds any judicial office or any other office that the Parliament from time to time declares 
 to be an office for the purpose of this paragraph: or—
It also proposes the omission of the following words from section 44—
, or of any of the Queen's Ministers for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or member of the Queen's navy or army
The fundamental principle behind subsection 44(iv) is that the executive and the legislature should be separated and that the executive should not be in a position to unduly influence the legislature. It is also to prevent someone from simultaneously holding two offices which could give rise to a conflict of duties and interests. These remain fundamental principles, but because of their archaic expression, their interpretation and application in recent times, we have seen undue harshness caused.
The amendments proposed are consistent with the spirit and principle of the intent of the constitution, but will clarify the application so as not to impose an unfair burden on candidates in public sector employment. The final paragraph of section 44 provides exemptions from the application of subsection 44(iv) for a range of public employees. The committee found that, at the end of the 20th century, most of these exemptions are inappropriate. The amendments proposed by this legislation go some way to improving those exemptions.
The legal and constitutional committee also recommended in recommendation No. 7 that, if constitutional amendment to delete subsection (iv) does not proceed or is delayed, then the Attorney-General should write to those states where reinstatement to public sector employment is not guaranteed.
The recommendation was that the Attorney-General request that state parliaments take such action as necessary to ensure that the relevant legislation does not infringe subsection 44(iv). The government's response noted that it cannot require state parliaments to adopt such provisions but it adopted the recommendation subject to qualification. As yet, we are not aware whether the Attorney-General has written to state parliaments urging them to pursue consistent legislation.
Of course, legislative reform is not the only answer. The Labor Party has long argued and maintained that the AEC should play a more active role in advising candidates on their eligibility. I hope also that the debate we are having today in the chamber does help to promote these issues and raise awareness in the community.
The Labor Party's support for this legislation is by no means a weakening of our resolve and our belief in the fundamental principles which are embedded within section 44 of the Australian constitution. It certainly does not reflect any sympathy for or concern about the predicament that faces Senator-elect Hill who has fallen foul of subsection 44(i) by apparently failing to renounce her British citizenship. Laurie Oakes described it pretty well in his Bulletin article recently when he said:
It is tempting to be amused by the pickle in which One Nation senator-elect Heather Hill finds herself. The sole successful federal candidate of a raucously chauvinistic and xenophobic party may face the loss of her Senate seat—
—Senator Faulkner, I do not think you were in the chamber when the President made a statement prior to the commencement of this debate. She asked honourable senators not to make reference to Senator-elect Hill's position as it is currently before the Court of Disputed Returns.
—I was quoting something that was in the Bulletin . But if you would prefer me not to do so, I will refer people to it and get on with it. As I indicated, I thought the journalist Laurie Oakes dealt with that issue very well and I commend the quote that I made to those who are interested in these matters. Having not heard the President's statement, I accept your advice, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I will not canvass that issue any further. Obviously, we would not want to trample into those areas, which is a matter of concern for all senators.
The issue of principle here is that we believe it is critical that no person seeking to represent the people of Australia be in a situation of possible compromise or conflict 
 by holding an office of profit under the Crown. But we recognise, as I have said, that the current archaic wording of section 44 does present anomalies. That is why we are prepared to support moves to address and overcome these sorts of difficulties. We believe it is essential that someone who seeks to represent the people of Australia should owe allegiance and loyalty to our nation, the parliament and the people of Australia. It is for these reasons that the opposition will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-03,"—Most people who have been associated with elections in any way, shape or form, especially federal elections, will know just how widely the scope of section 44 of the constitution ranges. In my belief, it ranges further than it used to. The reason for that, in my opinion, is that the range of services that are provided by government and non-government entities, private entities, on contract to the government these days means that at times almost everybody in the community in some way has had an association with providing services, goods and so on to the Crown. As we continue with the competition policy in Australia, we are actually catching more and more people who are potentially in the net of office of profit under the Crown.
It is a very unclear concept, in my opinion. But the problem is that it is not about influence. Maybe it was originally designed to restrict people who may otherwise have had influence in paid positions under the Crown. These days it can be almost anyone. Ironically, it is not necessarily those people working for universities who may be in the public sector. If they are part of a statutory authority, I understand that does not come under that. It could be a person who does privately contracted work in English as a second language for the government under the TAFE system. So we are actually getting further and further away from any people who are potentially influential. One can only wonder whether the men who put forward the constitution in the first place would have ever considered that this is what it meant when they put the constitution together.
Honourable senators may well be aware of the fact that I am a maximalist when it comes to constitutional change. I believe that it is more important that we deal with constitutional change than simply deal with the issue of the change of the head of state. It is my opinion that if we simply change the head of state and do not look at constitutional change, then we are missing the point.
We have a situation here which comes up as problematical—I believe unfairly problematical for so many and increasing numbers of people—every time we have a federal election. We ought to address it, and it can be addressed. I am sure that if there are problems with the way in which the bill is put at the moment, there should be a way in which the government can put together a bill which deals with those issues. There should be a way in which it can be amended. There should be a way in which the opposition, if they are in government, can put together something similar that can deal with the issue of constitutional change.
We should not be frightened of constitutional change and we should not, in my opinion, be frightened of getting the community involved in discussing constitutional change. Indeed, in Western Australia, when people have been invited to talk about the issues of constitutional change, they have come in their dozens to be involved and to put their views forward. Unfortunately, in Western Australia, that has not progressed in terms of action in the way that many people would like it to have done, but people are interested, when they are asked, about what kind of governance they think is appropriate. Sometimes people are not asked because maybe governments or particular parties are frightened of what people in the community will say.
I believe that we could progress this matter. I understand that there are some issues on which we could not go to committee stage on this bill. There is the necessity to give 21 days notice for a rollcall in the Senate if we were to go to the committee stage, which is fine. It means that, potentially, we could have an agreement, if there is this interest in the community—
—That would put us here on Christmas Day. Don't do it.
—No, not today. Potentially, there is the opportunity for us to adjourn this debate and have some process at a later date. I have nothing against the idea of having these issues put to a further public committee so that people can talk about them. They would be able to talk about the problems and the ways of working around them.
There is no real excuse for our not progressing this issue. We should not be afraid of constitutional change. We should not be afraid of making elections more inclusive. I am sure there are ways of dealing with the issue of people's loyalties. What we need to do is make sure that in the Australia of the late 1990s, going into the next century, we are not sitting on a situation which is more and more exclusive for no real reason.	Many of those who are contractors or work for some government department or who in some way may be caught under the net of `profit under the Crown' have no public influence at all. It is not an issue of public influence; it is an issue of, I believe, a concept within the constitution which deserves to be revisited and revised.
In terms of citizenship, I am sure we could deal with this adequately. If there are issues that need to be amended, we can do that. We are adult enough to do that and we are adult enough to bring in the community to assist us in getting to the right position. It is a pity that the government has said at this stage that it is unable to do that, but I do not believe any of these issues are beyond redemption.
I would like to see that at some future date we make a move on these issues. Of course, if I had my druthers, I would like to see a proper debate, in the fullness of time—bringing in the community at the earliest possible date—on changes to the constitution to make it more relevant to the needs of current Australia and to the needs of the future.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-12-03,"—This bill seeks to do three things, and I would like to tackle each in turn. Firstly, it would delete the prohibition enshrined in section 44(i) of the Austral 
 ian constitution that a person could not seek election to the parliament if that person was a citizen of another country or owed an allegiance of some kind to another nation. The bill proposes to replace this with a simple requirement that all candidates for political office be Australian citizens.
Senators would be aware that section 44(i) of the constitution has provoked litigation in the past, the leading case being Sykes v. Cleary (No. 2) of 1992 concerning, amongst other things, the validity of the candidacy of Mr Delacretaz and Mr Kardamitis who both held dual citizenships. But, as senators would also be aware, the section is again being invoked in possible litigation over the last election concerning the validity of the candidacy of a senator-elect from Queensland.
The section was drawn up at a time when there was no concept of Australian citizenship; when Australian residents were either British subjects or aliens. It was designed to ensure the parliament was devoid of aliens as so defined at that time. The Democrats accept, however, that the sentiment of the section, that only Australians should be eligible to stand as representatives for the federal parliament, is a valid and continuing one. But this is not to say that section 44(i) of the constitution as it currently stands is the most appropriate and adapted to achieving that end.
Rather, it contains notions such as `any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power'. These concepts are obviously subject to disparate interpretations by judges. Is it to be the case that some future member would lose their seat because, whilst in office, they have been made an honorary citizen of another country purely as part of the diplomatic process—as in the case of Bob Hawke? Such a result would be an absurdity.
Further, in the context of the current debate over the move to a republic, such reference to a foreign power brings the oath each member and senator takes upon assuming his or her seat into contradiction with the existing constitutional provision. Senators will recall that the oath requires members to `swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and 
 successors according to law'. Queen Elizabeth is the Queen of England. On a strict reading, that may be an unequivocal declaration of `allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power' as prohibited by section 44(i). So this present contradiction in our constitution would also be addressed by the deletion of section 44(i).
As it currently stands, section 44(i) is wholly unsuited to achieving its aim for the reasons outlined above. Like many sections of our constitution it has, understandably, lost its workability a century after its drafting. The proposed replacement for the section under this bill, that the qualification simply be that a person must be an Australian citizen, is sound so far as it goes. However, we should take account of the valuable work that has been done in this area by various parliamentary bodies in assessing whether the present amendment is sufficient.
Most recently, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997 recommended that section 44(i) be replaced by a provision requiring that all candidates be Australian citizens, but it went further to suggest the new provision empower the parliament to enact legislation determining the grounds for disqualification of members in relation to foreign allegiance—that is, the committee acknowledged that there are some situations, such as where a prime minister, for example, held dual citizenship, that may cause concern to the Australian people. A provision leaving the door open to parliament to put some better expressed requirements as to dual citizenship in place would seem a sensible recommendation.
I would further note that the Constitutional Commission, in its final report of 1988, recommended that subsection 44(i) be deleted and that Australian citizenship instead be the requirement for candidacy, with the parliament being empowered to make laws as to residency requirements. Going further back, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in its 1981 report entitled The constitutional qualifications of Members of Parliament, recommended that Australian citizenship be the constitutional 
 qualification for parliamentary membership, with questions of the various grades of foreign allegiance being relegated to the legislative sphere.
It is therefore tolerably clear to us that, especially in view of the multicultural nature of Australian society, contemporary standards demand that Australian citizenship be the sole requirement for being chosen for parliament under a new subsection 44(i), with a residual legislative power being given to the parliament to deal with unique cases that may arise from time to time.
The second element of the bill deals with the office of profit under the Crown issue of subsection 44(iv). Again, this section featured in the Sykes v. Cleary (No.2) litigation. The bill proposes to delete subsection 44(iv) and substitute a requirement that only judicial officers must resign their positions prior to election, as well as empowering the parliament to legislate for other specified offices to be vacated.
Subsection 44(iv) has its origins in the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 in the United Kingdom. Its purpose there was essentially to do with the separation of powers, the idea being to prevent undue control of the House of Commons by members being employed by the Crown. Obviously, times have changed, even though the ancient struggle between the executive and parliament continues to this day. Whilst this provision may have been appropriate 300 years ago, the growth of the machinery of government has meant that its contemporary effect is to prevent the many thousands of citizens employed in the public sector from standing for election without resigning their office and therefore without any real justification.
Taking my own party in my own state at the recent election as an example, we have 14 lower house seats in Western Australia to contest, yet seven potential Democrats candidates would not stand due to their unwillingness to resign from their public sector positions. It should be further mentioned that some of our potential candidates are teachers who feel they have no option, in the context of the 1998 election preceding the all important university entrance examinations, but to 
 remain in their positions out of a sense of duty to their students. Such a situation adds to the argument not just for the removal of the impediment presented by the office of profit provision but also for calls for fixed term elections, held at times of the year that do not discriminate against large sectors of the community in the sense of their capacity to fully participate in elections.
The Australian Democrats have a long history of trying to rectify this part of the constitution. In February 1980, nearly 20 years ago, a former Democrats senator, Colin Mason, moved a motion in this chamber which resulted in the inquiry I have referred to earlier by the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs into the government's order that public servants resign before nomination for election. In 1985 and again in 1989 the Democrats introduced a bill putting the recommendations of that committee into effect. Then in 1992 we introduced a bill, following the Constitutional Commission's report, to implement those recommendations. None of these very practical bills have been allowed to be debated by the government of the day to the stage where they could go to the other house.
I further note that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997 recommended that subsection 44(iv) be deleted and replaced by provisions preventing judicial officers from nominating without resigning their posts and other provisions empowering the parliament to specify other offices which would be declared vacant should the office holder be elected to parliament. Subsection 2(2) of the bill in its current form will not achieve this. Whilst some offices, such as those of a judicial nature, must be resigned prior to candidacy, no provision is made for other offices to be declared vacant upon a candidate being successfully elected. It would be absurd, of course, if public servants could retain their positions after having been elected to parliament. It is essential that a mechanism be put in place declaring vacant certain specified offices upon their holders being elected.
The third element of the bill seeks to modify the last paragraph of section 44 by deleting certain words. I have to confess to being a little mystified as to why the paragraph should not just be deleted in its entirety. Indeed, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997 noted that, if its recommendations concerning subsections 44(i) and (iv) were accepted, the last paragraph of section 44 should be deleted. I concur with that view.
So, in summary, the changes proposed in this bill incorporate only a selection of the recommendations made in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report of July 1997. In our view, ideally the bill should have incorporated all of those recommendations. For the purposes of this debate, however, we find the bill supportable as far as it goes. It is a distinct improvement on our present constitutional position.
In the event of this bill proceeding to the House of Representatives, I would expect the government to amend the bill to meet such concerns as have been indicated by Senator Ellison's and other senators' speeches. I think there is general consensus among all political parties, and possibly amongst the Independents, that this situation needs to be rectified. Therefore, if there is general political consensus as to that rectification, I and my party think it would be appropriate for the government to take a position of leadership in this matter and deal with this issue in time for the next election.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The language of section 44 of the Australian constitution reflects an age when government was small. The frame has understood the potential threat of a parliament comprising parliamentarians who simultaneously occupied government employment or an office of profit under the Crown. Citizenship laws were equally simple. Widespread dual citizenship was unknown. The framers knew what they meant by the phrase `allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power'. Today, these phrases are no longer satisfactory for outlining disqualifications for 
 members and candidates. Judicial interpretation has made their scope wide. They now represent barriers to potentially millions of Australians.
In 1988 the Senate reluctantly referred the Wood case to the High Court, sitting as a court of disputed returns. I say `reluctantly' because senators were aware of the fact that, although former Senator Wood was not an Australian citizen at the time of his election, he was nevertheless a properly qualified voter. I make this point because former Senator Wood would today still be ineligible to sit in this parliament under the bill introduced by Senator Brown. On that occasion, the Senate was required to act. Once the question of former Senator Wood's status was brought to our attention, not to have done so would have imperilled all legislative and executive instruments enacted by the parliament.
In Sykes v. Cleary—not a case, incidentally, brought by the Australian Labor Party—the High Court held that an office of profit under the Crown could include a public servant who had taken leave without pay. This clearly provides a constitutional bar far broader than the one necessary to meet the original objects of subsection 44(iv). Therefore, the Labor Party supports a change that enables the parliament to prescribe what kinds of offices fall within the contemporary meaning of the original objects of the clause.
A second aspect of Sykes v. Cleary related to dual citizenship. The court acknowledged that citizenship arrangements differed drastically between countries. The court held that the candidates were required to take active steps to renounce citizenship held with other countries. The precise steps that would be necessary in each instance remain unclear, and depend on the particular arrangements in each country. This decision by the High Court came as a surprise to most of us. We were completely aware of the necessity to take out Australian citizenship and we were aware of that before the 1987 election. We put a lot of effort into making sure that no Labor Party candidate presented themselves for election unless they were fully qualified. But at no stage did we understand that the High Court 
 might, at some future time, rule on dual citizenship.
The parliament has recognised the reality of dual citizenship in its own laws. Personally, I have never been an advocate for dual citizenship. It can create extensive problems for holders of multiple citizenships who find themselves in difficulties overseas. It is often unclear which country bears the responsibility of acting on behalf of its nationals. If this is just done so that someone can get through Heathrow Airport 10 minutes quicker, then I question the real benefits.
Citizenship is not about convenience; citizenship laws exist for good reasons. I wonder, when I reflect on the massive growth of dual citizenship, whether we have not drifted somewhat from those reasons. Nevertheless, it is a fact of life. It is something that the Labor Party and, I am pretty certain, the Liberal Party and others have accepted as a fact of life. There is no doubt that all members of this parliament should be Australian citizens. This has always been the purpose of subsection 44(i), and the ordinary language and meaning of the constitution should reflect that.
In some cases it is not hard to revoke dual citizenship. For example, British citizenship is one of the easiest to revoke—a simple form and a $170 fee. A form is easily available from the British consulate. Many other countries make it almost impossible for that sort of process, saying you can never give up citizenship of their country. So it is understood that, if candidates standing for election presented themselves at the consulate or the embassy, renounced their citizenship and handed them stuff in writing, that would meet the High Court's requirement. At least, that is what we assume; it is yet to be fully tested in another case. We all take that as the meaning of it: if you have taken an active step by presenting yourself and by denying allegiance to another country, that is enough.
I know that political parties—the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the Nationals and probably the Democrats, although I am not sure about the Greens—have put enormous effort into checking that all candidates meet the full requirements of the constitution on 
 the basis of Sykes v. Cleary & Ors. It does not surprise me that parties specialising in racism and xenophobia fail to be across the requirements of both the constitution and the Electoral Act.
Returning to the bill, as well as supporting a constitutional amendment to make Australian citizenship the test for qualification, the ALP supports leaving it for parliament to determine which offices it will provide a bar for under the office of profit provision. My personal view is that public servants ought to stand aside if they wish to run for parliament. But there should also be a restoration period following the election for unsuccessful candidates. This was very much the case in the 1960s and 1970s, but as each state government has revised its public service laws or its education bills, a lot of these provisions have slipped out.
I am not surprised to hear Senator Murray say today that seven teachers were a bit reluctant to run for the Democrats in the House of Representatives elections—well, I accept that—because they would have had to resign. Having resigned, what guarantee would there have been of their achieving their previous position? Senator McKiernan—I hope I am not stealing your material—did refer to the case of Paul Filing, who ran unsuccessfully against us in 1987. I think he was a police sergeant at the time. He was given a job back with the police force, but at a much lower level. We should try to deal with these matters so that, if we do not want public servants running, we could only do that on the basis that people who resigned their positions were, by an edict of this parliament, restored to their previous position immediately after their unsuccessful bid for parliament.
I note from Senator Brown's bill that judicial officers would automatically remain subject to disqualification, and I think that is a very sensible approach to take. Over the years, many members of this chamber have had considerable financial hits in order to take their positions in this place. After all, it has always been understood that the ban on senators, like a ban on members, takes effect from before the election until they actually 
 take their seats in parliament. For the House of Representatives that is not a very noteworthy factor—most of them take their seat in the parliament immediately—but, with the provisions of section 13, senators may have to wait many months before they can actually take up their seats. Of course, they still have families to support during this period and so the ban on returning to employment before you come to his chamber can be a very major penalty.
I think it was the 1961 Senate election that elected Doug McClelland, a very distinguished senator, to this chamber. He was a reporter for Hansard and had an eight-month wait. He then had to enter a new career selling ice-creams, as I understand, for eight months. So if the great minister in the Whitlam government, and President of this chamber, was ever asked what his job was before coming into parliament, it was one of selling ice-creams.
Senator Ferris by now is fairly intimately acquainted with these provisions. She was one of the lucky ones. She did not have to face a very long wait—something like three months, I think it was, compared with nine months for any senators-elect at this most recent election. We raised questions when we heard that Senator-elect Ferris was working for Senator Minchin, because we believed it totally contravened the existing provisions of the constitution, and we were conscious that we have to obey the law as it is.
If we had not raised objections in this chamber, down the track two things could have happened: validity of legislation or enactments by this parliament could have been challenged, and also Senator Ferris personally could have been placed in a very invidious position a year or two later because of the financial penalties that may have been attracted to her membership of this parliament. So I think we were right to raise that particular question at the time. It had a side benefit of embarrassing Senator Minchin—the skilled apparatchik from South Australia turned into one of the most incompetent people ever for overlooking this particular provision—so I suppose we could not resist some glee in pointing that out.
On reflection, Senator Brown's suggestion is that this parliament is the one that determines what is exempt and what is not. I say to Senator Brown that, if this is successfully translated, I still think I would want the parliament to exclude the sort of position that Senator Ferris took because it was the direct gift of the executive. It was not through a merit Public Service position—I am not inferring that Senator Ferris did not have the merit—it was through the MOPS Act or through Executive Council. I think those ones still should be exempt, but this parliament itself should determine that and not the High Court in those circumstances.
The Labor Party has had a long history of expanding the pool from which candidates for public office can be drawn. It is in that spirit that we support Senator Brown's bill. Recently the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs estimated that up to five million Australians could hold dual citizenship, and that is an ever expanding area. Coupled with the provisions for restoring the original intent of office-of-profit disqualification, the ALP believes that this bill will ensure that frivolous and avoidable litigation following elections can be prevented and that the pool of eligible parliamentarians from which candidates can be drawn will be expanded.
We do have some problems with this bill. One problem is that it is privately sponsored, and those bills do not have a very good track record. I think, when I last asked at a Senate estimates committee, I was told that in 10 or 15 years only one private member's bill had actually gone through this chamber and been adopted by the House of Representatives. I do not want to go to the detail of that, but it was a very, very narrowly based bill.
The odds of this bill actually progressing through this chamber with all the provisions required for a constitutional change still remain a bit pessimistic. For it then to be given currency in the House of Representatives, picked up and passed, again is not likely. But what Senator Brown has done is to make the first step. He has raised the issue and the consciousness on it.
I certainly would oppose this bill being put to the people on a separate basis. I hope Senator Brown accepts that I do not think $40 million being spent on just this one constitutional area would be acceptable. But if, at some stage, we are going to the people on questions of the republic or other matters, this should be a matter that we put to the people at the same time—hoping that it does not get, if you like, poisoned by some other issues that may be run.
A lot of time and a lot of money can be spent on unsuccessful referendums. I recall the last great referendum, when four questions were put to the people of Australia by the very admirable then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen. It was very, very hard going trying to get any of those up—they all failed. I must say I favoured only three out of four, but handing out how-to-vote cards on the day before I voted, I very quickly voted for all four, even the one I did not like much, because they were all going down the shute. These types of referendums will have a major chance of success if all parties support them, but that is an absolute requirement. If you do not have the support of the major parties, it is easy to knock off a referendum proposal.
I commend this particular bill and I commend Senator Brown for bringing the issues forward. I do hope that the government at some stage, with all its resources, will take over the sponsorship. I am not taking the credit away from you, Senator Brown, but the government has the ability to progress these things much more easily than a private member's bill has in the Senate. I think you have sparked interest in this area, and at the next opportunity that any government goes to the people on constitutional change, it should in fact have this as one of the propositions.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1998-12-03,"—The Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) Bill 1998 which is before the chamber at the moment proposes alterations to section 44 of the constitution in two material aspects. I will address each one separately. They are section 44(i), which relates to foreign citizenship, and section 44(iv), which relates to holding an office of 
 profit under the Crown. Alterations are also made to section 44(v), but it is substantially within the same line of thought.
Turning to the first matter, I disagree with the proposition that dual citizenship, provided one of the nationalities held by the person in question is Australian, should entitle a person to stand for election to the parliament. That is not disparaging in any way people who are dual nationals. I simply take the view that a higher requirement is expected of people who seek election to the federal parliament. In fact, that was the original intention of section 44 of the constitution.
Section 44 of the constitution does not say that any Australian citizen shall be entitled to election to the federal parliament. In fact, section 44 says that you must be an Australian citizen but there are categories of persons who are not eligible for election to the parliament. One such category, for example, is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent. There are other categories of persons. That is not to say that a person who is a dual national is necessarily in the same league as someone who is attainted of treason, but the original framers of the constitution felt that the parliament should be served by people who met a higher requirement than that which applied to citizens.
In relation to dual nationals, there are very good reasons why this section should be retained. The first is that there is a difference between somebody who enjoys the fruits of Australian citizenship and somebody who decides what the fruits of Australian citizenship should be. More importantly, there is a difference between somebody who lives within the shores of this country and somebody who has responsibility for dealing, for example, with the relationship between this country and another country.
Let me take a simple case in point. This parliament regularly deals with issues of external affairs, either in a legislative fashion or some other fashion—in some other form of debate, or the passage of resolutions, or the asking of questions in estimates committees, in question time or questions on notice. Suppose a person was a dual national of Australia and Japan, and Australia was in 
 volved in a bitter and acrimonious trade dispute with Japan in relation to the issue of tariffs, for example. Does it not create at least the perception of a lack of independence if a person who is voting upon issues related to trade between Australia and another country is also a citizen of that other country? The clear intention of the framers of the constitution in section 44(i) was to avoid that conflict of interest—to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest—by saying that such a person should be precluded from becoming a member of parliament.
We sometimes forget the very high office that every member of parliament holds in this place—both here and in the House of Representatives. We are not ordinary citizens. The people of Australia do not treat us as ordinary citizens. They expect a higher standard of us. It is not unreasonable on that basis for us to say to people who are dual nationals, `You are welcome to enjoy the fruits of Australian citizenship; however, if you want to be a legislator in this country, then a higher standard is required.' In saying that, I acknowledge some of the very learned comments made by Senator Ray in relation to dual citizenship. I think he made some very perspicacious comments. This is the difficulty of accepting the proposal contained in this bill.
It is ironic that certain members of parliament work themselves into quite a lather about the possibility of selling government interest in a telephone company for fear of partial foreign ownership, yet have no objection to allowing people to become members of parliament—to actually run the country as opposed to having an interest in a telephone company in the country—who are dual nationals. Is it not absurd to say that the telephone company should be 100 per cent Australian but the people who are running the country need not be?
I understand Senator Brown's desire to encapsulate a broad cross-section of the community and make them eligible for parliament. I understand that, but I say to Senator Brown that if people wish to aspire to the high office of senator or member of the House of Representatives, it is not unreasonable for people to say, `We expect you to be 
 more than a citizen. We expect you to have a clear and undivided loyalty to Australia.' `Clear and undivided loyalty to Australia' is the phrase Senator Faulkner used in discussing this matter in the debate today. That is not an unreasonable proposition. It is a proposition that I believe the majority of Australians would support.
Yes, there are five million people who are dual nationals potentially, but in Sykes and Cleary the High Court created a mechanism by which those people could make themselves eligible for parliament. I accept the comments that Senator Ray made about some countries not allowing a person to disavow their citizenship of that country. But the High Court did not say that they had to be a citizen of Australia only. It basically said that they had to take all reasonable steps; they had to actively show their allegiance to Australia solely. We cannot control the operation of the laws of another country within their jurisdiction, but we can certainly set limits within this country of what we expect of potential members of either the Senate or the House of Representatives.
For that reason, I do not believe it is unreasonable for section 44(i) to be in there. Although the wording has been described by others in this chamber as archaic, I think it is not that unreasonable, because it talks about a person who:
Is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power;
Consider those words. It says that, if you want to be a member of parliament in Australia, you should not be under any `acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power'. You are here to serve Australia first and foremost and not have the potential of being accused of serving, or in fact even serving, the interests of another country. If you wish to accept this high office, is it not a reasonable price that you should disclaim the rights and privileges of another country? It is a small price to pay, I believe, for the honour of serving the Australian people in this parliament. I believe there are few honours higher than that of 
 serving the Australian people in this parliament, and that is not an unreasonable price to pay for that honour.
I know the time is very brief and we have undertaken to Senator Brown to try to get this to a vote today, so I will have to shorten my comments on the other provision of the bill. I know my learned friend Senator Abetz will make comment on it. Suffice to say that there is a reason why subsection 44(iv) was inserted in the constitution, and I believe it is a historical reason. In the first half of the 19th century, the British parliament was dominated by the military because the military was dominated by the aristocratic class of Britain. There were peers with courtesy titles and grandsons of peers who were in the army and who were also in parliament. One only has to look at the history of Britain at the beginning of the 19th century to understand the fear that the framers of our constitution had that the military might dominate the operations of the parliament.
So I can very much see why subsection 44(iv) was inserted there. It was inserted there to ensure that the parliament would not become a captive of the military. When you consider that it was some 40 years only from the ending of transportation to the framing of the constitution and when you consider that transportation and the system which supported transportation in this country were maintained by the military rather than by the civilian powers of the colonies, you can understand why the framers of the constitution, seeking to create a charter for a new nation, should shy away from the potential of a military domination of the parliament. One of the frequent criticisms that is made of Indonesia and some other countries in the region, or Chile even, is that the parliament or the congress is in a position to be dominated by the military. That is, I believe, the intention of subsection 44(iv). I do not want to go into the merits of it too much, but it is worthy of note that it was inserted there for a very good reason, and that reason was to uphold our liberties and our freedoms.
I will conclude by saying that there has been remarkable comment on this provision of late. I do not want to talk about the merits 
 of any particular case, but it is interesting to note that one former member of the House of Representatives now believes that a special case should apply to citizens from the United Kingdom, when on 19 September that same person ended a speech in Longreach with the words `One people, one flag, one set of rules'. Isn't it dangerous if we, by passage of this bill, import into the Australian constitution perhaps an even more unsatisfactory situation than exists at the moment? I believe that Senator Ray has raised some very good points but I do not believe this bill is the way to address them. With great respect to what Senator Brown seeks to do, I do not believe this bill is the way to address it. In fact, I believe that it creates potentially as many problems as exist at the moment, if not more. For anybody who has any doubts about how we sort out the problem, I simply refer them to the excellent contribution made by Senator Ellison in stating what the Electoral Commission has done to try and make it clear to people what their obligations are. For those reasons I have outlined today, I certainly do not support the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I rise to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members andCandidates) Bill 1998. When subsection 44(i) of the constitution came in, it referred to British citizens. It is interesting to read the statement of Sir Edward Braddon from Tasmania almost 101 years ago, on 31 January 1898, when he was talking about the issue of whether or not there ought to be a right of appeal to the Privy Council. He talked about that in the context of the Commonwealth. He said:
I do not think anything more calamitous could occur than that we should deprive the people of the Commonwealth of the right to appeal to the Queen in Council, a right that as Britons they should be allowed to exercise and one which is enjoyed at the present time by every man in every part of the empire.
He talked of Britons and he talked of men. He had this to say a little later:
We all, I believe, desire to remain members of the great British Empire, and we wish to continue British subjects with all the rights of British 
 subjects, and of those rights this appeal to the Privy Council is a very considerable one.
There has been a great change since those days, as is indicated by the case of Senator Robert Wood, who departed the Senate in rather tragic circumstances. He was a person who was dedicated to this country and to the Senate.
As has been said before me, people should be Australians if they are going to represent Australians, and they should be Australians alone. I know it has been said that all sorts of legal problems can arise because of the action of other countries which may want to keep on their books, as it were, people who are, and want to be, citizens of Australia. But the High Court has worked that out. It has given us the proper test, which says that, if a person strives to be an Australian citizen and an Australian citizen only, then he or she should be treated as such.
Over almost 100 years—since we became a nation—we have grown away from our roots, from the British cradle, which gave us so many great attributes. It is now time that we stood as Australians and as Australians alone. The statement of Sir Edward Braddon, which may have had all sorts of force on 31 January 1898, has lost its force. In that context, about 111 years ago—on 1 October 1887—there was a poem published in the Bulletin by Henry Lawson. This is what he said in his second verse:
Sons of the South, make choice between
(Sons of the South, choose true)
The Land of Morn and the Land of E'en,
The Old Dead Tree and the Young Tree Green,
The Land that belongs to the lord and Queen,
and the Land that belongs to you.
Australia's great poet was saying at that time that there ought to be a distinction drawn between those in Australia who see themselves as Australians and those who are overseas, and that the great aspects of a nation can only be attained by people who see themselves as Australians only.
I have no objection to following on from what has already been said about people having dual citizenship and living in this country. That is more than reasonable, be 
 cause we are a migrant country. But there are problems where people who represent the nation—as we do, in the parliament—would want to hold on to a second aspect. There should be one aspect and one aspect only, as a symbol that we are an independent country and a country, hopefully, that is soon to be a republic—as Henry Lawson wanted about 111 years ago.
The purpose of section 44, I think, is best described by our present Governor-General, Sir William Deane, when he was on the High Court in 1992. In the Sykes v. Cleary and Others case, he had this to say:
Moreover, in the construction of a constitutional provision such as s.44—
he quotes Sir Garfield Barwick—
"". . . the purpose it seeks to attain must always be kept in mind.""
Sir William Deane continues:
That purpose is essentially to ensure that the composition of the Parliament is appropriate for the discharge in the national interest of its functions as the legislature of a free and independent nation under a Constitution which adopts the Cabinet or Westminster system of parliamentary democracy but is otherwise structured upon the doctrine of a separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers. As one would expect in the Constitution of a country whose population consisted (by 1900) largely of immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, the disqualification provisions of s.44 look solely to present allegiance, status and interests.
That last concept is one that we should keep in mind: no matter where you come from or whatever your past, you can become an Australian and an Australian citizen, but you must look to your present allegiance. Is it too much to ask that a person who represents Australia in this place should have a present allegiance to Australia and to Australia only?
It is my view that Senator Brown, who is rightly striving to make section 44 work and to make it contemporary, has gone too far in saying that a person can be a member of this parliament simply by being an Australian citizen, without taking away from himself or herself that part of his or her identity which is not Australian. It is that aspect which is symbolic of the country and of what we need.
The other issue I want to raise is the disqualification presently lurking in the constitu 
 tion for those who hold an office of profit under the Crown and who have contracts with the government. That is a voice from the 18th century. Macaulay's work on the Earl of Chatham, William Pitt, shows that Pitt was noted for the fact that he did not take bribes, he did not misuse public funds and he did not make use of the secret service, as they called it, as everybody else did. That was a symbol of the day. The idea was that the Crown was part of that to attract parliament to itself, to get the views of parliament on its side so it could do what it wanted. That danger of the Crown corrupting the parliament has long since passed and it is more than time that that provision went. I think it is one of the great shames of this place that Phil Cleary, a former member for Wills, had to go through the trauma he did to finally win his seat. It was a very unfortunate part of our history that he should have had to do that. The last part of the bill introduced by Senator Brown says:
The Constitution is altered by omitting the following words from section 44:
, or of any of the Queen's Ministers for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or member of the Queen's navy or army.
I must ask him why he deletes that part but leaves the rest of that section of the constitution:
But sub-section (iv) does not apply to the office of any of the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth . . . or to the receipt of pay . . . as an officer or member of the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth by any person whose services are not wholly employed by the Commonwealth.
Why leave that part in but take out the other part? I ask that in light of the fact that it is going to be parliament which determines, in any event, who fits into paragraph (iv) and who does not. It seems to me that that is too much open to the spirit of the day rather than being fixed by the people. There is much to be said for the people of Australia fixing the qualifications that their members should have.
It was a right they were given when the referenda took place in the 1890s and I think it is right that they should be left with the ability to determine who shall be and who shall not be their members of parliament, 
 rather than parliament itself in this context doing that. I would certainly like to hear Senator Brown on that. The main thrust of it, as others have said before me, is that the great need is for Australians to be represented by Australians and those who owe allegiance only to this country, and that members of parliament are in a special category above and beyond the rest of the population in that regard.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (RIGHT TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENT—QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-12-03,"—I rise to join in this debate on the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) Bill 1998. I understand that from our side we would not have minded this matter going to a vote this afternoon but I understand that, if I had not risen in my place, the Labor Party would have substituted one of their speakers to speak out this debate. It is on that basis I join in, noting that I have only about three minutes, so my comments will be brief. I do not object to the concept of dual citizenship, but I believe that this parliament, in particular in recent years, has expended a lot of energy in relation to assertions of conflicts of interest, assertions suggesting that a minister of the Crown or other people might do certain things if they have a conflict of interest.
If you hold two citizenships, both of the same value to that person, one can genuinely ask the question: in the situation of a conflict of interest between your nationalities, which one will prevail? Under the proposal before us, we could well have a situation where somebody has dual citizenship with a nation with whom we have hostilities, be it in relation to war, trade or other areas. That person could also be involved in trade in the other country or, indeed, in the armed forces in the other country, yet still hold a position in this parliament and possibly sit on the defence committee of this nation. When you serve in this parliament, you should have only one loyalty, and that is to Australia. You cannot have a dual loyalty.
It may be, as suggested, that subsection (2) of the bill would deal with that because the parliament would be given the power from 
 time to time to declare certain offices to be such as to disqualify you from holding office. I have to say that is a recipe for disaster. There have been times in this parliament when a party has had the numbers in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. It has not been unknown for this parliament to use its powers for particular purposes which are not necessarily in the best interests of the nation. You could have a situation where the opposition nominates a particular candidate who—you could pick any profession—happens to be a policeman.
—We have had some bad examples of cops.
—In relation to Mr Filing, it might be a bad example, I do not know, but it could be any profession or calling in life such that, if you hold that position, it is not allowable to be a member of parliament. The government of the day could, in effect, by passing it through both houses, disqualify that candidate from running for a seat or from taking office if that person were to win the seat. The government, with both houses, could effect such a result. I can understand the reason and rationale for this legislation but, when you look at the detail, there are some very real problems with it. I for one would not be satisfied in supporting this legislation in its current form. But that does not mean to say there is not a need for dealing with the problems of section 44.

—I do not have an objection to that if you are able to work that out between the various potential speakers next week. We will continue as I suggested for this time.
—So they will not be discharged?
—They will not be taken to be discharged.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Consideration</title>,Documents,30,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-03,"—One of the problems, if you leave all of the documents on, is that I have given up waiting for, say, document 106 because you never get to document 106. All that ever happens is that you have the same list every week and, if you never discharge documents, you never get further down the list. It is a lovely idea, but I think it has problems as well.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Consideration</title>,Documents,30,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-03,"—On that point, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have no problem if we go to document 106 and that is discharged, but I do know that there are other documents that other senators are interested in.
—Perhaps we could try your earlier suggestion of trying something for next week rather than figuring it out as we go along. It might be something that could be added to whips meetings or something like that and sorted out in advance.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Consideration</title>,Documents,30,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-12-03,"—I am not sure on what basis these comments have been made—whether it is by leave or whether it is by point of order. I suggest to Senator Hogg that, if he does know of specific documents that specific senators 
 want to make comment on, it is appropriate for his whip or, indeed, for himself, to ask that consideration of that particular document be postponed. I think that would overcome what Senator Margetts is concerned about: that we have a whole lot of documents there. If Senator Hogg knows that people want to speak on specific documents, let us preserve them, but let us not clog up the Notice Paper .
—I would suggest that, on this occasion, we proceed as suggested and as has been tried before. Perhaps next week we could trial having the parties figure out in advance who wants to speak to what documents and then we can bounce around to our hearts content. On this occasion, however, we shall go with documents 1 to 10. Does anyone want to speak to any of these documents?",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Consideration</title>,Documents,30,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-12-03,"—In speaking to this report I think it is important to say such a wealth of government documents come before us that it is very easy for some of them to slip through without us taking note of them. In this instance, I would like to draw people's attention to this report mainly because I think it is important to highlight the role of an institute such as this.
One of the main aims of the institute is to promote knowledge and understanding of Australian indigenous cultures, past and present. I want to place on record that it does so in an element of high quality research and knowledge within the area. It is probably one of the very few institutes that is dedicated to and managed by Aboriginal and Torres Islander people. The institute dedicates its work to a number of areas, such as undertaking and promoting Aboriginal and Torres Islander studies and making sure that all of these areas are placed on the public record.
There are a number of activities we should look at. The institute has done a number of 
 important things this year. It has instituted a new collections management system called `Mura', which is a Ngunnawal word meaning `pathway'. It has also ensured that a number of publications relating to regional agreements, key issues in Australia and working out agreements have been brought to the attention of the Australian public. I note that the Chair of the institute is Professor Marcia Langton, who is also the Chair of the Cultural and Indigenous Natural Resource Management Centre at the Northern Territory University. The Deputy Chair is Mick Dodson.
There is not a lot I want to say about this report. I think the institute has done some outstanding work through the year. My main aim in talking to the report was to highlight to the general public and this chamber that these reports should be taken note of and the opportunity taken to speak of them. I think the work that these sorts of institutes do during the year should be drawn to the public's attention.
There is often a lot of criticism about the role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies. There is a lot of criticism in fact about the role of Aboriginal people sometimes in this society. I think this report highlights that here we have an institute managed by Aboriginal people that conducts some very high quality research and that puts out some very high quality statements about issues affecting this country in terms of reconciliation and interaction with what is happening in our community and Aboriginal issues. I think it is worth our taking note and spending a few minutes to at least speak about its highlights and achievements during the year. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-12-03,"—I rise this evening to update the Senate on the marvellous progress being made in Newcastle by BHP in terms of the redeployment of its work force. Yesterday in this chamber, in discussions relating to the Hunter Advantage Fund and the tremendous contribution of the Howard government to the redevelopment of the Hunter Valley post-BHP, I made some mention of the fact that BHP was working very hard on the redeployment of its members into other occupations following the downsizing of steel-making operations in the next year.
BHP is to be commended for its work in this field. It has become a model for what businesses should be doing with their work force when they are faced with a significant downscaling. Often what happens is that businesses suddenly announce they are shutting up shop and people are left totally in the lurch  sometimes with only a few hours notice.
BHP has been working for two years on personal development plans with all its workers to make sure that, if they are not being redeployed within BHP and are not retiring, they have somewhere else to go. So far they have developed personal plans with 1,800 of their work force, which is almost the remaining work force in its entirety.
BHP has developed proper transition arrangements. The principles that underlie the transition arrangements are that people will be treated fairly and they will be well prepared for the future; the business will run safely and efficiently through the transition; and the restructured business will be world-class in 
 the eyes of all stakeholders. A recent Business Sunday report on 1 November this year stated that BHP was setting records in production and safety performance. So BHP is meeting those last two principles that I have just outlined.
Within the last year, 600 workers have left BHP of their own volition to go to other jobs. BHP now has a work force of 2,300. It is working with these remaining employees to make sure that, when the steel-making operation shuts down, they will have the skills needed to move on to the next phase of their life.
Workers will get help with the following: financial and career planning; personal counselling; retirement planning; small business courses; and training and education assistance. The initiatives undertaken by BHP include training and education opportunities relating to future careers and community support arrangements designed to create new jobs.
Personal action plans set up at BHP work as follows: employees are given help to explore and investigate various career options, to determine their career goals, to develop personal action plans and to receive job search assistance. At this stage, 1,800 employees have had at least one PAP, or personal action plan, discussion. That is a very high proportion of the work force. BHP has spent the equivalent of 76 weeks full-time work on such an arrangement. A total of 1,100 employees have now determined their direction—that is, half the remaining work force. A total of 595 have commenced retraining in new jobs. BHP is ensuring that the workers in the Hunter are not left in the lurch when steel-making ceases.
On the Business Sunday story examples were given of the sort of training and support that workers are getting. For example, an electrician who had worked at BHP for 38 years—in most corporate closures, having worked there for 38 years, that would probably be the end of your career—now has a whole new career option available to him, thanks to BHP. He is learning massage and reflexology. His training is being funded by the company. He has 12 months left at BHP and then he will start his own business. He 
 plans to have enough clientele in 12 months time to be able to move full-time into this new occupation. He told the interviewer that this is an alternative, very different lifestyle from the one he has had in his career at BHP. He finds it relaxing and I am sure he will be a great success.
Another worker, who has been a rail supervisor for 37 years, also has big plans for his future. He is taking a security course and will open his own business to take advantage of the many opportunities that have come about because of the staging of the Olympic Games.
Another worker, a bloom mill operator, has been helped by BHP to complete his commercial pilots licence. He said he believes BHP has contributed around $5,500 to his training. When asked, he said he did not think it was likely big corporations would help workers like this, but in his case and in many others BHP has.
A fourth example was a worker who had left the company and started his own courier business. He said that the company he had set up was already paying for itself. BHP had paid for him to attend courses that will help him run the business. He also received financial advice through BHP.
The story said that BHP provided financial support. That is one of the most important things that BHP is doing for its work force. This advice ensures that workers use their redundancy payout wisely, something that does not always happen. If people are retiring, they attend retirement seminars so they are well prepared for their possible options. BHP has picked the financial consultants and it uses these seminars very carefully. It does not want its workers to be given shoddy advice or to be ripped off. It wants them to be very well prepared for their future. The Business Sunday story finished by saying that no company that shut down was without trauma but BHP was setting an example that was being watched by other companies throughout Australia. BHP is to be commended for helping to ease the burden of the work force and the local community.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Broken Hill Proprietary Co.
