Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (10:01):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and flag that I will be moving an amendment during the Committee of the Whole to omit schedule 2 from the bill. This bill seeks to do three things. Firstly, the bill establishes a prisoner of war recognition supplement—a POWR—of $500 per fortnight, which will be paid to around 900 eligible former prisoners of war. Secondly, the bill seeks to clarify arrangements concerning offsetting provi­sions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. I will speak in further detail about this schedule shortly. Finally, the third schedule of this bill rationalises the way temporary incapacity payments are made under the bill.


The coalition supports schedules 1 and 3 of the bill. Of course, schedule 1 of the bill builds on a similar initiative of the previous coalition government. The previous coalition government made one-off ex gratia payments of $25,000 to Australian ex-POWs. In 2001 these payments were made to former Japanese POWs, in 2003 to prisoners of the North Koreans and in 2007 to former captives of the Germans and Italians. Honourable senators will know of my close personal connection to the ex-POW com­munity in Australia through my involvement as co-chair of the Australian ex-prisoner of war memorial project in my home city of Ballarat. The coalition supports the supple­ment, which will be available to approxi­mately 900 POWs who are known to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The first payment will be made on 6 October and the measure will be in place from 20 September this year. 


Schedule 3 of this bill rationalises temporary incapacity payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986—the VEA. The changes abolish the payment of temporary incapacity allowance under the act, with those previously eligible for this payment being transferred to the loss of earnings allowance presently available under the VEA. The rationalisation of these pay­ments reflects the changing nature of Australian society. A stay in hospital and periods of convalescence can be much shorter now than in the past. The temporary incapacity allowance currently paid under the VEA requires an eligible veteran to be hospitalised or unable to work for a mini­mum period of 28 days. After 28 days the veteran is eligible to apply to receive an allowance, which is backdated to the first day of hospitalisation. The changes proposed by the amendment remove the 28-day qualification period and replace it with a pro rata loss of earnings allowance which compensates for an actual loss of earnings. The Parliamentary Library explains that the amount of loss of earnings allowance payable is the lesser of the difference between the T&PI rate of disability pension and the veteran's present rate of disability pension and the amount of salary, wages or earnings actually lost, including loadings or other allowances that would have been payable. This is a sensible amendment which the coalition and the ex-service community support.


Schedule 2 of the bill has been the subject of a Senate inquiry and the coalition is opposed to it. Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to amend provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to clarify the opera­tion of compensation offsetting provisions. Offsetting occurs when a person is eligible to receive compensation from two or more sep­arate Commonwealth compen­sation schemes for the same incapacity resulting from injury. Offsetting dates back to 1973 when the Whitlam Labor government determined to broaden the application of the former Repatriation Act to cover certain non-warlike service. As a consequence of this action, some eligible ex-defence personnel were able to access compensation under two acts—the Repatriation Act and the Compen­sation (Government Employees) Act 1971. The offsetting changes introduced in 1973 and backdated to 1972 were intended to apply to dual eligibility for compensation paid from Commonwealth compensation schemes. A vital premise of Australia's repatriation system is that the Common­wealth will compensate for incapacity, not for the injury itself. As a result, two people with the same injury may receive different rates of compensation based solely on the degree to which each person is incapacitated. The coalition supports this principle, as does the veteran and ex-service community.


I now turn to the Smith case. The amendments proposed by this schedule arise from a decision of the full Federal Court. In the matter of Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (2009), the court found that compen­sation offsetting should not apply to Mr Smith because of the unique circum­stances of his case. Mr Smith was receiving compen­sation under the VEA and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 for two separate incapacities relating to separate periods of service in the Australian Defence Force. In the first instance, Mr Smith received compensation under the VEA for a duodenal ulcer and PTSD as a result of his service in Vietnam. Secondly, Mr Smith received compensation for anxiety arising from his service aboard HMAS Melbourne at the time it collided with the Voyager. The court held that these two conditions were not related and, on the basis of this fact, determined that offsetting should not apply under the act. I note the Commonwealth did not pursue this matter beyond the Federal Court. The Commonwealth argued that Mr Smith was being twice compensated for the same incapacity—a position the court disputed, holding that the injuries and resultant incapacities were different and separate. The court awarded a confidential settlement to Mr Smith and found in his favour. Consequently, the government is now seeking to clarify the legislation to make clear the Repatriation Commission's understanding of the intention of the legislation—and I use the word 'clarify' advisedly.


At the coalition's request, a Senate inquiry into the bill sought submissions from the veteran and ex-service community. In particular, I thank the RSL, Legacy and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia for their participation and the RSL for attending the public hearing in Canberra on 11 August. Three weeks ago, the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill was tabled in the Senate. My colleagues Senator Alan Eggleston and Senator David Fawcett tabled a dissenting report which calls for schedule 2 of the bill to be omitted. I thank both of my colleagues for their significant input into this inquiry.


During the inquiry, the RSL forcefully put the view that the proposed amendments went above and beyond the intention of the 1973 legislation which the government allegedly seeks to clarify. Further, the RSL put the view that appropriate provisions already exist in the legislation and in accompanying regulations to ensure that offsetting cases similar to Mr Smith's would be treated fairly under the act. The department did not dispute the detail of the RSL's analysis. It was also made clear during the public hearing and in other representations to me on other matters that parliament must maintain the ability to set the policies by which the department, the Repatriation Commission and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Com­mission operate. In particular, I note Rear Admiral Doolan's statement:


… the RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.


The coalition agrees with this and is concerned that these proposed amendments to, as the government claims, clarify the operation of the act will still require guidelines to ensure they are applied properly. Parliament's intention, rather than the department's, must be paramount in this respect. Parliament's original intention was sufficiently clear in this case. I will shortly move an amendment to omit schedule 2 from this bill. I ask honourable senators to consider the best interests of our veteran and ex-service community and support the coalition's amendment.


I understand that there may be some alterations to the explanatory memorandum to the bill. I do not know whether these are clarifications or what they are, but we are advised that there will be some alterations. I certainly have not seen the altered explan­atory memorandum and I do not know whether the minister on duty is able to nod her head to indicate whether or not this will be tabled. Obviously it would be an extraordinary situation were I to be starting my second reading speech in relation to this matter and it was being proposed to alter the explanatory memorandum. In fact it beggars belief that that would actually occur at this eleventh hour. So I am assuming that this will not be the case. I have not been advised by the minister's office or anyone else about it. We will wait and see. The amendments proposed in schedule 2 have not been justified and more work needs to be done before the parliament considers the measures presently opposed. The coalition will support schedules 1 and 3 of this bill but oppose schedule 2.


I will briefly address some other matters. I notice that my colleague Senator Fawcett has now entered the chamber and I will repeat the thanks I gave to him earlier for his significant involvement in the Senate inquiry and his very considerable input into it. The so-called winter recess has been an extraordinarily busy period. I want to thank the hundreds of veterans and ex-service­people, and their families, who I have met during my travels—everywhere from Albany to Geraldton in Western Australia, to Mackay, Townsville and Cairns in North Queensland, and from Sydney to Warrnam­bool, amongst other places. I look forward to spending more time on the road shortly and encourage people with an interest in veterans affairs to participate in the coalition's veterans forums which are being held right across the country. 


The biggest issue I am hearing is the ongoing unfair, unjust and inequitable situation facing DFRDB superannuants as a result of the shameful decision by this place to oppose the coalition's fair indexation bill. Honourable senators will be only too aware of the anger in the community at the decision of Labor, the Greens and Senator Xenophon to block the coalition's fair indexation bill from passing on 16 June. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame for this shameful decision to oppose the bill.


I want to turn now to the Centenary of Anzac. There remains significant concern about the Gillard-Brown Labor government's failure to establish a budget for the Anzac Centenary commemorations, which are getting closer by the day. The coalition welcomes the appointment of Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston as chair of the new Anzac Centenary Advisory Board, but it is fair to say that Air Chief Marshall Houston is flying solo at the moment, with other members of the board yet to be announced or appointed. The elephant in the room, however, is the lack of funding certainty which is jeopardising the planning for commemoration in small towns and big cities right across Australia. The coalition welcomed the $250,000 announced for a scoping study for works in Albany's part of the centenary. Coincidentally, the minister chose to visit Albany the day before I was scheduled to speak at a business breakfast there about the Anzac Centenary itself—imitation is the best form of flattery. I welcome his belated and minor financial commitment to this project and look forward to seeing a real commitment of funds for the Anzac Interpretive Centre very soon Finally, I turn to advocacy funding. I draw the Senate's attention to the anger in the veteran and ex-service community about cuts to veterans' advocacy in the budget. The minister signed, just prior to travelling to France for the 95th anniversary com­memorations of the Battle of Frommelles, letters which dramatically slashed funding under the Building Excellence in Support and Training program, known as the BEST program, as well as the Veteran and Community Grants program. The BEST grant program was established by the previous government. The grants enable ex-service organisations to provide assistance to veterans, veterans' families, members of the Defence Force and their families. The grants assist volunteer veterans working in our community to assist those who have served our nation and are in need of assistance. These volunteers help veterans file claims for compensation. These volunteers touch base with our ageing veterans and war widows to ensure they do not become socially isolated. They provide help and support to those in our community who want to discuss their experiences with someone who understands what they have been through. Cutting this funding could not have come at a worse time. Frankly, this government has no mandate to cut funding to this program but, just as with the carbon tax, it is going to do it anyway. Page 5 of the Review of DVA-fundedESO advocacy and welfare services, which was tabled in February, says:


There is also a strong belief that the current practice within Australia, whereby ex-serving members voluntarily take on a role to assist in claims preparation ... has worked very well—


I repeat, 'has worked very well'—


and should continue to be supported through funding mechanisms such as the BEST program. The very nature of this voluntary work should be valued, not understated.


It went on to say that the government must be mindful that BEST grants funding should be:


... sufficient to meet the needs of the veteran community.


How the government can justify cutting $8 million from veterans' advocacy funding but then spend $12 million advertising their carbon tax broken promise is beyond the comprehension of most in the veteran and wider Australian community. The decision to cut this funding, made without warning and without any consultation, will potentially and dramatically spell the end for ex-service organisations, which simply will not be able to survive. 


My office has been inundated with angry veterans pension and welfare officers asking how they are meant to survive on a grant which has, in some cases, been cut more than 50 per cent on last year's funding. This is even more concerning given applications for this funding round were received in March, when no mention of funding cuts had been made by the government. 


One of those organisations is the Geelong Veterans Welfare Centre. Recently I spoke in the Senate about commemorations at the Vietnam War memorial in Geelong. The Vietnam veterans centre in Geelong is located at Osborne House, a historic property with long links to the defence of the nation. After the memorial service, members of the local veteran community came up to me deeply concerned about the impact of the BEST cuts on the veterans of Geelong. They have made available to me a letter they sent to Minister Snowdon with their concerns:


The Geelong Veterans' Welfare Centre has the largest client base in Victoria and is the busiest office.


We ... cover areas as far a-field as the south-west coast to Warrnambool/Port Fairy/Portland and up to Hamilton/Horsham and back through Rokewood and Colac.


The letter goes on to say: 


The loss of funding, particularly to the salary, will severely limit our capacity to fill the Administration Support Officer position and will most likely force our employee to seek other employment opportunities.


What a disgrace, an utter disgrace! Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to table this letter from the Geelong Veterans Welfare Centre to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs outlining the impact of the cuts on the centre and the services it provides to veterans and their families in the wider Geelong region. 


Leave granted. 




Senator RONALDSON:
  I am sorry to say that this situation is repeated right across the country. Over the last three months, I have had the honour to speak at RSL state branch congresses across Australia. In his remarks to at least three of these congresses, the minister has said that the number of veterans of the Afghanistan conflict will shortly equal the number of veterans who served in Vietnam. But the justification for these cuts is a 25 per cent decline in the veteran population—that is, a decline in the VEA veteran population, not in veterans making claims under the SRCA or the MRCA. 


Younger veterans will still need advocates. These cuts in funding will flow on to reduce access to assistance for them and their families when they return home. The government has absolutely got this one wrong and the coalition and the veteran community demand answers, not more spin from this Gillard-Brown Labor government. 


The coalition supports schedules 1 and 3 of this bill. We will move to remove schedule 2 during the Committee of the Whole because doing so is in the best interests of veterans and their families. If the government really sees value in this amendment, it will consult further and then bring this measure back to the parliament with the support of the veteran community.


I have just been given an addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Clearly, I have not had the opportunity to look at this. Can someone tell me why on this matter, which has been on the books for two or three months, I am now getting an addendum to the explanatory memorandum 10 minutes after I have started speaking? What is going on with this government? What a disgrace! These amendments were circulated weeks ago. Everyone knows the urgency of getting these POW payments through. Yet here at the eleventh hour I am getting an addendum to the explanatory memorandum. How can this chamber possibly operate properly when the responsible shadow minister was not given a copy of this addendum to the explanatory memorandum? It is quite disgraceful. This is another example of a government which is in freefall, a govern­ment which is divided, a government which has lost control of the agenda and thinks it is appropriate to bring an addendum to an explanatory memorandum into this chamber when the debate has started. I will now go and have a look at this. I suspect it will not allay the fears of those who have been involved in this process—the RSL, the Vietnam veterans et cetera. (Time expired)

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-09-12,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:22):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The Veterans' Entitlements Act provides for the payment of pensions and other benefits to veterans and certain other persons and provides for medical and other support. The Australian Greens are of the view that, as a society, we send people off to serve on our behalf in situations which potentially place them at great risk. It is only fair then that we ensure we look after them properly when they return home. As an overriding principle, the Australian Greens support fair and equitable compensation, assistance and support for all veterans and their families. 


This bill has three schedules. Schedule 1 seeks to create a prisoner of war recognition supplement. This will provide for certain veterans who have been held as prisoners of war to receive an additional supplement of $500 per fortnight in recognition of the severe hardship and deprivation they suffered during their incarceration. Schedule 2 seeks to clarify and affirm the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to pensions payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The schedule aims to make clear that where compensation is paid from another source in respect of the same incapacity, though not necessarily the same injury or disease, as a pension which is paid under the act, compensation offsetting provisions will apply. The intention is to prevent double payment of compensation for the same incapacity. Schedule 3 seeks to rationalise the current temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance by abolishing the former, the temporary incapacity allowance, and replacing it with an entitlement to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance instead. 


Schedule 1 is welcomed by the veterans communities and appears to be supported by all, and schedule 3 is relatively uncontro­versial. I will address these schedules briefly before focusing on schedule 2, which deals with offsetting and is more controversial and which has raised some concerns for the veterans communities and for the Australian Greens. These concerns were recognised by the Selection of Bills Committee, which, in recommending an inquiry into the provisions of the bill, focused on schedule 2, stating that the purpose for the inquiry would be 'to seek further information about the changes proposed by schedule 2 and to enable feedback from the veteran and ex-service community about the changes'. The bill was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry, and I was pleased to participate in this inquiry as a committee member. 


Under schedule 1, the proposed prisoner of war recognition supplement will be paid to veterans who were held as prisoners of war and to civilians alike who were interned as prisoners during World War II and the Korean War. Previous governments have made one-off ex gratia payments of $25,000 to former prisoners of war. In 2001, they were paid to those who were detained in Japan; in 2003, to those who had been detained in Korea; and in 2007, to those who were detained in Europe during World War II. The prisoner of war recognition supple­ment is proposed to be paid in addition to any existing Commonwealth benefits the eligible person receives. It will be exempt from income tax, exempt from calculations in assessing other veterans entitlements and exempt from social security income tests. The payment will be indexed annually in line with the consumer price index. The supple­ment is not a pension, nor is it compensation based on any test of incapacity or on the person having suffered a war caused injury or disease, and it will not be subject to the offsetting provisions of the act. It is purely in recognition of incarceration. 


The Department of Veterans' Affairs estimates that up to 900 former civilian and veteran prisoners of war will be eligible for the supplement. Introduction of the supple­ment is overwhelmingly supported by the veterans community. It is appropriate that we acknowledge the unique and often traumatic circumstances that prisoners of war endured at this nation's behest. Neither one-off payments nor fortnightly supplements can possibly fully compensate for the experience of being held as a prisoner of war. But, as a society, we can make these gestures which may make life a little more comfortable for those who have endured so much and acknowledge the contribution these people have made on our behalf. The Australian Greens support schedule 1, the payment of a prisoner of war recognition supplement. 


Schedule 3, the proposed rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance, is a logical streamlining measure which will remove the overlap and confusion associated with two similar payments. This proposal elicited no major concerns from the veterans community or others during the committee's inquiry. The Australian Greens support schedule 3. 


This brings me to schedule 2 of the bill. According to information from the Depart­ment of Veterans' Affairs, schedule 2 seeks to clarify compensation offsetting provisions. These provisions apply where a veteran receives compensation for two or more different injuries or illnesses which would result in the same incapacity. The provisions have been used since the early 1970s and schedule 2 seeks to clarify their application rather than to alter them or change when they are applied. Compensation offsetting rests on the principle that compensation is payable for a state of incapacity rather than for a specific injury. This amendment seeks to affirm and give clarity to the original intention of the existing legislation and to ensure the equitable outcome that a person cannot receive duplicate compensation for the same incapacity under different pieces of legislation. 


Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, pensions are payable for war or defence caused injury or disease. Pensions under part 2 of the act are payable to veterans, while pensions under part 4 are payable to current or former Defence Force members with certain peacetime service. The amendment in the bill seeks to ensure that a person cannot receive duplicate compensation for the same incapacity by providing that, if a person is receiving a pension under part 2 or part 4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the person receives additional compensation from another source in respect of the incapacity or death for which the pension is being paid, the amount of Veterans' Entitlements Act pension is reduced—that is, offset on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount of additional compensation. Most cases involving compensation offsetting arise from duplicate entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and their predecessors, though compensation from other sources, including third party insurance and common law cases, may also be subject to compensation offsetting under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. 


The stated reason for the introduction of the bill was to clarify the law after a 2009 Federal Court case, the Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (2009) FCAFC 175, after that case cast doubt on the way in which the department had previously interpreted the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The policy objective of the amendments was said to be to provide some certainty that the offsetting provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act could continue to be administered as they had been for nearly 40 years so as to prevent duplicate compensation being paid to veterans for the same incapacity. I was pleased to be a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for the purposes of inquiring into this bill. During this inquiry, concerns were raised by some members of the veterans community about this schedule, and the Australian Greens had some similar concerns. These can be summarised as: concerns that the schedule would extend the potential scope of offsetting, to the detriment of veterans; concerns about the consideration of legal costs in determining the value of compensation received; and concerns about the apparent discretionary nature in which offsetting provisions could be applied in the future. 


I turn to the issue of legal costs first. During the inquiry, I was concerned to learn that, when considering what amount of compensation was received in order to determine what offsetting should occur, the Repatriation Commission allows for one type of legal cost to be subtracted from the lump sum but not another. So the costs which are described as party-party costs are able to be subtracted from a settlement figure and the net figure then used to offset. However, other costs commonly paid by a client to a legal adviser—called solicitor-client costs—are not subtracted. These solicitor-client costs reduce the amount of money actually recei­ved by the claimant for their own use. This was raised as a matter of concern by the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia and the Returned and Services League of Australia. 


The Australian Greens are of the view that solicitor-client costs can often be quite significant and should not be ignored when the settlement figure for offsetting is being calculated. As Rear Admiral Doolan of the RSL said to the inquiry, the figure used for offsetting should be the amount actually paid into a person's bank account. This is only fair. The idea behind offsetting is that a person should not be compensated twice for the same incapacity. However, a person has not actually received that part of the compensation for their own use which has been paid to their lawyer as a legitimate cost of taking the legal action. So, it stands to reason that that part of the settlement should not be taken into account for the purposes of offsetting. The Australian Greens believe that solicitor-client costs should be subtracted from any settlement for the purposes of offsetting calculations. 


The committee report notes that this is an area worthy of consideration by government, although it is beyond the scope of the current bill. I understand that there has been a recent extensive review of military compensation, that the government is yet to respond to the review and that further legislative changes are likely in due course as a response to this review. The Australian Greens wish to see the issue of solicitor-client costs addressed in the next amendment bill. 


Of more immediate concern is the possibility, raised by the RSL and the VVFA—the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia—that the bill would lead to a situation where the Commonwealth could double dip into veterans' disability pensions and would change the system that has operated satisfactorily up to now. I took these concerns seriously, discussing them in more detail with the RSL and the VVFA after the inquiry was completed. While committed to the principle that offsetting was a sound practice in order to prevent a person being compensated more than once for the same incapacity, I was concerned that veterans should not be worse off, given the assurances that the government had offered that this legislation was not intended to do any more than affirm and clarify the situation as it is applied prior to the Smith case. 


After discussions with a representative of the minister and senior members of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I was pleased that the government had agreed to amend the explanatory memorandum attached to the bill to include a clear statement to the effect that the proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions, including the interaction between the provisions and chapter 19 of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions, fifth edition—also known as GARP V. 


This revised explanatory memorandum reads:


The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision and ensure that the established compensation offsetting practices can continue. 


The expansion to the explanatory memorandum clearly sets out the current practice in the use of GARP where there is an 'accepted' condition and a 'non-accepted' condition and the situation where GARP does not apply. In both cases the memor­andum explicitly states that the current practice will not change under the proposed amendments.


There remained a concern, raised by the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia in the inquiry and subsequently, about the discretionary nature of offsetting practice as it may be applied by the Repatriation Commission or decision makers into the future, notwithstanding what has happened in the past. Again, the Australian Greens took these concerns seriously and I am pleased that, after further discussions with the minister's representative and the department, the government has agreed to add a further paragraph to the explanatory memorandum as follows:


The Repatriation Commission will be issuing appropriate policy guidance to the Department of Veterans' Affairs staff to ensure offsetting occurs in line with the legislation and longstanding practice as outlined above. Ex-Service Organisations will be consulted during the development of this material. 


These statements, which will be on the public record, affirm the government's position that schedule 2 clarifies but does not change current offsetting arrangements. As such, the concerns of the Australian Greens about schedule 2 have been substantially addressed. In light of the revised explanatory memorandum, the Australian Greens now support schedule 2, meaning the Australian Greens support the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, as proposed by the government, with one addition. 


On behalf of the Australian Greens, I will be co-sponsoring a second reading amendment to the bill with Senator Nick Xenophon requesting that the government undertake an examination of the cost of expanding the class of persons eligible for the repatriation health card for all conditions—known as a gold card—to include a person who is a nuclear test participant as defined in the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006, and that such examination of the costing be completed within three months. Consideration of extending the gold card to British nuclear test participants is a matter of principle for the Australian Greens and has been previously proposed by my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam. Australian veterans were exposed to nuclear testing and radiation between 1952 and 1963 at Maralinga, Emu Field and the Montebello Islands. The Greens believe that, given these people were exposed to ionising radiation and the severe health impacts arising from this, they should be entitled to full comprehensive health care, in particular at gold card standard. Currently, British nuclear test participants do not have an automatic right to these entitlements. It seems to the Australian Greens that, given the recognition of the experiences and service of prisoners of war in schedule 1 of this bill, this is also an opportune time to request the government to investigate the costs of implementing this reform for British nuclear test veterans, who were also acting in service of their country. It would be a just and long overdue reform. I understand that, given the relatively small number of veterans involved, the costs would not be unduly prohibitive but I am happy to have this examined. Thus, the Australian Greens are happy to co-sponsor a second reading amendment.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (10:37):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and note the contribution of Senator Ronaldson and our opposition to schedule 2. The bill gives effect to the following budget measures: a prisoner of war recognition supplement, some proposed compensation offsetting changes, and rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance.


I will touch briefly on schedules 1 and 3 and then come back to schedule 2. On schedule 2, I have a number of issues with both process and principle that I would like to address. With regard to schedule 1, since 2001 lump sum payments of $25,000 have been made to former prisoners of war, particularly prisoners of the Japanese during World War II. That was a well-justified initiative of the Howard government to recognise the conditions and privations that were put upon these people who served their country. In 2003, these were extended to former POWs of the North Koreans during the Korean War and were extended again in 2007 to former POWs interned in Europe during World War II.


The supplement is a $500 per fortnight payment, which I welcome on behalf of the veterans who have been prisoners of war and note that it is tax free and not offset. I believe that is the kind of precedent that we should be setting for all of our support for veterans, whereby we recognise the fact that they have provided a unique service to this country and therefore we should be prepared to provide unique support back to them, even if it is different to the way some other community payments are treated.


Schedule 3 of the bill is a rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance. I notice there will be some veterans who are affected by the wind back of TIA, but all of the veterans organisations that we consulted supported that rationalisation as providing better clarity around those provisions. 


I wish to discuss schedule 2 in a little more detail. I particularly wish to thank members of the RSL who came to the inquiry of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, as well as Legacy and VVF, who provided submissions to help the committee looking at this provision understand how these proposed amendments could affect veterans and their concerns about them. One of the concerns that we raised in particular was about process. The Minister for Veterans Affairs made statements about the extensive consultation that had preceded these amendments and yet in our discussions, particularly with the RSL, it became abun­dantly clear that the consultation process in fact was not particularly broad. When it was boiled down, the specific consultation process with peak bodies such as the Returned and Services League consisted of a budget-eve briefing.


The common definition of consultation, as I understand it and as I think a reasonable person in the community would understand it, is a process whereby you engage with concerned parties, put forward a case, seek their feedback and, as appropriate, amend your position based on their feedback. To have a one-way flow of information on the eve of an announcement such that people have no chance, no opportunity, to influence or put forward their case or identify where the amendments may affect them and call it consultation is a real stretch. I believe that in light of the proposed amendments that the Australian Greens are talking about, where the government is promising to consult with the veterans community, we need to look at what it has done preceding this amendment bill and make sure that it is held to account to have meaningful consultation, which means consultation well ahead of the tabling of any changes that gives a real opportunity for people to consider the amendments and to make appropriate and studied responses to the amendments.


I move to the issue of principle. The RSL raised the point that it is very happy with the way the current offsetting provisions work. It accepts the need for offsetting but it also maintains essentially that if it is not broken then don't try to fix it. DVA promises that these amendments will make no change and will have no impact on veterans, which raises the question—particularly given that the Federal Court indicated that the Smith case was unique and DVA is not able to identify anyone else who falls within the same category—as to why the changes are needed. The RSL in particular highlighted that it believes that the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions, fifth edition, the GARP V, is adequate and addresses the situations where there needs to be some offsetting or pro rata allocation for a combination of injuries that have led to an incapacity.


Coming to the principle of offsetting: as I said, none of the veterans organisations disputed the need for offsetting. If you go back to 1973, when the principle first started to appear in legislation, there was an overlap between the Repatriation Act, the predecessor to VEA, and the Commonwealth Compensation Act 1971, which gave rise to a situation where some people had dual eligibility. It was very clear that there were two Commonwealth schemes under which people could possibly have a dual eligibility. So the concept was that nobody should be compensated twice by the Commonwealth for an injury that was received during their service. I do not think anyone has concerns with that. What has changed, though, is that the understanding that the offsetting should be between two Commonwealth sources of compensation has been extended so that any source of compensation is included We see this in both the explanatory memorandum and the DVA submission. In fact, DVA highlighted that some 20 per cent of the offsetting cases they are dealing with are not from Commonwealth sources but from sources such as civil claims and other sources of compensation. There is a flawed principle in the application of this amend­ment and the way the department has administered offsetting since it was intro­duced in 1973. If the principle was to make sure that the Commonwealth was not liable twice for one injury, that would be fine. But when you extend that to other sources of income then you start abrogating the duty of care that the Commonwealth has to people who have served this nation. It is important to remember that loyalty flows two ways.


If we expect people to enlist in the armed forces and to be prepared to put their lives, their welfare and their health on the line in the interests of this nation then we should be prepared to return that loyalty to them when they return. If they have been injured, including in the course of their duties during non-war related activities, we have an obligation to care for them. The fact that they may have another injury which was caused during a civilian accident and which happens to affect the same incapacity does not remove the obligation of the Commonwealth to care for those people who have rendered that service to their nation.


This concept of the duty of care is longstanding. Going back to the 1500s, Elizabeth I instructed parishes in England that they needed to care for returned servicemen. During the Napoleonic wars the British government came up with the concept of the 'deserving poor', recognising that people who returned and who were incapacitated as a result of their service to their country deserved the care of the people of that country. In contemporary Britain—and I use the example of Britain because of the links to the Westminster system—as recently as the last decade there has been the concept of a covenant between the British people, their government and the military.


This covenant has two facets. One is that if the government is going to deploy service men and women then they have a duty to make sure that those men and women are adequately equipped, trained and supported in the theatre of war. Likewise, there is that obligation post service to provide adequate care. I do not believe that the Australian public expects or would support the principle that the Commonwealth should be able to shift that duty of care to a third party just because a veteran has had civilian compen­sation payable for an injury. If a veteran has signed up to the service and the service has promised to provide for them then that obligation continues. If the veteran has a civilian injury, that is a separate issue. Speaking to people in the service and even to people working within the Repatriation Commission, I have noted their surprise in hearing that offsetting would be allowed for things other than dual Commonwealth entitlement. I believe that is something we need to address as a parliament.


The second facet of this covenant relates to the costs that are considered as part of the offsetting arrangement. Currently if somebody seeks compensation because of an injury then not only does the government take into account the civilian costs—and I dispute that principle—but it does it in a way that I believe is quite unfair. Whilst DVA recognises the party-to-party costs it does not recognise or discount the solicitor-client costs. That means that if a veteran receives, for example, $30,000 but $10,000 of that is taken up with costs to their solicitor then, rather than recognising that they received only $20,000, DVA treats the whole $30,000 as being compensation received by the veteran and offset appropriately or accord­ingly. Again, I do not believe a reasonable member of the public would expect that our government should be short changing veterans who had to incur that cost in order to win that compensation in the first place.


To my mind, the government is not only going against the principle of two-way loyalty—of having a duty of care to veterans—by including that civil payment. It is  doing it in a manner that is unjustifiable. When questioned on this during the inquiry, DVA's position was that the offsetting or discounting of the solicitor-client costs was in line with community norms. Again, I come back to the principle that we are expecting people who sign up to serve in the Australian Defence Force to do things that are not expected of the broader community. If we expect that loyalty from them, we should show that loyalty back to them. We should show them that when things like this come up we are prepared to deviate from the community or civilian norm so that we do not disadvantage the veterans in our community.


The RSL also expressed during this inquiry its concern about the long-term changes of the offsetting provisions. The military, in a very welcome move, has in­creased the amount of rehabilitation available to servicemen. Rather than dis­charging them on a medical basis, there is an increased focus on rehabilitation. The question was raised—and was not particularly satisfactorily answered by the department—as to the long-term conse­quences of the costs of rehabilitation and how they may be offset in future years. I note particularly that the concept of offsetting between Commonwealth funds has now crept, without any legislative guidance, to include any source of compensation. The RSL raised the concern that, over time, the way people apply legislation can change and will often change to the detriment of the veteran.


So a number of new factors are starting to come into this whole space, where we see an increase in money spent by the Com­monwealth on rehabilitation—and very appropriately. The question remained open, at the end of the inquiry, as to whether there was any guarantee that there would not be a detriment in years to come to veterans who had received payment from the Common­wealth for rehabilitation services to enable them to continue their service. So, all in all, we have an amendment here that the depart­ment itself says will have no effect. It cannot identify other people who fall into the case of Mr Smith, whose court case led to this amendment. It is proposing to spend some $2.7 million implementing an amendment it has said will have no practical effect. The ex-service community oppose the amendment and I believe there is no cause for us to support this amendment.


Whilst I commend Senator Wright for her active role and for engaging with the government, it seems to be indicative of the coalition that has now been formed between the government and the Greens in that they were fully informed about the changes to the explanatory memorandum and yet it was only delivered to the opposition shadow spokesperson for this important portfolio when he was 10 minutes into his second reading debate speech. I believe it is a particularly poor effort on behalf of the government to treat their coalition partner differently to the way they would treat the opposition in this important area. It is not the first time they have worked together and, like Senator Ronaldson, I note and want to record my deep disappointment that the Greens, the ALP and Senator Xenophon joined together to defeat the bill that would have addressed the indexation of the DFRDB.


I also note, again coming back to the lack of consultation, that this government has, without consultation, reduced funding for things like veteran advocacy funding, an important part that enables volunteers within our service organisations to work with people who need advocates. The funding provides them with the training and support that enables them to do an important role. If there is one thing I have seen from my involvement in public life it is that government policy is one thing, but it is the people on the ground, those who have the relationships and the connections to encourage and walk with people through the process to connect them to the benefits that are available from policy, who actually make a difference. Policy by itself does very little. No matter how dedicated public servants in the departments are, they do not have the relationships with people in the community. So it is often these voluntary roles that are really the effective connecting and coordinating bodies, and to cut their funding arbitrarily and without consultation is, I believe, a particularly poor step on the part of this government. It shows a great disrespect for our veterans community and the work they do.


We will not be supporting schedule 2 of this amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-09-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:55):  I indicate that I will be supporting the second reading of the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, but I reserve my position in relation to schedule 2 of this amendment. I agree with Senator Ronaldson that it is quite unsatisfactory that an amended explanatory memorandum was provided some 10 minutes into Senator Ronaldson's speech on the second reading in relation to this. I am not ascribing blame. I understand from my brief discussion with Senator Wright from the Australian Greens that there were discussions and negotiations with the government last week. That is why there has been a late development in this, in the sense that an amended explanatory memorandum, in relation to schedule 2 of this bill, has been provided. It is important that that explanatory memorandum be thoroughly scrutinised in the committee stage to ensure that the matters raised by the coalition have been dealt with adequately. I will speak about that shortly in relation to that particular schedule and the potential impact it can have on veterans' entitlements.


It would be appropriate for me to raise at the outset, however, the comments made by both Senators Fawcett and Ronaldson on my position with respect to the indexation of veterans' superannuation entitlements. It was a controversial bill and it is a controversial issue. On that particular coalition private senator's bill, which I voted with the Australian Greens and the government to defeat, I voted with a great deal of caution and reluctance, but I made it very clear at that stage that I thought it was important that there be a re-think of this once the review being undertaken by the defence minister, and by a Senate committee, on the Defence Materiel Organisation hands down its findings. Clearly, the potential fiscal implications of that bill were quite significant—in the hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. That in itself is not a reason not to proceed with legislation, but given the disparity between what the coalition said it would cost and what the government said it would cost and given that this has huge long-term implications in terms of superannuation entitlements, I thought it was appropriate that we find savings from the Defence Materiel Organisation and from Defence generally in order to ensure that there is a long-term sustainable method of superannuation indexation for those who have served.


I also made it clear when I spoke at the time that I thought there would always be an issue with those who have been injured while serving their country and for the family members who have lost a loved one in the service of their country, and that ought to be a priority. I do not think there is any dispute about that in terms of a limited pool of resources for that. That is something I will allude to in the context of this contribution. I want to make that clear to the veterans community, for whom I have enormous respect. I pay tribute to Barry Heffernan, with whom I have worked closely—he works with the Vietnam Veterans Associa­tion in South Australia—for the work we have done together. That just reminded me that this morning I need to return Mr Heffernan's call from the weekend.


But it is important that we put this into perspective. The matter of superannuation entitlements is not over. It should be pointed out, not as a criticism but as a matter of historical record, that the coalition in their time in office did not deal with the issue of indexation. They opposed it. And it is fair to say that there are some in the coalition who were concerned about the budgetary implications of that and did not oppose it in the party room. But the party room has prevailed and is saying that this is the path they are going. I note that it will be coalition policy to take this to the people at the next election, as they are well entitled to do. So the door has not closed in relation to that and I am hoping that in the next few months we will get satisfactory answers in relation to savings from defence materiel and the long-term implications of such a move as proposed by the coalition so that we can have a good outcome for our veterans, not forgetting those who have served our nation, those who have been injured or maimed, who deserve every possible support—and improved support.


That brings me to the bill and a second reading amendment that I will move shortly. This bill contains three specific aspects. Schedule 1 creates the prisoner of war recognition supplement. That is entirely appropriate and I strongly support those measures. I note that Senator Wright, in her contribution, referred to the enormous sacrifice that our prisoners of war have made, the privations they endured. I note that Australian governments of the past have given an additional payment of $2,500 to prisoners of war under Japanese occupation during World War II. That is entirely appropriate. This goes further, in that it provides ongoing benefits to our prisoner of war veterans, and I strongly support that. I cannot imagine what all prisoners of war went through; some in particular went through horrors that cannot be described. I commend the government for going down this path and the coalition for supporting it.


I will talk about schedule 2 in a minute, because it is not a contentious one. It rationalises the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance through the abolition of the temporary incapacity allowance with effect from 20 September 2011. Thereafter, veterans will be entitled to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance. That, too, seems not to be contentious. It is something that the coalition and the government support and it seems to be a necessary technical change to ensure a fairer outcome in relation to the temporary incapacity allowance.


However, it is schedule 3 that is troublesome. It is intended to prevent, the government says, double payments of compensation for the same incapacity. It is an amendment that has come about as a result of a court decision in the matter of Mr Smith. That was a significant decision. It was a decision handed down at the end of 2009. The Commonwealth and David Ronald Smith was a case which looked at the interpretation of section 30C of the VEA in respect of incapacity from an injury. I think Senator Ronaldson well set out the details of that case involving Mr Smith's circumstances and the decision, and I do not propose to restate that.


The question is whether the government has overreacted in moving these amendments in response to the Smith case. The question is whether these amendments will have a number of unintended consequences, whether they will give too much discretion to the department, whether there can be circumstances in which veterans will miss out on just compensation and on their just entitlements as a result of these amendments, whether we are in fact giving too much power to the department and whether we are creating more legal uncertainty. Even though I am a lawyer by training, I would not want these amendments to lead to a lawyers picnic. I think that is something we need to be very mindful of. The committee stage of this bill will be critical in determining whether the addendum to the explanatory memorandum—a result of negotiations between the government and Senator Wright from the Australian Greens, and I commend her for her diligence in relation to this—will do what it is intended to do and whether it will fix the problem that the RSL have quite rightly pointed out is a significant issue for them.


My question to Senator Ronaldson in the course of the committee stage will be, given that he was handed the explanatory memorandum 10 minutes into his speech, which is less than satisfactory, whether he has heard from the RSL at such short notice as to what their attitude is and whether their position is in any way different as a result of this addendum to the explanatory memor­andum. That is a key issue. It may well be that the RSL have not had an opportunity to properly digest this, and you cannot blame them for that given what has occurred. I think it is important that we do not rush this, that we do not ram this bill through. It is important that we hear from key veterans organisations and from the Returned and Services League in particular, given their input into the bill process.


There is another issue, though, that needs to be dealt with. It is appropriate, I believe, in the context of this bill, in the context of veterans' entitlements, to deal with the issue of Maralinga, to deal with the issue of nuclear test veterans in this country and the shameful way they have been treated over many years. In the 2010-11 budget I was pleased with the government's recognition of British veterans' services as non-warlike but hazardous, which meant that those who served between 1952 and 1967 at the British atomic weapons detonation test sites of Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia and the Montebello Islands off the west coast of Western Australia would have greater access to health services. Over 17,000 Australian soldiers and civilians were directly involved in the tests and assessment of the fallout from the nuclear tests across these sites.


These tests were conducted to enable the United Kingdom to develop nuclear fission bombs and, later, nuclear fusion or hydrogen bombs, and were carried out with the full cooperation of the Australian government of the time. Sadly, many of these Australians have gone on to suffer a range of illnesses as a result of dangerous and continued exposure to high levels of radiation, from cancers to genetic diseases inherited by their children. Many of them have died as a direct result of this exposure to radiation. There are only around 2,000 survivors left and they are whittling away on a weekly basis.


In the 2010-11 budget, the government set aside $24.2 million over five years so that participants would have their claims to veterans' entitlements, such as the disability pension and healthcare cards, assessed under the more generous 'reasonable hypothesis' standard of proof under the new expansion to the class of persons eligible. However, my understanding is that very little of these funds have been accessed because the standard of proof remains too high for those suffering illnesses as a result of nuclear test service. In May 2007, Professor Al Rowland from Massey University in New Zealand published a scientific paper on chromosome damage that provided hard evidence of the relationship between exposure to the ionising radiation from atomic blasts and certain cancers and birth defects.


I have been contacted about this issue by many who have been affected for some time. I have spoken with many veterans, including Peter Patterson, a retired canon of the Anglican Church, who contacted me after his applications for a gold card and disability pension were denied. Mr Patterson was commissioned by the Australian Military Forces to serve at Maralinga, South Aust­ralia, for a period of 87 weeks between 1956 and 1963 as an Anglican chaplain. Mr Patterson has told me that he has suffered from prostate and skin cancer during his life as well as from psoriatic arthropathy, a debilitating chronic arthritis condition which causes the inflammation of all joints. It is incredibly painful and debilitating. However, Mr Patterson's claim for a disability pension was rejected on the grounds that the delegate of the Repatriation Commission was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the psoriatic arthropathy was related to service.


I have also spent time with Geoffrey Gates, who was 23 years old when he served at Maralinga with the Air Force. He arrived in the middle of 1961, just after the two major bombs had been tested. During his 12 months at the base, tests on smaller nuclear weapons were continuing as well as assessment of the fallout from the bombs. Geoff has survived a brain tumour and both his son and grandson suffer bipolar disease.


Some veterans have told me about how they did nothing more than turn their backs for mere moments before turning around to watch the aftermath of the explosion. That was the modus operandi back then. That was how it was done. There was a complete lack of duty of care to our nuclear test veterans. Despite this, despite the fact that we know that service men had no protective clothing, despite the fact that they were literally rained on with nuclear fallout, I am aware of applicants who have been knocked back for a gold card because the department has determined they were not exposed to harmful amounts of radiation.


I welcomed last year's budget announce­ment that the participation of British nuclear test participants would be considered as non-warlike hazardous. This was welcomed by the veteran community. But it seems it means almost nothing because what they really need is access to health services and, under the current rules, sadly, virtually nothing has changed.


I have this morning circulated an amendment that will be dealt with by the committee to expand the class of persons eligible to receive the gold card to include British nuclear test participants. The simple fact is that the standard of proof required is too high given nuclear radiation is unable to be so directly proven after the time that has elapsed. But what can be proven is that these veterans were exposed to nuclear radiation in circumstances where there was a lack of care and respect shown for those veterans who were there being exposed to nuclear radiation. How is it that we sent young men and women to participate in nuclear testing, to observe the mushroom cloud and to clean up the fallout and to this day do not recognise the very serious impacts it has had on their health and the health of their children and grandchildren? This amendment will ensure that those British nuclear test participants will automatically receive the gold card. It should be that simple.


However, I am aware that the government and the opposition may not support that and that they are concerned about the potential cost implications. I see the cost implications here as being quite distinct from the cost implications in relation to the issue of superannuation. I indicated just a few moments ago and at other times since that vote in June on the superannuation issue that I am open for there to be reform. I am open for there to be an improvement in the superannuation benefits. But here is a case where people need access to health care. It ought to be a right for those British nuclear test veterans.


I, and also on behalf of Senator Wright move:


At the end of the motion, add ""but that the Government undertake an examination of the cost of expanding the class of persons eligible for the Repatriation Heath Card—For All Conditions (Gold Card) to include a person who is a nuclear test participant (within the meaning of the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006), and that such examination be completed within 3 months"".


This is a second reading amendment to ensure that the government will conduct a cost review within the next three months on expanding the eligibility of the gold card to nuclear test participants. I am hopeful that both the government and the coalition will support that. I am hopeful that that will at least be a way forward for those who are reluctant to support my amendment. At least there will be an acknowledgement and some mechanism to deal with the costing of this so that those remaining British nuclear test veterans can have access to the health care that they deserve.


The contentious part of this bill will be schedule 2. Let us wait and see whether the addendum to the explanatory memorandum deals with those concerns. I have yet to be convinced. I think, again, that the protests of Senator Ronaldson that he received it halfway through his speech in the second reading debate are completely justified. I hope that the government will give time to allow key veterans organisations—in particular, the RSL—to provide commentary about the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, because at this stage I am not convinced that schedule 2 ought to be passed. I am not convinced that the govern­ment's reaction to the Smith decision is a justified one. But I also urge my colleagues to, at the very least, consider opening the way forward for nuclear test veterans in this country to receive the medical care that they so desperately deserve.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:14):  I am very pleased to take part in this debate on the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and to support any bill that supports our veterans. I am pleased to note that the coalition will be supporting, as I will be, the bill insofar as schedules 1 and 3 are concerned. I am very interested to be following Senator Xenophon in this debate and will be interested to have a look at the amendment he has proposed. I wonder if he has some costings for that amendment. I have to say to Senator Xenophon that it is perhaps too little too late. We really needed your support a few months ago during the indexation debate.




Senator Xenophon:
  It was a different issue, though.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is an issue of support for our veterans community. We desperately needed your support then, Senator Xenophon. You had your own reasons for not supporting us, which was a bit disappointing, but I am pleased to see that you are supporting those parts of this bill which will improve the benefits we give to our veterans.


I will come back the provisions of the bill, but I would just indicate how much our nation owes the veterans—those people who have defended our country in times gone by. What our veterans have done is fresh in my mind from a ceremony I attended yesterday morning in Townsville marking the 60th anniversary of national service. The dawn service yesterday, on the shores of Rowes Bay in Townsville, was a very moving service. It and the parade later in the day were the culmination of a week of activities, during which national serviceman got together in Townsville for this magnificent 60th anniversary celebration, celebrating those who were called up for national service from 1951 onwards and served in the Korean conflict and of course in Vietnam. It was tremendous to see the veterans together, renewing acquaintances, telling lots of stories and remembering friends and colleagues who paid the ultimate sacrifice.


The dawn service in Townsville, which is of course as senators would know classed, or we class it ourselves, as a garrison city. It is the home of Lavarack army barracks, one of the biggest army barracks in Australia, and of course RAAF Base Townsville, formerly Garbutt, which is a very significant RAAF base. A lot of veterans who have served in those services have retired to Townsville, so it is a community, a city, that very much values the work of our servicemen, including our national servicemen. Yesterday's ceremony was really a very moving service. The master of ceremonies was Mr Ben Hobson and the services were led by padre John Emerson. I particularly mention Brigadier Neil Weekes, retired, who has been a tower of strength to veterans over the years since he retired from active service in the army. Brigadier Weekes was a national serviceman himself—he was called up for the Vietnam War—so , many years ago. He later joined the regular army and rose through the ranks to become a brigadier by the time of his retirement. Brigadier Weekes gave a very moving tribute at the dawn service yesterday.


The dawn service was followed by a parade down the new Flinders Street. The veterans who participated were still sprightly—most of them were still in step. It was determined, probably not by them, that some veterans from the Korean conflict should travel in old Willys jeeps and other veteran army vehicles at the head of the parade. Of course, the Townsville regular army band provided the music for the march. The salute was taken by the Deputy Mayor of Townsville, Councillor David Crisafulli, and by Brigadier Stuart Smith, the current CO of Lavarack Barracks. It was a magnificent affair. It brought to mind, as Brigadier Weekes mentioned in his speech, some of the difficulties that some of the veterans of the Vietnam War lived through. The Whitlam government's treatment of veterans on their return from Vietnam is to its eternal shame. As I always say, and as many acknowledge, the decision to go to war in Vietnam was a political decision that a good 40 per cent plus of Australians did not agree with. That was no excuse for taking it out on the veterans when they returned. It was a quite despicable period in Australian history when those troops returning from Vietnam, after fighting for their country at the government's direction, were spat at and condemned and were shunned, even by family.


Brigadier Weekes gave a telling story yesterday. He mentioned that, in the walk of remembrance at Enoggera barracks, where all of those who were killed in Vietnam had a tree planted and a plaque placed, one soldier from Brigadier Weekes' platoon was not named and was not recognised. That is because his family was so totally opposed to the Vietnam War that they refused to put up the money to provide for the plaque and also refused to have their son's body returned to Australia. That is how hard the feelings were and how divided the nation was. I accept that there was a political division, but it does seem very sad and very unfortunate that the death of this soldier—who, as Brigadier Weekes mentioned, was over 21 and made his own decision to go to war in Vietnam to fight for his country—was not recognised through the placement of a plaque. We also heard of a similar incidence in which a family who did not agree with the Vietnam War do not want their son's name recorded on a plaque at the Australian War Memorial. There is space left for his name, but family members still refuse to have his service in Vietnam recognised. Perhaps they have their reasons. It just seems sad that Australians at the time could not distinguish the political element of that war from the magnificent service of veterans, in this case veterans who were national servicemen.


Notwithstanding that, it was a magnificent week in Townsville, with a lot of activity. The dawn service was certainly very moving. I congratulate the Townsville City Council on the naming of the park on the shores of Rowes Bay, where the national service memorial was constructed a few years ago. Yesterday, following the dawn service, the park was dedicated as National Service Park. The unveiling was conducted by Councillor Deanne Bell on behalf of the Townsville City Council, Mr Warren Hegarty on behalf of the National Servicemen's Association and Brigadier Smith, the current CO of Lavarack Barracks, as I have mentioned. 


I congratulate Warren Hegarty and his team on a fabulous week recognising the national service given by so many Australians over so many years. I know Mr Hegarty and his team have been working very hard for years now to ensure that the of 60th anniversary celebration would go off without a hitch, and they certainly succeeded in that. It was a great credit to them and a great recognition of the service of so many young Australian national servicemen to their country over the past 60 years.


I want to comment on the matters that Senator Xenophon raised about Maralinga. I have only recently seen his amendments, and Senator Ronaldson will no doubt deal with those in the Committee of the Whole. If Senator Xenophon is embarking upon this process, perhaps some investigation should be made into disabilities suffered by children of veterans who worked at Maralinga at the time of the atomic and nuclear test research. A constituent in of mine in Townsville has certain deformities which medical advice has suggested to her are the result of radiation that her father would have received during his service at Maralinga, prior to her conception. Clearly the department and governments should look at causal effects and costs and ensure that appropriate consideration is given in this area. I think this area should be looked at a little further. I have raised it at estimates hearings and have written to the minister about it. Perhaps it is something that Senator Xenophon might have considered. I hasten to add that, having only just seen his amendments and having only briefly heard him speak, I have not thought the matter through completely. I am sure that Senator Ronaldson, on behalf of the coalition, will have looked at this a bit more closely and will be able to indicate the areas in which the coalition perhaps does not agree. Clearly there is a need to look at this matter to see whether any harm may have been caused to Australian servicemen and perhaps their offspring as a result of service performed at Maralinga. 


I am pleased that the coalition will be supporting schedules 1 and 3 of the bill before us. I will not go into those schedules in any great detail as I am conscious that Senator Ronaldson and other coalition speakers have done so. Suffice to say that, in relation to schedule 2, I am persuaded by the evidence given by Rear Admiral Doolan, head of the RSL, during the Senate inquiry into this bill, where he said: 


… the RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.


 I agree with that sentiment. I am concerned that, under the amendments proposed to schedule 2 to clarify the operation of the act, there will still be a requirement for guidelines by regulation or by departmental decree to ensure that they are properly applied. I thought I heard the Greens say in their contribution to this debate that they were now satisfied, because of an explana­tory memorandum, that all would be well. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, explana­tory memorandums can have some influence on the way legislation and regulation are administered. It would seem to me that if the parliament's intention can be written into an explanatory memorandum it can just as easily be included in the legislation. So, I am concerned about schedule 2. Senator Ronaldson has indicated that he will be moving an amendment to omit schedule 2, and the coalition is doing that in the best interests of our veteran and ex-service community. I certainly urge the Senate to support that amendment.


In conclusion, I congratulate our veterans for all the work they have done over their lifetime. We are certainly as a nation indebted to them. I am particularly grateful that the 60th anniversary celebrations of national service held in Townsville yesterday yet again highlighted for the Australian community the work done by all of those who have served in the defence of our nation.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:31):  I am pleased to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. At the outset I must declare an interest as a member, however peripherally, of the defence family. Our youngest son was an active service officer with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, in both Iraq as a lieutenant and in Afghanistan as a captain. So, I have both a personal and a professional interest in this issue. I join my colleagues in supporting these POW supplementary support measures. My only regret is that this was not put into place earlier by either side of the parliament. I fully support it and I am sure the wider Australian community do. I also support schedule 3, relating to the loss of earnings allowance. This is logical and it is what we expect the veteran community would want to see, and I have no doubt it is what the wider Australian community would want us to pass. 


In contrast, I join in the opposition to schedule 2 of the bill. It proposes that the power of the parliament to determine the manner in which compensation payments are offset against each other should be removed. In other words, as it has been explained to me, in the event that an ex-serviceman has been wounded and is being treated for some matter relating to their defence service and is then the subject, regrettably, of a further injury—for example a motor vehicle accident which occurred well after their defence experience—then there would be an offsetting of the compensation to that person one against the other, the non-defence related activity against the defence related activity. I find this to be unacceptable; I find it to be parsimonious. I cannot understand why we are even debating it. We are merely the representatives of the wider Australia community. We are elected by the com­munity to be here to represent the people. The first question I would put to my colleagues on the other side is simply this: do the people want the parliament's power to deal with this issue of offset to be gagged; do they expect this to be devolved to some group of people other than the parliament, duly elected? My second question is: do the people of Australia want there to be a further limiting of veterans entitlements in this type of incident? If a person has been wounded in their service to the nation then my expec­tation is that the wider community would say let the community meet the costs associated with rehabilitating that person so that they can come back to a normal life and contri­bute to their family, to the community and to their own wellbeing without there being, hanging over their heads, some concern that if subsequently they are injured in some other unrelated circumstance there is going to be some form of offsetting to limit their entitlements. I find this to be unacceptable and I would bet a pound to a penny that if we were to poll the wider Australian community they would too.


In the legislation proposed by my colleague Senator Ronaldson only in recent weeks we anticipated the indexation of veterans entitlements. Again, if we were to poll the wider Australia community, people would not only have wanted that to happen but also would have shaken their heads and asked why it was ever the case that there was this disparity. It is not to the credit of this chamber that the ALP, the Greens and Senator Xenophon failed to support Senator Ronaldson in that instance. For those who do not understand the implications of that indexation, it is my understanding that the matter went back to 1997 when the age pension and the defence pension were similar, except that from that moment going forward the indexation for the age pension was a combination or a factor of both the CPI and the movement in wages. I see that as being entirely reasonable. Regrettably, defence pensions have not undergone the same level of indexation, having only been linked—and they remain only linked—to CPI. Wage movements over time in this country—certainly since 1997, given the economic growth we have enjoyed in that time—have caused the age pension to move upwards at a greater rate than the defence pension, so there is now a disparity between the two. Senator Ronaldson's bill aimed to redress that imbalance so that our defence veterans would enjoy the same level of benefit—nothing better; no improvement; nothing beyond—as our age pensioners. Surely that is reasonable given the service and sacrifice that they offered.


Veterans and ex-servicepeople have asked me—and rhetorically I ask it here on their behalf—the question, 'What have our service personnel done to incur the wrath of those on the other side and their failure to support that legislation?' They say to me: 'Where did we go wrong? Were we not diligent enough in the service we gave? Were we not competent enough in the service we delivered? Why are we being so harshly dealt with?' I cannot answer those questions.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Senator Xenophon is correct—why did we not address it when we were in government? Our failure to do so, however, is not an excuse to have failed to address that question in 2011. When we speak to everybody in the Australian community—younger people, older people, people across the board—what do they tell us they expect? When we tell them that our veterans are second-class citizens when it comes to the financial support they get from this nation, most people say to me, 'Go and fix it up.' And we have failed to do so. 


My third question, before I move on to the issue of younger veterans, relates to why the coalition did not receive the addendum to the explanatory memorandum until Senator Ronaldson was well into his speech. I think it should be explained why and how the Greens did have that access—and I compliment Senator Wright on her contribution. It is disappointing, if we are going to maturely debate an issue of such importance to the veteran community and of such interest to the wider community, that everybody has not had equal access to the documentation. I will return to this—I have had the opportunity presented to me by chamber staff to actually briefly review the addendum and I wish to return to it.


I was interested to hear the comments of Senator Macdonald with regard to the activities yesterday in Townsville. On Tuesday of last week, I was in the small town of Bruce Rock in the wheat belt of WA. It was absolutely amazing. There are, I think, a thousand people in the shire, with probably 200 to 300 living in the town. Right there in the main street was the most wonderful memorial to the fuzzy wuzzies. That memorial was dedicated last year—one of the original fuzzy wuzzies actually came down, with his son, to Australia and to Bruce Rock for the purpose.


Two Vietnam veterans decided, 11 years ago, that there should be some activity recognising the contribution of the Vietnam vets and the role they played, because we all know that the manner in which they were treated when they returned from Vietnam will, regrettably, forever be a stain on the history of this country. From that humble beginning 11 years ago, there will, when they meet on the first weekend of November this year, be 3,000 to 4,000 Vietnam veterans who will, with their families, descend on Bruce Rock. Last year there were 3,000 and this year they are expecting more. Some 400 are coming from Far North Queensland. It has become an annual event for them all. The shire president explained to me, with a high degree of pride, the activity that goes on, the contribution it makes to that small com­munity and the absolute overwhelming sense of goodwill that exists within those people.


Regrettably, should this legislation go through with the schedule that we are opposing, I am sure one of the questions discussed on that occasion will be the unfairness visited upon that group by the parliament through our inability to deal with this offsetting question. The event is an expression of the enormous interest in, the goodwill towards and the need for that community of military veterans to be able to come together to share values, to share stories and to encourage each other for the future. The last of the Korean War veterans also join them and it is my hope that, over time, should this activity continue in Bruce Rock, it will become a focal point.


There is a group called the Mad Galahs—military veterans, usually non-commissioned officers and lower ranks. They are fairly strident in their views—they express them, as their name suggests, without fear or favour—and they have that long-held healthy Australian disrespect, at least overtly, for senior officers. I can assure you again that they voiced to me very loudly their disappointment about the recent defeat of Senator Ronaldson's bill.


Over the last four to five years I have had the experience of meeting with and becoming friendly with many of our younger returned soldiers who have left military service. I have to say to you that they are, in my view, the best of the best. I have met young Army, Navy and Air Force officers. I speak to them about what they are doing now, what they were doing in military service and I say, 'Did you really want to leave the service?' In so many instances—and I dare say in my own son's—deep down, they did not want to leave the service. 


I have said to them, 'Is it because of the numbers of tours of duty you were required to undertake in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere?' They are emphatic when they say, 'No, it's not that.' And so I have said to them, 'Is it because of inferior or inadequate standards of management in your fields of combat?' and the answer has been no. I have said to them, 'Is it because we haven't supplied you with adequate equipment?' and they have said no in the main, even though in some instances they have had to buy their own, which I find to be reprehensible. Nevertheless, on the whole they feel they have been well handled on their tours of duty in the field. So I have said to them, 'Is it because of the attitudes of the wider Australian community towards you?' As I said earlier, if there is one thing that has happened as a result of the history beyond Vietnam, it is that the Australian community now well understands the differential between our military personnel and the role they play and those who send them there—as should have been the case with Vietnam. We should have always thanked and glorified the Vietnam veterans and, if there were blame or criticism to be apportioned, it should have been sheeted home to the political leaders who sent them. The same occurs today.


I am delighted to record and report—and observe, as you all are—the fact that our returned servicepeople are well and truly adulated by the Australian community. So it is not that which has caused so much wastage of the best of our best of the young military personnel. I will tell you what it is. Almost without exception, it is what they perceive to be the indifference within the Defence bureaucracy and the approach of government to their welfare. These are questions I asked the previous Chief of the Defence Force. We engaged on this quite often. I remain far from satisfied as to the management, the treatment, the welfare and the concern of our personnel as they return. I could give you examples relating to many people. These young people are highly employable in the civilian world, at salaries vastly beyond what they were getting in service—and that was not a reason for them to want to leave—but it is the perceived indifference and the perceived attitude of the Defence bureaucracy which simply causes them to say, 'Things have to be better outside.' As I said, my own son was very concerned about the bureaucracy and the inefficiency. As I said to him, 'The only way you are going to find that it is no different outside the military world is to get yourself into the corporate world,' and he has certainly found that to be the case.


I conclude my comments by going back to this addendum, which was received some minutes after this debate commenced. As Senator Ian Macdonald has indicated, it now suggests a move from legislation to regulation and departmental decree, but it goes exactly to the point I was just making about the Defence bureaucracy. The document says:


... will not change current operations of the compensation offsetting provisions. The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision—


the Smith decision is not explained. It goes on to say that where:


... interaction between the compensation offsetting provisions and Chapter 19 ... and the ... Rates of Veterans’ Pensions, 5th Edition (GARP V), ... will not change under the proposed amendments.


And it says:


Under current practice, if medical opinion is able to determine the relative contribution of an accepted condition and a non-accepted condition to the impairment—


then chapter 19 applies and on it goes. Then it says:


If medical opinion is not able to apportion the relative contribution of an accepted condition and a non-accepted condition—


then the chapter cannot apply. This is exactly the gobbledegook translated down to those in the ranks where they turn around and say, 'This is the bureaucracy we don't need.' I would think that if a person who is likely to be the subject of this legislation were to get hold of this document and say to themselves, 'What does it mean, what does it mean for me and what are the implications for me and ultimately for my family?' they would see that this document stands alone as an illustration of the points I make.


In conclusion, I certainly concur with the support of POW prisoner supplementary payments. I support the schedule 3 loss of earnings allowance and ask the government to reconsider schedule 2 because as it stands it would not receive the support of the Australian community.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:50):  by leave—I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. The Veterans' Entitlements Amend­ment Bill gives effect to a number of 2011 budget measures. The first measure creates a new prisoner of war recognition supplement payable at $500 per fortnight to former prisoners of war. The new supplement will be tax free and will not be treated as income for the purposes of the income test. The supplement is payable in recognition of the hardships these men and women endured during captivity. It is expected that approximately 900 former prisoners of war will benefit from the new supplement, which will be payable from 20 September 2011.


The second measure clarifies and affirms the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy which applies to disability pensions and has been in place since 1973. Compensation offsetting is applied to disability pensions to ensure that a person does not receive compensation under the Veterans' Entitlement Act and compensation from another source for the same incapacity. The amendments to the compensation offsetting provisions are being made in response to a decision of the full Federal Court, which highlighted the need to clarify and affirm this aspect of the legislation. I might, as an aside, note that that decision of the full Federal Court is referred to in the addendum as 'the Smith decision'. 


The amendments make it clear that compensation offsetting is to apply where a disability pension and compensation from another source are payable in respect of the same incapacity and do not require that the incapacity result from the same injury or disease. As the amendments are clarifying and affirming the legislation, they will not result in any change to the compensation offsetting practices currently being applied. No current disability pensioner's rate of disability pension will change because of the amendments in schedule 2 of the bill.


The final measure will rationalise payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. The bill will remove the current overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence caused injuries or diseases, and it allows the government to better target assistance to those in need. Under this measure the payment of the temporary incapacity allowance will cease from 20 September 2011, with future payments being better targeted through the payment of the loss of earnings allowance. The cessation of the temporary incapacity allowance will have no impact on a veteran's or member's rate of disability pension. From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members receiving treatment or recuperating from war or defence caused injuries or diseases will be assessed consistently against the criteria for loss of earnings allowance.


These measures continue the government's commitment to targeting and enhancing services and support to our veterans and members and their families. I commend the legislation to the Senate. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Stephens
):  The question is that the amendment in the names of Senator Xenophon and Senator Wright be agreed to. All of that opinion say aye, against no. I declare it lost.




Senator Xenophon:
  The ayes have it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Xenophon, are you seeking a division? 




Senator Xenophon:
  Yes, I am. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Xenophon, under the standing orders a division may not be held before 12.30 pm today, so the matter before the chair must be postponed until that time. This means the bill itself cannot move until that time, and we will have to move to the next bill.

 (South Australia) (11:55):  I seek leave to make a short statement which may assist.


Leave granted.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Subject to what the co-mover of this second reading amendment, Senator Wright, says on this, of course procedurally we cannot have a division before 12.30. If it is on the record that both the government and the opposition oppose this amendment then that would obviate the need for a division in these circumstances—if that would assist the chamber to proceed with the bill. As long as it is clear who has voted for what, I think that would be a fair outcome. I invite the government and the opposition to set out their reasons for opposing the amendment. That is not strictly necessary, but that way we can move on with this piece of legislation.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:56):  I am happy to pursue that approach and set out the reasons that the government is opposed to the amendment. If that is the will of the chamber, I am happy to proceed on that basis. On that basis I seek leave to make a short statement. 


Leave granted. 




Senator FEENEY:
   I thank the Senate. In setting out the reasons for the government's opposition to Senator Xenophon's proposed amendment, first let me point out that in the 2010-11 budget the government provided a $24 million com­pensation package to British nuclear test participants under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This package ensured that Australian Defence Force participants were provided appropriate compensation and health coverage for any condition related to their service in the testing program. British nuclear test participants are also eligible to receive non-liability health care for all cancers. British nuclear test participants are able to access a gold card. It is provided where the veteran is at or above 100 per cent of the general rate of disability pension. 


The gold card is only automatically granted to veterans with qualifying service, and that of course means warlike service, and over the age of 70 in recognition of the hazards of being in war and incurring danger from hostile forces of the enemy. The automatic granting of a gold card to the group proposed by Senator Xenophon would thus place British nuclear test participants in a more beneficial position than other veterans. Any automatic extension of the gold card to this group would result in significant additional costs that have not been considered by the government. That is the basis upon which the amendment is opposed and that is the basis upon which the government makes the contention that it has ensured that British nuclear test participants receive adequate and proper compensation and assistance.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (11:59):  The opposition opposes schedule 2 in the following terms:


(2)   Schedule 2, page 10 (line 1) to page 15 (line 16), TO BE OPPOSED.


I want to talk about a number of matters today. I do have some questions for Senator Feeney, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, but I want to start the discussion on my amendment by again reiterating that the opposition strongly supports schedules (1) and (3). We do so in relation to schedule (1) because in government we had a very proud history of assistance for POWs and we do so in relation to schedule (3) because it makes eminent sense. We support the government on both of these matters.


The issue, both from the opposition's point of view and from the point of view of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee with its dissenting report, and from many within the ex-service community, is schedule (2). The onus has been placed on the government to establish why this amendment is required now. Part of that onus, quite rightly, would involve, one would have thought, discussions between the government and the ex-service community on the justification for this schedule, in particular the outcome of the Smith case and the longstanding legal position in relation to these matters, given that the government is unable to say for sure whether anyone will be or will not be adversely impacted by the measures in schedule (2). In the budget, the government said that it wanted to spend $2.7 million to put in place processes to ensure that previous requirements for offsetting and identification of potential offsetting cases were made clearer. The obvious question to be asked about this is: why not get your systems in place first? What is the mad rush to go ahead with schedule (2) now, particularly with the degree of nervousness within the ex-service community on this matter? What is the requirement to do so now? 


What really worries me and the rest of the opposition, as well as other senators in this place and the ex-service community, is the fact that there has been no consultation on this. The Smith case was decided in 2009. There was no consultation with the RSL, for example, prior to the budget. Prior to the budget, there was no discussion with the RSL on the budget measure. Given that everyone knew the circumstances surrounding the Smith case, and given that it had been discussed at the roundtable and other forums before that, why not consult with the ex-service community? Why not let them have some input into it? But it was actually worse than that. Even after the budget, the government still refused to discuss this until there was a referral to the Senate committee, and only then did the government start consultation with the ex-service community. 


To make matters worse, today we have learnt that the government's partners in crime in the running of this country, the Australian Greens—the Gillard-Brown government—were given the opportunity to see this revised explanatory memorandum well in advance of today's debate. Was Senator Xenophon shown that? Was the opposition shown that? Was the RSL shown that? Was the Vietnam Veterans Federation shown that? Was Legacy shown that? No, they were not. They were told that something would be coming, that there would be an amendment to the EM which would clarify it. They have not, on my understanding, to this day—certainly not of an hour and a half ago—been given the opportunity to see that amended EM. The parliamentary secretary has got to stand up here when I finish and say why the Australian Greens are deserving of this but the opposition is not. Forget the opposition! Why were the RSL, Legacy and the Vietnam Veterans Federation not given the opportunity to see this, given that the RSL attended the Senate inquiry and the Vietnam Veterans Federation, on my understanding at least, made a submission—if not, they have certainly written to me on the matter. So what is this about lack of consultation? Why is it that the spokesperson for the Australian Greens gets the opportunity to see this but the rest of us do not? On what basis does the government justify that? This is a matter of very, very significant concern to the ex-service community. They want to know that this schedule is not going to have a negative impact on anyone else and they, quite rightly, have been pursuing the government to get those guarantees. The government had the opportunity to consult on this matter. Why was my office not told the content of this revised EM? 


Why did the government choose to speak to the Greens about this rather than speaking to the ex-service community, when the President of the RSL himself had taken the time to appear before that committee and expressed some very significant concerns about this matter. I will read them for the parliamentary secretary. Rear Admiral Doolan said:


The RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.


That underpins the concerns of the ex-service organisation in relation to this matter.


I am sure that the Greens spokesperson felt very special getting the heads up about this. But surely the Greens felt some necessity to ensure that other people knew about it rather than doing a dirty deal with the government? What a start that is! Why not come to us and say: 'What do you think about this? You've got amendments on the table. You've had them there for some time. We know schedule 2 is an issue for you; why not come and have a talk to us about what that amended EM said?' Why not have the courtesy to go to Legacy, the RSL and others, show them the revised EM and ask for their opinion? Why not do them that courtesy?



Senator Wright interjecting—




Senator RONALDSON:
  You say you did. Are you saying, Senator, that you did or did not. If you did, I will apologise and sit down. But if you did not—




Senator Wright:
  In a minute, I will speak then.




Senator RONALDSON:
  All right. I will look forward to that. I think I know the answer on the back of that because I would have thought it was a great opportunity to sit me down. If you have not taken that, that is your issue and not mine. 


Let us look at our other concerns in relation to this. As I am sure the parlia­mentary secretary has been told by now, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL are extremely concerned about this matter being dealt with by regulation. I will tell you what else they will be concerned about. I read from the last part of the addendum to the explanatory memorandum:


The Repatriation Commission will be issuing appropriate policy guidance to the Department of Veterans' Affairs staff to ensure offsetting occurs in line with the legislation and long-standing practices outlined above. Ex-service organisations will be consulted during the development of this material.


'Ex-service organisations will be consulted during the development of this material.' Why would they have any faith that they are going to be consulted about this when they were not consulted prior to the budget? They were not consulted until this matter was referred off to a Senate inquiry and they have not been consulted in relation to the addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Why would they have any confidence at all either that they are going to be consulted or their views are going to be listened to?


If you come back to me and say that you have put in place the IT systems, which we support—and I accept the words of the department that they need to ascertain whether there are going to be further offsetting issues—then we will talk to you about this schedule. But we are not prepared to take this from legislation into regulation. We do not believe the undertakings are sufficient to enable us to support it going from legislation to regulation.


I am amazed, quite frankly, that the government itself is prepared to impose a layer of risk on this by bringing this schedule in now. Get the system sorted out—we support you in getting the system sorted out—then come back into this chamber and say: 'We've got the systems worked out. We are confident that those systems will mean there will be no adverse impact for any veteran and we need to change the legislation to enable things to be done by way of regulation.' At that stage we will be quite happy to talk to you about it, but we are not prepared to take the authority of this chamber and give it to the department by way of potential regulation or other inter­pretation. We are not prepared to remove the right of this chamber on this matter. I am absolutely amazed that the government is prepared to do so. Get the systems sorted out. We support your systems being sorted out. It seems a lot of money but if that is the view of what is required to sort the systems out, go for it; it has our support. But do not come here and put the cart before the horse.


I say to the Greens that if they are serious about ensuring that there is no adverse impact for any veteran then they will abandon the quite obscene sign-up to this addendum to the EM and they will say to the government as well, 'You come back when you have put your systems in place and then we will talk about whether schedule 2 is required.' The government has failed to justify this schedule. The government has been told by the ex-service organisations that they do not support this schedule. The government has been asked by those ex-service organisations not to rush into this because the ex-service organisations quite rightly want to be 100 per cent sure that there will be no adverse impact. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary, given everything I have said today, can tell me this: what is the requirement for this to be done now, prior to the systems being put in place? Why can this schedule not be removed? I will speak to the minister as soon as those systems are in place and both he and I are confident that there will be no adverse impact. Then we can get it through this place very, very quickly. But at the moment there is no justification. At the moment the ex-service organisations are opposed to this. The parliamentary secretary has the opportunity to actually support the removal of this schedule, get the systems in place and then come back so we can talk about it. (Time expired)

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:15):  I am happy to endeavour to respond to some of the points made by Senator Ronaldson. Firstly, I will turn my attention to the question of the explanatory memor­andum. As I comprehend it, the Senate com­mittee suggested that additional information be inserted into the explanatory memor­andum to make it clear that established offsetting practices will not change as a result of the amendments. The additional information also includes an explanation of the interaction between chapter 19 of the Guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensions and the offsetting provisions. It is my understanding that ex-service organisa­tions are aware that the government is now making changes and that in large part those changes reflect requests of government by those organisations.


As to the mystery of when and how the addendum came to be lodged, I cannot really assist Senator Ronaldson except to say that I understand it was lodged with the Table Office on Friday. I will allow Senator Ronaldson to pursue the rest of the mystery as he sees fit.


In response to the opposition's allegation that the government has failed to fully justify the need for a change I would point out that the rationale behind the amendments has been explained in the budget materials, in the explanatory memorandum and at the committee hearings. I will reiterate that the amendments will not change the operation of the offsetting provisions but merely clarify and affirm the longstanding policy of numerous governments in relation to offsetting disability pension compensation. The clarification of the legislation will assist veterans, their representatives and others involved in such matters to understand how the offsetting arrangements operate.


It is critical for the government to place on the record that the proposed amendments will not and cannot result in a double offset as has been alleged. When the Guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensions is used, the offsetting provisions cannot apply in respect of that impairment. The operation of the Guide to the assessment of rates of veterans' pensionsdoes not fully cover all cases in which individuals have different conditions attributed to an incapacity. In essence, the operation of that guide covers only one potential set of circumstances. The proposed amendments are necessary to deal with circumstances that are not dealt with under that guide and in which it is not possible to use that guide.


As for the assertion that the government did not consult with the ex-service community prior to incorporating these amendments, let me first make the point that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has engaged in appropriate consultation with the ex-service community in relation to the full Federal Court's decision in Commonwealth v Smith. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has consulted with the ex-service community from budget night onwards about the proposed amendments to the offsetting provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This consultation has been undertaken in accordance with the confidentiality restrictions associated with budget measures and legislation.


On the question of the computer software and the changing of systems, the Department of Veterans' Affairs is committing staff and information technology resources to improving existing policy, procedural and other resource material concerning the application of the offsetting provisions. This work would be taking place regardless of the proposed amendments now being considered. This work includes the improve­ments of existing systems and the creation of better tools for staff to manage claims for which offsetting is required. It will also work to improve communication with affected clients and interested stakeholders. The provision of policy guidance material to staff, particularly in areas of complexity such as this one, is longstanding common practice.

I am unable to advise as to whether they have cited the addendum, but I would be happy to provide that advice as soon as I can clarify that point.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (12:20):  I would have thought that is absolutely pivotal to our discussions today. There are a lot of advisers sitting in the box over there beside the parliamentary secretary, so I am sure he can get a very quick response for me. I ask him to do that as a matter of urgency by turning his head to his left and asking the question of those advisers.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (12:21):  On the basis of the parliamentary secretary's response to my question, it is quite clear that the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and Legacy have not been provided with the opportunity to look at this amended EM to get their feedback. On that basis, I cannot see how this chamber can possibly proceed with this matter until those organisations have seen the addendum. I think that should be done as a matter of urgency and I think this bill should be delayed until that occurs. I move:


That the committee report progress and ask leave to sit again.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:22):  This is probably the last contribution I can make to this—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Crossin
) (12:22):  I have to put forthwith the motion moved by Senator Ronaldson. The question is that the committee report progress.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (12:22):  The noes have it.




Senator Ronaldson:
  I believe the ayes have it.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (12:22):  A division is required, but this is tricky because we cannot have any divisions until after 12.30 pm, so we cannot get out of this committee for another six or so minutes. I will call Senator Wright, who might want to respond until 12.30 to some of your earlier points. I have no other way but to continue in that manner.




Senator Ronaldson:
  Point of order. My understanding from matters that occurred earlier is that once a division is called for it will put any further debate back until the appropriate time.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (12:23):  That is correct, but under the agreement between the parties in the Senate I cannot call the division until 12.30 pm. We are in a bind here. Your question must be put immediately, which I cannot do until 12.30. Once that is voted on, depending on the outcome of that vote, that would determine whether or not we progress with this bill. So we have a five-minute delay.




Senator Ronaldson:
  I seek leave to make a statement.


Leave granted.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (12:24):  I thought it would be! But only for five minutes. We are insisting on this matter being put and voted on, because we do not believe that within 24 hours the government cannot ascertain from the Vietnam Veterans Federation, the RSL and Legacy whether this addendum to the EM clarifies their concerns. I am completely and utterly gobsmacked—to use an expression my children use—that the government is not actually asking the question, because this may well resolve this issue. If the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and Legacy come back and say that the addendum satisfies all their queries, my view would be that the opposition would look very seriously at that. If they come back and say that it still does not clarify their concerns, then that position would surely require a change of attitude from the government in relation to the progress of this matter.


This is not a political point between the government and the opposition. This is about whether or not we are prepared to take a risk in relation to entitlements and in relation to people's futures. Surely it is incumbent upon the chamber to do that. For the sake of just four, five or six hours, go back to the RSL. I will call it now: if I get a phone call from the RSL, from the Vietnam Veterans Federation and from Legacy that this amendment satisfies their concerns I give the parlia­mentary secretary an undertaking that we will not oppose this schedule.


The chamber needs to understand that we are opposed to this schedule because those who know best what the likely outcome of this schedule might be have been opposed to it themselves. This debate is not rocket science. If those organisations are concerned about it, then we should be concerned about it. If their concerns have not been clarified to their satisfaction then we should be con­cerned about what the outcomes might be. Why not just send this addendum off to these three groups and then can come back to us. We can put this off until tomorrow. I give the parliamentary secretary and the minister my undertaking that if these groups come back and say, 'That has satisfied our queries,' that will be the end of the matter and it will go through. But we are not prepared to stand here when those three organisations, and presumably others, have expressed that they are dissatisfied with what has been promised to date and that they still have concerns. I cannot believe that Senator Wright, whom I have known for a long time, would not be prepared to accept that we need to get this clarified. We can then move on from this matter. I do not want to see anything occur that is going to impact on other parts of the bill, but I am not going to cop it today by supporting a schedule that is not supported by very significant sections of the ESOs. Let them have a look at this amended EM. Let them come back and tell the government they are happy with it. If I get the same phone call, this matter will be dealt with and we can move on to other legislation. You have my firm undertaking that if Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL say that the addendum to the EM meets their concerns that will be the end of the matter. But we are not prepared to sell these organisations down the river. We are not prepared potentially to risk the rights of veterans in this country. We are not prepared to take this from being legislation to being a regulation. I cannot believe that anyone in this chamber would not be prepared to accept that we need to get some clarification about the addendum from those who are opposed to it. I am sure my colleague would be very happy to hear from the RSL, because my colleague sat in on this inquiry. Senator Fawcett was there and he heard the National President of the RSL expressing his concerns. If the National President of the RSL comes back to Senator Fawcett, Senator Eggleston and me and says, 'We are prepared to accept what is in the addendum,' then the matter gets through.


I ask the government: please, just for the sake of four or five hours, go and get some advice in relation to this. It should have been done beforehand. Everyone knows it should have been done beforehand. It was not, but let's just get on with it. I will have nothing further to say about the lack of consultation if we defer this, find out what it is and come back. We can get it listed. We can get it slotted in. We can get it done and dusted very quickly. There are no more speakers. We are in committee. We can deal with this. Let's deal with it on the back of reasonable knowledge about the people who are not owed a disservice from this chamber by not being consulted in relation to it. I ask the Greens: if the government is not prepared to accept this, please support us for the sake of literally four or five hours. It may well be that this can be clarified this afternoon—I do not know. But it is a matter of getting this material to those organisations who are owed the courtesy of consultation by everyone in the chamber—not just the government, not just the opposition, not just the Greens and not just Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan. Everyone in this chamber owes them the courtesy of finding out what their views are in relation to this matter.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-09-12,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:39):  The Australian Greens do not support the opposition's amendment. As I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, despite initial concerns about the effects of schedule 2 which were raised prior to the inquiry, during the inquiry and with me subsequently, I have now satisfied myself that schedule 2 is not intended to and will not effectively change the previous practice in relation to offsetting. I am satisfied that it will affirm and clarify the existing situation and that it is appropriate that schedule 2 remain in the bill. The Australian Greens are not prepared to jeopardise the passage of the beneficial provisions in schedule 1 of the bill nor the sensible rationalisation provisions in schedule 3 and to hold up consideration of the bill because of concerns that have been raised about schedule 2, having satisfied ourselves that those concerns have been adequately addressed in changes to the explanatory memorandum.


I have been able to come to this view because I have been at pains to consult with and consider the concerns of the RSL and the VVFA and to discuss those concerns in some detail with the government. Although my motives have been somewhat impugned today, I would like to just put on the record that when looking at legislation I am keen to seek the best outcomes possible through consideration of the legislation, consultation and, where possible, collaboration with inter­ested parties. I initiated these discussions both with the organisations that I consulted with and with the government and, having heard those concerns, negotiated to address them to see if an alternative way of addressing the concerns was available. I have acted in good faith.


I cannot answer on what attempts the opposition made to enter into fruitful negotiations with the government about their concerns. I cannot be held responsible for that and the Australian Greens cannot be held responsible for what negotiations were carried out. What I do know is that, having heard the concerns of the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia, and having had further discussions about those, I was satisfied that the changes to the explanatory memorandum would address those concerns. Although I was not at liberty to necessarily show the explanatory memorandum to the organisations, because that was not within my control, I conveyed to those organisations my view that that was adequate. I felt that I had heard their concerns and that they understood that their concerns had been addressed in the explanatory memorandum, although of course they might not be fully satisfied.


The suggestion that somehow the current situation is enshrined only in legislation is misleading in that there is already an administrative practice and discretion, and I am satisfied that schedule 2 of the bill will not change that situation and that indeed there will be further steps taken as set out in the explanatory memorandum to develop guidelines in consultation with ex-service organisations to direct and guide the decision making of the officials of the Department of Veterans' Affairs so that there will be no effective change to what has been agreed to be an effective, fair and good working system up until now. So the Australian Greens are not able to support the opposition's amendments.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-09-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:43):  I indicate that I for one do not impugn Senator Wright's intentions or motives in relation to this. I just want to make that clear. I am not doing that. I have concerns, though, because the onus is on the government to ensure that these amendments will not have unintended consequences. I commend Senator Wright for her diligence and the genuine nature in which she has approached this particular issue. But I did support the coalition in relation to the last division with respect to progress being reported. In other words: I supported the delaying of this bill until we heard from some of the key stakeholders—in particular, from the RSL. Now, unless the Parlia­mentary Secretary for Defence, Senator Feeney, is able to provide the chamber with information that the RSL has seen the precise wording of this addendum to the explanatory memorandum and has had a chance to consider the precise wording, I for one am reluctant for this bill to proceed. Given the will of the chamber is that the bill does proceed, I think the appropriate course of action is that the Senate examine forensically schedule 2 and the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which has a arisen as a result of the diligence and hard work of Senator Wright. But there are still legitimate questions to ask about the potential effects.


Given that the RSL has commented on this previously and that it was a participant to the Senate inquiry into the bill, in which Senator Fawcett, among others, had an active role—I acknowledge Senator Fawcett's service to this nation, given his distinguished background in the Australian Defence Force—the gaping concern to me is that, it is important we find out what the key stakeholders are saying. So, if I may, I ask the parliamentary secretary: since this matter was last raised in committee has there been any sign off, any communication, from the Returned and Services League or other key stakeholder groups, such as the Vietnam Veterans Federation, in relation to the addendum to the explanatory memorandum to this bill?

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:46):  I cannot really go much further than what I have said before in the debate—that is, that the government, as I am advised, has consulted with ex-service organisations and that they have been apprised of the issues and the principles that are manifest in the addendum. Whether they have seen the actual addendum itself, I am unfortunately not in a position to advise the Senate. In the event, Senator Xenophon, that you require the stated support of the RSL in order to support this bill, I am not in a position to assist you. Obviously, it is not for me to say what is the position of the RSL or of any of the other ex-service organisations. That is obviously a matter for them. As for the consultation that has taken place with them, I have nothing further to add. Insofar as your point goes to schedule 2, and the onus being on the government, all I can do is repeat the point made in my second reading speech—that is, these amendments are clarifying and affirming the legislation and will not result in any change to the compensation offsetting practices currently being applied.

 (South Australia) (12:48):  I am grateful to Senator Feeney for his response on behalf the government, but something is missing here. Is it not within the wherewithal of Senator Feeney, repre­senting the government, to advise whether the addendum to the explanatory memor­andum was actually shown to the RSL? I do not think is it an unreasonable question. If the RSL has been shown it, and has not said anything about it, that might, if it does not solve the problem, go some considerable way to resolving this issue. If the RSL is acquiescent, if it is comfortable, about this addendum to the explanatory memorandum, it would reassure me about this issue. Is it not possible to establish whether the RSL has been shown a copy of the addendum to the explanatory memorandum that was filed this morning?

 (South Australia) (12:50):  There was a Rolling Stones song, Mr Chairman, about not being able to get any satisfaction, and it was alluded to by Senator Feeney. There is another Rolling Stones song that goes along the lines of: you can't always get what you want, but sometimes you might just get what you need. I know Senator Feeney is a big Rolling Stones fan—I can just tell. He is a Jaggerite; a Mick Jagger acolyte. All I want is to establish whether this particular addendum has been shown to the RSL. Given the RSL's involvement in this, does Senator Feeney concede it is quite reasonable for the RSL to be shown this addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which arose out of some considerable negotiations between Senator Wright's office, on behalf of the Greens, and the government? Again I commend Senator Wright for the work she has done on this. It is not a difficult issue. I just want to get what I need.

How does it take three hours to ascertain whether the RSL has been given a copy of this? The longer you drag this out, the more obvious I think the response is. If they have not, just say, 'No, they have not been' and then I will make the comment that they should have been—which I am sure you will not. Have they or have they not been shown this for comment?

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (12:54):  I draw the Senate's attention to the evidence given by the RSL during the inquiry around the issue of consultation. The minister had made comment that there was wide consultation. Does the senator believe that consultation is required? Rear Admiral Doolan said:


The point we made earlier on was that the first we knew of this was when the legislation was brought forward. When we became aware of the legislation, we were on a short timescale to provide input to this Senate committee, which we did.


It became apparent that it was a prebudget eve briefing that they had received on the information. When we brought this up with DVA and asked, 'Did you consult?' one of the officials responded:


As the RSL have said, we regularly provide a prebudget briefing, and that is on the day of the budget. In that briefing we explained a whole range of measures coming through in the budget, including offsetting, and explained that the intention of the amendment … But it is true that there was no extensive prebudget consultation about the amendment itself. 


So they clearly said that there was no extensive prebudget consultation, which puts lie to the claim that there has been widespread consultation. My question is: do you support the need to consult with key stakeholders in this whole process?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:56):  I thank the senator for his question. Yes, Senator, I hope you will have noted that in one of my earlier contributions I did touch upon the fact that the Department of Veterans' Affairs has been engaged in consultation with ex-service organisations and that is obviously something that is of great importance and of great continuing importance. I think it is fair to say that in every interaction I have ever had with Veterans' Affairs, whether through the estimates process or through debate in this place, the importance of those service organisations and the perspectives they bring are acknowledged and understood by all. 


What I cannot do is get up in this place and assert the opinions of the RSL; that is for them to assert. I am not able to comment on their level of support for the actions of this government. That is something that only they can properly do. I am I think properly constrained in terms of speaking for another organisation. The RSL will announce in public what they do or do not think about matters as they arise.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (12:57):  The question was not at all to ask you to comment on the RSL; the question was going to the point that the government has claimed there is consultation. You have just made the claim again that the department engages in consultation. In broad terms I accept that that does occur on a frequent basis. What we are talking about here specifically is schedule 2, this offsetting provision. What became very clear during the committee hearing was that in fact there had been no consultation. There had been a briefing, a one-way flow of information, the night before the budget, which does not give anybody any confidence that there has been a serious attempt to consult. The question is—and it is raised again around this explanatory memorandum—does the government believe in the value of consultation with key stakeholders and will you give them the courtesy of the opportunity to provide feedback before this becomes part of law?

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (12:58):  I have just been advised by the Vietnam Veterans Federation that they have not seen the changes to the explanatory memorandum resulting from their concerns. They understand that the Greens had negotiated some amendments, but they had not seen them. Senator Wright, I was reflecting on the fact that you had been given these changes—not you personally. The fact remains that you were shown amendments to the EM by the government to ensure your support for schedule 2, knowing that the government did not have the support of the opposition in relation to schedule 2 because of the concerns of the ex-service community. You ultimately, Senator Wright, will need to make a decision in about two minutes time as to whether you think it is appropriate for one political party to negotiate the terms of an explanatory memorandum when the ex-service organisations, who have expressed a real concern about this, have indicated in a Senate inquiry that there has not been appropriate consultation. You will have an opportunity to say whether you think that is acceptable. 


This is not a reflection on you at all, Senator Wright, but it is most certainly a reflection on your party. Following all the talk from the Australian Greens about consultation and doing the right thing, about making sure the process is right, here is an opportunity for them to prove that this was not a political stitch-up between the government and the Greens in relation to this change in the addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Here is the opportunity for her to say that they actually do agree with due process. Here is the opportunity for her, in about two minutes time, to say that they are not prepared to let this go through until they have canvassed appropriately and properly the views of the ex-service organisations and only then will they support the three schedules; only then will they support schedule 2.


I direct this to the parliamentary secretary as well as to Senator Wright: having had confirmation that the Vietnam Veterans Federation has not seen the changes, how can this chamber possibly countenance this matter being dealt with now? How can we possibly countenance completely ignoring the views of organisations who have been participants in this process? How can the Australian Greens support such an abuse of process by forcing this legislation to be dealt with before we get the views of those ex-service organisations? How can the parliamentary secretary and the government possibly countenance forcing this chamber to deal with this matter until they have actually consulted with the participants in this process, one of whom took substantial time to involve themselves in the Senate inquiry process? How can that be a reasonable outcome for this chamber? How can anyone sitting in the gallery say this is an appropriate process for this parliament to be involved in? 


This is simple—this is not knocking off a bit of legislation which has to go back to the other place and then possibly come here and then become new legislation. All we on this side are asking—and I will speak for Senator Xenophon—is for the government to assure us that the consultation we think is appropriate has been carried out. Then we will deal with this matter. Either these organisations will be happy with it and it will go through or, if they are still not happy with it, the government has to make a decision about whether it is prepared to go against their wishes. And for what? The government says it is about to spend money anyway getting in place the systems it says it needs to address potential issues further down the track—and I said I accept that. So it can go and spend the money and then we will worry about what is in schedule 2. But it is totally inappropriate for this matter to be dealt with today before proper consultation has been carried out. These are not some mickey mouse groups that have sprung up after a good spring rain. This is the RSL, this is Legacy, this is the Vietnam Veterans Federation. Surely to goodness they deserve the respect of this chamber enough to be consulted on this matter. I move:

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:11):  I will reflect firstly on Senator Ronaldson's references to Senator Wright's involvement in this matter. I have a slightly different perspective. I do not think it is incumbent upon Senator Wright to enter into widespread consultation with key groups; I think the primary responsibility for that rests with the government. That is what I think is fair. I acknowledge Senator Wright's hard work on this and I acknowledge the spirit in which she undertook those negotiations. From my perspective, it is fair to say that it is the government's obligation to consult with the key stakeholders, not necessarily that of Senator Wright or the Greens. So I have a slightly different perspective on that.


But I do agree wholeheartedly with Senator Ronaldson, who has become my spokesperson on this particular issue—maybe more broadly; we will wait and see—that it is unwise and unsafe to proceed further in the absence of hearing from the RSL, from the Vietnam Veterans Federation, from Legacy and from other key stake­holders who participated fully in the Senate inquiry and who have a longstanding interest in this. I understand, however, that it is the will of the chamber to proceed to deal with these matters now. It is therefore incumbent upon me to ask the parliamentary secretary, Senator Feeney, a number of specific questions relating to the explanatory memorandum. 


I note that the explanatory memorandum starts off by saying that the proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. My first question is: to what extent will these amendments change current arrangements at all if they do not change the compensation offsetting provisions? Is it the case that, whilst they will not strictly change the current compensation offsetting pro­visions, they may change the way in which matters are dealt with in terms of compensation offsetting? It is a technical question but, given that so much of this will turn on technical issues, it is only the first of a number of such questions I have with respect to the explanatory memorandum.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:14):  Firstly, I now have some advice of a more specific nature concerning the consultation process which has taken place.




Senator Xenophon:
  I'm listening.




Senator FEENEY:
  Excellent. Perhaps we will get you some satisfaction, Senator. Perhaps Senator Ronaldson's days as your spokesperson are numbered. I understand that the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia have seen all parts of the addendum with the exception of the final paragraph—that is, the paragraph beginning 'The Repatriation Commission'. I can advise the Senate that the discussions with VVFA and DVA on concerns about double dipping have occurred, that there have been discussions between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the operational working party, which is comprised of ex-service organisations, on the text of the explanatory memorandum. There has been a discussion between the minister's office, the RSL and the VVFA about the explanatory memorandum. Further, I am advised that John Hodges of the RSL has indicated he is broadly supportive and I note again that the explanatory memorandum does not change anything—that it spells out the current operations and sets out the fact that there will be further consultations.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator FEENEY:
  I understand both are true. These amendments result in no change. They are clarifying and affirming only and no disability pension will be affected.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-09-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:17):  I am perplexed. We are debating amendments which the government has just said will result in no change. If we are debating amendments which will result in no change, why then have the amendments put in the first place? To be fair to Senator Feeney, he has said that they will result in clarifying the current provisions. I think that is the summary of what Senator Feeney has outlined. I am grateful to Senator Feeney for finally responding—that is, for the government finally being able to respond; it was not Senator Feeney's fault—to the issue I raised with Senator Ronaldson. If these amendments will result in no change, as we have just heard, to what extent will they result in clarifying the established compensation offsetting practices and, to the extent that they do clarify the offsetting practices, does the clarification in itself result in some change in the way the current provisions are being dealt with?

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:18):  We are obviously talking about the second measure, clarifying and affirming the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy. You ask the question: if these amendments do not change anything, why are we doing this? I guess the answer to that question is that these amendments are in response to a decision of the full Federal Court in Commonwealth of Australia v Smith, which decision highlights the need to clarify and affirm these aspects of the legislation. That is what we are doing.

This is legislation that the government is pursuing, and it is pursuing it on the basis that it is good legislation, that it is required in the aftermath of the Smith decision, that it realises government policy which the government has been clearly expounding upon through the budget process, the budget and subsequently. Lastly, we are mindful of the fact that we are making changes here that we believe have the broad support of ex-service organisations.

I assure the parliamentary secretary that, until we find out what the views of the RSL, the Vietnams Veterans Federation and Legacy are, as is only appropriate, we will continue debating this matter. I will be very careful about the way I put this: I am taking the parliamentary secretary at face value because I acknowledge that the parlia­mentary secretary does not have personal knowledge of this matter and the parlia­mentary secretary has taken advice from departmental and ministerial staff on this matter. If it is incorrect, I will hold him to account only to the extent that he was providing the chamber with information he had been provided with. But he will not be surprised to know that I will be very deeply concerned if the advice that has been given today is incorrect. If, indeed, it is correct that the document was passed around the table on 26 August, was there a consultation process put in place for that circulated document?

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:35):  Senator, your histrionics and your rhetoric are simply about your delaying this debate rather than grappling with it. You might put forward the contention, if you will, that our consultation process has been inadequate—that is a matter for you and I am sure you will enliven that point to the best of your abilities—but the government's position on this is very clear and it is very simple. Arising from a decision of a full bench of the Federal Court, we were required to do the responsible and sensible thing and make amendments to this legislation so that the legislation is clear and effective. The amendments clarify and affirm the legislation. They will not result in any change to the compensation-offsetting practices currently being applied. We have made this point again and again and again.


You may very well seek to make the partisan political point that we have not consulted adequately with organisations about the fact that the amendments will not result in any change to the compensation-offsetting practices currently being applied, but that remains our point. We have prepared an addendum and we have done that in response to the Senate committee, to our discussions with the Greens party and to discussions with others. As for the forensic detail, emails and so forth, I have provided you with the very best information that I have to hand. The fundamental point remains the same—these are not mighty changes. They are not going to result in the current practices changing. They are not going to result in a diminution of entitlements.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (13:37):  I am glad you believe that commentary about appropriate consultation is histrionics. I can give you some histrionics if you want it but I put this to you: is it histrionics to question the government about its consultation processes? Is it histrionics to say that it is inappropriate for one minor political party, which just happens to be your government partner, to get information that is not provided to ex-service organisations? As I said to you before, these are not groups that spring up after a good spring rain. These are the peak bodies in this country. Are you telling the chamber that it is histrionics to demand why any political party has an arrangement and a scenario of consultation when those groups that are actively and intimately involved in this process do not? If that is the government's definition of histrionics then, quite frankly, heaven help us.


The simple fact is that we have been advised today that the RSL was given a copy of this document only after this debate started and after the government had been caught out in relation to the lack of consultation. That is not histrionics. The simple fact is that if it had not been raised today this matter would have gone through without the RSL having had any input into it whatsoever; it would have been a fait accompli. The Vietnam Veterans Federation would not have had any input into it; it would have been a fait accompli. Legacy would not have had any input into it; it would have become a fait accompli. If that is the way that you want to carry out your consultation process, that is fine. If the Greens think that is an appropriate consultation process, that is fine. But everyone be on notice: what the Greens say and what the Greens do are often two entirely different matters.


The Greens were given the opportunity today to say, 'For the sake of three or four hours, we are going to clarify this situation and clarify whether those peak bodies are supportive of this addendum.' Then petty politics entered into this debate. You are not prepared for the sake of four or five hours to concede a bit of ground on this matter. You are driven by petty pride for a very simple matter. There is no reason why this chamber could not have dealt with this matter later today or in the morning—no reason at all. But petty pride means that the government and the Greens are not prepared to accept that the right thing should be done in this case. I am absolutely staggered that the Greens have been prepared to compromise themselves to this extent by not acknowledging that three or four hours can get some serious clarification. I am utterly amazed, given the need for the government and the department to maintain close working relationships with these ESOs, that they also have not been prepared for the sake of three or four hours to do so. If that is histrionics, you have got it.


I ask the parliamentary secretary: in the last paragraph, which, of course, has not been circulated to anyone other than the Greens and now the chamber today, when will the Repatriation Commission be issuing appropriate policy guidance, and has that been drafted yet?

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-09-12,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (13:42):  I put on the record again my understanding that the very reason the last paragraph in the explanatory memorandum was inserted was after I made an assiduous effort to consult with both the RSL and the VVFA to clarify their concerns. I took those concerns to the government as they concerned me as well, particularly in relation to the degree of discretion that was potentially available to the Repatriation Commission and decision makers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs in implementing the scheme that would be in effect once the amendments were passed. My understanding after quite a degree of discussion was that there have always been administrative arrangements in place; that there was no intention as a result of the amendments to change those administrative arrangements; that they had worked and had operated effectively over quite a significant period of time and that no complaints had been received from the veterans community about those administrative arrangements. But, to ameliorate the concerns that I had, which were directly being passed on because of my consultation with the RSL and the VVFA, there was an agreement to add a further paragraph in the explanatory memorandum to clarify that there would be specific guidelines drafted to ensure the situation did not change and that there would be consultation with the ex-service organisations to allow input into those guidelines to again assuage their concerns.


Rather than, as has been suggested, some mucky deal being done where the concerns of two significant veterans associations, the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia, are ignored or undermined, in fact it is the opposite. Late on Friday I was still relaying to the government my concern about unintended consequences of the amendments if they were to pass. I then in full transparency contacted those organisations and spoke to members of those organisations and conveyed to them my view that the changes to the explanatory memorandum would satisfy their concerns and it satisfied my concerns that the ultimate effect of passing these amendments, particularly schedule 2, would not have unintended consequences that would make the lot of veterans worse given that the assurance all the way through has been that that would not be the case.


Having given a lot of consideration to this matter, the Greens were of the view that, rather than waste the valuable time of the chamber, where there are beneficial provisions that presumably some veterans are waiting to take effect, the prisoner of war recognition provisions and other sensible provisions that would allow a sensible rationalisation of two very similar allowances, rather than holding those up unnecessarily and having satisfied myself that I had been open and thoughtful and considerate of the concerns of the VVFA and the RSL, I formed the view that it was appropriate to support the bill. That is why the Greens have taken the position that we have taken.

 (Victoria) (13:46):  With the greatest respect to Senator Wright, this is actually not about whether she has or has not satisfied herself in relation to this matter. I am sure an enormous amount of due diligence has gone into this. I am not aware that Senator Wright is an expert in this field but she may well be and if she is then I apologise. But it is not actually a matter of Senator Wright satisfying herself; it is about Senator Wright and the Greens and the government satisfying themselves that indeed proper process has been followed. That is what it is all about, not whether Senator Wright has satisfied herself in relation to this. Senator Wright could have satisfied herself in relation to this by actually telling those organisations what was in this addendum to the explanatory memorandum and asking them. If they had said to her on the back of her going to them with the words from this addendum, 'I am satisfied with it,' then Senator Wright would be quite entitled to make the comments that she has. She actually would have tested her views in relation to this against the addendum. But she has not tested those views against the addendum. She has tested her views in relation to her interpretation, not on the back of what the peak bodies were saying about it. So, with the greatest respect, that is not sufficient investigative work. 


The parliamentary secretary told me before that the work had started on these policies. What stage are they at? When did that commence and when will they be ready for ex-service organisation consultation?

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (13:48):  Already policy advice is available. This advice is in plain-speaking language, which is easier for departmental staff and veterans and their advocates to understand. The policy has been available broadly speaking for a long time. While I am on my feet, I might also read into the transcript an email that has only just been received, at least by me. It is to Mr Ross Bain, who is the chief of staff to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and it is from Mr John Hodges. It reads:


Dear Ross


The RSL continues to oppose schedule 2 of this bill. However, if the Senate sees fit to pass this bill, the RSL would be comfortable with the amendment of the explanatory memorandum.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (13:49):  Exactly. So we have spent the last three hours trying to ascertain what the views were of the ex-service organisations who have been involved in this process. Why was this not done beforehand? I am not suggesting for one minute that what has been given to Mr Bain, what you have read out, is not correct. But I want to consult with the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation over question time and taking note and whatever time is there, and indeed if their position is that they are happy to let this go through then it will go through. But why was not this done at 10 past 10 this morning? Why have we gone through this charade trying to ascertain the views of these ex-service organisations, the charade of not knowing whether people had or had not been given documents, the charade about whether people had or had not been consulted. Three hours we have spent on this when we should have at an early stage had the sort of advice we are now starting to get through a drip feed.


I want to take up the parliamentary secretary's comment in relation to the policy guidance. I take it from what you have said that the Repatriation Commission has the view that they already have appropriate policy guidance in place to meet the requirements of the recently added but not distributed addendum to the EM.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (13:52):  In response to my question about the policy guidance, Parliamentary Secretary, you said that that work was already underway. You then said that that work has been done for some time. My question related specifically to the added but not distributed addendum to the explanatory memorandum. I suppose I am either entitled to say, 'Well, yes, it has been, and it has been there for some time,' or 'The work has just started.' Which one is it? Has it been there for some time and therefore, if it has, that is what the department will be relying on? Or has it started in the last three hours? You cannot have it both ways, Parliamentary Secretary. Either the work has already been done and you are going to rely on it—shake your head as you may, I am only quoting your words. I am just quoting your words, old boy, and the simple fact is that you said it had been underway for some time and they were already there. You are now telling me they have just started it. Given that, according to your comrade in arms from the Greens, she was still negotiating with the government late on Friday afternoon, have they started that work since nine o'clock this morning? Is that what you are telling us? Or, indeed, has all this work been done? Was that just put in to satisfy a few whims, according to you—and, indeed, the consultation will not be required because the decisions have already been made? If it is there and has been there for some time, why do we need this particular piece of legislation?

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (13:55):  The Parliamentary Secretary for Defence has just said—



A government senator:  That's the one!




Senator RONALDSON:
  Gee, you're on the ball today, aren't you, old fellow? You're right on the mark. You picked that up straight away. The parliamentary secretary has just indicated to us that we had two wasted divisions today while we ascertained what the advice from the ex-service organisations was. Guess what? One of those divisions occurred before you gave the RSL the document you are talking about, so that was a waste, was it? Consultation was a waste—when it was done before you sent them the material, sent them the addendum? That was a waste, was it? I am glad you think that consultation is a waste! I am glad you think that the RSL and the Vietnam veterans federation and Legacy are also a waste, because that is implicit in your comment! That is what you are saying. We wasted time this morning while you ascertained two very simple things. The first one was whether the RSL and the Vietnam veterans federation had been consulted. The second one was what their response was. And we got their response 15 minutes ago, which actually postdated the other of the divisions that you are talking about.


Please do not come in here and effectively reflect on the bona fides of those ex-service organisations. If you cannot get your act together, if you rely on the Australian Greens, your partners in crime, to carry you, you will come unstuck every single time. Every single time, they will bring you unstuck, because what they say and what they do are two entirely different matters.


Parliamentary Secretary, I am looking forward to our discussing this again later this afternoon, and I am looking forward to your providing me with the information this chamber should have been given at 10 o'clock this morning—that is, what was the level of consultation, who was it with and what was the outcome of those deliberations? I said to you at 10 past 10 this morning and I gave you an undertaking at least two hours ago that, if you satisfy this chamber that you have had the consultations and you can satisfy the chamber—if you are telling this chamber—that the people whom you are asking to sign up to this and to whom you had not given the benefit of the document are supportive, we will support this measure. Do not talk about wasting divisions. Do not talk about abuse of due process. Do not rely on the Australian Greens to do your job for you. Get out and consult. Do what you should be doing. Deal with the RSL and Legacy and the Vietnam veterans federation in the manner in which they would expect to be dealt with; they deserve absolutely no less. If the President is here, I will sit down. I presume we are now holding this matter over, Mr Temporary Chairman.


Progress reported.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (10:01):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and flag that I will be moving an amendment during the Committee of the Whole to omit schedule 2 from the bill. This bill seeks to do three things. Firstly, the bill establishes a prisoner of war recognition supplement—a POWR—of $500 per fortnight, which will be paid to around 900 eligible former prisoners of war. Secondly, the bill seeks to clarify arrangements concerning offsetting provi­sions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. I will speak in further detail about this schedule shortly. Finally, the third schedule of this bill rationalises the way temporary incapacity payments are made under the bill.


The coalition supports schedules 1 and 3 of the bill. Of course, schedule 1 of the bill builds on a similar initiative of the previous coalition government. The previous coalition government made one-off ex gratia payments of $25,000 to Australian ex-POWs. In 2001 these payments were made to former Japanese POWs, in 2003 to prisoners of the North Koreans and in 2007 to former captives of the Germans and Italians. Honourable senators will know of my close personal connection to the ex-POW com­munity in Australia through my involvement as co-chair of the Australian ex-prisoner of war memorial project in my home city of Ballarat. The coalition supports the supple­ment, which will be available to approxi­mately 900 POWs who are known to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The first payment will be made on 6 October and the measure will be in place from 20 September this year. 


Schedule 3 of this bill rationalises temporary incapacity payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986—the VEA. The changes abolish the payment of temporary incapacity allowance under the act, with those previously eligible for this payment being transferred to the loss of earnings allowance presently available under the VEA. The rationalisation of these pay­ments reflects the changing nature of Australian society. A stay in hospital and periods of convalescence can be much shorter now than in the past. The temporary incapacity allowance currently paid under the VEA requires an eligible veteran to be hospitalised or unable to work for a mini­mum period of 28 days. After 28 days the veteran is eligible to apply to receive an allowance, which is backdated to the first day of hospitalisation. The changes proposed by the amendment remove the 28-day qualification period and replace it with a pro rata loss of earnings allowance which compensates for an actual loss of earnings. The Parliamentary Library explains that the amount of loss of earnings allowance payable is the lesser of the difference between the T&PI rate of disability pension and the veteran's present rate of disability pension and the amount of salary, wages or earnings actually lost, including loadings or other allowances that would have been payable. This is a sensible amendment which the coalition and the ex-service community support.


Schedule 2 of the bill has been the subject of a Senate inquiry and the coalition is opposed to it. Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to amend provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to clarify the opera­tion of compensation offsetting provisions. Offsetting occurs when a person is eligible to receive compensation from two or more sep­arate Commonwealth compen­sation schemes for the same incapacity resulting from injury. Offsetting dates back to 1973 when the Whitlam Labor government determined to broaden the application of the former Repatriation Act to cover certain non-warlike service. As a consequence of this action, some eligible ex-defence personnel were able to access compensation under two acts—the Repatriation Act and the Compen­sation (Government Employees) Act 1971. The offsetting changes introduced in 1973 and backdated to 1972 were intended to apply to dual eligibility for compensation paid from Commonwealth compensation schemes. A vital premise of Australia's repatriation system is that the Common­wealth will compensate for incapacity, not for the injury itself. As a result, two people with the same injury may receive different rates of compensation based solely on the degree to which each person is incapacitated. The coalition supports this principle, as does the veteran and ex-service community.


I now turn to the Smith case. The amendments proposed by this schedule arise from a decision of the full Federal Court. In the matter of Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (2009), the court found that compen­sation offsetting should not apply to Mr Smith because of the unique circum­stances of his case. Mr Smith was receiving compen­sation under the VEA and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 for two separate incapacities relating to separate periods of service in the Australian Defence Force. In the first instance, Mr Smith received compensation under the VEA for a duodenal ulcer and PTSD as a result of his service in Vietnam. Secondly, Mr Smith received compensation for anxiety arising from his service aboard HMAS Melbourne at the time it collided with the Voyager. The court held that these two conditions were not related and, on the basis of this fact, determined that offsetting should not apply under the act. I note the Commonwealth did not pursue this matter beyond the Federal Court. The Commonwealth argued that Mr Smith was being twice compensated for the same incapacity—a position the court disputed, holding that the injuries and resultant incapacities were different and separate. The court awarded a confidential settlement to Mr Smith and found in his favour. Consequently, the government is now seeking to clarify the legislation to make clear the Repatriation Commission's understanding of the intention of the legislation—and I use the word 'clarify' advisedly.


At the coalition's request, a Senate inquiry into the bill sought submissions from the veteran and ex-service community. In particular, I thank the RSL, Legacy and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia for their participation and the RSL for attending the public hearing in Canberra on 11 August. Three weeks ago, the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill was tabled in the Senate. My colleagues Senator Alan Eggleston and Senator David Fawcett tabled a dissenting report which calls for schedule 2 of the bill to be omitted. I thank both of my colleagues for their significant input into this inquiry.


During the inquiry, the RSL forcefully put the view that the proposed amendments went above and beyond the intention of the 1973 legislation which the government allegedly seeks to clarify. Further, the RSL put the view that appropriate provisions already exist in the legislation and in accompanying regulations to ensure that offsetting cases similar to Mr Smith's would be treated fairly under the act. The department did not dispute the detail of the RSL's analysis. It was also made clear during the public hearing and in other representations to me on other matters that parliament must maintain the ability to set the policies by which the department, the Repatriation Commission and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Com­mission operate. In particular, I note Rear Admiral Doolan's statement:


… the RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.


The coalition agrees with this and is concerned that these proposed amendments to, as the government claims, clarify the operation of the act will still require guidelines to ensure they are applied properly. Parliament's intention, rather than the department's, must be paramount in this respect. Parliament's original intention was sufficiently clear in this case. I will shortly move an amendment to omit schedule 2 from this bill. I ask honourable senators to consider the best interests of our veteran and ex-service community and support the coalition's amendment.


I understand that there may be some alterations to the explanatory memorandum to the bill. I do not know whether these are clarifications or what they are, but we are advised that there will be some alterations. I certainly have not seen the altered explan­atory memorandum and I do not know whether the minister on duty is able to nod her head to indicate whether or not this will be tabled. Obviously it would be an extraordinary situation were I to be starting my second reading speech in relation to this matter and it was being proposed to alter the explanatory memorandum. In fact it beggars belief that that would actually occur at this eleventh hour. So I am assuming that this will not be the case. I have not been advised by the minister's office or anyone else about it. We will wait and see. The amendments proposed in schedule 2 have not been justified and more work needs to be done before the parliament considers the measures presently opposed. The coalition will support schedules 1 and 3 of this bill but oppose schedule 2.


I will briefly address some other matters. I notice that my colleague Senator Fawcett has now entered the chamber and I will repeat the thanks I gave to him earlier for his significant involvement in the Senate inquiry and his very considerable input into it. The so-called winter recess has been an extraordinarily busy period. I want to thank the hundreds of veterans and ex-service­people, and their families, who I have met during my travels—everywhere from Albany to Geraldton in Western Australia, to Mackay, Townsville and Cairns in North Queensland, and from Sydney to Warrnam­bool, amongst other places. I look forward to spending more time on the road shortly and encourage people with an interest in veterans affairs to participate in the coalition's veterans forums which are being held right across the country. 


The biggest issue I am hearing is the ongoing unfair, unjust and inequitable situation facing DFRDB superannuants as a result of the shameful decision by this place to oppose the coalition's fair indexation bill. Honourable senators will be only too aware of the anger in the community at the decision of Labor, the Greens and Senator Xenophon to block the coalition's fair indexation bill from passing on 16 June. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame for this shameful decision to oppose the bill.


I want to turn now to the Centenary of Anzac. There remains significant concern about the Gillard-Brown Labor government's failure to establish a budget for the Anzac Centenary commemorations, which are getting closer by the day. The coalition welcomes the appointment of Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston as chair of the new Anzac Centenary Advisory Board, but it is fair to say that Air Chief Marshall Houston is flying solo at the moment, with other members of the board yet to be announced or appointed. The elephant in the room, however, is the lack of funding certainty which is jeopardising the planning for commemoration in small towns and big cities right across Australia. The coalition welcomed the $250,000 announced for a scoping study for works in Albany's part of the centenary. Coincidentally, the minister chose to visit Albany the day before I was scheduled to speak at a business breakfast there about the Anzac Centenary itself—imitation is the best form of flattery. I welcome his belated and minor financial commitment to this project and look forward to seeing a real commitment of funds for the Anzac Interpretive Centre very soon Finally, I turn to advocacy funding. I draw the Senate's attention to the anger in the veteran and ex-service community about cuts to veterans' advocacy in the budget. The minister signed, just prior to travelling to France for the 95th anniversary com­memorations of the Battle of Frommelles, letters which dramatically slashed funding under the Building Excellence in Support and Training program, known as the BEST program, as well as the Veteran and Community Grants program. The BEST grant program was established by the previous government. The grants enable ex-service organisations to provide assistance to veterans, veterans' families, members of the Defence Force and their families. The grants assist volunteer veterans working in our community to assist those who have served our nation and are in need of assistance. These volunteers help veterans file claims for compensation. These volunteers touch base with our ageing veterans and war widows to ensure they do not become socially isolated. They provide help and support to those in our community who want to discuss their experiences with someone who understands what they have been through. Cutting this funding could not have come at a worse time. Frankly, this government has no mandate to cut funding to this program but, just as with the carbon tax, it is going to do it anyway. Page 5 of the Review of DVA-fundedESO advocacy and welfare services, which was tabled in February, says:


There is also a strong belief that the current practice within Australia, whereby ex-serving members voluntarily take on a role to assist in claims preparation ... has worked very well—


I repeat, 'has worked very well'—


and should continue to be supported through funding mechanisms such as the BEST program. The very nature of this voluntary work should be valued, not understated.


It went on to say that the government must be mindful that BEST grants funding should be:


... sufficient to meet the needs of the veteran community.


How the government can justify cutting $8 million from veterans' advocacy funding but then spend $12 million advertising their carbon tax broken promise is beyond the comprehension of most in the veteran and wider Australian community. The decision to cut this funding, made without warning and without any consultation, will potentially and dramatically spell the end for ex-service organisations, which simply will not be able to survive. 


My office has been inundated with angry veterans pension and welfare officers asking how they are meant to survive on a grant which has, in some cases, been cut more than 50 per cent on last year's funding. This is even more concerning given applications for this funding round were received in March, when no mention of funding cuts had been made by the government. 


One of those organisations is the Geelong Veterans Welfare Centre. Recently I spoke in the Senate about commemorations at the Vietnam War memorial in Geelong. The Vietnam veterans centre in Geelong is located at Osborne House, a historic property with long links to the defence of the nation. After the memorial service, members of the local veteran community came up to me deeply concerned about the impact of the BEST cuts on the veterans of Geelong. They have made available to me a letter they sent to Minister Snowdon with their concerns:


The Geelong Veterans' Welfare Centre has the largest client base in Victoria and is the busiest office.


We ... cover areas as far a-field as the south-west coast to Warrnambool/Port Fairy/Portland and up to Hamilton/Horsham and back through Rokewood and Colac.


The letter goes on to say: 


The loss of funding, particularly to the salary, will severely limit our capacity to fill the Administration Support Officer position and will most likely force our employee to seek other employment opportunities.


What a disgrace, an utter disgrace! Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to table this letter from the Geelong Veterans Welfare Centre to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs outlining the impact of the cuts on the centre and the services it provides to veterans and their families in the wider Geelong region. 


Leave granted. 




Senator RONALDSON:
  I am sorry to say that this situation is repeated right across the country. Over the last three months, I have had the honour to speak at RSL state branch congresses across Australia. In his remarks to at least three of these congresses, the minister has said that the number of veterans of the Afghanistan conflict will shortly equal the number of veterans who served in Vietnam. But the justification for these cuts is a 25 per cent decline in the veteran population—that is, a decline in the VEA veteran population, not in veterans making claims under the SRCA or the MRCA. 


Younger veterans will still need advocates. These cuts in funding will flow on to reduce access to assistance for them and their families when they return home. The government has absolutely got this one wrong and the coalition and the veteran community demand answers, not more spin from this Gillard-Brown Labor government. 


The coalition supports schedules 1 and 3 of this bill. We will move to remove schedule 2 during the Committee of the Whole because doing so is in the best interests of veterans and their families. If the government really sees value in this amendment, it will consult further and then bring this measure back to the parliament with the support of the veteran community.


I have just been given an addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Clearly, I have not had the opportunity to look at this. Can someone tell me why on this matter, which has been on the books for two or three months, I am now getting an addendum to the explanatory memorandum 10 minutes after I have started speaking? What is going on with this government? What a disgrace! These amendments were circulated weeks ago. Everyone knows the urgency of getting these POW payments through. Yet here at the eleventh hour I am getting an addendum to the explanatory memorandum. How can this chamber possibly operate properly when the responsible shadow minister was not given a copy of this addendum to the explanatory memorandum? It is quite disgraceful. This is another example of a government which is in freefall, a govern­ment which is divided, a government which has lost control of the agenda and thinks it is appropriate to bring an addendum to an explanatory memorandum into this chamber when the debate has started. I will now go and have a look at this. I suspect it will not allay the fears of those who have been involved in this process—the RSL, the Vietnam veterans et cetera. (Time expired)

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-09-12,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:22):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The Veterans' Entitlements Act provides for the payment of pensions and other benefits to veterans and certain other persons and provides for medical and other support. The Australian Greens are of the view that, as a society, we send people off to serve on our behalf in situations which potentially place them at great risk. It is only fair then that we ensure we look after them properly when they return home. As an overriding principle, the Australian Greens support fair and equitable compensation, assistance and support for all veterans and their families. 


This bill has three schedules. Schedule 1 seeks to create a prisoner of war recognition supplement. This will provide for certain veterans who have been held as prisoners of war to receive an additional supplement of $500 per fortnight in recognition of the severe hardship and deprivation they suffered during their incarceration. Schedule 2 seeks to clarify and affirm the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to pensions payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The schedule aims to make clear that where compensation is paid from another source in respect of the same incapacity, though not necessarily the same injury or disease, as a pension which is paid under the act, compensation offsetting provisions will apply. The intention is to prevent double payment of compensation for the same incapacity. Schedule 3 seeks to rationalise the current temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance by abolishing the former, the temporary incapacity allowance, and replacing it with an entitlement to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance instead. 


Schedule 1 is welcomed by the veterans communities and appears to be supported by all, and schedule 3 is relatively uncontro­versial. I will address these schedules briefly before focusing on schedule 2, which deals with offsetting and is more controversial and which has raised some concerns for the veterans communities and for the Australian Greens. These concerns were recognised by the Selection of Bills Committee, which, in recommending an inquiry into the provisions of the bill, focused on schedule 2, stating that the purpose for the inquiry would be 'to seek further information about the changes proposed by schedule 2 and to enable feedback from the veteran and ex-service community about the changes'. The bill was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for inquiry, and I was pleased to participate in this inquiry as a committee member. 


Under schedule 1, the proposed prisoner of war recognition supplement will be paid to veterans who were held as prisoners of war and to civilians alike who were interned as prisoners during World War II and the Korean War. Previous governments have made one-off ex gratia payments of $25,000 to former prisoners of war. In 2001, they were paid to those who were detained in Japan; in 2003, to those who had been detained in Korea; and in 2007, to those who were detained in Europe during World War II. The prisoner of war recognition supple­ment is proposed to be paid in addition to any existing Commonwealth benefits the eligible person receives. It will be exempt from income tax, exempt from calculations in assessing other veterans entitlements and exempt from social security income tests. The payment will be indexed annually in line with the consumer price index. The supple­ment is not a pension, nor is it compensation based on any test of incapacity or on the person having suffered a war caused injury or disease, and it will not be subject to the offsetting provisions of the act. It is purely in recognition of incarceration. 


The Department of Veterans' Affairs estimates that up to 900 former civilian and veteran prisoners of war will be eligible for the supplement. Introduction of the supple­ment is overwhelmingly supported by the veterans community. It is appropriate that we acknowledge the unique and often traumatic circumstances that prisoners of war endured at this nation's behest. Neither one-off payments nor fortnightly supplements can possibly fully compensate for the experience of being held as a prisoner of war. But, as a society, we can make these gestures which may make life a little more comfortable for those who have endured so much and acknowledge the contribution these people have made on our behalf. The Australian Greens support schedule 1, the payment of a prisoner of war recognition supplement. 


Schedule 3, the proposed rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance, is a logical streamlining measure which will remove the overlap and confusion associated with two similar payments. This proposal elicited no major concerns from the veterans community or others during the committee's inquiry. The Australian Greens support schedule 3. 


This brings me to schedule 2 of the bill. According to information from the Depart­ment of Veterans' Affairs, schedule 2 seeks to clarify compensation offsetting provisions. These provisions apply where a veteran receives compensation for two or more different injuries or illnesses which would result in the same incapacity. The provisions have been used since the early 1970s and schedule 2 seeks to clarify their application rather than to alter them or change when they are applied. Compensation offsetting rests on the principle that compensation is payable for a state of incapacity rather than for a specific injury. This amendment seeks to affirm and give clarity to the original intention of the existing legislation and to ensure the equitable outcome that a person cannot receive duplicate compensation for the same incapacity under different pieces of legislation. 


Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, pensions are payable for war or defence caused injury or disease. Pensions under part 2 of the act are payable to veterans, while pensions under part 4 are payable to current or former Defence Force members with certain peacetime service. The amendment in the bill seeks to ensure that a person cannot receive duplicate compensation for the same incapacity by providing that, if a person is receiving a pension under part 2 or part 4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the person receives additional compensation from another source in respect of the incapacity or death for which the pension is being paid, the amount of Veterans' Entitlements Act pension is reduced—that is, offset on a dollar for dollar basis by the amount of additional compensation. Most cases involving compensation offsetting arise from duplicate entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and their predecessors, though compensation from other sources, including third party insurance and common law cases, may also be subject to compensation offsetting under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. 


The stated reason for the introduction of the bill was to clarify the law after a 2009 Federal Court case, the Commonwealth of Australia v Smith (2009) FCAFC 175, after that case cast doubt on the way in which the department had previously interpreted the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The policy objective of the amendments was said to be to provide some certainty that the offsetting provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act could continue to be administered as they had been for nearly 40 years so as to prevent duplicate compensation being paid to veterans for the same incapacity. I was pleased to be a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee for the purposes of inquiring into this bill. During this inquiry, concerns were raised by some members of the veterans community about this schedule, and the Australian Greens had some similar concerns. These can be summarised as: concerns that the schedule would extend the potential scope of offsetting, to the detriment of veterans; concerns about the consideration of legal costs in determining the value of compensation received; and concerns about the apparent discretionary nature in which offsetting provisions could be applied in the future. 


I turn to the issue of legal costs first. During the inquiry, I was concerned to learn that, when considering what amount of compensation was received in order to determine what offsetting should occur, the Repatriation Commission allows for one type of legal cost to be subtracted from the lump sum but not another. So the costs which are described as party-party costs are able to be subtracted from a settlement figure and the net figure then used to offset. However, other costs commonly paid by a client to a legal adviser—called solicitor-client costs—are not subtracted. These solicitor-client costs reduce the amount of money actually recei­ved by the claimant for their own use. This was raised as a matter of concern by the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia and the Returned and Services League of Australia. 


The Australian Greens are of the view that solicitor-client costs can often be quite significant and should not be ignored when the settlement figure for offsetting is being calculated. As Rear Admiral Doolan of the RSL said to the inquiry, the figure used for offsetting should be the amount actually paid into a person's bank account. This is only fair. The idea behind offsetting is that a person should not be compensated twice for the same incapacity. However, a person has not actually received that part of the compensation for their own use which has been paid to their lawyer as a legitimate cost of taking the legal action. So, it stands to reason that that part of the settlement should not be taken into account for the purposes of offsetting. The Australian Greens believe that solicitor-client costs should be subtracted from any settlement for the purposes of offsetting calculations. 


The committee report notes that this is an area worthy of consideration by government, although it is beyond the scope of the current bill. I understand that there has been a recent extensive review of military compensation, that the government is yet to respond to the review and that further legislative changes are likely in due course as a response to this review. The Australian Greens wish to see the issue of solicitor-client costs addressed in the next amendment bill. 


Of more immediate concern is the possibility, raised by the RSL and the VVFA—the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia—that the bill would lead to a situation where the Commonwealth could double dip into veterans' disability pensions and would change the system that has operated satisfactorily up to now. I took these concerns seriously, discussing them in more detail with the RSL and the VVFA after the inquiry was completed. While committed to the principle that offsetting was a sound practice in order to prevent a person being compensated more than once for the same incapacity, I was concerned that veterans should not be worse off, given the assurances that the government had offered that this legislation was not intended to do any more than affirm and clarify the situation as it is applied prior to the Smith case. 


After discussions with a representative of the minister and senior members of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I was pleased that the government had agreed to amend the explanatory memorandum attached to the bill to include a clear statement to the effect that the proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions, including the interaction between the provisions and chapter 19 of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions, fifth edition—also known as GARP V. 


This revised explanatory memorandum reads:


The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision and ensure that the established compensation offsetting practices can continue. 


The expansion to the explanatory memorandum clearly sets out the current practice in the use of GARP where there is an 'accepted' condition and a 'non-accepted' condition and the situation where GARP does not apply. In both cases the memor­andum explicitly states that the current practice will not change under the proposed amendments.


There remained a concern, raised by the RSL and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia in the inquiry and subsequently, about the discretionary nature of offsetting practice as it may be applied by the Repatriation Commission or decision makers into the future, notwithstanding what has happened in the past. Again, the Australian Greens took these concerns seriously and I am pleased that, after further discussions with the minister's representative and the department, the government has agreed to add a further paragraph to the explanatory memorandum as follows:


The Repatriation Commission will be issuing appropriate policy guidance to the Department of Veterans' Affairs staff to ensure offsetting occurs in line with the legislation and longstanding practice as outlined above. Ex-Service Organisations will be consulted during the development of this material. 


These statements, which will be on the public record, affirm the government's position that schedule 2 clarifies but does not change current offsetting arrangements. As such, the concerns of the Australian Greens about schedule 2 have been substantially addressed. In light of the revised explanatory memorandum, the Australian Greens now support schedule 2, meaning the Australian Greens support the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, as proposed by the government, with one addition. 


On behalf of the Australian Greens, I will be co-sponsoring a second reading amendment to the bill with Senator Nick Xenophon requesting that the government undertake an examination of the cost of expanding the class of persons eligible for the repatriation health card for all conditions—known as a gold card—to include a person who is a nuclear test participant as defined in the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006, and that such examination of the costing be completed within three months. Consideration of extending the gold card to British nuclear test participants is a matter of principle for the Australian Greens and has been previously proposed by my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam. Australian veterans were exposed to nuclear testing and radiation between 1952 and 1963 at Maralinga, Emu Field and the Montebello Islands. The Greens believe that, given these people were exposed to ionising radiation and the severe health impacts arising from this, they should be entitled to full comprehensive health care, in particular at gold card standard. Currently, British nuclear test participants do not have an automatic right to these entitlements. It seems to the Australian Greens that, given the recognition of the experiences and service of prisoners of war in schedule 1 of this bill, this is also an opportune time to request the government to investigate the costs of implementing this reform for British nuclear test veterans, who were also acting in service of their country. It would be a just and long overdue reform. I understand that, given the relatively small number of veterans involved, the costs would not be unduly prohibitive but I am happy to have this examined. Thus, the Australian Greens are happy to co-sponsor a second reading amendment.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (10:37):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and note the contribution of Senator Ronaldson and our opposition to schedule 2. The bill gives effect to the following budget measures: a prisoner of war recognition supplement, some proposed compensation offsetting changes, and rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance.


I will touch briefly on schedules 1 and 3 and then come back to schedule 2. On schedule 2, I have a number of issues with both process and principle that I would like to address. With regard to schedule 1, since 2001 lump sum payments of $25,000 have been made to former prisoners of war, particularly prisoners of the Japanese during World War II. That was a well-justified initiative of the Howard government to recognise the conditions and privations that were put upon these people who served their country. In 2003, these were extended to former POWs of the North Koreans during the Korean War and were extended again in 2007 to former POWs interned in Europe during World War II.


The supplement is a $500 per fortnight payment, which I welcome on behalf of the veterans who have been prisoners of war and note that it is tax free and not offset. I believe that is the kind of precedent that we should be setting for all of our support for veterans, whereby we recognise the fact that they have provided a unique service to this country and therefore we should be prepared to provide unique support back to them, even if it is different to the way some other community payments are treated.


Schedule 3 of the bill is a rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance. I notice there will be some veterans who are affected by the wind back of TIA, but all of the veterans organisations that we consulted supported that rationalisation as providing better clarity around those provisions. 


I wish to discuss schedule 2 in a little more detail. I particularly wish to thank members of the RSL who came to the inquiry of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, as well as Legacy and VVF, who provided submissions to help the committee looking at this provision understand how these proposed amendments could affect veterans and their concerns about them. One of the concerns that we raised in particular was about process. The Minister for Veterans Affairs made statements about the extensive consultation that had preceded these amendments and yet in our discussions, particularly with the RSL, it became abun­dantly clear that the consultation process in fact was not particularly broad. When it was boiled down, the specific consultation process with peak bodies such as the Returned and Services League consisted of a budget-eve briefing.


The common definition of consultation, as I understand it and as I think a reasonable person in the community would understand it, is a process whereby you engage with concerned parties, put forward a case, seek their feedback and, as appropriate, amend your position based on their feedback. To have a one-way flow of information on the eve of an announcement such that people have no chance, no opportunity, to influence or put forward their case or identify where the amendments may affect them and call it consultation is a real stretch. I believe that in light of the proposed amendments that the Australian Greens are talking about, where the government is promising to consult with the veterans community, we need to look at what it has done preceding this amendment bill and make sure that it is held to account to have meaningful consultation, which means consultation well ahead of the tabling of any changes that gives a real opportunity for people to consider the amendments and to make appropriate and studied responses to the amendments.


I move to the issue of principle. The RSL raised the point that it is very happy with the way the current offsetting provisions work. It accepts the need for offsetting but it also maintains essentially that if it is not broken then don't try to fix it. DVA promises that these amendments will make no change and will have no impact on veterans, which raises the question—particularly given that the Federal Court indicated that the Smith case was unique and DVA is not able to identify anyone else who falls within the same category—as to why the changes are needed. The RSL in particular highlighted that it believes that the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions, fifth edition, the GARP V, is adequate and addresses the situations where there needs to be some offsetting or pro rata allocation for a combination of injuries that have led to an incapacity.


Coming to the principle of offsetting: as I said, none of the veterans organisations disputed the need for offsetting. If you go back to 1973, when the principle first started to appear in legislation, there was an overlap between the Repatriation Act, the predecessor to VEA, and the Commonwealth Compensation Act 1971, which gave rise to a situation where some people had dual eligibility. It was very clear that there were two Commonwealth schemes under which people could possibly have a dual eligibility. So the concept was that nobody should be compensated twice by the Commonwealth for an injury that was received during their service. I do not think anyone has concerns with that. What has changed, though, is that the understanding that the offsetting should be between two Commonwealth sources of compensation has been extended so that any source of compensation is included We see this in both the explanatory memorandum and the DVA submission. In fact, DVA highlighted that some 20 per cent of the offsetting cases they are dealing with are not from Commonwealth sources but from sources such as civil claims and other sources of compensation. There is a flawed principle in the application of this amend­ment and the way the department has administered offsetting since it was intro­duced in 1973. If the principle was to make sure that the Commonwealth was not liable twice for one injury, that would be fine. But when you extend that to other sources of income then you start abrogating the duty of care that the Commonwealth has to people who have served this nation. It is important to remember that loyalty flows two ways.


If we expect people to enlist in the armed forces and to be prepared to put their lives, their welfare and their health on the line in the interests of this nation then we should be prepared to return that loyalty to them when they return. If they have been injured, including in the course of their duties during non-war related activities, we have an obligation to care for them. The fact that they may have another injury which was caused during a civilian accident and which happens to affect the same incapacity does not remove the obligation of the Commonwealth to care for those people who have rendered that service to their nation.


This concept of the duty of care is longstanding. Going back to the 1500s, Elizabeth I instructed parishes in England that they needed to care for returned servicemen. During the Napoleonic wars the British government came up with the concept of the 'deserving poor', recognising that people who returned and who were incapacitated as a result of their service to their country deserved the care of the people of that country. In contemporary Britain—and I use the example of Britain because of the links to the Westminster system—as recently as the last decade there has been the concept of a covenant between the British people, their government and the military.


This covenant has two facets. One is that if the government is going to deploy service men and women then they have a duty to make sure that those men and women are adequately equipped, trained and supported in the theatre of war. Likewise, there is that obligation post service to provide adequate care. I do not believe that the Australian public expects or would support the principle that the Commonwealth should be able to shift that duty of care to a third party just because a veteran has had civilian compen­sation payable for an injury. If a veteran has signed up to the service and the service has promised to provide for them then that obligation continues. If the veteran has a civilian injury, that is a separate issue. Speaking to people in the service and even to people working within the Repatriation Commission, I have noted their surprise in hearing that offsetting would be allowed for things other than dual Commonwealth entitlement. I believe that is something we need to address as a parliament.


The second facet of this covenant relates to the costs that are considered as part of the offsetting arrangement. Currently if somebody seeks compensation because of an injury then not only does the government take into account the civilian costs—and I dispute that principle—but it does it in a way that I believe is quite unfair. Whilst DVA recognises the party-to-party costs it does not recognise or discount the solicitor-client costs. That means that if a veteran receives, for example, $30,000 but $10,000 of that is taken up with costs to their solicitor then, rather than recognising that they received only $20,000, DVA treats the whole $30,000 as being compensation received by the veteran and offset appropriately or accord­ingly. Again, I do not believe a reasonable member of the public would expect that our government should be short changing veterans who had to incur that cost in order to win that compensation in the first place.


To my mind, the government is not only going against the principle of two-way loyalty—of having a duty of care to veterans—by including that civil payment. It is  doing it in a manner that is unjustifiable. When questioned on this during the inquiry, DVA's position was that the offsetting or discounting of the solicitor-client costs was in line with community norms. Again, I come back to the principle that we are expecting people who sign up to serve in the Australian Defence Force to do things that are not expected of the broader community. If we expect that loyalty from them, we should show that loyalty back to them. We should show them that when things like this come up we are prepared to deviate from the community or civilian norm so that we do not disadvantage the veterans in our community.


The RSL also expressed during this inquiry its concern about the long-term changes of the offsetting provisions. The military, in a very welcome move, has in­creased the amount of rehabilitation available to servicemen. Rather than dis­charging them on a medical basis, there is an increased focus on rehabilitation. The question was raised—and was not particularly satisfactorily answered by the department—as to the long-term conse­quences of the costs of rehabilitation and how they may be offset in future years. I note particularly that the concept of offsetting between Commonwealth funds has now crept, without any legislative guidance, to include any source of compensation. The RSL raised the concern that, over time, the way people apply legislation can change and will often change to the detriment of the veteran.


So a number of new factors are starting to come into this whole space, where we see an increase in money spent by the Com­monwealth on rehabilitation—and very appropriately. The question remained open, at the end of the inquiry, as to whether there was any guarantee that there would not be a detriment in years to come to veterans who had received payment from the Common­wealth for rehabilitation services to enable them to continue their service. So, all in all, we have an amendment here that the depart­ment itself says will have no effect. It cannot identify other people who fall into the case of Mr Smith, whose court case led to this amendment. It is proposing to spend some $2.7 million implementing an amendment it has said will have no practical effect. The ex-service community oppose the amendment and I believe there is no cause for us to support this amendment.


Whilst I commend Senator Wright for her active role and for engaging with the government, it seems to be indicative of the coalition that has now been formed between the government and the Greens in that they were fully informed about the changes to the explanatory memorandum and yet it was only delivered to the opposition shadow spokesperson for this important portfolio when he was 10 minutes into his second reading debate speech. I believe it is a particularly poor effort on behalf of the government to treat their coalition partner differently to the way they would treat the opposition in this important area. It is not the first time they have worked together and, like Senator Ronaldson, I note and want to record my deep disappointment that the Greens, the ALP and Senator Xenophon joined together to defeat the bill that would have addressed the indexation of the DFRDB.


I also note, again coming back to the lack of consultation, that this government has, without consultation, reduced funding for things like veteran advocacy funding, an important part that enables volunteers within our service organisations to work with people who need advocates. The funding provides them with the training and support that enables them to do an important role. If there is one thing I have seen from my involvement in public life it is that government policy is one thing, but it is the people on the ground, those who have the relationships and the connections to encourage and walk with people through the process to connect them to the benefits that are available from policy, who actually make a difference. Policy by itself does very little. No matter how dedicated public servants in the departments are, they do not have the relationships with people in the community. So it is often these voluntary roles that are really the effective connecting and coordinating bodies, and to cut their funding arbitrarily and without consultation is, I believe, a particularly poor step on the part of this government. It shows a great disrespect for our veterans community and the work they do.


We will not be supporting schedule 2 of this amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-09-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:55):  I indicate that I will be supporting the second reading of the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, but I reserve my position in relation to schedule 2 of this amendment. I agree with Senator Ronaldson that it is quite unsatisfactory that an amended explanatory memorandum was provided some 10 minutes into Senator Ronaldson's speech on the second reading in relation to this. I am not ascribing blame. I understand from my brief discussion with Senator Wright from the Australian Greens that there were discussions and negotiations with the government last week. That is why there has been a late development in this, in the sense that an amended explanatory memorandum, in relation to schedule 2 of this bill, has been provided. It is important that that explanatory memorandum be thoroughly scrutinised in the committee stage to ensure that the matters raised by the coalition have been dealt with adequately. I will speak about that shortly in relation to that particular schedule and the potential impact it can have on veterans' entitlements.


It would be appropriate for me to raise at the outset, however, the comments made by both Senators Fawcett and Ronaldson on my position with respect to the indexation of veterans' superannuation entitlements. It was a controversial bill and it is a controversial issue. On that particular coalition private senator's bill, which I voted with the Australian Greens and the government to defeat, I voted with a great deal of caution and reluctance, but I made it very clear at that stage that I thought it was important that there be a re-think of this once the review being undertaken by the defence minister, and by a Senate committee, on the Defence Materiel Organisation hands down its findings. Clearly, the potential fiscal implications of that bill were quite significant—in the hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. That in itself is not a reason not to proceed with legislation, but given the disparity between what the coalition said it would cost and what the government said it would cost and given that this has huge long-term implications in terms of superannuation entitlements, I thought it was appropriate that we find savings from the Defence Materiel Organisation and from Defence generally in order to ensure that there is a long-term sustainable method of superannuation indexation for those who have served.


I also made it clear when I spoke at the time that I thought there would always be an issue with those who have been injured while serving their country and for the family members who have lost a loved one in the service of their country, and that ought to be a priority. I do not think there is any dispute about that in terms of a limited pool of resources for that. That is something I will allude to in the context of this contribution. I want to make that clear to the veterans community, for whom I have enormous respect. I pay tribute to Barry Heffernan, with whom I have worked closely—he works with the Vietnam Veterans Associa­tion in South Australia—for the work we have done together. That just reminded me that this morning I need to return Mr Heffernan's call from the weekend.


But it is important that we put this into perspective. The matter of superannuation entitlements is not over. It should be pointed out, not as a criticism but as a matter of historical record, that the coalition in their time in office did not deal with the issue of indexation. They opposed it. And it is fair to say that there are some in the coalition who were concerned about the budgetary implications of that and did not oppose it in the party room. But the party room has prevailed and is saying that this is the path they are going. I note that it will be coalition policy to take this to the people at the next election, as they are well entitled to do. So the door has not closed in relation to that and I am hoping that in the next few months we will get satisfactory answers in relation to savings from defence materiel and the long-term implications of such a move as proposed by the coalition so that we can have a good outcome for our veterans, not forgetting those who have served our nation, those who have been injured or maimed, who deserve every possible support—and improved support.


That brings me to the bill and a second reading amendment that I will move shortly. This bill contains three specific aspects. Schedule 1 creates the prisoner of war recognition supplement. That is entirely appropriate and I strongly support those measures. I note that Senator Wright, in her contribution, referred to the enormous sacrifice that our prisoners of war have made, the privations they endured. I note that Australian governments of the past have given an additional payment of $2,500 to prisoners of war under Japanese occupation during World War II. That is entirely appropriate. This goes further, in that it provides ongoing benefits to our prisoner of war veterans, and I strongly support that. I cannot imagine what all prisoners of war went through; some in particular went through horrors that cannot be described. I commend the government for going down this path and the coalition for supporting it.


I will talk about schedule 2 in a minute, because it is not a contentious one. It rationalises the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance through the abolition of the temporary incapacity allowance with effect from 20 September 2011. Thereafter, veterans will be entitled to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance. That, too, seems not to be contentious. It is something that the coalition and the government support and it seems to be a necessary technical change to ensure a fairer outcome in relation to the temporary incapacity allowance.


However, it is schedule 3 that is troublesome. It is intended to prevent, the government says, double payments of compensation for the same incapacity. It is an amendment that has come about as a result of a court decision in the matter of Mr Smith. That was a significant decision. It was a decision handed down at the end of 2009. The Commonwealth and David Ronald Smith was a case which looked at the interpretation of section 30C of the VEA in respect of incapacity from an injury. I think Senator Ronaldson well set out the details of that case involving Mr Smith's circumstances and the decision, and I do not propose to restate that.


The question is whether the government has overreacted in moving these amendments in response to the Smith case. The question is whether these amendments will have a number of unintended consequences, whether they will give too much discretion to the department, whether there can be circumstances in which veterans will miss out on just compensation and on their just entitlements as a result of these amendments, whether we are in fact giving too much power to the department and whether we are creating more legal uncertainty. Even though I am a lawyer by training, I would not want these amendments to lead to a lawyers picnic. I think that is something we need to be very mindful of. The committee stage of this bill will be critical in determining whether the addendum to the explanatory memorandum—a result of negotiations between the government and Senator Wright from the Australian Greens, and I commend her for her diligence in relation to this—will do what it is intended to do and whether it will fix the problem that the RSL have quite rightly pointed out is a significant issue for them.


My question to Senator Ronaldson in the course of the committee stage will be, given that he was handed the explanatory memorandum 10 minutes into his speech, which is less than satisfactory, whether he has heard from the RSL at such short notice as to what their attitude is and whether their position is in any way different as a result of this addendum to the explanatory memor­andum. That is a key issue. It may well be that the RSL have not had an opportunity to properly digest this, and you cannot blame them for that given what has occurred. I think it is important that we do not rush this, that we do not ram this bill through. It is important that we hear from key veterans organisations and from the Returned and Services League in particular, given their input into the bill process.


There is another issue, though, that needs to be dealt with. It is appropriate, I believe, in the context of this bill, in the context of veterans' entitlements, to deal with the issue of Maralinga, to deal with the issue of nuclear test veterans in this country and the shameful way they have been treated over many years. In the 2010-11 budget I was pleased with the government's recognition of British veterans' services as non-warlike but hazardous, which meant that those who served between 1952 and 1967 at the British atomic weapons detonation test sites of Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia and the Montebello Islands off the west coast of Western Australia would have greater access to health services. Over 17,000 Australian soldiers and civilians were directly involved in the tests and assessment of the fallout from the nuclear tests across these sites.


These tests were conducted to enable the United Kingdom to develop nuclear fission bombs and, later, nuclear fusion or hydrogen bombs, and were carried out with the full cooperation of the Australian government of the time. Sadly, many of these Australians have gone on to suffer a range of illnesses as a result of dangerous and continued exposure to high levels of radiation, from cancers to genetic diseases inherited by their children. Many of them have died as a direct result of this exposure to radiation. There are only around 2,000 survivors left and they are whittling away on a weekly basis.


In the 2010-11 budget, the government set aside $24.2 million over five years so that participants would have their claims to veterans' entitlements, such as the disability pension and healthcare cards, assessed under the more generous 'reasonable hypothesis' standard of proof under the new expansion to the class of persons eligible. However, my understanding is that very little of these funds have been accessed because the standard of proof remains too high for those suffering illnesses as a result of nuclear test service. In May 2007, Professor Al Rowland from Massey University in New Zealand published a scientific paper on chromosome damage that provided hard evidence of the relationship between exposure to the ionising radiation from atomic blasts and certain cancers and birth defects.


I have been contacted about this issue by many who have been affected for some time. I have spoken with many veterans, including Peter Patterson, a retired canon of the Anglican Church, who contacted me after his applications for a gold card and disability pension were denied. Mr Patterson was commissioned by the Australian Military Forces to serve at Maralinga, South Aust­ralia, for a period of 87 weeks between 1956 and 1963 as an Anglican chaplain. Mr Patterson has told me that he has suffered from prostate and skin cancer during his life as well as from psoriatic arthropathy, a debilitating chronic arthritis condition which causes the inflammation of all joints. It is incredibly painful and debilitating. However, Mr Patterson's claim for a disability pension was rejected on the grounds that the delegate of the Repatriation Commission was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the psoriatic arthropathy was related to service.


I have also spent time with Geoffrey Gates, who was 23 years old when he served at Maralinga with the Air Force. He arrived in the middle of 1961, just after the two major bombs had been tested. During his 12 months at the base, tests on smaller nuclear weapons were continuing as well as assessment of the fallout from the bombs. Geoff has survived a brain tumour and both his son and grandson suffer bipolar disease.


Some veterans have told me about how they did nothing more than turn their backs for mere moments before turning around to watch the aftermath of the explosion. That was the modus operandi back then. That was how it was done. There was a complete lack of duty of care to our nuclear test veterans. Despite this, despite the fact that we know that service men had no protective clothing, despite the fact that they were literally rained on with nuclear fallout, I am aware of applicants who have been knocked back for a gold card because the department has determined they were not exposed to harmful amounts of radiation.


I welcomed last year's budget announce­ment that the participation of British nuclear test participants would be considered as non-warlike hazardous. This was welcomed by the veteran community. But it seems it means almost nothing because what they really need is access to health services and, under the current rules, sadly, virtually nothing has changed.


I have this morning circulated an amendment that will be dealt with by the committee to expand the class of persons eligible to receive the gold card to include British nuclear test participants. The simple fact is that the standard of proof required is too high given nuclear radiation is unable to be so directly proven after the time that has elapsed. But what can be proven is that these veterans were exposed to nuclear radiation in circumstances where there was a lack of care and respect shown for those veterans who were there being exposed to nuclear radiation. How is it that we sent young men and women to participate in nuclear testing, to observe the mushroom cloud and to clean up the fallout and to this day do not recognise the very serious impacts it has had on their health and the health of their children and grandchildren? This amendment will ensure that those British nuclear test participants will automatically receive the gold card. It should be that simple.


However, I am aware that the government and the opposition may not support that and that they are concerned about the potential cost implications. I see the cost implications here as being quite distinct from the cost implications in relation to the issue of superannuation. I indicated just a few moments ago and at other times since that vote in June on the superannuation issue that I am open for there to be reform. I am open for there to be an improvement in the superannuation benefits. But here is a case where people need access to health care. It ought to be a right for those British nuclear test veterans.


I, and also on behalf of Senator Wright move:


At the end of the motion, add ""but that the Government undertake an examination of the cost of expanding the class of persons eligible for the Repatriation Heath Card—For All Conditions (Gold Card) to include a person who is a nuclear test participant (within the meaning of the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006), and that such examination be completed within 3 months"".


This is a second reading amendment to ensure that the government will conduct a cost review within the next three months on expanding the eligibility of the gold card to nuclear test participants. I am hopeful that both the government and the coalition will support that. I am hopeful that that will at least be a way forward for those who are reluctant to support my amendment. At least there will be an acknowledgement and some mechanism to deal with the costing of this so that those remaining British nuclear test veterans can have access to the health care that they deserve.


The contentious part of this bill will be schedule 2. Let us wait and see whether the addendum to the explanatory memorandum deals with those concerns. I have yet to be convinced. I think, again, that the protests of Senator Ronaldson that he received it halfway through his speech in the second reading debate are completely justified. I hope that the government will give time to allow key veterans organisations—in particular, the RSL—to provide commentary about the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, because at this stage I am not convinced that schedule 2 ought to be passed. I am not convinced that the govern­ment's reaction to the Smith decision is a justified one. But I also urge my colleagues to, at the very least, consider opening the way forward for nuclear test veterans in this country to receive the medical care that they so desperately deserve.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:14):  I am very pleased to take part in this debate on the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 and to support any bill that supports our veterans. I am pleased to note that the coalition will be supporting, as I will be, the bill insofar as schedules 1 and 3 are concerned. I am very interested to be following Senator Xenophon in this debate and will be interested to have a look at the amendment he has proposed. I wonder if he has some costings for that amendment. I have to say to Senator Xenophon that it is perhaps too little too late. We really needed your support a few months ago during the indexation debate.




Senator Xenophon:
  It was a different issue, though.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is an issue of support for our veterans community. We desperately needed your support then, Senator Xenophon. You had your own reasons for not supporting us, which was a bit disappointing, but I am pleased to see that you are supporting those parts of this bill which will improve the benefits we give to our veterans.


I will come back the provisions of the bill, but I would just indicate how much our nation owes the veterans—those people who have defended our country in times gone by. What our veterans have done is fresh in my mind from a ceremony I attended yesterday morning in Townsville marking the 60th anniversary of national service. The dawn service yesterday, on the shores of Rowes Bay in Townsville, was a very moving service. It and the parade later in the day were the culmination of a week of activities, during which national serviceman got together in Townsville for this magnificent 60th anniversary celebration, celebrating those who were called up for national service from 1951 onwards and served in the Korean conflict and of course in Vietnam. It was tremendous to see the veterans together, renewing acquaintances, telling lots of stories and remembering friends and colleagues who paid the ultimate sacrifice.


The dawn service in Townsville, which is of course as senators would know classed, or we class it ourselves, as a garrison city. It is the home of Lavarack army barracks, one of the biggest army barracks in Australia, and of course RAAF Base Townsville, formerly Garbutt, which is a very significant RAAF base. A lot of veterans who have served in those services have retired to Townsville, so it is a community, a city, that very much values the work of our servicemen, including our national servicemen. Yesterday's ceremony was really a very moving service. The master of ceremonies was Mr Ben Hobson and the services were led by padre John Emerson. I particularly mention Brigadier Neil Weekes, retired, who has been a tower of strength to veterans over the years since he retired from active service in the army. Brigadier Weekes was a national serviceman himself—he was called up for the Vietnam War—so , many years ago. He later joined the regular army and rose through the ranks to become a brigadier by the time of his retirement. Brigadier Weekes gave a very moving tribute at the dawn service yesterday.


The dawn service was followed by a parade down the new Flinders Street. The veterans who participated were still sprightly—most of them were still in step. It was determined, probably not by them, that some veterans from the Korean conflict should travel in old Willys jeeps and other veteran army vehicles at the head of the parade. Of course, the Townsville regular army band provided the music for the march. The salute was taken by the Deputy Mayor of Townsville, Councillor David Crisafulli, and by Brigadier Stuart Smith, the current CO of Lavarack Barracks. It was a magnificent affair. It brought to mind, as Brigadier Weekes mentioned in his speech, some of the difficulties that some of the veterans of the Vietnam War lived through. The Whitlam government's treatment of veterans on their return from Vietnam is to its eternal shame. As I always say, and as many acknowledge, the decision to go to war in Vietnam was a political decision that a good 40 per cent plus of Australians did not agree with. That was no excuse for taking it out on the veterans when they returned. It was a quite despicable period in Australian history when those troops returning from Vietnam, after fighting for their country at the government's direction, were spat at and condemned and were shunned, even by family.


Brigadier Weekes gave a telling story yesterday. He mentioned that, in the walk of remembrance at Enoggera barracks, where all of those who were killed in Vietnam had a tree planted and a plaque placed, one soldier from Brigadier Weekes' platoon was not named and was not recognised. That is because his family was so totally opposed to the Vietnam War that they refused to put up the money to provide for the plaque and also refused to have their son's body returned to Australia. That is how hard the feelings were and how divided the nation was. I accept that there was a political division, but it does seem very sad and very unfortunate that the death of this soldier—who, as Brigadier Weekes mentioned, was over 21 and made his own decision to go to war in Vietnam to fight for his country—was not recognised through the placement of a plaque. We also heard of a similar incidence in which a family who did not agree with the Vietnam War do not want their son's name recorded on a plaque at the Australian War Memorial. There is space left for his name, but family members still refuse to have his service in Vietnam recognised. Perhaps they have their reasons. It just seems sad that Australians at the time could not distinguish the political element of that war from the magnificent service of veterans, in this case veterans who were national servicemen.


Notwithstanding that, it was a magnificent week in Townsville, with a lot of activity. The dawn service was certainly very moving. I congratulate the Townsville City Council on the naming of the park on the shores of Rowes Bay, where the national service memorial was constructed a few years ago. Yesterday, following the dawn service, the park was dedicated as National Service Park. The unveiling was conducted by Councillor Deanne Bell on behalf of the Townsville City Council, Mr Warren Hegarty on behalf of the National Servicemen's Association and Brigadier Smith, the current CO of Lavarack Barracks, as I have mentioned. 


I congratulate Warren Hegarty and his team on a fabulous week recognising the national service given by so many Australians over so many years. I know Mr Hegarty and his team have been working very hard for years now to ensure that the of 60th anniversary celebration would go off without a hitch, and they certainly succeeded in that. It was a great credit to them and a great recognition of the service of so many young Australian national servicemen to their country over the past 60 years.


I want to comment on the matters that Senator Xenophon raised about Maralinga. I have only recently seen his amendments, and Senator Ronaldson will no doubt deal with those in the Committee of the Whole. If Senator Xenophon is embarking upon this process, perhaps some investigation should be made into disabilities suffered by children of veterans who worked at Maralinga at the time of the atomic and nuclear test research. A constituent in of mine in Townsville has certain deformities which medical advice has suggested to her are the result of radiation that her father would have received during his service at Maralinga, prior to her conception. Clearly the department and governments should look at causal effects and costs and ensure that appropriate consideration is given in this area. I think this area should be looked at a little further. I have raised it at estimates hearings and have written to the minister about it. Perhaps it is something that Senator Xenophon might have considered. I hasten to add that, having only just seen his amendments and having only briefly heard him speak, I have not thought the matter through completely. I am sure that Senator Ronaldson, on behalf of the coalition, will have looked at this a bit more closely and will be able to indicate the areas in which the coalition perhaps does not agree. Clearly there is a need to look at this matter to see whether any harm may have been caused to Australian servicemen and perhaps their offspring as a result of service performed at Maralinga. 


I am pleased that the coalition will be supporting schedules 1 and 3 of the bill before us. I will not go into those schedules in any great detail as I am conscious that Senator Ronaldson and other coalition speakers have done so. Suffice to say that, in relation to schedule 2, I am persuaded by the evidence given by Rear Admiral Doolan, head of the RSL, during the Senate inquiry into this bill, where he said: 


… the RSL view is that it is much better to have the legislation being the basis for all these matters than to have it by regulation.


 I agree with that sentiment. I am concerned that, under the amendments proposed to schedule 2 to clarify the operation of the act, there will still be a requirement for guidelines by regulation or by departmental decree to ensure that they are properly applied. I thought I heard the Greens say in their contribution to this debate that they were now satisfied, because of an explana­tory memorandum, that all would be well. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, explana­tory memorandums can have some influence on the way legislation and regulation are administered. It would seem to me that if the parliament's intention can be written into an explanatory memorandum it can just as easily be included in the legislation. So, I am concerned about schedule 2. Senator Ronaldson has indicated that he will be moving an amendment to omit schedule 2, and the coalition is doing that in the best interests of our veteran and ex-service community. I certainly urge the Senate to support that amendment.


In conclusion, I congratulate our veterans for all the work they have done over their lifetime. We are certainly as a nation indebted to them. I am particularly grateful that the 60th anniversary celebrations of national service held in Townsville yesterday yet again highlighted for the Australian community the work done by all of those who have served in the defence of our nation.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:31):  I am pleased to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. At the outset I must declare an interest as a member, however peripherally, of the defence family. Our youngest son was an active service officer with the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, in both Iraq as a lieutenant and in Afghanistan as a captain. So, I have both a personal and a professional interest in this issue. I join my colleagues in supporting these POW supplementary support measures. My only regret is that this was not put into place earlier by either side of the parliament. I fully support it and I am sure the wider Australian community do. I also support schedule 3, relating to the loss of earnings allowance. This is logical and it is what we expect the veteran community would want to see, and I have no doubt it is what the wider Australian community would want us to pass. 


In contrast, I join in the opposition to schedule 2 of the bill. It proposes that the power of the parliament to determine the manner in which compensation payments are offset against each other should be removed. In other words, as it has been explained to me, in the event that an ex-serviceman has been wounded and is being treated for some matter relating to their defence service and is then the subject, regrettably, of a further injury—for example a motor vehicle accident which occurred well after their defence experience—then there would be an offsetting of the compensation to that person one against the other, the non-defence related activity against the defence related activity. I find this to be unacceptable; I find it to be parsimonious. I cannot understand why we are even debating it. We are merely the representatives of the wider Australia community. We are elected by the com­munity to be here to represent the people. The first question I would put to my colleagues on the other side is simply this: do the people want the parliament's power to deal with this issue of offset to be gagged; do they expect this to be devolved to some group of people other than the parliament, duly elected? My second question is: do the people of Australia want there to be a further limiting of veterans entitlements in this type of incident? If a person has been wounded in their service to the nation then my expec­tation is that the wider community would say let the community meet the costs associated with rehabilitating that person so that they can come back to a normal life and contri­bute to their family, to the community and to their own wellbeing without there being, hanging over their heads, some concern that if subsequently they are injured in some other unrelated circumstance there is going to be some form of offsetting to limit their entitlements. I find this to be unacceptable and I would bet a pound to a penny that if we were to poll the wider Australian community they would too.


In the legislation proposed by my colleague Senator Ronaldson only in recent weeks we anticipated the indexation of veterans entitlements. Again, if we were to poll the wider Australia community, people would not only have wanted that to happen but also would have shaken their heads and asked why it was ever the case that there was this disparity. It is not to the credit of this chamber that the ALP, the Greens and Senator Xenophon failed to support Senator Ronaldson in that instance. For those who do not understand the implications of that indexation, it is my understanding that the matter went back to 1997 when the age pension and the defence pension were similar, except that from that moment going forward the indexation for the age pension was a combination or a factor of both the CPI and the movement in wages. I see that as being entirely reasonable. Regrettably, defence pensions have not undergone the same level of indexation, having only been linked—and they remain only linked—to CPI. Wage movements over time in this country—certainly since 1997, given the economic growth we have enjoyed in that time—have caused the age pension to move upwards at a greater rate than the defence pension, so there is now a disparity between the two. Senator Ronaldson's bill aimed to redress that imbalance so that our defence veterans would enjoy the same level of benefit—nothing better; no improvement; nothing beyond—as our age pensioners. Surely that is reasonable given the service and sacrifice that they offered.


Veterans and ex-servicepeople have asked me—and rhetorically I ask it here on their behalf—the question, 'What have our service personnel done to incur the wrath of those on the other side and their failure to support that legislation?' They say to me: 'Where did we go wrong? Were we not diligent enough in the service we gave? Were we not competent enough in the service we delivered? Why are we being so harshly dealt with?' I cannot answer those questions.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  Senator Xenophon is correct—why did we not address it when we were in government? Our failure to do so, however, is not an excuse to have failed to address that question in 2011. When we speak to everybody in the Australian community—younger people, older people, people across the board—what do they tell us they expect? When we tell them that our veterans are second-class citizens when it comes to the financial support they get from this nation, most people say to me, 'Go and fix it up.' And we have failed to do so. 


My third question, before I move on to the issue of younger veterans, relates to why the coalition did not receive the addendum to the explanatory memorandum until Senator Ronaldson was well into his speech. I think it should be explained why and how the Greens did have that access—and I compliment Senator Wright on her contribution. It is disappointing, if we are going to maturely debate an issue of such importance to the veteran community and of such interest to the wider community, that everybody has not had equal access to the documentation. I will return to this—I have had the opportunity presented to me by chamber staff to actually briefly review the addendum and I wish to return to it.


I was interested to hear the comments of Senator Macdonald with regard to the activities yesterday in Townsville. On Tuesday of last week, I was in the small town of Bruce Rock in the wheat belt of WA. It was absolutely amazing. There are, I think, a thousand people in the shire, with probably 200 to 300 living in the town. Right there in the main street was the most wonderful memorial to the fuzzy wuzzies. That memorial was dedicated last year—one of the original fuzzy wuzzies actually came down, with his son, to Australia and to Bruce Rock for the purpose.


Two Vietnam veterans decided, 11 years ago, that there should be some activity recognising the contribution of the Vietnam vets and the role they played, because we all know that the manner in which they were treated when they returned from Vietnam will, regrettably, forever be a stain on the history of this country. From that humble beginning 11 years ago, there will, when they meet on the first weekend of November this year, be 3,000 to 4,000 Vietnam veterans who will, with their families, descend on Bruce Rock. Last year there were 3,000 and this year they are expecting more. Some 400 are coming from Far North Queensland. It has become an annual event for them all. The shire president explained to me, with a high degree of pride, the activity that goes on, the contribution it makes to that small com­munity and the absolute overwhelming sense of goodwill that exists within those people.


Regrettably, should this legislation go through with the schedule that we are opposing, I am sure one of the questions discussed on that occasion will be the unfairness visited upon that group by the parliament through our inability to deal with this offsetting question. The event is an expression of the enormous interest in, the goodwill towards and the need for that community of military veterans to be able to come together to share values, to share stories and to encourage each other for the future. The last of the Korean War veterans also join them and it is my hope that, over time, should this activity continue in Bruce Rock, it will become a focal point.


There is a group called the Mad Galahs—military veterans, usually non-commissioned officers and lower ranks. They are fairly strident in their views—they express them, as their name suggests, without fear or favour—and they have that long-held healthy Australian disrespect, at least overtly, for senior officers. I can assure you again that they voiced to me very loudly their disappointment about the recent defeat of Senator Ronaldson's bill.


Over the last four to five years I have had the experience of meeting with and becoming friendly with many of our younger returned soldiers who have left military service. I have to say to you that they are, in my view, the best of the best. I have met young Army, Navy and Air Force officers. I speak to them about what they are doing now, what they were doing in military service and I say, 'Did you really want to leave the service?' In so many instances—and I dare say in my own son's—deep down, they did not want to leave the service. 


I have said to them, 'Is it because of the numbers of tours of duty you were required to undertake in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere?' They are emphatic when they say, 'No, it's not that.' And so I have said to them, 'Is it because of inferior or inadequate standards of management in your fields of combat?' and the answer has been no. I have said to them, 'Is it because we haven't supplied you with adequate equipment?' and they have said no in the main, even though in some instances they have had to buy their own, which I find to be reprehensible. Nevertheless, on the whole they feel they have been well handled on their tours of duty in the field. So I have said to them, 'Is it because of the attitudes of the wider Australian community towards you?' As I said earlier, if there is one thing that has happened as a result of the history beyond Vietnam, it is that the Australian community now well understands the differential between our military personnel and the role they play and those who send them there—as should have been the case with Vietnam. We should have always thanked and glorified the Vietnam veterans and, if there were blame or criticism to be apportioned, it should have been sheeted home to the political leaders who sent them. The same occurs today.


I am delighted to record and report—and observe, as you all are—the fact that our returned servicepeople are well and truly adulated by the Australian community. So it is not that which has caused so much wastage of the best of our best of the young military personnel. I will tell you what it is. Almost without exception, it is what they perceive to be the indifference within the Defence bureaucracy and the approach of government to their welfare. These are questions I asked the previous Chief of the Defence Force. We engaged on this quite often. I remain far from satisfied as to the management, the treatment, the welfare and the concern of our personnel as they return. I could give you examples relating to many people. These young people are highly employable in the civilian world, at salaries vastly beyond what they were getting in service—and that was not a reason for them to want to leave—but it is the perceived indifference and the perceived attitude of the Defence bureaucracy which simply causes them to say, 'Things have to be better outside.' As I said, my own son was very concerned about the bureaucracy and the inefficiency. As I said to him, 'The only way you are going to find that it is no different outside the military world is to get yourself into the corporate world,' and he has certainly found that to be the case.


I conclude my comments by going back to this addendum, which was received some minutes after this debate commenced. As Senator Ian Macdonald has indicated, it now suggests a move from legislation to regulation and departmental decree, but it goes exactly to the point I was just making about the Defence bureaucracy. The document says:


... will not change current operations of the compensation offsetting provisions. The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision—


the Smith decision is not explained. It goes on to say that where:


... interaction between the compensation offsetting provisions and Chapter 19 ... and the ... Rates of Veterans’ Pensions, 5th Edition (GARP V), ... will not change under the proposed amendments.


And it says:


Under current practice, if medical opinion is able to determine the relative contribution of an accepted condition and a non-accepted condition to the impairment—


then chapter 19 applies and on it goes. Then it says:


If medical opinion is not able to apportion the relative contribution of an accepted condition and a non-accepted condition—


then the chapter cannot apply. This is exactly the gobbledegook translated down to those in the ranks where they turn around and say, 'This is the bureaucracy we don't need.' I would think that if a person who is likely to be the subject of this legislation were to get hold of this document and say to themselves, 'What does it mean, what does it mean for me and what are the implications for me and ultimately for my family?' they would see that this document stands alone as an illustration of the points I make.


In conclusion, I certainly concur with the support of POW prisoner supplementary payments. I support the schedule 3 loss of earnings allowance and ask the government to reconsider schedule 2 because as it stands it would not receive the support of the Australian community.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (11:50):  by leave—I table an addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. The Veterans' Entitlements Amend­ment Bill gives effect to a number of 2011 budget measures. The first measure creates a new prisoner of war recognition supplement payable at $500 per fortnight to former prisoners of war. The new supplement will be tax free and will not be treated as income for the purposes of the income test. The supplement is payable in recognition of the hardships these men and women endured during captivity. It is expected that approximately 900 former prisoners of war will benefit from the new supplement, which will be payable from 20 September 2011.


The second measure clarifies and affirms the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy which applies to disability pensions and has been in place since 1973. Compensation offsetting is applied to disability pensions to ensure that a person does not receive compensation under the Veterans' Entitlement Act and compensation from another source for the same incapacity. The amendments to the compensation offsetting provisions are being made in response to a decision of the full Federal Court, which highlighted the need to clarify and affirm this aspect of the legislation. I might, as an aside, note that that decision of the full Federal Court is referred to in the addendum as 'the Smith decision'. 


The amendments make it clear that compensation offsetting is to apply where a disability pension and compensation from another source are payable in respect of the same incapacity and do not require that the incapacity result from the same injury or disease. As the amendments are clarifying and affirming the legislation, they will not result in any change to the compensation offsetting practices currently being applied. No current disability pensioner's rate of disability pension will change because of the amendments in schedule 2 of the bill.


The final measure will rationalise payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. The bill will remove the current overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence caused injuries or diseases, and it allows the government to better target assistance to those in need. Under this measure the payment of the temporary incapacity allowance will cease from 20 September 2011, with future payments being better targeted through the payment of the loss of earnings allowance. The cessation of the temporary incapacity allowance will have no impact on a veteran's or member's rate of disability pension. From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members receiving treatment or recuperating from war or defence caused injuries or diseases will be assessed consistently against the criteria for loss of earnings allowance.


These measures continue the government's commitment to targeting and enhancing services and support to our veterans and members and their families. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

  Subject to what the co-mover of this second reading amendment, Senator Wright, says on this, of course procedurally we cannot have a division before 12.30. If it is on the record that both the government and the opposition oppose this amendment then that would obviate the need for a division in these circumstances—if that would assist the chamber to proceed with the bill. As long as it is clear who has voted for what, I think that would be a fair outcome. I invite the government and the opposition to set out their reasons for opposing the amendment. That is not strictly necessary, but that way we can move on with this piece of legislation.

Leave granted. 




Senator FEENEY:
   I thank the Senate. In setting out the reasons for the government's opposition to Senator Xenophon's proposed amendment, first let me point out that in the 2010-11 budget the government provided a $24 million com­pensation package to British nuclear test participants under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This package ensured that Australian Defence Force participants were provided appropriate compensation and health coverage for any condition related to their service in the testing program. British nuclear test participants are also eligible to receive non-liability health care for all cancers. British nuclear test participants are able to access a gold card. It is provided where the veteran is at or above 100 per cent of the general rate of disability pension. 


The gold card is only automatically granted to veterans with qualifying service, and that of course means warlike service, and over the age of 70 in recognition of the hazards of being in war and incurring danger from hostile forces of the enemy. The automatic granting of a gold card to the group proposed by Senator Xenophon would thus place British nuclear test participants in a more beneficial position than other veterans. Any automatic extension of the gold card to this group would result in significant additional costs that have not been considered by the government. That is the basis upon which the amendment is opposed and that is the basis upon which the government makes the contention that it has ensured that British nuclear test participants receive adequate and proper compensation and assistance.

The 
answer

—



QUESTION FROM SENATOR XENOPHON ON 25 AUGUST 2011.



Question: Minister, following on from the answers you provided yesterday in relation to the importation of New Zealand apples, did the Government receive any advice as to the withdrawal of concessions New Zealand would be entitled to impose in the event that import permits were not able to be issued by 17 August 2011? Who was the advice from and what was the nature of the advice?



Answer: The WTO Trade Law Branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided regular legal advice to the government on New Zealand's rights under the WTO Agreement in the event that Australia failed to comply with the outcome in the apples dispute. This included advice on New Zealand's right to suspend concessions in respect of Australian exports to New Zealand.


Under WTO rules, New Zealand would initially need to target its retaliatory measures at exports of Australian goods (rather than services). New Zealand would have the discretion to suspend concessions on any product it wished, up to the value of the authorised retaliation. New Zealand is an important export market of Australia. In 2010, Australia's total goods-exports to New Zealand were worth $8 billion across 1153 product categories.



Question: Minister, what steps would New Zealand be required to take to withdraw any concessions?



Answer: Under WTO rules, New Zealand would need to seek authorisation from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body under Article 22 on the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes to suspend concessions.



Question: Doesn't that answer assume that what WTO agreements do is to authorise the imposition of sanctions? Don't they just authorise that concessions no longer apply?



Answer: Article 22 authorises the suspension of concessions in certain cases. The suspension of concessions is often referred to as the imposition of retaliation or sanctions.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Dregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senator Cormann, the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate (Senator Joyce) and Senator Fifield today relating to Future Fund assets.


Whatever way you look at it, the government has been caught out using the proceeds from the expected sale of Future Fund assets to help it create the illusion of an early surplus. The assets from the Future Fund are of course supposed to be quarantined from the government. The government is not supposed to touch those assets, but what is very clear from information provided by the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, David Tune, is that the government expects to raise revenue from the expected sale of Future Fund assets and that those proceeds will hit the budget bottom line. Those proceeds will become part of the government's underlying cash balance in 2012-13, which the government wants us to believe will be about $3.5 billion.


Today we had a lot of political rhetoric from the minister. We did not have a lot of facts, we did not have a lot of actual information and we did not have a lot of answers to the questions asked, so let me recap where things are at. A spokeswoman for the Minister for Finance Penny Wong was quoted in the Australian today as saying:


… more than $250 million worth of assets were due to be withdrawn from the Future Fund in the 2012-13 financial year, despite the fund having been created, by Peter Costello, under the condition it was not to be touched before 2020.


These are not the opposition's words; these are the words of the minister's own spokeswoman, as reported by the Australian. A spokesman for the Future Fund is also quoted in the story, confirming:


… the anticipated withdrawal was known to the fund and that this was the first time a withdrawal had been included in the budget bottom line.


This of course is a government that is always desperate for more cash. It is a government that has deserted for successive deficit budgets. It is a government that inherited a position of no government net debt. It is a government that is very quickly running up to $107 billion worth of government net debt and is likely to exceed that, given the fiscal impact of recent decisions, including the $4.2 billion hit on the budget bottom line from the carbon tax and various hits from decisions in Western Australia and New South Wales to increase royalties.


Today, the minister refused to confirm the figure that was given by her own spokes­woman. Her spokeswoman said that the government planned to withdraw—the spokeswoman's words—$250 million worth of assets from the Future Fund. I ask the minister: how much of the $4.937 billion in estimated proceeds from the sale of non-financial assets in 2012-13 is expected to come from the sale of assets of the Future Fund. Given that the government has put the overall figure into the budget, the minister, if she were prepared to be open and transparent, should have provided the Senate with that figure. It is a very straightforward question. The Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation let the cat out of the bag. He said that that figure of $4.937 billion includes revenue from the expected sale of Future Fund assets. The Senate deserves to know how much the government expects to collect from that. The minister also confirmed that, yes, the proceeds from that sale of Future Fund assets will hit the budget bottom line. It is part of the government's claim of an early surplus; it does form part of the government's underlying cash balance of $3.5 billion. The minister was not prepared to say when that money would leave the government's budget bottom line and when it would exclusively be held as an asset in the Future Fund.


The Future Fund has sold assets before. The Future Fund sold down its shareholding in Telstra, for example. None of those proceeds and none of those sales have ever made it into the budget bottom line. Sales of assets and purchases of assets inside the Future Fund should not hit the budget bottom line, but of course this is just, at best, another accounting trick by a government that is so desperate to claim an early surplus that it is prepared— (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:06):  The government is not withdrawing anything from the Future Fund. That is fundamentally incorrect. It is another false assertion by those on the other side, another part of the scare campaign that they have run constantly since they have been in opposition. They are trying to scare the people of Australia so that they will vote for them at the next election. People are not conned by that at all. As the minister said in question time, she has put out a press release asserting the fact, but those on the other side once again just do not want to know that, just do not want to hear it. As we heard earlier, it appears that the only people that are not happy with the economy in Australia are those on the other side. They do not want to know any of the good news; they just want to talk down the economy all the time. When you come from a party where you have got a $70 billion black hole, it just amazes me that you continue to talk down the economy. 


The government has a very sound fiscal strategy, unlike those on the other side. They cannot even work out how to fix up their big black hole. Instead of making false claims about the budget they would do better to focus—especially Mr Robb and Mr Hockey, who cannot even get their facts aligned—on how they are going to deal with their big black hole. Ever since they have been in opposition they have been talking down the economy and doing nothing—all they have done is oppose, oppose, oppose. They have to realise that there are 140,000 more Australians in jobs than there were a year ago. That is a very important issue. The people of Australia understand that that is an important issue. I also think Mr Hockey should stop trying to avoid scrutiny by undermining the role of the Parliamentary Budget Office. If the coalition were serious about budget accountability and transparency they would support the recommended model for the Parliamentary Budget Office and the government's legislation. But, no, they cannot do that. They have to come out with a brand-new scare campaign. Every week there is a new scare campaign. The latest is that the government is going to sell off Future Fund money. As I have said, that is untrue. It is just another scare campaign from those on the other side. 


The Gillard government has a sound fiscal strategy. We understand the importance of having that sound fiscal strategy and making sure that the government and the country are able to move forward. We understood that when we went into deficit to put stimulus into the economy, which kept over 200,000 Australian jobs and kept people off the dole queues. We made it clear at that time that we would return the budget to surplus, and that is what we continue to do. We laid down a budget earlier this year that has us coming back to surplus in 2012-13, and as a government we are determined to deliver on that. 


As I said, those opposite can run their scare campaigns. Today it is one thing, tomorrow it is another thing and last week it was something else. I do not think a week has gone by where they have not come up with some new scare campaign to try to make themselves look more impressive. The $70 billion black hole is the thing that people out there in voter land will remember. Those opposite cannot come up with a way to deal with it. They would rather cut pensions to Australian pensioners for two years or cut Medicare than deal with the reality of their $70 billion black hole. At the time of  the previous election, if my memory serves me correctly, they had an $11 billion black hole that I do not think they dealt with appropriately either. 


Our economy is in a very strong position. It is almost stronger than that of any other advanced economy. We are weathering the global financial uncertainty, as we did the previous financial crisis. We are building productivity, we are investing in skills and education, we are investing in trade training centres and we are investing in the National Broadband Network. Those opposite did nothing for 12 years. They claim that they had this great surplus when they lost government, but they did nothing. They did not spend on infrastructure. They did not spend any money for the future of the people of Australia. They do not care what happens in future to the children of today. They just do not care. (Time expired)

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:11):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy President—you are not acting anymore; you are the real thing! It is an interesting day. They have got the big guns out today defending Senator Wong. I would have to say that Minister Wong had a very bad day in the office today. Today was a shocker for Minister Wong. Let's start with her actual statement, which was: 


Any funds raised from the sale of nonfinancial assets will be kept by the Future Fund—not by the government. 


She said:


The government is not making withdrawals from the Future Fund. The Future Fund is simply making a small change to the types of assets it holds.


See, $250 million—a quarter of a billion dollars—is just small change. Hell, if you dropped it at the pub on a Friday night you would not bother picking it up!


Let us go through statement No. 9 of the budget financial statements. This is helping the finance minister out with finance. It has been ticked off; it is part of her portfolio. There we see it: net cash flows from investments in nonfinancial assets are $3.77 billion. The trouble is that that actually becomes part of the bottom line, where they end up with a $3.498 billion surplus—the magical $3.5 billion surplus. In two pages, quod erat demonstrandum—QED—it is all worked out for you. It does actually affect the bottom line. If the minister had read two pages she would have made a more concise, articulate and correct statement than the one she actually made. But the fun did not stop there. It just kept going. In answer to a question from Senator Cormann, my good friend and colleague, Mr Tune said, 'The estimates for the sale of nonfinancial assets'—we have just been through that—'include the expected sale of assets from the Future Fund.' Boom, boom! Surely not. Senator Wong said it was not so. She came into the parliament today and said it. Then we had to quiz her. Maybe she just missed it. We should quiz her on a few of the fundamental facts that any decent financial officer should know—fundamental facts that should be at your fingertips, like, for instance, how much you have got in the Future Fund. The answer to this one was a clanger. She said, 'I think we have got more than $70 billion.' She could have said, 'I think we've got more than a dollar,' or 'I think we've got more than $38.56.' But, no, she thinks we have more than $70 billion. It is just a little bit more, actually—it is $75.15 billion, if my memory serves me correctly. But who cares? What is $5 billion between friends these days? These are the most fundamental things that she cannot handle.


It gets worse. We asked how much they have contributed—not the capitalisation of interest but how much of a contribution to the Future Fund this economic luminary and her forebears have presided over. Her answer? She will take that one on notice. She did not know how much she had contributed to her own Future Fund. We were having a bit of a laugh before because they were saying two was the number. What is so interesting about the answer to this is that it is not a number. It is not a number because it is nought—it is zero. It is ex nihilo—it is nothing. They have contributed nothing to the Future Fund. But she could not remember that she had not contributed anything, so she took it on notice. No doubt we will get an answer back later on telling us it is nothing.


Where does this leave our nation? It leaves our nation in the hands of people who are completely and utterly out of their depth. If it was any sadder you would cry. This is the person who is responsible for financial affairs—she is the finance minister. But they do not have a clue. So they run out of the chamber and put Senator Bilyk out there to defend them after questions on notice. I would have stayed in the chamber myself.


To help out Minister Wong with a few of the figures: the government has $133 billion of liabilities to public servants. If they all retired and they all wanted their money the government would have to pay out $133 billion. But it does not have $133 billion. It has the Future Fund with $75 billion in it but if you start using that money to pay off your surplus then you are using their savings to fix up your stuff-up.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:17):  The claims by Senators Cormann and Joyce and those opposite relating to the Future Fund are completely misleading and incorrect. They also demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of the operation of the Future Fund and indeed the architecture for the management of the fund that was put in place by those opposite when they were in government. Claims of accounting tricks and withdrawals from the fund are completely misleading. Those opposite fail to under­stand risk in a difficult economic environ­ment. They fail to understand a change in investment mix to reduce risk in a difficult economic environment. They fail to understand that the timing of the sale of assets related to the Future Fund is an issue for the Future Fund—a Future Fund with an independent board of guardians, amongst whom is none other than the former Treasurer, Peter Costello. They fail to understand just how this fund works. 


This also demonstrates a complete lack of credibility when it comes to economic management. This is from those opposite, who went to the last election with a suite of policies that, when costed, came up $11 billion short. Even their own auditors would not give an unqualified appraisal of their accounting for their election promises. Those opposite criticised the stimulus package that this government put in place to deal with the financial crisis and to support communities and jobs. What has happened in the wake of that? We have one of the strongest economies in the OECD and a job rate that is the envy of the United States and the United Kingdom, with an unemployment rate half the rate in those countries. We did an excellent job of managing the economy during the global financial crisis. 


More recently, a leak from the opposition party room has indicated that they are planning $70 billion worth of cuts to services in the lead-up to the next election. They plan to go to the election with a policy of restoring a surplus but they have failed to come clean with the Australian people about how they are going to achieve this surplus. How are they going to achieve this surplus without the revenue from the minerals resource rent tax? How are they going to achieve this surplus without the revenue from carbon pricing? There is one way they are going to achieve this perceived surplus, and that is through cuts to services—$70 billion worth.


They will not come clean with people in their individual electorates. I have asked the member for Calare, John Cobb, to come clean with the people of Calare about what services are going to be cut in that electorate. Is Medicare on the line? Is the childcare rebate on the line? Are increases to pensions on the line? Is a reduction in the company tax rate on the line? What services are those opposite going to cut from the budget to achieve their so-called surplus?


When it comes to carbon pricing, the advice of all the experts throughout the world on what is one of the most pressing environmental and economic issues facing our nation is that an emissions trading scheme is the most cost-effective way of tackling climate change.




Senator Cormann:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to the motion before the chair, which is that the Senate take note of the answers by Senator Wong to questions asked by Senators Cormann, Fifield and Joyce. Senator Thistlethwaite is not speaking to the motion before the chair and I ask that he return to it.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Thistlethwaite has been directly relevant for the majority of his contribution. We have always allowed a little latitude in take notes.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  My points go to the issue of economic management. Economic management is at the core of the claims made by those opposite. When it comes to the issue of pricing carbon, we have seen from David Cameron, the Conservative leader in the United Kingdom, that we have got it right. We have got it right on this important economic issue. When it comes to the claims made by the opposition in respect of the Future Fund, this morning and in the parliament, they are simply wrong. They fail to understand the architecture of the fund, the independence of those who manage that fund and the need for the fund to make decisions to reduce risk on behalf of the people of Australia, whose funds are invested in the scheme.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:22):  You might indulge us a little if we are a bit suspicious of this government when we receive advice, as we did, from answers to questions on notice—forensic questioning by Senator Cormann—that the estimates for the sale of non-financial assets include expected sale of assets from the Future Fund. The reason for our suspicion is this. You might recall there used to be something called the Higher Education Endowment Fund—gone. There used to be a thing called the Health and Medical Infrastructure Fund—gone. There used to be a thing called the telecommunications fund—gone. That is billions of dollars set aside for investment in community assets and infrastructure gone, squandered by this government. They basically did a smash-and-grab raid on those three funds.


Those of us on this side of the chamber actually take the squandering of those assets a little bit to heart, because when we came to office we inherited a $96 billion debt. People forget this, but it actually took us 10 years to pay down every cent of that debt. It was not until the middle of 2006 that all of that debt was gone. We balanced the budget, we repaid all the debt and we cut taxes. But in that situation, when you find you have a surplus, it is important to lock away Aust­ralia's good economic fortune into a fund. We set up the Future Fund. It is a sovereign wealth fund. I hear all this talk about how we should set up a sovereign wealth fund in Australia. We have one! It is called the Future Fund and you can only put money in it if you are running budget surpluses.


We have heard, we have seen and we have read that this government, with their sticky fingers, want to take $250 million away from the Future Fund. That is galling in itself, but, when you think that this government have not put a single dollar into the Future Fund, it is even more galling. We have heard the excuse from Senator Wong—in fact she could not even bring herself to admit that they had not put a dollar into the Future Fund—and it was, 'Well, you know, the global financial crisis; it is really tough.' But we have been hearing from this government how Australia is the envy of the world, how our economy is booming and how great we are doing. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say the economy is booming but that we cannot run a budget surplus and we cannot find money to put into the Future Fund. You cannot have it both ways.


All I can think is that this government are just really unlucky. They were unlucky in 2008-09—unlucky budget deficit. They were unlucky in 2009-10—budget deficit. They were unlucky in 2010-11—budget deficit. They are going to be unlucky in 2011-12 as well—budget deficit. They are the unluckiest mob that you will ever come across. If you are in a lightning storm, do not stand next to any of these guys—you are not going to see the day out.


There was a salutary warning from a very insightful gentleman, the Hon. Peter Costello, in his 2007-08 budget speech. He made this observation:


If you rob capital or earnings from the Future Fund, taxpayers will have to make up the difference.


I think he foresaw a day when we might have a government like this in place. It is also worth recounting the very reason for setting up this fund in the first place. Mr Costello said at the time:


The Fund is established and is well on its way. It will help pay entitlements to our soldiers, navy and air force personnel which must be honoured after they have retired and finished their service to the nation. The Fund operates as an accumulation fund and reinvests its earnings. It aims to meet its target by 2020.


We want to see that target met by 2020. We expect this government to honour that commitment. We expect this government to defend the fund as much as we did.


There is an important additional thing that the government must do in defending the fund—the term of the current chair of the Future Fund Board of Guardians, Mr David Murray, expires in six months and the government needs to outline the process of consultation the government will undertake when appointing a successor to Mr Murray to ensure the ongoing independence and integrity of that fund. It needs to recommit to protect this fund and it needs to make sure that the next chairman is someone who will stand up for it. (Time expired)

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:36):  I think all of us in this place can recall a pretty significant day in the diary of this parliament, 24 June 2010, when Julia Gillard, the now Prime Minister, and Labor deposed for the first time a first-term Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. They said that the government had lost its way. Obviously, this was Kevin 07's fault. It was a case of: 'We'll just cut his throat and slide him aside, and we're going to get back on with the job of fixing this up.' 




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Scullion, you must refer to members of the other house by their correct title or their correct name and salutation. 




Senator SCULLION:
  I withdraw. There could be no more visible example of how badly they had failed at that stage than their border control and protection policies. When Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party won government in August 2007, I think people all around the world would have looked to the policies that the coalition government had put in place. You could say from a comparison of those policies with those of any other government that they had been a very, very effective suite of policies. 


I came to this place in 2002, and I recall that in that financial year 3,039 people had arrived in 19 boats. There were 54 the year before and 75 the year before that. Certainly, it was a very serious circumstance and we needed to address it—and we did. We introduced temporary protection visas. We made sure that there was offshore processing. There were a number of regional agreements to interfere with the process of people smuggling, and they worked. This is not just on my say so. The statistic that shows this most starkly is when we went from 3,039 people in 19 boats to zero people and zero boats. I think the reason for the spotlight on us from international communities was that they were working very hard against criminal organisations engaged in people trafficking and they were looking very carefully at Australia as an example of how well they had done. 


Of course, when the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, took over as Prime Minister of Australia, Labor simply thought the problem was solved and that they would get straight on with the job and say: 'Don't worry about those policies. After all, our motive is not that we need to protect Australia and the people who are refugees around the world from the pressures of international people smuggling. What we want to do is to make sure that we have some electoral benefit. It is not a problem for us. Things are solved in that area. The process of preferential voting means that we need to toss up whether we think about this nation's interests or whether we think about the electoral interests of the Labor Party.' Here comes the nub: the Greens and the Independents were talking about having a more compassionate approach. All the wisdom around the world said: 'No, don't do that. This is a really good set of policies that protects people, that looks after people and that ensures they don't make this very, very ugly voyage to Australia.' Immediately the policies that were in the interest of the Australian Labor Party were implemented, the border protection that was in the interest of this nation was destroyed. 


For those in this chamber and for those outside it who are listening, this is always the problem with Labor. It goes to motive. Why do you do a thing? Why do you have a policy? Is it in the interests of the Labor Party or is it in our national interest? I think more and more Australians are starting to put the ruler of motive across the policies that we see rolled out by those opposite.


So the trade was back on. I do not know how many times I have sat in here and heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, say: 'No, no, it's not our policies that have changed it. Something odd is happening in Europe. Something odd is happening somewhere else.' Perhaps something is happening with the climate—I am not sure, because there have been a whole range of excuses. International policy makers everywhere have clearly understood that if you change this policy the consequence is a major rush of vessels. We saw that from the time Labor took over in 2007. We have gone from three boats straight up to 1,033 people in 22 boats, to 5,604 people in 117 boats and, in 2010-11, 4,949 people in 89 boats. That is a staggering endorsement of those people who said, 'When you change this policy, there will be a consequence.' Because those opposite have put their grubby paws on preferential voting for the interests of the Labor Party, they have deserted the interests of this nation. 


So we now have the situation where there are some 15 million mandated refugees around the world. As an Australian, my heart, like every Australian's, goes out to them. These are sometimes stateless people. There are 15.4 million people looking for somewhere else to be. So Australia decided that, rather than act as a single nation or country, it would be part of a group of countries—in fact, part of the United Nations process—to identify those most in need. Australia takes around 13,500 refugees, of which half are taken as the highest priority refugees in the world. A very small percentage of the 15.4 million require a refugee outcome. The UNHCR decides who those people are. At the moment, they come from the Horn of Africa. People which find themselves in camps like Kakuma in the Horn of Africa well know the reason they have been chosen as the most in need. It is that they live in the most horrific circumstances. Their life expectancy is so low compared with that of refugees in other parts of the world. I have had some staggering statistics put to me about this. Children who are under four years of age have, for a period of time, a life expectancy of less than six months. That is why they are on the priority list. That is why those people must be a priority in coming to Australia.


Importantly, the other half of the 13,500 refugees are part of the family reunification humanitarian scheme which ensures that those who are part of the refugee diaspora—after they have been flung around the countryside—are able to come together again, to join up as a family again. They are able to join their families in Australia. That is our contribution, and it is a very large contribution compared with the size of our population. Under Labor's new arrangement, we now have people coming from all over the world. If you can afford the $8,000 or $10,000 per head to get here in a boat then you have jumped the queue. The people who will not be coming here are the 6,000-odd people who are part of the family aspect of that demographic. They will not be coming here because their places have been taken by boat people—people who have simply come here. Originally, under the coalition, we sent a clear message: do not come here by boat; if you do you will be treated in exactly the same way as the place from which you left. So people stopped coming. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, came and said: 'Look we're going to change all that. We've sold our souls to the Greens—to the devil.' That is why we have this situation. Julia Gillard, the current Prime Minister, took her place and said, 'We've lost our way: we've lost our way on border protection, we've lost our way on the carbon tax, we've lost our way on the mining tax.' But, most importantly, as an iconic process, they have lost their way on border protection. Well, hello! We know that, but they said they would fix it. Kevin Rudd failed because he simply was thinking more about the interests of the Labor Party. Julia Gillard seems to be failing because she is more interested in the interests of the Labor Party than in the interests of Australia and Australians. 


If you want to think about compassion—and as somebody said, it is the coalition and those interested in a tough border protection policy that send the clear signal: please do not put the lives of your families at risk; the UNHCR will decide who comes to this country—then think for a moment about the men and women, but mostly about the women and young children, in places like Kakuma. If you are compassionate, then every time we weaken a policy think about their lives and how short their lives are. This Labor Party stands absolutely condemned for putting its interests and its political motives—their relationship with the Greens—above the national interest. (Time expired)

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:46):  Immigration and border protection policy is an area of public policy that is very important, very complicated and detailed. But it is also an area that requires leadership to develop and implement a policy that ensures our nation meets the international commitments to which we are a signatory, including our humanitarian obligations under the United Nations conventions dealing with the treatment of refugees. It requires leadership to ensure a policy that provides an effective deterrent to the insidious trade of people smuggling and playing on the lives of the vulnerable and asking them to risk their lives on the high seas in unsafe and unseaworthy boats. Countries benefit from a multipartisan or a bipartisan approach to dealing with issues such as this.


Today's matter of public importance demonstrates, on behalf of the coalition, a complete lack of leadership on this important issue, an inability to analyse the recent decision of the High Court and an unwillingness to work with the government and implement a workable, effective and long-term policy solution to what is a difficult and very complex area of public policy. In the wake of the High Court's decision, Tony Abbott said:


I think that our country should have the best border protection policy that the government of the day thinks that it needs and I’m [pleased] to work constructively to give the government, to restore to the government, the option of third country offshore processing which it says the High Court and the Solicitor-General have denied to it.


When we heard that quote from the Leader of the Opposition, those on this side thought, 'Finally we have some logic, finally we have some thoughtfulness, finally we have a constructive approach to what is a very difficult policy area, and finally we have some leadership from the coalition.' We welcomed the commitment from the Leader of the Opposition. We provided a depart­mental briefing and we provided access to the experts regarding both the immigration issues and the legal issues associated with the High Court decision. In that briefing, the Leader of the Opposition was told of the High Court's judgment and the new interpretation of the law that the High Court had given to this issue. In that briefing, the Leader of the Opposition was told of the legal advice from the Solicitor-General, which cast further doubt on offshore processing of asylum seekers—wherever that may be. Indeed, the past declarations of Nauru under the Howard government would, in all likelihood, have been invalid under this decision of the High Court. 


The Leader of the Opposition was also informed that a legislative response is required—that is, an amendment to the Migration Act is required to ensure that our country has an effective long-term policy to deal with this very difficult policy issue. A number of days after the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, he began backing away from them. He began to say that he opposed a bipartisan approach to this. He resorted to type on this particular issue, he resorted to the opposition's policy of Nauru. He ignored the departmental advice, the expert advice, of those who have worked in this particular policy area for many years. In particular, he ignored the advice of the head of the department, Andrew Metcalfe, who, I note on Friday last week, former immi­gration minister in the Howard govern­ment Amanda Vanstone described as a 'first-class public servant'. Well, the Leader of the Opposition has ignored his advice showing a complete lack of leadership on this issue. In the wake of the High Court's decision, the government did what any good government would do—reacted quickly. We considered the advice of the departmental experts and the legal experts. We consulted the opposi­tion and other groups in society and, indeed, the executive consulted government MPs this morning. We have developed a legislative response that will overcome the difficulties identified in the High Court's decision. This legislative response will ensure that we continue to meet our international obli­gations in this policy area yet, at the same time, provide a very effective deterrent to people smuggling and stop people smugglers trading on the vulnerability of those seeking a better life by asking them to get on unsafe boats and undertake unsafe journeys.


The government has developed such an approach in consultation, based on the advice of experts. Yet the opposition come in here today and raise a matter of public importance in which they claim that the government has failed to find its way on this important policy issue. The only ones who have failed to find their way on this important policy issue are the opposition. Despite the advice of experts, first class public servants and the government's legal advisers in the wake of the High Court decision, they refuse to move away from their commitment to a policy that has been demonstrated not to work. It will not provide an effective deterrent. Experts have advised the government that it will not work. Indeed, 95 per cent of those who were housed on Nauru, who were found to be genuine refugees, ended up in Australia or New Zealand. This policy is not an effective deterrent.


What is needed to deal with this issue is a regional architecture with regional consultation. We need to work with our neighbours to ensure that in our region there is an effective deterrent to people smuggling that allows a nation such as Australia to ensure it meets its international commitments and gives priority to those in need. Many of those have been mentioned in the Senate today—those in the Horn of Africa and in Burma, some of whom have been waiting in camps for 16 to 20 years.


The government's policy will ensure that we meet those international commitments yet provide a sensible, logical approach to the trade of people smuggling and an effective deterrent. The government has offered the opposition a commitment to work in a bipartisan manner on this issue. On several occasions we have said to the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and the relevant shadow spokesperson that we will work in a bipartisan manner and that this issue requires a legislative response. That legislative response will ensure that we provide an effective deterrent to people smuggling and continue to meet humanitarian commitments that our nation has pledged to meet in a manner that will see priority given to those in need. The government stands ready and willing to work with the opposition on this important issue. We oppose the claim by the opposition in the Senate this afternoon that the government has lost its way on this issue. The opposition has lost its way on this issue. (Time expired)

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (15:56):  Senator Thistlethwaite questioned the need for this matter of public importance discussion today. I have to remind Senator Thistlethwaite: you were at a caucus meeting this morning when your own party was fighting over the absolute disarray in which your government has put border protection in Australia. Did you not read the headline in the paper today: 'Showdown: Labor rebels rally to sink Gillard's offshore asylum seeker solution'? You question why we have come in here today and raised this as a matter of public importance. Go and have a bit of a chat with Senator Cameron. See how Senator Cameron is feeling today. Have a chat with Senator Marshall. See how Senator Marshall is feeling today.


Listen to the talk that is going on in the corridors because, as a result of 24 June last year, which is now fondly known as 'execution day', there is a very good chance that the Australian public is going to revisit that day. Why? Because the Prime Minister who replaced Mr Rudd said at the time:


I accept that the government has lost track. We'll get it back on track. I have taken control for precisely those purposes.


What an absolute joke! What did she take control of? She took control of what was a complete, total and utter mess on that side. Lo and behold, she has managed to make it even worse.


The 'current' Prime Minister—and I use that word very loosely, as I know many on the Labor side of politics do—has also gone on the public record asking the public not to judge her on the way she became Prime Minister but on the job that she is doing. If the latest Newspolls are anything to go by, from the rumours in the corridors of Parliament House—and we all know what those rumours are; in fact, lo and behold, Senator Farrell walks in right on cue—the current Prime Minister is about to become the former Prime Minister.


In relation to so many policy failures, this is possibly the greatest policy failure of the Gillard Labor government. Who can forget Ms Gillard's catchcry when she was the shadow minister for immigration, when she used to say to the opposition if another boat arrived under our watch, 'Another boatload, another policy failure.' That was her mantra. I ask those on the other side: now that the Prime Minister has notched up a century, in that 100 boats have now arrived on our shores under her watch—and that is not a century to be proud of—what is the level of policy failure that is currently engulfing the Prime Minister of Australia? Put aside what I have to say as a coalition senator. You all expect me and all of us on this side to come into this place and criticise you. Let us have a look at what members of the Labor Party—members of the current Gillard govern­ment—have to say about the Prime Minister's mess when it comes to border protection. Senator Mark Bishop, a Western Australian senator, said to the Australian online when he was commenting on the government's mishandling of its botched Malaysia solution that the 'very existence of the government itself' was threatened. And he did not stop there. He went on to say:


There appears to be continuing lack of accountability, ministers don't seem to take responsibility for their own decision-making and consequences.


The Australian public must be fully confident of the ministers on the other side when their own Labor senators are doubting their own confidence.


But let us not stop there. Let us look at the House of Representatives. Let us see what Labor MP Graham Perrett said about the government's botched border protection policy. He said that the government needs to take time to get the policy right. You have got to be kidding me. Haven't we on this side listened to you bleat on and on and on for what is now turning into years that you had the policy right? And you had it wrong all the time. You had it wrong on every single occasion. One of your own members in the House of Representatives has at least now had the guts to stand up and say to the people of Australia that the government needs to take the time to get it right—an outright admission that when it comes to border protection policy this government is an absolute failure.


But it does not stop there. Another Labor senator, Doug Cameron, who is the convener of the left-wing group of the Labor Party, is on the record as saying that all of those who sit around him in the Senate have become 'political zombies', too scared to speak their minds. And what did he say about the Malaysia solution, which the Gillard government today reaffirmed itself to, despite the legal advice? Senator Cameron said that the Malaysia solution was no solution at all. That is a Labor senator saying that. And I understand Senator Marshall was not far behind him. That is two Labor senators who have stood up in caucus and said that the Malaysia solution is no solution at all.


Yet we come into this place today and are subjected to unity on the Labor side of politics: the Malaysia solution is going to stop the boats. I hate to tell you this, but it has not stopped the boats yet. They continue to arrive. In fact, if you go back to your offices you will probably find that another one has arrived. But the 100th boat under Prime Minister Gillard's watch arrived post the Malaysia announcement. It is interesting that since I have been in this place there has been this constant tension between the left and the right of the Labor Party. Today we see, yet again, the Left coming in, all built up. And yet again they have to roll over. Senator Cameron and Senator Marshall have had to roll over. They have had to have their little tummies tickled. They have had to be told to be good boys and come in here and tell this place to tell the Australian public it is a solution, when they are on the record as saying it is the complete opposite.


In addition to that, let us have a look at what the newspapers are saying about the Gillard government. If any senator wanted confirmation that the Gillard government's policies are not working and that there is massive dissension in the Labor Party ranks, they need only look at a snapshot of the headlines from the last 24 hours. The first one is 'Labor could win if Rudd returns', in Adelaide Now on 12 September. I would like to know Senator Farrell's views on that, quite frankly. Were you the unnamed source, Senator Farrell? If you were, put your hand up now. The second headline is 'PM facing Malaysian deadlock', in the Australian on 11 September. Then there is 'Emergency talks to head off shift to Rudd', in the CourierMail on 10 September; 'Julia Gillard seeks action as smugglers close in', in the Australian on 10 September; '100th boat on Labor's watch', in the Daily Telegraph on 10 September and '100th asylum seeker boat arrives for Julia Gillard', in Adelaide Now on 10 September. I could go on and I could go on and I could go on.




Senator Farrell:
  Please don't!




Senator CASH:
  Such is the extent of the failure of this government when it comes to border protection. I see Senator Farrell is laughing. I have to say to Senator Farrell, as someone who had his little paws all over 'Execution Day' a year and a half ago: if you thought it was bad under Mr Rudd, what do you honestly think now? This is a Labor Party that is in a complete, total and utter mess when it comes to so many of its policies, not least of which is border protection. Again, it is not just us on this side of the chamber who think that. The House of Representatives itself condemned the Malaysia deal. A motion was passed in the House of Representatives condemning the Gillard Labor government. And who supported that motion? Adam Bandt did—Adam Bandt, who as we know is in alliance with the government. The Independents Andrew Wilkie and Bob Katter, whom the government has to rely on for support, actually supported the motion, despite the Prime Minister's pathetic protestations. Under Prime Minister Gillard, Labor has an appalling record when it comes to protecting Australia's borders.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Before I call Senator Polley, I remind all senators to correctly address members of the other house.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:06):  Quite often we come into this place and have to speak on trivial and irrelevant matters of public importance, such as the one that has been put forward by the opposition. It really hurts me to have to say this about my colleague Senator Cash, but to be fair to her she often comes in here and rants. But that was one of the most disappointing rants I have heard to date from you. It was a rant from one extreme to the other, talking about leadership, about misleading the public—as if those people on the other side are saints.


We won't talk about the disunity within the Liberal Party, will we. We will not talk about the disunity in their camp between Turnbull and Abbott. We will not talk about those sorts of issues. We won't talk about those opposite misleading the Australian community. We won't talk about issues to do with polling. The only time they talk about polling is when they are showing their natural arrogance, the arrogance that they demonstrate in this place on a daily basis in their belief that they were born to rule. They have never accepted the fact that they lost the 2007 election. They do not accept that they lost the last election.




Senator Williams:
  You didn't win the last one.




Senator POLLEY:
  We did. We are sitting on this side of the chamber because the Prime Minister of this country negotiated the outcome that put us on the government benches. She was unlike Mr Abbott, who was quite prepared to throw billions of dollars at anybody who was prepared to support Abbott in government. That is the difference with those on the opposite side.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Polley, I did remind the Senate about using the correct title to address members of the other house. It has happened on both sides of the chamber today. I will call a point of order on every occasion on which people are not referred to correctly, so please refer to people by their correct titles and not just by their surname.




Senator POLLEY:
  I take that on board. Using Mr Abbott's correct title I will re-state that he was prepared to pay whatever price it was going to take to get on the government benches.


But let's talk about this MPI. As a signatory to the 1951 United Nations convention and the 1967 protocol, Australia, the USA and Canada are the three highest recipients of humanitarian refugees in the world and have been for many years. This government is no different at all. The Howard government's legislative provision section 198A(3) was tested in the Federal Court, which endorsed offshore processing of asylum seekers. The High Court has reinterpreted the legislation and although we the government are disappointed we accept the High Court's decision. The government has already acknowledged that legislative change would be needed to put offshore processing beyond doubt. That is what our publicly released legal advice shows.


The Labor government has accepted that there are three issues: first, to break the people-smuggling business model you need to have a significant disincentive in place and take away the product that they are trying to sell; second, you need an orderly migration program to consider all humanitarian claims; and, third, we need acceptance of genuine humanitarian refugees in line with our long-term commitment. Of these issues, the Australian government has a very positive position on the acceptance of humanitarian refugees. There can be no question that this will continue, and the increase to 14,750 signals that this is so.


But the government is committed to breaking the people-smuggling trade. We are committed to deterring people from taking these dangerous trips in boats that are rarely seaworthy. We are concerned about their welfare. We are concerned about the women, children and men who set sail for a better life. We are committed to orderly migration programs. To break the people-smuggling trade an adequate deterrent is needed. If this were not the case why would the coalition have resorted to the Pacific solution? The coalition has always supported offshore processing of asylum seekers but, in keeping with their mantra in opposition, they are about opposing, opposing and opposing.


So, what is this motion about? It is about the fact that they are unable to accept the harm done to refugees on Nauru. Ninety-five per cent of the people were resettled to Australia and New Zealand, many suffering from serious mental conditions. They were unable to accept that the cost of reopening Nauru would be about $1 billion over four years, and that does not include the inevitable infrastructure costs. I can remember pictures of Tony Abbott at Nauru looking into a classroom pretending it was a detention centre. We know, and so does the opposition, that the processing centre in Nauru is not available for use. There is no offshore processing centre ready for use in Nauru. That is a fact. And is there anything on Nauru that would be ready for use to process 200 or 300 people? The processing centre was dismantled and the remaining infrastructure given to the people of Nauru. That is a fact. While Nauru signed the instruments of access to the refugee convention in June this year, it does not currently have legislation for determining refugee status determination and it has no experience in undertaking refugee status assessments. Nauru is isolated, and, with redevelopment, its costs would be very expensive. The opposition have been briefed by officials. Mr Abbott knows that Nauru will fail. It is not just us providing the briefing to Mr Abbott and the opposition; it is the officials, who have made it very clear that Nauru will fail. Nauru will not stop the boats. The government is committed to the Malaysian solution. This, combined with a commitment to Manus Island, will achieve the outcome that this government is looking for. The message will be: if you take a boat to Australia, you will be returned to Malaysia and processed with the 90,000 other asylum seekers and refugees waiting there. Malaysia willingly entered into this agreement, acting in good faith. The UNHCR has repeatedly said the govern­ment's Malaysian transfer arrangement was workable. The UNHCR was engaged and consulted throughout the process by Australia and Malaysia and very much helped to shape the final arrangement.


Christmas Island is an important immigration facility for this government. It also provides significant benefits for the local community, including improved infrastructure and significant employment opportunities. Meanwhile, we have Mr Abbott flopping all over the place, flip-flopping as usual. Over the last week he committed to an act of good faith, then ruled it in and then ruled it out: 'I am not ruling anything in and I am not ruling anything out.' Who does that remind me of? This change in attitude towards working positively and constructively was welcomed, but what do we find? We find, as usual, Mr Abbott going back on his word in an article in the Conversationtitled 'The vexed question of onshore processing and possible civil unrest':


If we go back to 2007 when then Immigration Minister Andrews targeted Africans, particularly Sudanese, as impossible to assimilate, that caused a significant drop in public support, particularly in Victoria, towards the settlement of refugees.


It wasn’t the refugees who caused it, it was the public statements of hostility from leading political figures. As it turns out African refugees (rarely if ever boat arrivals) have proven to be generally law abiding, hard working and passionately attached to the Australia that has given them the precious gift of freedom.


I could go on and on, but what I want to put on the record is that this government is a compassionate government. We will treat refugees with respect. We will ensure that in whatever measures this government takes—and the Malaysian solution is part of that—we will endeavour to do all that we can to stop the boats. Those opposite would not accept anything this government puts forward on this issue. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-09-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:17):  What a disgrace. What an absolute disgrace we are confronted with today: the complete and utter failure and inability of this government, led by this Prime Minister, to protect our borders. This Prime Minister is the all-rounder of failed border protection, the very person who as the shadow minister for immigration, on the rare occasion she was able to do so, would get out of the policy and say, 'Another boat, another failed policy.' And what do we have now? We have another boat, another 100 policy failures. Ms Gillard, the current Prime Minister, has now made her maiden test century. She is the Shaun Marsh of failed asylum seeker policy. The big question, of course, is whether she will go on to do more than 151 runs, as Shaun Marsh did the other day in Sri Lanka.


But of course Prime Minister Gillard is not restricted to being a batsman; she is a bowler of the most hapless form, the hapless hat-trick. What were her three failures? Firstly, there was her failure to stop the arrival of asylum seekers; secondly, her abject failure of the so-called East Timor solution; and, thirdly and most recently, her failure in the Malaysia solution. How inconvenient are umpires when you are completely and utterly afield as a cricketer! It is far too serious an issue to be dealt with like this.


I was in East Timor, in Dili, only five weeks ago and one of my purposes was to try and establish what I thought of the prospect of us joining with East Timor to set up an asylum seeking facility there. You would only have needed to visit to find it would not work. Those of us who have lived and worked in Malaysia, particularly under the then prime ministership of Mahatir Mohamad, would know the way in which illegal immigrants were dealt with by the government—off the end of the cane, off the end of the stick. It would be no different.


Earlier this afternoon we heard my colleague Senator Scullion referring to the 15.4 million refugees around the world. We know, as a result of the discussions over Malaysia, that more than 90,000 genuine refugees are rotting in asylum camps and refugee camps in Malaysia, and we know the story of the Horn of Africa. I have made the observation in this place before, and I believe it to be true, that there is a high degree of corruption in the actual refugee camps, where people who are legitimate refugees accepted by this country get somewhere near the top of the queue but never, ever get a guernsey. Why? Because of the corrupt payments that are going to those who manage those refugee camps from others who jump the queue and suddenly find their way. I have not yet seen any action taken by this government to investigate that shocking scenario to see if it is true.


The worst feature of the failure of this government is the increased number of unaccompanied children who are being put on these leaking, rotting wooden fishing boats and put to sea under the most horrific conditions—and we are doing nothing about it. I have reflected on a more generic term. If you wish to try and smash the business model of somebody else, how do you go about it? In this case, of course, it is the so-called business model of the people-smugglers—one which, incidentally, Prime Minister Howard and his then immigration minister, Mr Ruddock, were very successful in smashing. But, as we all know, the Howard government inherited a problem and found a solution. They handed it to the then Rudd-Gillard government, who picked up that solution and turned it back into a problem.


If you want to smash the business model of an opponent, what are your options? The first one is to compete on better terms. Only last week we saw Clarke and Dawe parodying this situation, ridiculing this government, talking about the fact that we brought Irish and English immigrants and even convicts here in the 1700s and 1800s. Brian Dawe even asked the question of John Clarke, parodied as Treasurer Swan: 'Why don't you have a weekly ship or a monthly ship out of the Middle East?' That is the stupidity of that particular circumstance.


The second thing you would do is to make the business illegal and successfully prosecute the perpetrators. This draws me to an article in the Age on 30 August. We now see in Melbourne that Victorian Legal Aid lawyer Saul Holt is telling us that they are appealing to the chief judge of the Victorian County Court to overturn the crime of people-smuggling based on the fact that although these people, the asylum seekers, have no visas they will argue that under international and Australian law genuine refugees seeking asylum from persecution should not in fact lead to people-smugglers being charged. What are we going to do—give them medals? What is interesting is that this is in Victoria. What is the proportion of people-smugglers that end up in Victorian prisons? I can tell you that it is very few. But I can tell you the answer for Western Australia, as my colleagues would know. We have 130-plus in Western Australian jails at the moment either awaiting trial or who have been dealt with, costing the Western Australian taxpayer $100,000 each a year, in excess of $13 million a year. So here is the success of my second item of the business model, making it illegal. Victorian Legal Aid do not want to make people smuggling illegal. They presumably want to put it on a pedestal.


The third that I would suggest to you if you are trying to smash the business model is convincing the consumers that the product is unattractive so that they do not want to buy it—in other words, so they do not want to come here. Taking the opposition out of the market is another option. But the fifth one—and I will deal with the third and the fifth together—is to completely change the product, change it completely, so that the consumer is disinterested.


It was in 1954 that Australia signed up to the UNHCR. That is nearly 50 years ago. Surely the circumstances have changed in the world—




Senator Farrell:
  Fifty-seven.




Senator BACK:
  Thank you very much. I appreciate that, Senator Farrell. I know Senator Farrell's capacity for numbers and I would always defer to him on that particular element. But surely the circumstances from post Second World War Europe, Australia and Asia have changed such that it is time that we revisit that entire situation.


I look at what the Howard government implemented by way of finding its solution. The first measure of course was temporary protection visas, to give that level of protection to those people until such time as conditions in their home countries were such that they could safely be returned. That is something that should never, ever have been discontinued. On the Nauru solution, we hear that bleatings of Senator Carr and others saying that it never worked. The point was that it took the oxygen away from the people-smugglers. The people-smugglers could not advertise in their evil ways in Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iraq and other places that people coming to Australia would get to Australia. That was the point of Nauru, and it worked. It is interesting that Nauru was run by Australians. It would be most interesting to run a poll of people who have been found to be not genuine refugees: would they like to go to Malaysia under Malaysian manage­ment or would they like to go to Nauru to a facility under Australian management? It would be most interesting to see what the outcome would be.


The other thing we did under the Howard government was forge a strong, positive relationship with Indonesia. Think back to the tsunami when this country sent $1 billion to the people of Indonesia at a time when their Islamic brothers in the United Arab Emirates could only come up with $1 million—and only when it was shamed afterwards did Saudi Arabia kick the can to some very limited effect. What we see in this country now in the circumstances of our relationship with Indonesia, which I will not dwell on today, is a very upset relationship with that country. What level of cooperation is Australia likely to get with the government of Indonesia at the moment on matters associated with asylum seekers and border protection given the fact that we treated them so harshly in the months of June and July this year?


The Howard government eliminated the pull factors. Even Minister Bowen has accepted at the moment that what we have done in this country is create those pull factors and we are going to continue to see an increase in the numbers to come. Then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Philip Ruddock said the safest thing to do was to keep people off the boats. This government has failed. This government is unable to protect Australia's borders. It must go.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-09-12,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:27):  I rise today to make a contribution to this debate about migration as well. I want to, firstly, indicate that it is one of those areas that I have spoken about on numerous occasions in this chamber and it is an area that can be highly charged and unfortunately at times politicised. Unfortunately at other times we see the creeping of xenophobia into the discussion. It is an area that needs to be critiqued in respect of what it is about.


Before I get to the relevant points, I want to make comment on some of the previous contributions from speakers from the opposition. Firstly, Senator Scullion spoke about the Horn of Africa. There is a terrible situation happening over there. That is why we need sympathetic and reasonable management of how we protect our borders and deal with those poor souls who come from situations that we are aware of in the Horn of Africa.


Senator Cash spoke about reports of headlines in the newspapers about what is happening in our caucus today. Yes, there was a caucus meeting today where metho­dically and reasonably the members of the Labor caucus worked through a process of discussing this issue. At the end of the day, we worked up and supported a solution that will see an outcome of presenting legislation to the House of Representatives and eventually to this chamber for a resolution on how we deal with migration.


It really astounds me how not just Senator Cash—I do respect Senator Cash; she is a good performer from the opposition—but in general most of those people in the opposition here will tend to rely on the media. I guess that is why there is a campaign out there currently wanting some reform in the media. I will give just one example of why you cannot always rely upon the media. Just last week, I was quoted in the Age as having made some comments about the introduction of or the support for the Nauru solution. It was not even me in the photograph; it was a colleague. That clearly demonstrates that those opposite should never rely upon media headlines in the newspapers.


We know that there has been a High Court decision in relation to our Malaysia solution, which has been dealt with. Subject to that decision, we need to work out future positions on handling migration and border protection. That is why, in caucus today, we had a discussion dealing with this particular issue. The High Court judgment established a new interpretation of migration law, which is why we need to work through a process of managing this. Legal advice from the Solicitor General cast further doubt over offshore processing of asylum seekers, wherever it might occur. It could be anywhere in the Pacific that we as a government decide in the future to deal with this issue. Indeed, talking about Nauru under the Howard government, the Solicitor-General has indicated that, most likely, that decision would have been invalid as well. This is an opportunity for the opposition to work with us in a bipartisan way to make sure we get a solution, because one day in the future they may be in a position where they might be in government and they will need to deal with this issue.




Senator Back:
  We've dealt with it before.




Senator FURNER:
  There is no use in playing politics on this issue, Senator Back. You need to deal with migration in a methodical, reasonable and responsible manner, rather than coming up with cheap slogans like, 'We will stop the boats.' You know, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I, as chair of the defence subcommittee, take a strong interest in defence matters. It was only last year, in July, that I was very fortunate to be on the parliamentary defence program at the border protection command in Darwin. On that day, it was actually the day on which the Prime Minister was on HMAS Bathurst, we went out into the harbour and saw firsthand how our hardworking, professional men and women on that ship deal with this issue. Low and behold, one of the opposition members of the House of Representatives, the member for Dickson, just had to ask the question. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to work out what the answer would have been to his question, which was: 'Why don't we just stop the boats? Why don't we just turn them around?' We are in the middle of the ocean somewhere, we cannot see land for miles around us, and here is the member for Dickson asking a stupid question like that. I knew what the answer would be, and sure enough it was: 'If you go around trying to stop the boats, the first sign of an Australian naval patrol boat will result in those people drilling holes in their hull, damaging their engines or do anything they can to make sure they are rescued.' We are dealing with desperate people. We are dealing with people who are coming from areas where they are persecuted, or where there is war or conflict, and you have these grubby people-smugglers getting them over here in any possible way, shape or form, whether it be in a leaky ex-fishing boat, whatever the case may be, regardless of its condition. We all watched, sadly, on our TVs last year as SIEV221 smashed up against the rocks on Christmas Island. I do not want to see that scene again and I am sure everyone in this chamber feels the same. That is why we need to work together on a solution to this issue.


Regardless of what the opposition does when this legislation comes into the parliament, it needs to reflect on its position, because at some stage in the future it will need to deal with this. It is not a case of coming up with cheap political slogans such as: 'We will stop the boats,' or 'We will pick up the boat phone and ring someone in Canberra who will deal with this issue.' You need to work through a humane solution and deal with it using a logical process.


I will focus on Nauru for a moment. We know that, as a result of that solution, somewhere around 60 per cent of those who were resettled from Nauru were resettled in Australia, and that a whopping 95 per cent of people resettled from Nauru ended up in Australia or New Zealand. It was not an outcome that worked, despite what those opposite would have you believe. It did not work. The reality is that 95 per cent of those people were resettled in our country and in New Zealand. We know that, not long ago, the member for Cook and also Mr Abbott visited Nauru and inspected what is a dilapidated migration centre. They came up with the view that it would have a significantly lower cost than the Malaysia solution. We know that is also not true; they have got it wrong. It will not be cheap or effective. It will be more costly, because of the changes that will need to be made on Nauru. That is why we as a government will not consider Nauru has a possibility in the legislation we introduce to deal with this issue. In fact, the highest level of Department of Immigration and Citizenship estimates are that the coalition's Nauru plan would cost taxpayers $980 million, almost $1 billion, in operational costs alone. That is $1 billion that could be spent elsewhere, on health or education, rather than refurbishing a centre that is basically inoperative.


Once again Mr Abbott needs to decide, for the sake of the coalition as an alternative government, to work with us on this issue. Migration to this country has always been an issue. I remember, back in the 1970s and the 1980s, when the Vietnamese boat people arrived on our shores. I still dread to remind myself of some of the redneck statements such as, 'Why don't we get the Navy out there and blow 'em out of the water.' I am certain that is not what the opposition is advocating, but it certainly stirred up xenophobia in our community. We need to make sure that those sorts of comments and views are oppressed and that we deal with this issue as a government—and as a government we can.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (21:50):  Tonight I wish to speak on an issue that is posing a threat to our country's surf lifesaving clubs—in particular, the 128 surf lifesaving clubs that are located within my home state of New South Wales. The issue relates to rising sea levels and the threat that they pose to the life and the wellbeing of our surf clubs. Many members of this nation's surf clubs enjoy worthwhile lifestyles, and I am pleased to say that I have been a member of a surf lifesaving club in Sydney for 26 years. As a long-time member and former president of Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club, I have many wonderful memories of my time on the beach, watching over fellow beachgoers in often wild and at times unforgiving surf conditions.


From an early age I was taught to treat the ocean with the utmost respect. Indeed, its power and propensity to turn from beautiful to ugly at a moment's notice means it deserves nothing less. This was a lesson drilled into me as a youngster: even when your back is turned, you always keep one eye on the ocean. Mother Nature can be a supremely unpredictable force. This is a lesson that has served me and many surf lifesavers well throughout the world.




Senator Nash:
  Never turn your back on the ocean.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  That is true. I feel that it is my duty today to pass on that lesson about always keeping your eye on the beach, because some coastal regions of New South Wales are finding out the ability of the ocean to sneak up on them. Surf clubs of this nation make up the first line of defence against the vastness of the ocean and they are, at present, facing a serious threat in the form of extreme weather events associated with sea level rise. The surf clubs are often the first to experience the effects of rising sea levels in this country and as such do not have the luxury to 'um and ah' over this threat. They need to take action in order to save themselves and to save the Australian way of life.


In recognising the challenges that climate change, changing weather events and sea level rise are posing for our nation, Surf Life Saving Australia has commissioned a study to develop a climate change adaptation road map that will assist in the management of projected climate change impacts. The objective of this study was to understand the risks posed by climate change, to review available strategies to address those risks and to develop a program to implement the identified strategies. The outcome is a climate change adaptation road map for surf lifesaving which outlines strategies that will increase the resilience of surf lifesaving to the projected impacts of climate change. These outcomes represent an important first step for surf lifesaving in preparing for the impacts of climate change.


Climate change is indeed a pressing issue and one that is already having an impact on a number of surf clubs. Without action, it will continue to threaten and impact on one of this nation's most iconic movements. The study is entitled Impact of extreme weather events and climate change on surf life saving services. It assessed the range of risks climate change might pose to the surf lifesaving movement and identified a range of strategies to deal with them. Increased sea levels, altered wave climates, modified rainfall patterns and changes to the frequency and intensity of storms are just some of the effects of climate change the study found the movement will need to face in the coming years. It is true that these effects are expected with or without climate change, but the damage caused by climate change will be far greater if no action is taken to mitigate the impact.


Of the 128 surf clubs in New South Wales, 47 per cent are located in coastal zones classified as zones of potential instability. Cudgen Headland is a surf lifesaving club on Kingscliff Beach in the north of New South Wales and perhaps one of the most vulnerable. This surf club has been hit hard recently by storm events which have caused shoreline recession in front of the club and along the adjoining beach, resulting in decreased amenity for beach users and impact on the surf club and interclub surf carnivals. The New South Wales Surf Life Saving Championships were held at the beach in March of this year and just prior to that event the local council, the surfing community and the surf club were required to dump sand from the adjoining river onto the beach just so there was enough sand to run the events. The club has been working with the Tweed Shire council to establish temporary protection measures, including sea wall construction and sand nourishment. These actions combined with the natural sediment renourishment from Cudgen Creek have improved the condition of the beach adjacent to the club. Cases such as at Cudgen Headland highlight the impact of natural climate variability on coastal conditions. Projections for climate change, including a rise in mean sea level, are likely to continue to exacerbate existing management issues and generate new management challenges for surf clubs everywhere.


Sea level rise as a result of climate change will have a number of different physical and ecological effects on coastal systems, including direct inundation, flood and storm damage, loss of wetlands, erosion, saltwater intrusion of coastal aquifers and associated rising water tables. These are all risks which were identified in the surf lifesaving study. Other effects of climate change, such as higher sea water temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns and changes in storm tracks, frequency and intensity will also affect coastal systems, both directly and through interactions with sea level rise. The report found:


Almost all Surf Lifesaving Clubs (SLSCs) in Australia are located at the forefront of the coastal zone, often within metres of the shoreline. Understandably, the vast majority of SLSCs are located on sandy beaches, which provide high amenity and support recreational use. Sandy coastal zones are vulnerable to coastal erosion and thus sensitive to the impacts of climate change. Over 63 per cent of SLSCs nationally are situated on coastal areas classified as zones of potential instability. Projected impacts of climate change include coastal erosion leading to asset exposure and changes in coastal beach safety through altered beach form.


These biogeophysical effects will, in turn, have direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts on tourism, human settlements, agriculture, freshwater supply and quality, fisheries, financial services and human health in the coastal zone.


For the great surf lifesaving movement of this nation, the impact of climate change and rising sea levels is already being felt and will continue to be an issue that the movement will need to grapple with for many years to come. It is heartening to see the foresight of those involved in the administration of surf lifesaving through the development of this road map for dealing with climate change. I would like to place on record my congratulations to the administrators of surf lifesaving in this country for their commitment to dealing with the issue of climate change, for their commitment to working with the government to address what is a serious economic and social issue for our nation and for their commitment to ensuring the continued viability of a great pastime, a great Australian tradition and a great volunteer movement and organisation in our country. I remain committed to working with the movement to deal with one of the most pressing economic and social issues of our generation.
