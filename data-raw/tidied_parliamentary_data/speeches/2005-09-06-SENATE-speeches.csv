"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-09-06,"—I have looked at the reasons for urgency that the government has put forward for these three bills. The Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 5) Bill 2005 is one that has been debated, one could say, to completion. But the other two bills that the government is asking for us to exempt from the cut-off in no way qualify. The fact is that the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 and the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 2005 ought to have been brought before this place months ago. They are dealing with and catching up with legislation that was passed decades ago. There is no good reason in the paper put forward by the government for exempting these bills from the cut-off.
Let us remember that the cut-off is there so that when bills are brought before the Senate the Senate can go to the community and get feedback. What we are seeing here is the government using its numbers to effectively abolish that rule, which enables the public to have input on pieces of legislation which have very often been steamrolled straight through the House of Representatives. The cut-off rule is a much valued rule. It does not prohibit money bills or important bills from being dealt with expeditiously in this place. But it is meant to allow the people of Australia to have input. This is being clearly flouted by the government on this occasion.
It is important to speak up about it. I do not believe these bills should be exempt from the cut-off rule. It is bad practice. It is undemocratic. It goes against the form of this Senate, and the government should think again. If the government is going to repeatedly do this, we will be taking repeated opposition to it. I herewith say that the Greens do not support this legislation, except in the matter of the bill that I have mentioned.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,BUSINESS,0,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-06,—I asked the minister last night whether he could give me a specific answer to the question: will any industrial action that may have been legal on or after 9 March this year become illegal after the passing of this bill?,SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—The answer is that, potentially, that is right. At this stage I am not willing to comment on any particular situations. The purpose of making legislation retrospective, or giving it a particular starting date, as we have—namely, 9 March 2005—is to ensure that any behaviour after 9 March, or that commencement date, is deemed to be illegal for the purposes of the legislation.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-06,"—I understand the second part of your answer. The first part did try to go to my question, and I think you have acknowledged that some industrial action that would have been legal at the time will now be illegal with the passing of this legislation. Why can’t the minister tell me what that industrial action would be?
—Oh!
—Senator Ferris says, ‘Oh!’ as if that were a terrible question. Here we are considering retrospective legislation that will affect at least 270,000 building workers, as the original definition stood. The definition has expanded, and I will be asking the minister in a moment to tell me how many extra employees will be caught up in the expanded definition. But a substantial amount of people have potentially been taking legal action at a point in time and then, without their knowledge, without this government doing anything to inform any of those people, the government retrospectively makes those things illegal. Somehow Senator Ferris thinks that this is an unreasonable thing for me to ask about. I do not think it is unreasonable whatsoever.
—I didn’t say that.
—Senator Ferris, the whingeing and whining and the moaning because I ask a question of the minister indicates that sort of attitude from you. It discredits you and really reinforces the arrogance that this government shows when dealing with this sort of legislation. Minister, can you detail, given that you have indicated that there will be some industrial action—
—Senator Marshall, direct your questions, if you have them, through the chair. Would you be kind enough to do that?
—Yes, I would be, clearly. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, will the minister detail what industrial action is now going to be illegal under this bill that was not illegal on 9 March? He has indicated that there is some. I am asking him to detail what that is.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—First of all, can I say, as I had occasion to in question time yesterday, there ought to be a standing order against verballing. Senator Marshall sought to verbal Senator Ferris, and I think the record needs to cleared up on that. In relation to the legislation, it stands to reason that, when you introduce new legislation which introduces new penalties et cetera, the law will change and then people who conduct behaviour from the day of the commencement of the legislation may well fall foul of those provisions in the legislation. There is nothing different about this, other than that the commencement date is the date the government announced—namely, 9 March 2005—and the activities would already need to have been unprotected industrial action. It was made known on 9 March 2005. I am now being asked what activities and particular examples—
—Not examples; what action.
—Read the legislation, and the legislation tells you. It is quite clear. I am not going to reread all the clauses and subclauses. Those on the other side oppose this legislation because they say that it is anti-union and all that sort of stuff. We heard all of that yesterday and we will undoubtedly hear it even louder today because we are being broadcast. We will hear all of that again. I think Senator Marshall and those opposite do know what the provisions of the legislation are and what it is designed to weed out. I simply remind the Senate that this legislation has arisen as a result of the Cole royal commission, which exposed a culture of lawlessness and illegality in the building and construction industry. As a government we are trying to clean it up, and those opposite, in the ALP in particular, are running a campaign to try to protect that culture which Royal Commissioner Cole exposed.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-06,"—The minister put a proposition to this chamber and I just want to correct the record. We do not protect lawlessness. We do not support criminality. It is outrageous to make that assertion in this place. We say that this Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 is not the way forward to deal with the issues in the building industry. We say that putting in retrospective legislation that specifically targets one union and one set of workers, rather than ensuring that the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act are properly policed, is not the way forward. We say that this piece of legislation is driven by this government’s blind hatred of a particular union and the knowledge that it can politically attack a certain group of building workers because it believes it is politically able to do that. That is what this bill is driven by. It is not driven by sensible public policy or a desire to clean up the building industry.
Turning to the issue of retrospectivity, the issue that we are discussing currently, the minister says, ‘Read the legislation and that will tell us what action was unlawful.’ Let us be really clear what is being proposed here. What is being proposed is making action, which previously was not illegal, retrospectively unlawful. What is being proposed by this government is to make action taken by an employee, or in fact an employer, retrospectively unlawful. It does not have to be something outrageous. It may be a dispute over health and safety, because there are different provisions when safety issues are raised in this legislation. It may be action which, at the time it was taken, was not contrary to law, and action which under the Workplace Relations Act—the primary industrial relations regulatory mechanism in this country—was not unlawful. That is what this government is proposing on the basis of some broad diatribe about what is happening in the building industry. It is not on a specific issue that this needs to be retrospective. Even if we accepted your arguments, Minister—which we do not—about the need for specific target penalties for this sector which substantially extend beyond those applicable to other sectors of the work force, nothing that has been put by this government to the Senate inquiry or in this chamber today in this debate explains why retrospectivity is so important.
We are not just talking about making something retrospectively problematic or some retrospective operation; we are talking about very significant penalties. This act introduces a new statutory concept of unlawful industrial action for the building and construction industry as opposed to the protected and non-protected action which can be taken under this government’s legislation in the Workplace Relations Act. Clause 38 of the bill that we are debating prohibits a person from engaging in an unlawful industrial action. It is a grade A civil penalty and the penalties are up to $110,000 for a body corporate and $22,000 for an individual. I spoke yesterday about how that is substantially greater than the penalties which currently exist under the Workplace Relations Act. The government is saying that we are going to retrospectively deem activities, which may have not been unlawful previously, as being unlawful. We are also going to increase the penalties applicable to the action.
—He does not know what that is.
—Senator Marshall points out that the minister and the government do not know what that action is. We wait with bated breath for some indication of the events or the issues which are so important that they require this parliament to override the principle against retrospectivity in cases particularly of penalty provisions. These are significant penalties. The simple proposition is that the government are saying that something that was not unlawful should now be made unlawful, that something that was within the law should now be exposed to prosecution. They have not put forward to this chamber or in their arguments about the bill any cogent reason as to why retrospectivity in respect of the unlawful industrial action has to be imposed.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-06,"—We are considering my three amendments moved jointly to make the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 applicable on the day on which the act receives royal assent rather than the due date in the bill of 9 March 2005. It is important to separate out the issues of retrospectivity from the issues that the bill is considering. There are many Australians—employers and individuals—who might support the bill in terms of what it is trying to do but would not support retrospectivity because of the principle that is being corrupted here. I think that a very important point to make is not to mix the two issues up together. What Senator Marshall and I previously, and now Senator Wong, have focused on—Senator Marshall in particular by giving a numerical figure to those potentially affected—is the potential numbers and nature of organisations, employees and employers who could be affected adversely by retrospectivity. That is an entirely different issue from the issue of what the bill is intended to do in the first place, which is to set up an industry-specific regulatory environment.
All sides of parliament have a view on that. My view is well known and it is in my speech and in my minority report. But even if I were to be a strong supporter of an industry-specific regulator—which I am not—I would still remain very opposed to the retrospective nature of this law. It offends a long tradition of principle established by all parties in this parliament that we should not support laws which adversely affect individuals and organisations by making unlawful what was previously lawful and by applying penalties which are in excess of those which applied at the time. The example is often given of the reintroduction of capital punishment where somebody who was not to be hanged previously was then to be hanged—retrospectively because you have changed the law. That would just be abhorrent. In fact I suspect the High Court would overturn it. That is the extreme example of what can happen in the circumstances. So I am really concerned that the government should seek to do go down this path and I think it is to their discredit on this occasion.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—To respond to Senator Murray first: we had a discussion about this last evening and we were all agreed that, as a matter of principle, we did not necessarily like retrospectivity in legislation. But we were all, in fact, agreed that there were occasions on which we had voted for, or supported, an element of retrospectivity in legislation. So it is not a situation of, ‘There shall never be any retrospectivity.’ That is not the position, as I understand it, of any party in this place. Having debunked that, the question then is: on what occasion should legislation be retrospective?
—Yes.
—I agree, and Senator Murray is agreeing with that and I thank him for that. Therefore the question is: is this matter sufficiently serious as to warrant retrospectivity? As I said last night, I can understand that that is an individual judgment that individuals will make and come down on either side of the debate. To take up and debunk Senator Wong’s point on this legislation, asserting that this is because of a hatred of a particular union, can I simply indicate that a former Liberal government introduced retrospective legislation against people who had enriched themselves in a way that was deemed to be completely and utterly immoral and at the expense of the Australian taxpayer—with the bottom-of-the-harbour tax schemes. On that occasion we took on, if you like, an element of the wealthy end of town because of the seriousness of their activities. On this occasion we are now taking on a particular trade union. What that goes to show is that we in the Liberal Party are willing to take on, without fear or favour, those that offend against the basic standards in such a way that retrospectivity is deemed appropriate by us. We do not like using it, we wish that it was not necessary, but every now and then it is required. I simply point to that previous example where a Liberal government introduced retrospective legislation against those who had sought to unfairly enrich themselves at the expense of their fellow Australians. This is not us conducting a campaign against the trade unions or an element of the trade union movement. It is about having fairness in the building and construction industry. I would remind senators of the Cole royal commission which found a culture of illegality and unlawfulness, and we as a government believe that should be overcome.
I can understand that Senator Wong, as a former CFMEU employee, would be passionate about this. Before coming to parliament she was on the payroll of the CFMEU. Good luck to her. But before she starts asserting that we are doing this because of our hatred for the CFMEU, she in fact might like to declare her interest in the CFMEU prior to entering into this debate. Let me simply say that the CFMEU has in it an ‘f’ word that the Labor Party never likes to use. Of course, that is the forestry component of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. Can I say that the forestry union was very supportive of us at the last federal election and we appreciated its support. So do not suggest, in any shape or form, that we are trying to pursue the CFMEU with this legislation. What we are seeking to do is pursue illegality by employers, unions or workers to ensure that this culture changes.
Senator Wong says, ‘We want to get rid of illegality; we want to get rid of all the things that are bad in the industry, but this particular legislation is not the way forward.’ Can I ask Senator Wong: if all the amendments are carried, would you vote for the legislation? She is strangely silent. Of course she would not. She would still oppose the legislation even if all the amendments were carried. So where is her alternative approach? There is none. As a former paid official of the CFMEU she is doing their bidding in this place. That is fine, we all come from different backgrounds, but I think those listening in to this debate should be aware of that.
In relation to retrospectivity and the need for it, I indicated the reasons last night but for Senator Wong’s benefit I will put them on record again:
The decision to designate 9 March 2005 as the date of effect was taken to ensure that industry parties—industry parties can be both sides of the equation—did not take advantage of the time between the bill’s introduction and its passage to engage in unlawful or antisocial conduct of the sort identified by the Cole royal commission.
That is the reason we are doing it, so do not say no reason has been offered. A reason has been offered. I can understand that those opposite might reject that reason. That is fine. That is what this debate is about. But do not come in here suggesting that no reason has been proffered. What is really being said is that no reason has been proffered as to convince those opposite—such as Senator Wong, who used to be engaged by the CFMEU. Can I indicate that I doubt that any legislation of this kind would ever be to the liking of those opposite.
Coming back to Senator Murray’s points, I understand what he says about retrospectivity. I think we are all agreed that sometimes it is necessary, so it is an on-balance proposition, and on balance we fall in favour of retrospectivity. I can understand that the Democrats, on balance, are against retrospectivity. I understand that that is the divide between us and I hope we can put it to a vote.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-09-06,"—I wish to respond to the comments just made by Minister Abetz because it is typical of this minister to get up in this place trying to offer an argument that has no basis in truth whatsoever. He went back to a set of circumstances that occurred in the mid-1970s to try to justify why the government is applying retrospectivity to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. I do not want to go into a lot of detail about the issue of retrospectivity. Senator Murray dealt with it at some length in his minority report and I support the arguments he put to the committee at that time and I still support the arguments. There is no justification for retrospectivity on this occasion.
The events in 1975 that Senator Abetz talks about arose out of, again, a witch-hunt by a Liberal coalition government on a trade union, that is, the painters and dockers in the mid-1970s. They thought it was an easy mark—there was criminality associated with that organisation in one particular state and some notorious events occurred around that time. They thought it was an easy way to attack the trade union movement, and the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Fraser, called a royal commission. I happened to be a participant in that commission because I was a union official who represented workers on the waterfront. I represented my union in that commission.
Senator Abetz, if you want to be honest with the Australian people, the difference between the circumstances of 1975, the white shoe brigade and the bottom-of-the-harbour tax schemes, and the circumstances of today is that those people in 1975 were in breach of the tax laws. There was special legislation, certainly, introduced to wrap them up but they were breaching tax laws and that is what the royal commission found. They were in breach of the law at the time. We did not introduce, and Prime Minister Fraser did not introduce, legislation which put new tax laws in place retrospectively. He did not do that. He introduced legislation in order to corral the people who had breached the tax laws of the time. There is a difference between doing that and taking people in this industry who have acted legally, in accordance with the law, for the past six months and saying that what they did six months ago, which was lawful under the law of that time, is now unlawful and they are subject to penalty. That is a radically different approach from what occurred in 1975.
You shake your head, Senator Abetz. I suspect that you have not even gone back to look at it. I suspect that you have not gone and checked the facts. You have just manufactured an argument which you thought looked reasonable, would sound reasonable to the Australian people and was the basis for justifying your actions in respect of this bill.
Of course, Labor will oppose this bill irrespective of whether the amendments are carried or not. That has always been our position. We have never at any time said that we believe this bill to be necessary. We have argued consistently in here against it because there is a Workplace Relations Act and there are penalties under that act for unlawful activity. It is open to any employer organisation to pursue action under that act if they believe unions are engaging in unlawful activity. In the same way, there is the opportunity for unions to pursue action under that act if they believe employers are acting illegally or pursuing unlawful activity.
Why do we need a special set of legislation to deal with this industry that is not applicable to any other workers in the country? A worker in the building industry, taking into account the definition, could be someone who runs a soft furnishing factory somewhere providing curtains, blinds or carpets to a high-rise building. The scope of this legislation is horrendous in its potential application. We suddenly say that they are different in form from any other worker in the country. Let us take an example. You have a sheet metal worker who works for a firm in Ingleburn. The firm is making airconditioning equipment that goes into the cottage industry, into housing. They are not captured by this legislation, so they are acting quite lawfully when they do whatever they do, and they are covered by the Workplace Relations Act. If that same worker makes a piece of airconditioning equipment and installs it in a high-rise building he is captured by this law. The reality is that there are thousands of workers who are in that situation every day. In the morning they could be installing a piece of airconditioning equipment in someone’s house and in the afternoon they could be working on a high-rise building. An electrician—my friend Senator Marshall was an electrician many years ago—may be in a variety of industries during—
—They are not workers; they are contractors.
—Some of them are workers. Senator Marshall was a worker.
—The point is it applies to employers as well as—

(Senator Lightfoot)—I suggest you continue your private meeting outside.
—Senator Murray makes a valid point. Electricians can be both workers and contractors because of the form of definition that is used. But they can work in a variety of industries during the day. This is a nightmare for workers who are going to have to operate under this system because they will never know when they have trod on the by-line or the side line, when they are in play or when they are out of play. I suspect that a lot of workers are going to find themselves in a position where they are breaching the law in ignorance. That is not only bad legislation and bad law, it is an impossible position to put any citizen in—where they find themselves in a position of breaching the law in ignorance. That is exactly what this government is doing with this legislation if it is passed by this chamber.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-06,"—Again Senator Abetz ducked my question, so let me remind him of it because I think it is an important question. Earlier on in the exchange, he indicated that there were forms of industrial action that would have been legal between 9 March and today which, after the passing of that legislation, will be illegal. I do not know what they are. He suggested to me that if I read the legislation I would know. I have read the legislation and, quite frankly, I do not know.
If Senator Abetz knows that there is some form of industrial action that is going to be legal today and illegal after the passing of this bill, he ought to be able to tell us what it is. He is relying on the fact that a press release put out on 9 March said that everyone—the hundreds of thousands of people that this legislation is going to affect—should know what they are doing and whether it is legal or not. He does not seem to be able to tell us and I suspect it is because he does not know either. If he does not know, the advisers next to him do not know and cannot tell him and he cannot advise this chamber, how can he expect the hundreds of thousands of workers who are going to be covered by this bill to know? How can he expect them, by making this sort of legislation retrospective, to understand what sort of action they were taking?
I think it is absolutely incumbent upon this government to tell us what form of action is going to be changed in its status by the passing of this bill. I think that is the very least he can do. If he does not know and the department cannot tell us then he should advise us honestly of that situation so that at least may be some defence for those people who were expected to know. I do not really know how this government expects them to know. But that is what happens when you apply retrospective legislation. There is an expectation that people should know the changing status of the law. It is a big call, but it is a call this government has made. So maybe the minister could answer my question: what form of industrial action that is legal today, or between 9 March and today, will be made illegal with the passing of this bill?",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—It will come as a surprise to listeners and anybody in the Senate to know that this bill contains only 78 clauses. If Senator Marshall had read the bill as he has asserted, he did not even get halfway, because clause 36 of the bill outlines that industrial action that does not meet the requirements for protected action will be unlawful. Protected action is only available in the context of negotiating a single business agreement. It is all there in black and white in the legislation. Senator Marshall has embarrassed himself, unfortunately, with his question.
In relation to the stiff penalties and the reason for particular legislation for this industry, the royal commission in fact made recommendations to that effect. It highlighted the belief amongst the construction industry participants that breaking the law does not have any real consequences. This has resulted in an industry plagued by unlawful conduct. To change this culture it is necessary to make the penalty regime appropriate to the circumstances of the industry. The maximum penalty under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is $33,000 for a body corporate or $6,600 for an individual. These are relatively small amounts when compared with the value of building and construction projects.
Unlawful conduct must attract serious consequences if the rule of law is to be restored as the foundation of workplace relations practices in the construction industry. For example, one head contractor, on being told of the maximum penalty—it was then $10,000—responded: ‘Ten thousand dollars? I will call my secretary in with the petty cash tin to take care of it now.’ That is the sort of culture that those opposite, unfortunately, are defending by their actions in this debate.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-06,"—Yet again we have a minister who refuses to answer the specific issues and deal with the debate. There are some senators in this place whose contributions are characterised by an understanding of the policy issues or the legal issues before them and a discussion of those is what characterises their contributions to the debate. There are others who like to act as one of those players on a football field who goes after the player and not the ball. I will leave it to the audience to work out which category the minister falls into.
It is interesting that the minister had a go at Senator Marshall for not having read the bill. He said that, if you read section 36, that tells you what unlawful industrial action is. Actually, unlawful industrial action is dealt with in section 37. Section 37 defines ‘unlawful industrial action’. It makes reference to the issues of industrial motivation and constitutionally connected action. It provides that such action is obviously not excluded action, which, as the minister did correctly point out, is either action taken in furtherance of an AWA or is protected action under the Workplace Relations Act.
The reason the minister cannot answer Senator Marshall’s question is that the government does not know. What the government has done is put in place a broad definition of ‘unlawful industrial action’—a new statutory concept that is not in place under the Workplace Relations Act. It has created far greater penalties in relation to this unlawful industrial action concept that it has now introduced for the purposes of the building industry and it has made it retrospective.
The minister will say, ‘Why won’t Labor support this bill?’ if this is not passed. There are two issues here. Firstly, as Senator Murray correctly points out, there is the issue of retrospectivity and in what circumstances it is appropriate for a government or a legislature to pass retrospective legislation. Is it appropriate, when you are imposing penalties in relation to action which previously was not unlawful, to make it retrospective? Clearly that is not the way we approach most legislative tasks. The minister keeps saying that there are times when retrospectivity is appropriate, and there are, but they are generally associated with either remedial legislation—legislation to fix up something which the parliament has passed; it may be beneficial legislation—or legislation such as tax laws where there is a clear public policy argument for making the legislation retrospective, subsequent to the announcement of what the tax scale should be.
Secondly, the minister keeps being asked by Senator Marshall and other senators: ‘What is the action which will now be rendered unlawful that was not?’ The minister keeps being asked to explain why this should be made retrospective. His only response to the latter question is a continued diatribe about unlawfulness in the building industry and the accusation that if Labor do not support the retrospectivity argument then we somehow support lawlessness in the building industry. That is a very interesting non sequitur—one that the minister feels compelled to make—that does nothing other than demonstrate the paucity of his argument.
We have indicated that we are opposed to these bills because we do not believe that they will assist in the satisfactory resolution of issues within the building and construction industry. We are, in general, opposed to creating specific industrial jurisdictions for specific industries. We are specifically and particularly opposed to retrospective penalties and increased penalties being applied to one sector in excess of those applied in another sector. We are concerned—and Senator Marshall has raised this—about the definition of ‘construction industry’ being so broad that employers and employees who have not previously been considered part of the industry are now covered by the provisions of this bill. We are also concerned about the restrictions on collective bargaining and the right to strike, and about the arguable breach of Australia’s ILO conventions.
That is a thumbnail sketch of some of the reasons why Labor are opposed to these bills. Given that we are discussing an issue of retrospectivity, it would be good if the minister, instead of simply accusing those opposite of somehow supporting lawlessness—which is not true—could come up with a cogent argument as to why we ought to make legislation retrospective to render unlawful actions which were previously within the law and to substantially increase the penalties for engaging in those actions. In his previous contribution I think the minister conceded by implication that this legislation is about taking on a particular trade union. We welcome that concession.
The minister made reference to the bottom-of-the-harbour tax evasion schemes and said that there we had a situation where someone unfairly enriched themselves and therefore retrospective legislation was required. I have to say I am not across the detail of the bottom-of-the-harbour tax evasion issue. I have read about it. Obviously I was fairly young at the time. I think I was in Malaysia at the time. It does seem interesting to me that the analogy is drawn between people enriching themselves unlawfully at the expense of taxpayers and employees seeking to advance their industrial interests. That is what this unlawful industrial action talks about. It talks about people ‘advancing industrial objectives of an industrial association’, ‘disrupting the performance of work’ and various other things. Some of those things, arguably, would be able to be regulated under the Workplace Relations Act.
Why is it that the minister believes that there is some argument that connects people who are evading tax with employees who are furthering their industrial interests and somehow that is the basis for justifying retrospectivity? It is not a justification for retrospectivity. We say that the government should reconsider the commencement date of this legislation. The point put by Senator Murray, and a point I also made in this debate, is this: even if one agreed with the contents of this legislation, which Labor do not, one would need separately to be convinced of the need for the retrospective introduction of penalty clauses. Really, when you are infringing a principle against retrospective penalisation of the actions of citizens, you need an argument that is a little more cogent and weighty than a general diatribe about lawlessness in the building industry—which everyone in this chamber would not support.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—Talking about diatribes, I take Senator Wong back to the former Labor government taking specific action against a particular trade union called the BLF. It is funny that that has not been raised before by those opposite. Even the Labor government at that time saw the need to take specific action against a particular union because of allegations of corruption et cetera. I think we know the very sordid history of the BLF. I think it would be fair to say that the Cole royal commission exposed similar allegations. It would not surprise me if certain elements of the BLF had simply regrouped in the new CFMEU, but I dare say that is a matter of speculation.
Suffice to say that, after hearing the evidence, an independent royal commissioner—so it is not my diatribe—determined that there was a culture of illegality and lawlessness within the building industry. We believe that ought to be cleaned up. Suggestions have been made that to clean that up you need stiffer penalties to deal with that particular culture. That is the proposition we are putting to this parliament. Ultimately, it is for a vote. I think we have now bounced the ball backwards and forwards sufficiently.
I know that Senator Wong and Senator Marshall do not like my answers, but that does not mean that their questions have not been answered. What I think is shown is that they disagree with my answers and they disagree with the government’s reasons. That is fine—that is what happens in debate. But to make the bald assertion that their questions have not been answered is patently false and will be shown to be so in the Hansard. The fact is that we believe that there is a need to start this legislation on 9 March to ensure that industry parties do not take advantage of the time between the bill’s introduction and its passage to engage in unlawful or antisocial conduct of the sort identified by the Cole royal commission. I can understand that former CFMEU officials and other trade union officials in this place would disagree with that. I accept that and I understand it. But, just because you disagree, that does not mean that the point has not been engaged by the government. I suggest that, given the time, we might in fact move to the vote.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-06,"—That is a good try. We get constant rhetorical flourishes from the Special Minister of State, but I cannot see how he has answered the questions. Just for the record, let me ask the questions again before I go on to debunk some of his arguments about justification for retrospectivity. Minister, in case you are confused about what questions have been asked—because I cannot see how you have attempted to answer them—tell me: what form of industrial action that is currently lawful or that currently falls within the definition of protected action may be rendered unlawful by the bill? Will those taking part in such action be retrospectively subjected to sanctions and greater penalties under this bill? Think about that, and maybe your advisers can give you some advice as well.
You have talked about how there is some general acceptance and said, ‘We do not like retrospectivity but it is a fairly regular occurrence.’ I think there is a significant difference in what we are talking about, and I want to explore that for a moment. The department went to some pains to demonstrate to us that there were significant precedents. They advised the committee that there were over 100 bills with retrospective effect that had been noted in reports of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. But, as Senator Murray rightly pointed out during the committee hearings, the vast majority of those bills either had a beneficial effect, made technical amendments or related to taxation measures.
At the time, the departmental officers conceded that there were only four bills that imposed penalties retrospectively—and that is what we are talking about. They relied on those four bills as precedents. One of those bills was the Criminal Code Amendment (Anti-hoax and Other Measures) Bill 2002. At the time, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee wrote to the Attorney-General expressing the view that retrospectively declaring something to be a crime would establish an unfortunate and undesirable precedent. At the time, the Attorney-General wrote back to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee—and the committee has put this in its report, and that has been tabled in the Senate—and gave an assurance to the committee and to the Senate that that bill would not be used as a precedent.
I ask the minister: why did the department use that bill as a precedent, given the assurance from the Attorney-General that it would not be used as a precedent? What status can we then give to assurances given by government ministers? We understand that the executive arm of government very regularly overturns assurances given by ministers. We do not have to go back too far to the rock-solid guarantee that was given to Minister Abbott to defend the Strengthening Medicare program, on which you spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising. We could also go to the core promises of Prime Minister Howard that became non-core promises after an election in similar circumstances. I think it is a new low when departmental officers can overturn assurances given by ministers. That is a sign of a fairly arrogant government. Why does the department simply ignore assurances given to the Senate by the Attorney-General? What confidence can we have in further assurances given to the Senate by government ministers?",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—For the benefit of Senator Marshall—and it is a bit tedious, I confess—who asks about what industrial actions will be not allowed, as I indicated to him, he should have started at section 36, which talks about unlawful industrial action and what it means.
—Why do you have to do that? Haven’t you got anything better to say?
—Senator Wong, I wish you wouldn’t play the person but instead listen to the answers being given. It is not very becoming. Section 37 talks about the definition of—
—How many women are there on the Tasmanian Senate ticket? Remind me—it is a number between zero and six.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! Senator Abetz, continue with your answer.
—Thank you. I received the highest vote ever in Tasmanian political history! The definition of unlawful industrial action—
—You did not have a quota. There were lots of women on your ticket!
—To have scored that sort of vote, Mr Temporary Chairman, as you would know, undoubtedly a large number of Tasmanian women would have voted for me. That certain elements of the feminist class do not like the fact that people like me attract such a lot of support—

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Order!
—Clause 37 of the bill is entitled ‘Definition of unlawful industrial action’ and states:
Building industrial action—
which is previously defined in clause 36—that is why I referred Senator Marshall to clause 36 beforehand—
is unlawful industrial action if:
(a)      the action is industrially-motivated; and
(b)      the action is constitutionally-connected action; and
(c)      the action is not excluded action.
That is the legislation. Then you go back to clause 36 to find out the definitions of ‘constitutionally connected action’, ‘excluded action’, ‘industrially motivated’ and ‘building industrial action’. So it is quite clear. All that Senator Marshall has to do is in fact read the legislation and all his questions will be answered for him.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-06,"—Despite Senator Abetz’s rhetorical flourish, he has ducked the question. It was the minister who told us that some industrial action that is legal today is going to be rendered illegal after the passing of this bill. That was the question I asked him, and he cannot tell us what it is. And then he goes through the bill and says, ‘It is all in the legislation.’ I have read all that, and the reason I asked you that question, Minister, is that I could not work it out. I could not work out what form of industrial action becomes illegal. This is the purpose of the committee stage. You were able to tell me quite clearly that there was some, and when asked what that was, you did not know and you referred us to bits of the legislation which relate to different other bits of the legislation as if that were an answer. That is no answer, Minister; that is no answer at all. That is just your trying to grasp at straws and trying to impress people by picking up the bill and going to different clauses. I do not know what that is supposed to prove. Minister, if you cannot answer the question, if you do not know the answer and you want to correct what you said earlier, why don’t you simply do that instead of going on with that sort of gobbledegook?",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—It looks as though I will have to read it into the Hansard for the benefit of Senator Marshall. Then those listening in can understand that Senator Marshall, whilst having been directed to where the answer lies, unfortunately simply cannot comprehend what the legislation says. It says:

building industrial action means:
the performance of building work in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to building work, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work, where:
the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed, wholly or partly, by an industrial instrument or an order of an industrial body; or
the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in connection with an industrial dispute (within the meaning of subsection (4)); or
a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work, or on acceptance of or offering for building work, in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed by an industrial instrument or by an order of an industrial body; or
a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work, or on acceptance of or offering for building work, that is adopted in connection with an industrial dispute (within the meaning of subsection (4)); or
        a failure or refusal by persons to attend for building work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend for building work;
        but does not include ...
I can keep reading until two o’clock, but I think it is pretty clear now that it is all in the legislation. I just could not believe, and that is why I was not grasping, Senator Marshall’s question. He asserted that he had read the legislation, but he could not come to grips with it. That is quite obvious and I can understand that. So that is why I am happy to read quite large slabs of it into the Hansard, so that people who want to follow this debate can have an understanding of what we as a government are seeking to do. We are, without apology, seeking to clean up the building and construction industry.
I remind those opposite that even a Labor government in either 1986 or 1987 found the need to deal with the Builders Labourers Federation. They deliberately had them deregistered. It was a particular action against a particular union because of illegality. And now a royal commission has determined that there is a similar culture within the building industry again, which I suppose might beg the question whether or not certain elements of the BLF have now found themselves in the CFMEU. Unfortunately, that same culture that existed under the BLF seems to have re-emerged within the CFMEU. As a government concerned about the welfare of this country we want to clean that up. The building and construction industry represents about seven per cent of GDP. Seven hundred thousand people are employed in it. It is vitally important that the illegality and unlawfulness that were disclosed by the Cole royal commission be weeded out, and it is a pity that those opposite have admitted that even if the Democrat amendments were to be passed they would still oppose the legislation. And what is their way forward? They have no proposals of their own to put forward.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-09-06,"—My question is to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin. I refer to table 3 on page 10.4 of Budget Paper No. 1, which shows Telstra sale proceeds for each financial year over three years beginning in 2006-07 at $11.28 billion. Can the minister confirm that these sale proceeds are based on a share price of $5.25? Does the minister still stand by the government’s own budget figures, which were released less than four months ago?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-09-06,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The projections or forecasts are based on $5.25 a share. Given that the Telstra share price is $4.30 as of lunchtime today, a drop of approximately 18 per cent since the budget, when will the government adjust its projection of sale proceeds down to a more realistic level? When will the budget papers actually reflect reality? Does the minister agree that, as the Financial Review today described, the sale process is ‘beginning to resemble one of those John Cleese management training videos’? When is the minister going to take some responsibility for the government’s mismanagement and correct the projection of sale proceeds that are included in this year’s budget?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-09-06,"—The government has for some time provided in the budget papers for the possible sale of Telstra and the consequences for the budget of such a sale because it is government policy to sell our remaining shares in Telstra. Therefore, certain assumptions must be made and are reflected in the budget. We have repeatedly stated that what is in the budget is an accounting assumption for budgetary purposes and does not reflect in any way any decision as to what price the government might receive for its shares or any decision about the structure of the sale or any other matter. For the purposes of budget preparation we have made an accounting assumption—without any government decision having been made as to how in fact Telstra would be sold and at what price—that it would be sold in three tranches and at a price that has been derived without much effort.
I stress that that price of $5.25—and I have said this on many occasions, as have Senator Coonan, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister—is not a target price for the government’s sale. It does not reflect any decision about a price that the government would accept or seek in relation to Telstra’s sale, nor have we made a decision that we will sell in three tranches.
The government’s clear position is this: we seek the legislative authority to enable the executive to make a decision as to whether or not to sell its shares. We do not have that particular luxury. We are denied at the moment by law any authority to sell. We seek the legislative authority to be able to make a decision as to whether or not we sell. As I have said on many occasions, if the parliament grants us that authority then it would be my intention to come back to the cabinet in the first quarter of next year with advice based on professional expert advice as to whether or not the government should proceed to a sale in the course of 2006 and under what circumstances. But I stress that the assumptions in the budget papers do not reflect any government decisions and do not reflect in any way a target price.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-09-06,"—I can only repeat what I said: they are merely accounting assumptions for the purposes of budget preparation and do not reflect any government decisions. The $5.25 to which you refer is actually based on the price back in 2002 when this assumption was first introduced into the budget and it is merely indexed by the growth in the ASX, which is seven per cent per annum. Obviously, the Telstra share price has not reflected that in total. The great tragedy is that the Labor Party have cost Australian taxpayers $54 billion. By their denial of our authority to sell all our shares at the time of T2, they have denied shareholders $54 billion. The federal government is worth $54 billion less than it otherwise would be because of this idiotic ideological opposition to the further sale of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-09-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked today relating to Telstra.
What a complete and utter fiasco. I think it has been best summed up by Michael Sainsbury today. In talking about Mr Trujillo, he said:
On the upside he has cracked open the conspiracy of silence that has shrouded Telstra for half a decade.
I hope you do stay, Senator Joyce. I hope you are not dragged out of the chamber like you were during question time and on previous occasions. There he is, being dragged out again. Michael Sainsbury continued:
It is a conspiracy that had the tacit consent of government, Telstra’s board and management and the global investment banks. The aim was to get Telstra ready for sale in an orderly manner and keep the company’s share price as high as possible.
Things were humming along OK until Trujillo’s arrival. With no hand in glove relationship with Canberra he has made public, frank and honest comments about the state of the telco’s business, and it’s not pretty.
Is that not the truth? Mr Trujillo, upon opening up Telstra’s books when he arrived, discovered that Telstra had gone out of its way to underinvest in its network, deliver a second-class service and not provide cutting-edge technology to the Australian public. He also discovered that it could use its money to buy back its own shares, engage in high-dividend payouts and, on top of that, special dividend payouts. This is a policy carried out with the connivance of the government for one reason and one reason only: the government wants to keep Telstra fattened up for sale. It has engaged in all of these policies, designed to make sure that Telstra’s share price is inflated, so that it can get as much as it can when it flogs off Telstra.
But the honesty of Mr Trujillo has ripped the fig leaf off John Howard and Minister Coonan. He has exposed the situation for what it is. The document that I sent to the Stock Exchange today blows the whistle on the conspiracy. A couple of weeks ago, on 11 August, Mr Trujillo handed to the Prime Minister a document that blew the whistle. It was a document that said: ‘We are paying dividends out of reserves and borrowings. This is unsustainable.’ The Telstra board has said that it is unsustainable to keep propping up the share price in the way this government has wanted it to do. The government knows this is the case. It knows this is the board’s view. And what has the government done? Nothing.
Mum and dad shareholders out there today are watching their share price tank because this government is sitting on information that should be in the marketplace. It has been leaked to journalists. It has been given to the major shareholder. It has been leaked around to some institutions. That is why the share price is tanking—that and the information supplied by Telstra yesterday about some of its revenue forecasts. That is what has happened. But has there been a statement to the Stock Exchange so that mum and dad shareholders can get the same fair go that others are now getting? The government, John Howard and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, are sitting there mum. This is a disgrace. While the share price is falling, the wealth of mums and dads in this country is suffering, because this government cannot afford to have the truth exposed that it has been engaged in propping up the price of Telstra’s shares just to flog it off.
What Mr Burgess has said may be harsh words. They have definitely upset the minister and the Prime Minister. In fact, things are so bad, I understand, that Mr Trujillo and Minister Coonan are not speaking. Instead of phoning the relevant minister about the fact that they were going to make a Stock Exchange announcement, who did Mr Trujillo phone? Senator Minchin. He did not ring Senator Coonan, the prevailing minister. They are not even speaking, things are so bad. Because Mr Trujillo continues to tell the truth: Telstra have not done the job. We have 141,000 phone lines in Australia with faults. Is that up to scratch? The Prime Minister and the minister for communications say that services are adequate; services are up to scratch. Five years of rhetoric has been blown away. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-09-06,"—Senator Conroy talks about the government’s conspiracy to sell Telstra. Well, it is some conspiracy. This has been on the agenda for nine years. This legislation has come to the Senate twice before. There have been two very extensive inquiries into the sale of Telstra. It has not exactly been a secret that this government was going to sell Telstra, Senator Conroy. It has been on the agenda of the Howard government since it was elected in 1996. So, far from being a secret conspiracy, it has been one of the most open and well-known policies of the Howard government.
The reason for wanting to sell Telstra is very simple and very clear, and that is that the government do not need to own it to regulate it. We are providing a very comprehensive set of regulations which will provide for a very effective telecommunications service to the people of Australia and, in particular, will protect the interests of the people in regional Australia as part of the package for this sale. Furthermore, the government consider the sale of Telstra to be in the interests of the company, its shareholders, the wider telecommunications industry and, as I have said already, most importantly of all, the people of Australia.
There are a number of reasons for supporting the sale of Telstra, which Senator Conroy, I am sure, is well aware of. Firstly, the private sector is much better placed than the government to make judgments about the risks of share ownership. Secondly, it will allow Telstra to realise its full potential as one of Australia’s most important companies in the information age and to make operational and investment decisions on the same basis as its competitors, such as Optus and AAPT. Thirdly, as I have said already, it will remove the inherent conflict of interest that exists when the government has the job of setting the rules for all phone companies while at the same time having a direct financial interest in the biggest one of all.
That is the case for selling Telstra. It is a very good case and a very sensible case. When he was Labor communications minister, Kim Beazley corporatised Telstra and required Telstra to act like a private company. Now we are making it a private company so that it can realise its full potential in the market and provide adequate services, good services and even better services to the people of Australia.
One of the great achievements of the Howard government in telecommunications has been the deregulation of the telecommunications industry. When we came to office there was one telco. There are now over 100 telcos providing services to the Australian people, offering competition and offering a diversity of services. As a result of that, better services and lower prices are being provided to the people of Australia. Telecommunications prices have dropped dramatically as a result of competition.
In particular, the people of regional Australia are much better off than they ever were under Labor. Labor had no real interest in the people of regional Australia but, as a result of the programs that the Howard government has introduced, such as Networking the Nation and encouraging competition, telecommunications services in the regions are certainly much better. In particular, we now for example have Optus offering satellite based broadband across the whole of this country, so no-one anywhere in this country should be without access to broadband. Telstra, through Telstra Country Wide, has responded to that competition and it has greatly improved its services in the regions. In contrast, the ALP’s record in government on telecommunications was particularly appalling. It was very bad and Australia was a long way behind. Let us take the next step, and do it quickly, and make Telstra a fully privatised company so that it can operate in the marketplace and can offer better services to the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,4,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2005-09-06,"—I think Senator Eggleston nailed the noble aim: you do not need to own Telstra, or any telecommunications company, to regulate it. Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, referred to that in her answers to questions. She said that Telstra will be held to its service guarantees. But that is exactly the problem that the current CEO of Telstra is highlighting: if Telstra is held to those service guarantees and to the regulations that the government has announced, its share price is going to drop and it is going to go broke. The government has to be held accountable for that.
The government might have noble aspirations but they are not going about fulfilling them very well. They might have had nine long years during which they wanted to sell Telstra but they still have not managed to get the sale process right. They are in a dreadful quandary. They are facing a number of questions to which they do not seem to have the answers. There are questions about whether to put in regulations which are sufficient to buy The Nationals’ vote on this or whether to help ordinary Australians who are currently shareholders in the T2 package by having lighter regulation of Telstra.
Another question is: do they expose Telstra to true competition or keep some monopoly there so that the Telstra share price is held up and they get the kind of sale price that they want for their own shareholding? They have questions like whether they enshrine the separation in legislation or whether they succumb to pressure to put it in regulation to give the company more flexibility down the line. The key question, and the reason why the Labor Party has consistently opposed the sale of Telstra, is: do they sell Telstra and lose control of the company or do they keep control of Telstra and keep control of vital infrastructure and vital communications technology in this country?
They are the kinds of questions that they appear to have not been able to resolve. That is a result of continuing mismanagement and of trying to prop up the share price of Telstra while dealing with National Party objections. They are talking about enforcing regulation and they are talking about enforcing service guarantees, but their policies have reduced Telstra to a state where Telstra are saying that it is almost impossible to fulfil those because the service is so run down, because the equipment is so old, because the work force is ageing and because Telstra have failed to replace obsolete equipment. Telstra have also put themselves in a position where they are not able to innovate as well as they would like because of both their run-down equipment and their ageing work force.
For the minister to say that services are well and truly adequate is laughable. The new CEO of Telstra, Sol Trujillo, has well and truly exposed that. The minister chooses to deny it. She chooses to try to push ahead to retain control of Telstra by regulation and by apparently wanting to put a couple of directors on the board, and yet still sell the government’s shareholding in Telstra and expose it to privatisation. It is impossible to do everything that the government says it wants to do. The government is promising all of these conflicting things because it wants National Party support in this chamber to sell Telstra. The National Party appear to have rolled over on that and to be supporting the sale, even though it will disadvantage people not only in regional areas but also right around Australia. That is well illustrated by the fact that people in this chamber will not see the details of the regulations that are meant to control Telstra before they are required to vote on the sale.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-09-06,"—I will make one concession to Senator Hurley in this debate. She obviously believes that Labor have taken a quite different approach to this issue at this point in time. But had Labor been re-elected back in 1996, we would not be having this debate today, because they would have sold Telstra a long time ago, like they sold the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas Airways, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and so forth. It would have been long gone by now, and we would not be having this debate.
Let us look at some of the arguments that have been put forward in today’s question time by the opposition. They say that Telstra services are inadequate and that the fact that 140-odd thousand phone lines at any particular point in time are experiencing service difficulties proves that Telstra services are inadequate. I will say a couple of things about that. First of all, in a country where there are 20 million people, and probably about as many mobile and fixed phones, it would not be particularly surprising that that number of phone lines at any given point in time might be experiencing service difficulties. That is no great revelation, I would have thought.
In arguing as they have done today that the services provided by Telstra are inadequate, the fact is that the opposition are ignoring the clear evidence about what Australians think about the services that Telstra offers. Only three weeks ago in this place the opposition were quick to point to opinion polls which demonstrated that Australians did not want the government to sell Telstra. Fair enough. There was fairly clear evidence in that opinion poll on that question. I concede that. But that same opinion poll—I think it was by Newspoll—also indicated something else about what Australians thought of Telstra—that is, they thought that the standard of service being offered by Telstra was pretty good. That was the view of both metropolitan and country Australians, and it was a view quite consistently held around the country irrespective of the region. Australians felt that there was a high-quality service being offered by Telstra.
That does not gel with what has been said today in the course of this debate and in the course of question time today; it gels with a campaign which is designed to run down Telstra and to talk down its shares. I have to say it is a matter of great discredit to the Australian Labor Party that in that respect it runs along the same pathway and indeed holds hands with some elements of Telstra’s management who at the present time are apparently going to some pains to put pressure on the government by talking down the value of Telstra shares to get a better deal out of the government in its regime for privatising the rest of Telstra.
That is a shameful position for the opposition to take, and a pretty discreditable one for the management of Telstra to be taking as well. To be quite frank, I think that for an executive of the level of the gentleman from Telstra to talk down the value of Telstra shares in the way that he did this week is pretty disgraceful. The fact is that the reason for that reaction from Telstra—I am not sure what the reason for the reaction of the Labor Party is—is that they do not like the conditions that are being imposed on them by the federal government as a precursor to privatisation. They do not like the requirement to provide services into regional and rural Australia at the standard which Australians have come to expect around the country. They do not like the idea that there are limits on foreign ownership. They do not like the idea that they are expected to provide for directors on their board that have experience in regional and rural Australia’s problems. But these are the requirements that the government will unequivocally place on them, because we believe that standards must be set.
We also believe that the most important standard to be set is that government should get out of the business of closely controlling all the elements of one particular player in the marketplace—that is, Telstra—and get back into the business of regulating the whole of the marketplace on an even-handed basis. That is the job of government. We are not doing that job properly if we have one of those players, albeit the biggest player, sitting there as an asset of the Commonwealth government. It is a clear conflict of interest, and our plans will remove that conflict of interest and create the proverbial level playing field. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-09-06,"—I am pleased Senator Humphries acknowledges that part of this debate has to be about standard setting, because in her answers today the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts revealed that the Howard government has no intention of guaranteeing a decent level of telecommunications service to the Australian people. Although the minister wants to ram the highly controversial full privatisation of Telstra through the parliament in record time, the regulations that will govern its competition—
—Nine years!
—Yes, record time: six days consideration for five pieces of legislation. It is record time, Senator Hill. Although that is what the government aims to do, the regulations that will govern its competition with other service providers will not be ready for some months. Yet again, we see the government rushing through with half the job but not coming forward and setting out those standards for all of us to see. What is more, those regulations will be drafted with the assistance of Telstra—the same Telstra that is baulking at the government’s supposed requirements.
This is an absolute recipe for disaster. Telstra’s directors have mounted an aggressive campaign for lax regulations. As has been referred to by Senator Conroy, Phil Burgess, who heads Telstra’s regulatory unit, reportedly told an audience at the National Press Club that Telstra was so heavily overregulated he would not even recommend the stock to his mother. It will be interesting to read that assessment in the T3 prospectus when it comes time for the sale! Telstra’s directors are strongly opposed to providing a decent minimum level of service, and they are strongly opposed to regulations that guarantee that service. These are the people who will do a secret backroom deal with the minister on regulation; that is, of course, after the National Party has sold out on its constituents. The National Party will vote for the privatisation of Telstra without knowing how it will be regulated. What a disgrace.
It is all well and good for the likes of Senator McGauran to tell the press that the regulations will be made here in parliament and in the Senate and not outside in the boardroom. But the regulations are going to be drafted with the assistance of Telstra, and we have learnt today that what Senator McGauran has said is not the case. The parliament and the Senate will ram through the sale of Telstra before the regulations are ready. The National Party will pat itself on the back for squeezing out a few measly dollars for infrastructure and then a couple of months down the track Telstra will draft the regulations.
But it is not just the Queensland Nationals and not just Queenslanders, nor is it just Australians in rural and regional areas, who will suffer when Australia is privatised. We have read in the newspapers this week that Mr Sol Trujillo plans to slash services by up to 80 per cent, a plan that will affect all Australians. Mr Trujillo also plans to slash as many jobs as he can. The result will be even worse customer service and even worse responses to complaints and problems, and that result will be felt by all Australians. In my home town of Perth the situation is particularly dire. The West Australian on 22 August this year quoted one of Australia’s leading telecommunications analysts as saying:
To be honest, the situation in Perth is worse than regional Australia—
it is a pity that Senator Eggleston is not here to hear this—
there are more suburbs in Perth that have greater problems with getting good quality broadband ...
I would say that perhaps even as much as half of Perth does not have a network that can be upgraded to good quality services, and an enormous amount of investment is needed to make that happen.
We need to make sure that that National Party money does not all go to Queensland but that some of it comes to the West. The expert concluded by saying that not only do many suburbs of Perth suffer from broadband black spots—Canning Vale, Maylands, Wanneroo, Hamersley, Beechboro, Doubleview and even Fremantle, just to name a few—but that:
... Perth is one of the country’s black spots
A city of over a million people is one of the country’s black spots. Perth is a capital city that has suffered from nine long years of underinvestment in infrastructure to the extent that telecommunications experts say that the whole metropolitan area is a black spot—all of the capital city of Perth. That is an absolute indictment of Telstra and of the Howard government. And we are not even talking about the problems facing rural and regional Western Australia. (Time expired)

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-09-06,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That:
the following bills be introduced:
Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005, and
Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005; and
the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to these bills allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL


TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER ISSUES) BILL


Purpose of the bills

The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill allows for the full sale of Telstra and necessary consequential amendments.
In relation to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill, changes to the telecommunications regulatory regime will be made to maximise the regulatory regime’s capability to respond to market developments and emerging networks as well as changing consumer needs. The bill improves investment certainty and the operation of the telecommunications specific anti-competitive conduct and access regulations. It also introduces an operation separation framework to provide equivalence and transparency of Telstra’s wholesale and retail operations. The bill improves the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s power to respond to consumer interests, makes amendments in relation to the requirements for Industry Development Plans, and makes a range of other minor amendments including to the numbering plan regime.

Reasons for Urgency

The bills are part of a package of measures relating to the further privatisation of the government’s remaining shareholding in Telstra and future proofing of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia.
Passage of these bills is therefore necessary to ensure that these measures are in place before 1 January 2006 to provide the necessary regulatory framework to “future proof” telecommunications services in regional Australia.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-06,"—When the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005 were in committee previously, we were discussing the issue of retrospectivity and Senator Abetz, for the government, justified the retrospectivity of the legislation on the basis of what he termed lawlessness—the lawlessness of the building industry. It is interesting to consider what ‘lawlessness’ actually means. I presume it means an absence of law. My recollection of what was found during the Cole royal commission was not so much that there was an absence of regulatory power but that there were problems with the enforcement of existing legislation. That really goes to the nub of some of the issues that the opposition has with this legislation.
Instead of dealing with some of the specific issues of enforcement of existing regulation, for example, what the government is seeking to do is to create a new bureaucracy with coercive powers and furthermore to create a new legislative framework with specific application to one sector of industry, the building industry. Moreover, the government is seeking to introduce the penalty provisions retrospectively. As I have indicated before, what that means is that actions by individual employees, possibly by unions and potentially by contractors—as Senator Murray has also pointed out, the definition would apply to subcontractors on a building site or in the building industry, which is a wider proposition—which were lawful at the time they were taken would now be deemed to be unlawful.
As yet, the only explanation we have had from the minister as to why there is such a compelling case for retrospectivity is a general diatribe about lawlessness. We on this side of the chamber say that the test should be higher for this parliament to pass legislation that renders acts which were previously lawful unlawful and exposes Australian citizens to substantial penalty provisions. As yet, we have not heard from this government a cogent defence of the retrospectivity aspect of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,14,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-06,"—Senator Wong makes an excellent point. I have a couple of outstanding questions which I put to the minister prior to the resumption of this debate. I hope I will get answers to them. To follow on from what Senator Wong said, if there is a special need for the retrospectivity, you would think that would have come out of the royal commission, given what this government has said during its rhetorical flourishes and the extreme ideological position it keeps putting before the Senate. The royal commission actually found that the number of incidents of unprotected action in the building and construction industry was very small, especially when considered in the context of the industry as a whole.
In relation to unprotected industrial action, the royal commission found only 24 incidents around the whole country since 1999. That is the actual finding of the royal commission. Over those years since 1999, there were four incidents in New South Wales, seven in Victoria, three in Queensland, two in South Australia, seven in Western Australia and one in Tasmania. Many of those incidents of unprotected action were very short and involved stoppages of no more than a few hours and frequently involved issues to do with site working conditions.
From 1999 until the end of the royal commission, there were 24 occasions when unprotected industrial action was taken. That is the finding of the royal commission. That is hardly the case for special circumstances. That is hardly the case for this legislation and the penalties that will apply. That is hardly the case for broadening the scope of building and construction work and potentially expanding the definition of unprotected industrial action. It is hardly the case for retrospectivity as put by the government. I wanted to get the facts on the record. Facts carry more weight than rhetorical flourishes from the minister. I am waiting for answers in respect of using cases as precedents, when we have had an assurance from the Attorney-General that they would not be used as precedents.
I am waiting on these answers from the government. The Attorney-General was very clear in that assurance and the department has breached that assurance. I would like a response from the government about what that assurance means and its value. The minister may also want to comment on what the Attorney-General at the time said:
An offence would only be made retrospective after careful consideration on a case by case basis and only where there are special circumstances necessitating retrospectivity, as they were in relation to the new hoax offence.
I have advised the Senate of the occasions when unprotected action was taken over those years as stated by the royal commission. That is hardly a special case. Maybe the minister can give us some details about the special case. Again, I refer him to the assurance given by the Attorney-General that that particular piece of legislation would not be used as a precedent. I asked this before question time. He has had his advisers available since then and there is no reason why the minister cannot answer that question. I call on him to do so.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,14,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—This is becoming painfully tedious. The Australian Labor Party is seeking to defend the indefensible in relation to the government trying to weed out the culture of illegality and unlawfulness which exists in the building and construction industry. That was the finding of the royal commission, something which Senator Marshall is now trying to deny. The reason I did not respond earlier was that Senator Marshall, as we have heard, has the full quote in front of him. The assurance related to criminal sanctions only and, moreover, was qualified as follows:
An offence would only be made retrospective after careful consideration on a case by case basis and only where there are special circumstances necessitating retrospectivity ...
In the debate last night, before question time today and now again, we bounce the ball backwards and forwards. In this situation, I think all parties in the Senate agree in general terms that retrospectivity should be avoided, if possible. However, we are all agreed that retrospectivity can be used from time to time—in other words, on a case-by-case basis. When the government examined the findings of the royal commission and the culture that unfortunately exists within the building and construction industry, it made a determination and on balance it believed that it was important to have this legislation made retrospective.
When I say ‘made retrospective’, on 9 March 2005 when the legislation was tabled it was announced that it was intended that the legislation would apply as of that date, so it is not the case that the people coming into this arena were completely surprised that the government had changed its mind. People were warned on 9 March 2005 that certain conduct would become illegal from that date onwards. So the suggestion that the Attorney-General gave an assurance et cetera, as embellished by Senator Marshall, is quite disingenuous. A statement was made that said that careful consideration would be made on a case-by-case basis. In other words, no such blanket guarantee was given as was so inappropriately suggested by Senator Marshall. I thought he was being disingenuous, and then when he read the quote out himself which says ‘on a case by case basis’, he must have known that no such blanket guarantee was given and that the government would—as one would expect—consider these situations on a case-by-case basis. That is exactly what we have done and, after consideration, we believe that it is important in this area to have retrospectivity so-called.
The parts of the present bill dealing with industrial action will operate retrospectively, but they do not impose criminal sanctions. So we are talking about criminal sanctions in relation to the assurance but this is on, if you like, a lower level. I indicate to you, Senator Marshall, that all the dissembling in the world will not enable you to get around the shameful fact that the Australian Labor Party are simply trying to protect the CFMEU in relation to this legislation. I accept that the Democrats come to this issue as a matter of principle, and I think Senator Murray and I had that discussion last night in relation to retrospectivity. On balance, we disagree with the Democrats’ approach, but we can fully understand their arguments. As I have pleaded on a number of occasions, let us put this to the vote and move on to the other issues that are before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,14,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-06,"—It is not surprising that this matter does not come to a vote when what has been put by opposition and crossbench senators is not adequately responded to and your contributions are imbued with language that describes opposition senators as disingenuous and dissembling and refers to the Labor Party being shameful and various other things. It is not surprising that opposition senators feel the need to correct the record and to put our views very clearly, which I will do again. We do not support criminal activity in any form. We do not support criminal activity in the building industry or anywhere else. We do not support, as you called it, ‘a culture of lawlessness’. We are not here to defend that. We have a difference of views—
—Well, then vote for the legislation.
—This is the problem with the illogical way in which the minister approaches this bill: he says, ‘If you do not agree with lawlessness then you have to vote for our bill.’ There is a step there that is an absolute non sequitur. There are those of us who do not believe that the Howard government’s prescription of retrospectively imposing penalties on a sector of the work force is the way to go forward. The minister says: ‘These are not criminal penalties. Therefore, it is okay.’ These are very substantial civil penalty provisions. I do not know why the minister is shaking his head. They are substantially greater penalties than currently exist under the Workplace Relations Act. They include $110,000 penalties for bodies corporate and $22,000 penalties for individuals.
The other justification the minister uses is that people have known since 9 March. I am aware that if you spend too much time in this place, sometimes you have the erroneous view that this is the centre of the universe and that people are interested in everything that is going on here. I regret to say that I do not think the great majority of the Australian people are that engaged with the detail of what occurs in this chamber or in the other place. I certainly do not think that the 250,000-plus people who work in the building industry would have been sitting on the edges of their seats waiting to examine the detail of legislation tabled in the chamber on 9 March. Somehow, I simply do not think that was likely. So to suggest that theoretically that justifies retrospectivity is really a fallacious argument. In any event, the ALP has put on the record its views about retrospectivity and about the amendments.

Looking at the sets of amendments I have put and will be putting on this legislation, I think three can legitimately be classed as amendments of principle. They concern advertising, retrospectivity and appointments on merit, which is in the amendment still to come. The fourth set are the only ones which you would regard as technical or trying to alter the framework of the legislation. I am moved to do so by a great concern. The Australian Democrats believe that the major problem with workplace relations law and indeed this industry is not so much the lack of law or sufficiently strong law but the lack of enforcement and that regulation and enforcement are weak.
I was quite interested by the analogy drawn by a couple of government speakers who remarked on how well they had done with respect to the waterfront dispute. By no means am I an expert on waterfronts—I am not much of an expert on building either, apart from once being a building labourer—but the crane rates achieved were higher than I expected. The point is that that entire exercise was achieved without changing the law. It was achieved within the existing framework of the existing law.
The point was made in the royal commission and has been made in the subsequent inquiry into this legislation that many of the transgressions of law outlined in the royal commission and in other circumstances have been transgressions of the criminal law, the tax law, the Corporations Law or state laws such as health and safety laws. If all the laws, including workplace relations laws, were properly enforced and the regulators were on the case, there would be no need for this industry specific legislation. I think the royal commission did a disservice by recommending industry specific legislation rather than the Democrats’ preferred choice of the introduction of a national workplace relations regulator with the powers that go with a national regulator across all industries and the enforcement of existing law.
At this moment it is against both criminal and workplace law to use duress in a workplace, and it is against both criminal law and any other law to steal from a building site. So the idea that our laws are inadequate at present is not persuasive. The idea that they are not properly enforced at present is persuasive. I make those remarks because how the legislation is framed affects its extent or scope. In the earlier discussion Senator Marshall drew attention to the fact that the definition under which this industry specific legislation applies is very material to the individuals, the contractors, the employers, the businesses and the union and employer organisations that are affected by it. There was evidence to the committee from all quarters that the definition as laid out was too broad.
We have therefore tried to narrow the definition. I will not call our definition the AiG definition, but the Australian Industry Group was extremely concerned by the extent of the government’s definition, as were the CEPU, the CFMEU and other contributors to the inquiry. Neither do I intend, unless the minister requires it, to go in depth through the way in which I have constructed the amendment, simply because the amendment has been before all parties, advisers and shadows for quite some time and I am sure they have had adequate time to pay attention to it. That is the framework around my amendments.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,14,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-06,"—Senator Murray makes a very good point about this. There is a continual and, I think, quite deliberate misrepresentation by the government that this legislation is aimed at criminal conduct and is designed to stamp out criminality, corruption, standover tactics, thuggery et cetera. There has been a common theme throughout nearly all the contributions of government members to the debate on this legislation. One wonders whether they have read this legislation and understand what it is about, because it does not go to those issues, and they ought to know that.
This legislation does a number of things. Let me go through them. Firstly, it broadens the scope of what may be defined as industrial action and provides for penalties to be imposed for new breaches of the Workplace Relations Act and for increased penalties on current offences, and all of this is to operate retrospectively from 9 March 2005. We are talking about normal industrial relations activity. We are talking about people attending meetings that may have not been authorised by their employer without putting in the appropriate notices and those notices only having been able to go in if those meetings were part of protected industrial action.
Let me give a practical example, so people can put this legislation into context. Let us say there was a serious injury on a building site—it may have involved a forklift or scaffolding—and the members in the immediate area stop work to find out what happened, what caused the accident and whether it would affect their ongoing work and then a meeting takes place. If that meeting were not authorised by the employer—and it may not have been; the employer may not have been on site at the time—that meeting would be considered unprotected industrial action. Under this legislation, every individual who participated in such a meeting could be fined $22,000. If the union in any way had an involvement in organising such a meeting to talk about the serious accident, they could be fined $110,000. In addition to that, they could all be liable for unspecified and unlimited damages.
Most normal people in a workplace would believe that it is their right to have a meeting and discuss what happened in circumstances such as that. But this legislation makes that illegal and applies enormous fines for working people and for unions, and I think that is a most unfortunate situation. None of that has anything to do with criminality. It does not have anything to do with organised crime, thuggery, intimidation or corruption. It is simple industrial relations—the normal things that will happen day to day.
I do not expect many government senators to understand how building sites might operate. Building sites are constantly moving. We have enormous productivity in the building industry in this country. Floors go up before your eyes, services follow the floors up as the concrete is laid, the centre of activity increases, amenity sheds are moved around and toilets are moved constantly. There are often situations where large numbers of employees are left without any amenities or toilets and situations where work cannot proceed in a normal manner without a meeting to discuss some of those situations. If that meeting or discussion, which meant people were unable to work, was not authorised by the employer, again under this legislation that will be deemed to be unprotected industrial action and there would be enormous fines applied and unlimited exposure to civil proceedings for damages. That is what we are talking about—normal industrial relations on a day-to-day basis. We are not talking about the situations that the government or the minister have talked about in this area.
What is driving it? Why is there the rush and why do the government want to make it retrospective? It is simply a crude attempt to stop unions and employers renegotiating certified agreements prior to the introduction of this government’s new, extreme agenda in industrial relations. Why did the government want to do that? They wanted to do it because they thought they were going to be ready with a whole swag of legislation which was going to tip the balance completely in favour of employers. They thought they would be able to drive into the industry AWAs and that they would be able to break the unions—which has been their real agenda throughout this process. There has been no evidence to the contrary.
The unions were seeking—with employers, I must say—to provide some certainty over the next three years, given the uncertain environment which we are all about to enter into in industrial relations, given what the government had stated was their industrial relations agenda. We have not seen the details of much of that—we have seen this legislation—but we have certainly heard the principles of what they want to do. I am not surprised that both employers and unions are seeking to have some stability, at least for the next three years, and to provide some certainty about working conditions and the business environment in which they want to work.
There was never any suggestion that employers and employees, through their unions, could not renegotiate certified agreements. It is legal to do so. In fact, the parties had agreed to do so. If the parties did not agree to do so, it could not be done. It had to take both parties to agree to do so. In fact, in most instances, the parties were obliged to do so as part of their existing certified agreements. The CFMEU has been mentioned—and I know what has happened in Victoria. The bulk of the building and construction industry CFMEU certified agreements were to expire in October anyway. My understanding is that nearly all of those agreements had clauses to say that negotiations for a new certified agreement would start no later than three months prior to the expiration of the existing agreement. So there was actually an obligation on the parties to begin negotiations on a new agreement.
Why do the parties want those clauses? They want them because it is in the interests of both the unions and the employers to have some certainty in the future. If you can negotiate a new agreement before the other one expires—one ready to take over from the expiry date—there is no protected industrial action and there is a smooth transition from one agreement to the other and more certainty is provided for the employer in their ability to tender. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with providing certainty for employers and employees? It is only this government that seeks to create disputes where there are none. It is only this government that seeks to create disputes where there need not be any. This government cannot bear the thought that there may be some employees who may in some measure be protected against any onslaught the government may launch in the near future to further regulate and restrict the bargaining rights of employees and their unions.
The second effect of the bill, of course, is to broaden the definition of building and construction work, and we have spoken somewhat about that. I may not have asked the minister this directly in relation to the previous amendments, but what I want to know from the minister is: how many extra workers is it estimated by the government that the new definition will now apply to? We believe that is important, to measure the effect of this legislation. We understand its scope. We understand that there are some 450,000, maybe 470,000, employees under the old definition, and we would certainly like to know how many workers it applies to now.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,14,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-06,"—I will deal firstly with Senator Murray’s amendments, and I remind the Senate that we are dealing with definitions at the moment. The Democrats propose substituting definitions for ‘building certified agreement’, ‘building agreement’ and ‘building award’ so that they mean the respective agreement or award that primarily applies to building work. Although this approach accords with the government’s intention for the ‘building work’ definition to determine the scope of the bill, these amendments are less precise. Defining an instrument as one that primarily applies to building work introduces an element of uncertainty that may result in litigation. The existing definition of ‘building work’ is intentionally broad so that it can ensure that the problems endemic in the industry are not shifted down the contractual chain. For example, construction unions have demonstrated a willingness to target companies manufacturing products for the industry in pursuit of their industrial goals. The breadth of the definition of ‘building work’ ensures that all those involved in the construction industry, whether on site or supplying essential materials, are covered. Also, as noted in response to concerns raised at the Senate inquiry, the bill provides a mechanism for removing categories of work captured inadvertently by this legislation by regulation.
Senator Murray indicated in his contribution that he disagrees with the royal commissioner. That is fine; I think he has done that very respectfully—unlike some others in this debate—and I accept that. But, in weighing up as a government, we need to determine whether the respected opinion of Senator Murray ought to have weight over that of a royal commissioner who listened in open hearings to 171 days of evidence. Somebody with Commissioner Cole’s training and expertise, having listened to all that evidence, carries on this occasion more weight with the government in determining the approach that we have taken.
I will respond to Senator Marshall, who still seems to be in denial mode in relation to the building and construction industry. The reasons for reform are that the royal commission found that the commercial construction industry was characterised by illegal and improper payments, chronic failure to honour legally binding agreements and regular flouting of court and industrial tribunal orders, and a culture of coercion and intimidation. Those listening to Senator Marshall would have thought that what occurs in the building and construction industry is what happens on a day-to-day basis all around Australia. The findings of the royal commission, after 171 days of hearing, specifically repudiate that assertion. Indeed the report of the royal commission said, in volume 1, page 6, paragraph 17:
At the heart of the findings is lawlessness. It is exhibited in many ways. There are breaches of the criminal law. There are breaches of laws of general application to all Australians where the sanction is a penalty rather than possible imprisonment. There are breaches of many provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
We as a government believe that the economy and community cannot bear the costs of such conduct. The laws of this country must apply to all citizens whether they be union officials, employers or employees. The royal commission also noted, in volume 1, page 6, paragraph 16, that the royal commission’s findings:
... demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular. They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform.
So, with great respect, while Senator Marshall comes in here and asserts that what the CFMEU does in relation to the building and construction industry is exactly what happens in workplaces all around Australia every day, that it is just normal industrial activity, that is specifically repudiated and rejected by the royal commissioner, who spent 171 days listening to evidence in public.
If we as a government have to make a determination as to whether we listen to the opposition on this or the royal commissioner, it will not surprise those listening that we as a government have determined to follow the line of the royal commissioner who made these specific findings. That is why it is so disappointing that those opposite have unfortunately not found themselves in a position to agree with the findings of the royal commission in these areas. Indeed they ran a campaign—I recall the Senate estimates committees where campaigns were run—against the Building Industry Taskforce and those public bodies being required to clean up this culture of disgraceful behaviour within the building and construction industry.
Allow me to repeat what the royal commission found:
These findings demonstrate an industry—
that is, the building and construction industry—
which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular. They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform.
That is what this government is seeking to do with this legislation. Senator Marshall then suggests that this government is a government that seeks to create disputes where there are not any. Can I indicate to Senator Marshall and those listening that under the Howard government we have the lowest rate of industrial disputation ever in this country. So if we are deliberately going out and creating disputes where disputes do not exist, how does he account for the undisputed figures which show that industrial disputation has gone down under the Howard government because we have been able to deliver through our reforms in workplaces where workers have been able to get more jobs? Under Labor, one million were unemployed; now it is down to five per cent and we want to drive it down even further.
Real wages have increased. Mr Beazley recently sought to boast again how he reduced the extent of wages against GDP during the accord period—in other words, how real wages were not allowed to grow. We as a government are delighted that real wages have grown and that workplaces are happier places. I would have thought that the best measure of that would be the extent of industrial disputation. To assert that we as a government are simply trying to create disputes where there are not any defies all the objective evidence. The objective evidence is that under nine years of the Howard government industrial disputation is at an all-time record low.
I was also asked about how many workers might be covered by this legislation. I suppose it is like asking, for example, when the parliaments of the various states introduced breathalyser laws: how many people are going to be covered by that? Do you make that measure the number of those who have a drivers licence or only those drivers who will be driving in breach of the breathalyser laws? Of course, that is the Australian Labor Party’s great dilemma in this. They want a number but they are not willing to say that the number must be the number of workers who are willing to engage in unprotected industrial activity.
—Who doesn’t the breathalyser law apply to? Who in the Australian community is not covered by the breathalyser law?
—I would have thought everybody without a drivers licence, unless they are driving illegally. Of course, that is the Labor Party’s proposition. That is their starting point—that everybody is likely to behave illegally. We as a government do not take that stand.
—No, the law applies to everybody. The law is the law.
—That is the interesting thing, isn’t it? Those on the other side believe that every Australian is likely to drive without a licence. I am not sure that that applies to—

Senator Forshaw interjecting—


(Senator Chapman)—Order, Senator Forshaw!
—I have a greater regard for my fellow Australians than those sorts of suggestions from those opposite.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I am not quite sure what the minister was saying but if he just imputed that those on this side have a view about people who are engaging in criminal activity, as seemed to be what he was doing, I would ask him to withdraw it. It is clearly an inappropriate imputation.
—I think, Senator Wong, that the point being made was a point of debate rather than a point of imputation against opposition senators.
—If those opposite were offended as a result of the foolish interjections and my response, of course I withdraw. Unfortunately, it is time to report, but can I encourage those opposite to drop their union affiliations tomorrow and get on with the debate so that we can deal with this legislation.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2005-09-06,"—I rise tonight to speak about ethanol and its importance not only to rural and regional Australia but also to this nation as a whole. We have a significant opportunity to build a sustainable domestic biofuels industry in Australia, for the benefit of all Australians. There are significant benefits that stand to be delivered through the development of this industry, but there are certain impediments in the way of further development and I would like to talk about a path forward to ensure that we have industry growth and development. As ethanol is primarily produced from molasses or starch, there has been much focus on the potential benefits for the sugar and wheat producers in our rural and regional communities and the flow-on effects for those communities. As a National, my focus and concern are very much on delivering where we can to develop industry in our regional communities.
In September 2002, we saw the government introduce a domestic production subsidy to encourage industry growth. Ethanol has been used as a fuel additive in Australia for a number of decades and we want to see that continued and developed. In recent years, ethanol as a fuel additive has attracted considerable media focus; however, most of the coverage that we have seen has been negative. Regardless of the inability to substantiate negative claims on the effect of using ethanol, consumer confidence has declined substantially. Indeed, in April 2003 the government introduced a 10 per cent cap on the ethanol blend allowable in fuel. Historically, the four major oil companies have been reticent about purchasing and blending ethanol in their fuel mix, and that is still the situation today. As a result of the decline in consumer confidence in the product, it would appear the oil companies have been even less inclined to purchase ethanol.
I would like to point out that this is a policy that the government took to the 2001 election and I would hope therefore that there would be a very strong belief that we should deliver on that policy. An excise regime currently applies to ethanol at the rate of 38.142c per litre. Recognising the potential benefits of the biofuel industry to the nation, as I have said, the government has put in place a target of 350 million litres of biofuel production by 2010. Currently domestic ethanol production stands at 105 million litres per annum, with the industrial, pharmaceutical and fuel sectors the major users.
Ethanol has the significant benefit of being a renewable fuel. Our fossil fuel reserves are finite and our estimation is that our reserves will only last for around another 24 years. Ethanol is domestically produced and, as a renewable fuel, there is no limit on future production capacity. If we can encourage industries out in our regions to develop domestic production, I believe we need to support them wherever we can.
In terms of our balance of trade, we have an increasing trade deficit due to petroleum product imports. These figures have increased from $448 million in 2001 to around $6½ billion in the financial year 2005-06. If we can reduce our reliance on foreign oil by increasing our domestic fuel production capacity through ethanol, there are obvious benefits for the nation. Certainly, one of the benefits of the development of an ethanol industry in Australia is the potential for economic returns for primary producers as well as the economic stimulation and job growth in rural and regional communities—something that The Nationals have pushed very hard in the past and will continue to push in the future. Ethanol production would provide another market option for primary producers which would of course maximise their income returns. It would also stimulate industry development in regional Australia, with resulting job opportunities and economic growth contributing to the prosperity of our regions.
The benefits of ethanol to the environment are without question. In certain cities in the United States, ethanol is mandated specifically as a result of the environmental benefit it provides. In Australia we are becoming increasingly aware of the environment and what we can do to improve it, and we should continue to be very focused on this area. Preliminary results from a CSIRO study of May 2005 suggest there is a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of ethanol in fuel. For each litre of ethanol produced, the study suggested that there is a 2½ kilogram reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is the equivalent of removing 70,000 cars from Australian roads—and the benefits of that are quite obvious.
Traffic related air pollution is a growing concern in our community. Reducing vehicle emissions through increased use of ethanol has real health advantages for Australia, particularly in cities where pollution levels are high. Ethanol is not a carrier of toxic particles found in fuels such as petrol and diesel. Minimising the use of petrol through the increased use of ethanol would be a distinct advantage in reducing air pollution in metropolitan areas.
I would like to point out too that the Australian Medical Association has come out recently very strongly supporting the development of an ethanol industry in this country. The President of the AMA said:
“The AMA is a strong advocate on initiatives related to environmental impacts on human health such as global warming …
“We are equally passionate about the impact of vehicle emissions on human health and we would encourage governments to pursue responsible measures to reduce emissions.
“The AMA considers the use of biofuels such as ethanol in petrol as a positive move.
“In our opinion, there is incontrovertible evidence that the addition of ethanol to petrol and biodiesel to diesel will reduce the deaths and ill-health associated with the emissions produced by burning those fuels …”
It is very interesting to see that the positive effects of the development of the ethanol industry are being picked up by important bodies such as the AMA. The development of this industry is not just about supporting rural and regional communities; it is also about supporting the health benefits for this nation.
Australia is lagging behind the rest of the world in recognising the significant benefits of ethanol use. Brazil and the United States are currently the world’s leading producers of ethanol. The United States has recently again shown its commitment to the industry, with its Senate overwhelmingly passing an energy bill that will significantly expand the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol. It would seem that percentage mandates for ethanol use in fuel and also clean air legislation have been instrumental in the successful uptake of ethanol use in various nations around the world. We as a government certainly need to be focused here in this nation to do what we can to ensure the development of the ethanol industry.
There has certainly been some suggestion over recent years that ethanol should be mandated. While I can certainly take on board those sentiments that are being put forward by some sectors that mandating is an option, I believe that we need to perhaps look at alternative measures to ensure the take-up of ethanol in this nation. We are now looking at a situation where we see the oil companies virtually refusing to take on ethanol. We have said, as a government, that it is part of our policy that we want to see a 350 million litre target for biofuels in this nation. To do that, we are going to need to require the oil companies to increase their take-up. If we have a requirement of 350 million litres by 2010, it seems to me fairly simple, sensible and obvious that we have an annual volumetric target placed upon those oil companies that they have to meet for each year up until 2010 so that we can indeed implement the policy that, as a government, we have taken to the people and that we have said we will follow through and implement. What I am putting forward is that we have a volumetric target, a volumetric requirement on the oil companies that is enforceable, so that we reach our policy target of 350 million litres of biofuel by 2010.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Ethanol</title>,ADJOURNMENT,15,1,speech
