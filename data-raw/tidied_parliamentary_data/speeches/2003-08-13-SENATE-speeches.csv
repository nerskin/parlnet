"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—In the earlier debate on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 I outlined what is wrong with this legislation. I could not summarise it better than Tom Uren, a former minister in a number of Labor governments, who has taken an enormous interest in the Australian environment, not least a key role in protecting some of the natural areas around Sydney Harbour in recent years. In today's Canberra Times Tom Uren says about the legislation before us:
The HOWARD Government introduced legislation into the House of Representatives on June 27, 2002, to scuttle the Australian Heritage Commission and replace it with the Australian Heritage Council. Such a move would destroy the commission and the independence it stands for.
They are tough words from Mr Uren. He goes on to say:
As every year passes the threat to our environment grows, not only in our own country but to the planet. Australia needs a legislative body that stands above party politics. The AHC is such an authority.
The nation has the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as an independent body in relation to broadcasting and communications. We have the Reserve Bank on monetary matters and the economy. It is imperative that we have an independent authority on heritage and environment issues.
The Information and Research Service of the Parliamentary Library, describing the opposition to the bill, indicates that the Government intends to transfer major aspects of the commission's authority to the minister. The research council concludes: “The new council will have considerably less freedom of independent action than the AHC”—
the existing Australian Heritage Council. Further on, Tom Uren says:
The now Emeritus Professor David Yencken—
who was Chairman of the Australian Heritage Commission—
gave evidence in 2001 before the Senate Environment Committee ... He spoke on a joint submission by seven former commissioners, including five former chairs of the commission.
Professor Yencken said that the proposed bill contained some positive elements but noted obvious deficiencies. He said that the maintenance and continued development of the National Estate would be jeopardised by the change. Responsibility for listing should rest with the council as it now does with the commission and the council should retain all the powers of the existing commission.
	...	...	...
I have advocated to senators that Parliament can strengthen the commission's powers but the ministerial control would suffocate it.
And there is the rub. This legislation effectively transfers the powers of the existing Australian Heritage Commission to the minister. It gives the minister a veto. It puts the negative hand of politics, as practised over recent decades, as overriding the independent authority of the Australian Heritage Commission. There are senators who, quite rightly, point out that the commission does not have sufficient powers. That is why we should build up those powers, but not at the expense of clobbering them by transferring the ultimate authority of what is listed and what is not listed as Australian heritage to the minister of the day, who then comes under the pressure of corporate and other sectional interests and a political decision is made, rather than a decision on the environmental and heritage merits. 
On behalf of the Australian Greens, I will be moving a number of amendments to include a greenhouse trigger in the environment protection legislation, to include a trigger for land clearing—and that means forest destruction—and to replace the amendments made by the government and the Democrats some years ago which removed logging of Australian forests from the purview of this legislation, because it should be one of the central issues. Instead, the minister's authority nationally was removed; the government's authority to intervene on logging of heirloom and iconic forests and wildlife in Australia was removed. I will be making special efforts—and I hope the minister will listen to this—to find out what is happening with the listing of Recherche Bay in southern Tasmania, the site of the oldest intact European structure in Australia, which is imminently threatened by logging.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—I rise today to recap Labor's position, following several of my colleagues having spoken in the second reading debate on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. Australia's heritage regime was put in place by the Whitlam government. It has served Australia well. Although most agree that it needs some updating, it is an exemplary scheme which has been recognised world wide. The government has its sights set on reforming this heritage regime. In 2000, it brought in legislation which was later amended and we are now debating further amending bills in the Senate. 
Labor is concerned that the government's plans will wipe out the gains made in heritage protection since 1975 and set the clock effectively back to zero by dismantling the existing Register of the National Estate. About 12,000 items of heritage are currently protected, but only about 500 of those would be transferred directly to a replacement register. The rest would be caught in limbo and have no protection. Labor is also concerned that independent decision making about heritage will be replaced by a politicised system that allows the minister to make the decision. The Heritage Commission is the existing decision making body, and it is proposed that it will be replaced by an advisory heritage council—effectively transferring power from an independent body into the hands of the minister.
The government amended the current heritage bills to address some but certainly not all of the concerns raised about its original plans for a new regime during the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee inquiry into the bills. Whilst this new version has satisfied some of the detractors of the 2000 version of the bill—including the International Council on Monuments and Sites and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—the Australian Conservation Foundation and a group of former chairs of the Australian Heritage Commission, as well as former Labor colleague Tom Uren, are indeed strongly opposed to it. I note, Senator Brown, that I too was going to make reference to the article published today in the Canberra Times by Tom Uren stating very clearly his views on the future of the Heritage Commission and his vehement opposition to the changes proposed to it under this legislation. 
The bills use the existing Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act framework to establish a national scheme for heritage assets and replace the Heritage Commission with a heritage council. There are three bills in the package: the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002; the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002, which repeals the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975; and the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002, which has the purpose of creating the proposed successor to the commission.
In conclusion I would like to make reference to my colleague in the other place Mr Kelvin Thomson and his presentation in that chamber about Labor's primary concerns about these bills. Firstly, the present Heritage Commission has a broad range of functions, and its replacement, the Australian Heritage Council, will be an advisory body only. As I said before, this will represent a transfer of power from an independent body to, effectively, a minister's office and a very political body. Secondly, the definition of actions which trigger heritage consideration has been narrowed, deleting matters such as the provision of grants and the granting of authorisations. Thirdly, the decision to list places presently lies with the Australian Heritage Commission. The government proposes to transfer this previously independent, technical, merits based decision to the minister.
Fourthly, the government is proposing to reduce the heritage protection provided from what is known as `a place and its associated values' to just `the values of the place'. Fifthly, the government has not honoured its commitment to transfer Commonwealth places on the existing Register of the National Estate to the new Commonwealth Heritage List. This failure could have important adverse consequences for the future of Commonwealth assets around Australia, such as the Georges River in Sydney and Point Cook and Point Nepean in Victoria. I will refer to some of those matters during the committee stages of the debate. Finally, the Australian Communications Authority has to consider the impacts on the environment regarding communications facilities where a place on the Register of the National Estate is affected. The Commonwealth proposes to remove this provision.
With all of these issues on Labor's mind, we will be moving a series of amendments to each of the bills in the committee stages of this debate. As my colleagues previously have made very clear, unless Labor's amendments—which will have the effect of maintaining the Heritage Commission with its current powers—are accepted, Labor will not be supporting these bills.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-13,"—This package of bills that we are debating—at last—today is a major step forward in the protection and conservation of places of heritage significance across Australia. Perhaps most importantly, it provides real recognition for the value of Indigenous heritage and culture. I will be moving a series of amendments that strengthen the package as we get into the committee stages. I will go through those in detail and respond to some of the comments that have already been made here this morning when we get into the committee stages of the bills. What is important is that the government has accepted these amendments, and they do considerably strengthen this legislation that is before us today.
This package has had a long history. It goes back to the days of Labor government—indeed, it formally began the process in 1996 when the Australian Heritage Commission embarked on a consultative process aimed at developing a national heritage strategy that actually worked. What I do have to emphasise here is that it was a Labor government that put all of this in place—that actually acknowledged that the existing system did not work—and put in place a consultative process that has involved all those groups and organisations with any interest in this issue. I also note, in light of the opposition's continuing opposition to the bills, that the basis for the national heritage listing policy is an intergovernmental agreement signed in 1997 by all state and territory governments, as well as the Commonwealth and the Local Government Association. So this is not just something that the current government has thought up and, on a whim, introduced into this place. 
What has driven all of these concerns and all of this action is the fact that, for too long, environment and heritage legislation in Australia has been piecemeal and toothless. There were a lot of good intentions, but on the ground the laws were useless if you actually wanted to protect places, species and matters of Commonwealth interest from what you could describe as the eternal enthusiasm of developers and those who want to take down the old and replace it with the new. That did not just include private developers; it also has included state and local governments. There were no third-party provisions under environmental law. The resources minister could make decisions without regard for the environment minister's advice. Marine species were largely unprotected. Action was almost impossible if the environment issue was not on Commonwealth land, et cetera, et cetera.
A lot of these problems were dealt with by the passage of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Under the EPBC Act—and I must add that over 500 amendments were made to the government's original bill while I was leader of the Democrats—it is the environment minister who gets to make the decision, not the resources minister, and matters of national environmental interest now apply to all Commonwealth land. Third parties can take, and in a number of cases have taken already, successful action to protect the environment when the government has not done the job properly. In other words, individuals now have standing in court. Under this act, they can put their case for the protection of a particular area, species or issue and they have standing and the right to be heard. They have been heard. There have been a number of cases where successful action has led to significant penalties and, in one case, imprisonment.
The Heritage Council bills are the next step. The old heritage legislation—the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975—was effectively a feelgood piece of legislation, and previous speakers have acknowledged this today. Many thousands of places were entered onto the Register, or the temporary register, of the National Estate but then were forgotten. The old act gave very little protection to places listed on the register. For the first time, this new package of bills draws heritage into the EPBC legislation and, as a consequence, they become an integral part of the national environmental protection system. They establish a Commonwealth Heritage List which imposes far greater requirements on the Commonwealth agencies that manage the government's heritage portfolio. The bills establish a National Heritage List which imposes substantial responsibility on the Commonwealth government for the management of places that are entered onto the list. The bills provide a new listing system to ensure heritage values are covered by a sixth trigger under the EPBC Act. The Commonwealth will have considerable power to protect the identified values of listed areas.  
It is important to note that the legislation is designed to protect values, not areas. The criticism by Senator Lundy a moment ago— and I will work through this issue in the committee stage—is in fact a positive. It is in recognition of the fact that much of our cultural and national heritage is to be found on leasehold or private land. The intention is to enter into management agreements with existing landholders to protect values and not to acquire land for reservation, unless that is what the owner wants to happen.
Today, in my speech to the second reading debate, I am not going to spend too much time explaining why I am supportive of the package of bills, because I have been told by a number of those who are opposed to this legislation that I should not trust the government. I will work through the plethora of organisations and individuals who deal with these issues day by day. I will talk about their interests in seeing this legislation passed and their support for what is being done to protect our natural and built heritage and to make some real progress by putting these places in a far more secure position than they are in now. I will use this opportunity to go through a few comments from those organisations.
I will start with ATSIC because I understand there has been some confusion about where ATSIC stands on these bills. This morning ATSIC Commissioner Rodney Dillon, who has been delegated the responsibility of dealing with these important bills, told my staff that he welcomes this package of bills because it is a lot stronger than the current regime and that ATSIC is pleased with the minister's recognition of the values of Indigenous heritage and culture. Mr Dillon believes, as many do—indeed, I do—that we can still improve things further, that this is a significant step forward and that it is better to take this step now and continue to work on any improvements in the future.
I have received a great deal of correspondence from the Australian Council of National Trusts. Their most recent briefing paper states:
The National Trust and all the groups that have a specific interest in heritage support the revised Bills.
The council outlined the main community benefits of the legislation as: enhanced protection of heritage places, especially heritage places of national significance, with potential benefits such as better environmental and social outcomes; greater opportunities for community input into heritage assessments and approvals; early triggering and a more certain process with explicit time lines ensuring community comment is considered sooner in the development process; all decisions will be transparent, and information will be available to the public; and national heritage listing will provide tourism benefits for regional Australia and Indigenous communities. Another letter from the Council of National Trusts emphasised:
The passage of these Bills is necessary in order to enable the Commonwealth to take its proper national role in the identification and protection of heritage places, and in the essential support for community education regarding the value of heritage to communities throughout the nation.
In a combined briefing paper from the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Humane Society and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, the proposed new regime in this legislation was referred to as:
A substantial improvement on that which operates under the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 and constitutes a momentous step forward for the protection and conservation of places of heritage significance. 
The same brief, which was written by the current adviser to the Democrats, emphasises the fact that the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 `contains a fatal flaw'— the current regime `provides very little statutory protection for places on the Register or Interim List'. For example, the brief points out that, under the current regime, there are no criminal or civil penalties for failing to comply with the act. In the new legislation there are serious penalties for failing to obtain proper approval for an activity that is likely to have a significant impact on the national heritage values of a national heritage place. The penalties include seven years in prison, up to $5½ million in fines for corporations and up to $550,000 fines for individuals.
I simply cannot understand the reasons for the intransigence of a number of senators. Despite listening to speeches on the second reading, I do not understand what it is that is deterring some senators from supporting this legislation. The Humane Society International, in its winter parliamentary briefing, said:
We view the proposed legislation to be an advance on existing laws to protect Australia's natural and cultural heritage and urge all parties to give them their support.
The Australian Heritage Commission in their press release of 18 June 2003 stated that these bills represent `the largest advance in heritage protection in 25 years'. They added:
Not only are the existing arrangements maintained but there is, for the first time, a whole new suite of provisions ensuring rigorous statutory protection of national and Commonwealth heritage.
They go on to say:
The new heritage amendments will provide a far greater set of tools to protect heritage places compared to the `empty tool box' of the existing Heritage Act.
In addition to the groups I have already mentioned, I will just list others that support this legislation. They are the Australian International Council on Monuments and Sites; the Institution of Engineers Heritage Committee; the Federation of Australian Historical Societies; the Australian Academy of the Humanities; the national heritage chairs and officials, who represent the state and territory Heritage Councils; the Royal Australian Institute of Architects; the Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology; the Australian Institute of Archaeology; the Property Council of Australia; Museums Australia; and Winda Mara Aboriginal Corporation. Just to discuss that last organisation, their spokesperson contacted my office recently urging us to support these bills, emphasising his disappointment that those senators who are opposing the bills have not consulted Indigenous people at community level.
Another important aspect to emphasise in today's debate is that the passage of these bills will unlock one of this year's budget measures, the new, distinctively Australian National Heritage Initiative, worth $13.3 million over four years. If these bills do not pass, that $13.3 million cannot be spent.
Preliminary identification of important national heritage themes will begin as soon as the legislation is enacted. The extent of heritage values associated with each theme will then be determined and owners and managers of relevant areas will be invited to have parts of their properties entered on the national list of heritage areas of national importance. Funding can then be made available to assist and support owners and managers in maintaining the heritage values of their particular listed areas.
Before I conclude today, I want to provide an example of how the current regime is failing. Had this legislation been in place a year or so ago—indeed, when it was last debated, which was late last year—a very significant piece of land in New South Wales would have been saved from development. This site is a 59-hectare heritage site at Castle Hill which is known as the Third Government Farm. The site was registered on the Australian Heritage Commission's national heritage estate database on 25 March 1983. It was passed into the care of the New South Wales government and was listed in December 2000 on the New South Wales state heritage register as the Third Government Farm, listing No. 01448. However, the New South Wales listing is only for 19 hectares and a development company has now successfully tendered for a 100-hectare commercial, residential and retail development called Rouse Hill regional town centre. Unfortunately, construction is beginning. This is a very sad indictment of the current heritage listing regime. The fact that a site of such significance can fall through the many gaps between the state and territory and national heritage regimes is just one of the many reasons that change is necessary. 
There are still some in this chamber who will argue that we should not be supporting this legislation because it does not go far enough, that we should hang out for bigger improvements or quite significant changes to the EPBC Act. But surely they should also recognise that what we have here today is a major step forward. Basically their argument boils down to whether or not we are going to take a small step—the heritage groups argue, and I argue, that it is a significant step, but at least those senators in their speeches on the second reading have acknowledged it is a small step in the right direction—or make no improvements whatsoever. As we make this very important step, I urge senators from all political parties to look again at the problems with the current regime, to look at the potential that this legislation has and at how well the EPBC Act is working to protect species and places and to agree that we should put in, as an additional trigger under the EPBC Act, Australia's heritage.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-08-13,"—I rise today to strongly support the legislation which is before the house and to commend to the house what has been a very long and difficult process to take steps to enhance the legal regime in this country to protect our national collective heritage. Obviously our heritage is a vitally important part of making out who we are. Our heritage tells us who we were in the past and indeed who we are in the present. It is an important part of our development as a nation, our national development as a unique experience, and it is educated by our heritage. It is therefore incumbent on us to ensure that that heritage is properly protected.
The three bills which are before the Senate today meet the objectives of protecting our national heritage. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 establishes the Commonwealth's responsibilities for the identification, protection and management of heritage places of national significance. Heritage sites identified will be registered on a National Heritage List which retains its statutory identity. They will include natural, historic and Indigenous places of outstanding national heritage value. The National Heritage List will create opportunities to celebrate, commemorate and safeguard places that recall significant themes in Australian history and will also protect features of our natural environment which are treasured and worth protecting.
Senator Lundy mentioned that there were presently some 12,000 places on the Register of the National Estate, established under the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. My advice is that there are presently in fact more than 13,000 places on that register. I am also advised that the register will be retained in accordance with the commitment made by the government at the 2001 federal election. Under the legislation, a significant change in the decision-making process is effected. That change is that the minister will make decisions on additions to the National Heritage List on the advice of the Australian Heritage Council. 
 Senators have risen in this place to criticise the fact that the minister would under this regime retain that final decision-making power. I think it is important to recognise that decisions about the adding of names to a heritage list and the consequences of those decisions are matters of significant political gravity. It amazes me how often we hear from people in this place, who are practitioners in democracy, that there should be some process other than a democratic one to resolve particular issues. In other words, it amazes me when people suggest that people other than elected governments should make decisions on matters of great national consequence. The minister is the appropriate person to make those decisions at the end of the day. Yes, the minister must act taking full account of advice given to him or her by the Australian Heritage Council. I dare say that, without prescribing the minister's discretion, the minister would rarely act outside the advice given to him or her by a body consisting of important and recognised experts in the field of heritage.
It has been the case in Australia's history—including in its recent history—that matters of heritage listing have been intensely political matters. It has been a matter of record that those matters have carried with them enormous consequences—politically, socially and fiscally—and in those circumstances it seems to me only appropriate that an elected minister, a minister with the authority of a mandate from the people of Australia, should make final decisions about whether or not items are listed on the National Heritage List.
The bill also ensures that Commonwealth agencies have greater management responsibilities in relation to Commonwealth heritage places. It has amazed me, in looking at this legislation, that up until now simply inadequate protection has been provided and inadequate processes have been in place with respect to Commonwealth owned assets that might be included in a national list. I am very pleased to support this legislation because, as a heritage and environment minister in the ACT quite some years ago, I was involved early on in making sure that this process was kicked along. I supported the decision taken by the Council of Australian Governments in 1997 to support this process and to bring this process forward. I would have been surprised at that time had I known that the final debate on this legislation was still some six or seven years away. 
Nonetheless, it is, in the process of debating this bill, worth looking at the extensive consultation which has characterised the development of this bill and which commends itself to us when we consider whether to pass the bill. The bill is the culmination of at least six years of community consultation and discussion. Not only was there the unanimous decision of Australian governments in 1997 to support the process which led to this legislation but also there was the 1998 National Heritage Convention convened by the Australian Heritage Commission. During 2000, as the legislation was being prepared, officials conducted 76 briefings in state and territory capitals and in many regional centres in a national briefing program. The National Cultural Heritage Forum, which included key stakeholder organisations such as the Australian Council of National Trusts, played a crucial role in getting this legislation to this stage. All of those organisations can rightly say that they contributed to this outcome, and I think they could rightly say that the process reflected their input. 
It is disappointing to see that, despite what would have to be one of the longest and most extensive processes of consultation yet undertaken on any piece of legislation—certainly a much longer process of consultation than that which accompanied the 1975 legislation—we see today considerable opposition from some opposite to this package of bills. It is also worth emphasising, as Senator Lees has done, that this legislation should be commended for not only what it does but what it replaces. The inadequacy of the present legislation is difficult to overstate. Yes, the 1975 legislation was an important landmark. Yes, it took the acknowledgment of our national heritage to a level it had not been at previously. But to say that the present legislation in any way adequately serves the public interest in Australia is simply wrong.
There are inconsistencies today between the states' and territories' heritage legislation, which protects places of state or local significance, and the world heritage decrees, which protect places of world significance. The Australian Heritage Commission Act does not provide adequate legal protection for important heritage sites and, as Senator Lees has pointed out, there are no civil or criminal penalties provided for breaches of the provisions of the act under this present framework. That is very handsomely compensated for by significant penalties in the present bill, and we would be wise to ensure that that protection is in place as soon as possible so that the destruction of our natural and built environment, particularly as it affects issues of national significance, does not continue.
The Australian Heritage Commission has described this legislation as `the largest advance in heritage protection in 25 years', and so it is. Our heritage in all parts of the nation stands handsomely to benefit from it. Indeed, our heritage outside our nation also stands to benefit. It is significant that this legislation provides that not only can places be listed within Australia but also places can be listed outside Australia. Obviously, the capacity that flows from that is to enter into agreements and arrangements with other governments to ensure that areas are protected— places like Kokoda in Papua New Guinea, Lone Pine in Gallipoli and Changi war prison in Singapore. Senators may recall the debate recently about the future of the Changi war prison in Singapore. I would like to see the dialogue that goes on with the government of Singapore occur in the light of this legislation having been passed. That would be an appropriate acknowledgement of our view about the importance of that kind of heritage being protected and would provide some basis for the Australian government to properly negotiate with the government of Singapore and other governments to protect external sites of interest to Australians.
In the ACT's case there are a number of places or properties already listed on the Register of the National Estate. They include places you might expect, such as the Australian War Memorial, Old Parliament House, the National Library, and indeed the building in which we are sitting today. More local institutions, such as the Sydney and Melbourne buildings, the Albert Hall and Duntroon House, are also included and they embody the important heritage from a local community perspective for the people of Canberra. It is a matter of regret that sometimes forces beyond our control can damage the integrity of the National Estate. The fires in Canberra on 18 January badly ravaged many parts of Canberra and destroyed the heritage listed Mount Stromlo Observatory. Many of the alpine huts in the hinterland of the ACT were also damaged or destroyed and that has detracted from the heritage of this region. We cannot always control natural phenomena, but we can and we should ensure the legal and legislative framework for protection is as strong as it can be. As previous senators have noted, this legislation does precisely that. 
This legislation deserves the support of members of this house. The community is the most significant beneficiary from this legislation, with improved protection of heritage places. While the bill retains current opportunities for community input to heritage assessments and approvals, a more certain process with unambiguous timelines will ensure that community comment is given greater consideration and is therefore more effective in the final outcome of decisions about heritage listings. All of these benefits and the overhaul of the heritage listing procedure make this bill one which will benefit the wider Australian community. Because the bill facilitates the process of selecting important places and things that we have inherited from previous generations and takes care of them, I think it deserves to be supported. I commend this legislation to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-08-13,"—One Nation supports the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002, or the concept of the bill. However, there are some concerns in relation to how it is proposed the council will function. Let me say, first of all, that our Australian heritage is a very important part of our society in terms of both its structure and the issues it represents—as other senators have said—not only in relation to buildings such as the War Memorial in Canberra but also in relation to other substantive buildings throughout the country. It is important that, when this legislation is being administered, equal weight is given to Indigenous heritage of this land as is given to non-Indigenous heritage. What I am saying is that it is the duty of those who will make up this council to ensure that all sectors of our heritage are both considered and proportionally protected. Going back to some of the things that have happened in Queensland, like the destruction of buildings in Brisbane, nobody is saying that we should return to having demolitions at midnight, but we do need to have a balance between the rights of the people who own property and the rights of the general community and its willingness, and also concern, to protect some of that heritage. Equally, the government is responsible for ensuring that, with the passage of this bill, there is sufficient funding for those people who have private property that becomes the subject of a listing. Referring to the current legislation, section 23(2) of the Australian Heritage Commission Act states:
(2)	The Commission shall not enter a place in the Register in accordance with subsection (1) unless:
	(a)	it has, by public notice:
	(i)	stated that it intends to enter the place in the Register;
	(ii)	given a description of the place sufficient to identify it;
	(iii)	notified persons of their right to make written objection to the entry of the place in the Register ...
Public notification is under section 22(1) of the Australian Heritage Council Bill and section 22(1)(c) gives persons advised a reasonable opportunity to comment in writing on whether the place should be included in the register. I do not believe that those words are anywhere near strong enough. If you are the owner of a private property, it is your right to effect your ownership of that property in such a way as you see fit. However, if the Australian Heritage Council lists that property, there are quite serious implications for the owner. I believe that that person should have the right to object to that listing, whereas what the legislation proposes merely allows that person to comment but not to actually object. 
This leads me to the area of the legislation under which the Australian Heritage Council can enter into commercial agreements and commercial entities can sponsor the Australian Heritage Council. It may be well and good for corporate Australia to support heritage—and they do that in many ways—but the function of the Heritage Council should not be underwritten by any corporate entity. That could bring undesirable pressures on the people in that council. Yes, corporate entities could sponsor and support the preservation of heritage listed properties, but One Nation does not believe that it is in the public interest that they should fund the Australian Heritage Commission itself.
I will be putting this question to the minister: what surety does the public have that there will be community representation on the council? As we know, there is a requirement that people have certain academic qualifications to be on a government board. The proposed Heritage Council is not and should not be any different. Because of the capacity of this legislation to affect private property, it is important that we have some assurance from the minister that there will be a community representative on the council as well as those people with respective academic capabilities. Another area of concern for One Nation is the movement away from assessing a property's intrinsic value—its overall value to the community—to an asset based valuation. That narrows the scope for the preservation of our heritage buildings.
Another issue that I would like to raise, and this issue has been raised by the Australian Conservation Foundation, relates to the proposed council. It is the opinion of the ACF that the proposed Australian Heritage Council should be `an independent statutory body, as is the present case with the Australian Heritage Commission'. This is very important because it places the council at arm's length from government such that the council could carry out its assessment on the basis of being a truly independent statutory body. That is probably one of the greater concerns that I have in relation to the bill. In their briefing note of January 2002, the Australian Conservation Foundation said:
The Heritage Bills offer some improvements, for example in the provisions for increased management planning of heritage places and more appropriate penalties. However, with the weakening of the Australian Heritage Commission, question marks over the future of the Register of the National Estate and other concerns, the Heritage Bills as they stand represent a step backward for heritage protection. The Heritage Bills in their current form, should not be passed.
I reiterate that that is the position of the Australian Conservation Foundation. I carry the same concerns, and I clearly indicate to the minister and to the chamber that One Nation will support the bills but will be watching very closely their progression through the chamber.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—I also would like to speak on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. My colleague Senator Allison spoke on these bills some time back when the second reading debate first commenced. Given the timelag and some of the statements made since, and given other things that have occurred, I think it is appropriate for me to also make comments.
The passage of these bills is an example of why the Senate is important and a perfect example of why the Prime Minister's attempt to gut the Senate's powers should be resisted at all costs. This legislation, through these three bills, clearly is in need of significant improvement and, without the Senate's ability to have worthwhile power to make and insist on such amendments, we would not have the opportunity to significantly improve what is flawed legislation. It is also worth noting the context in which the bills come forward, which is the current regime they seek to amend. It has to be said that the current legislative regime for heritage protection is grossly inadequate. 
I recognise the validity of some of the comments that people have made, including Senator Harris just now, about the independence of the Australian Heritage Commission and the importance of the listing process. I think Senator Lundy said that there are 12,000 sites currently protected. I would dispute that: there might be 12,000 sites listed, but any legal ability to protect them is pretty much zero. We saw just one example of that with the proposal to build a new, unnecessary and expensive detention centre on Christmas Island, which is listed as a heritage site. The only requirement under the existing act is for the minister to seek the opinion of the Heritage Commission. There is no requirement for the minister to pay any attention to that opinion, and there is no legal mechanism for that advice to be made public or to require in any way that the minister act in a way that preserves the heritage values of a site. That applies to all of the sites currently listed. So there is a major flaw in the existing legislation in that there is no real way to legally ensure the protection of the sites listed. That said, agreeing to change by allowing the passage of legislation which modifies but which nonetheless contains components that would significantly move things backwards is not a desirable outcome either.
Many people examining these bills have commented that they do contain some positives, but there are also some significant negatives. The Democrats have put in a lot of time over many months to try to address those negatives and to ensure that those concerns are addressed where possible, and that is why the bills need amendment. There is certainly no way that the Democrats would support these bills as they currently stand, because they would enable the enactment of some significant negatives. Again, it has to be emphasised that the existing commission can be as independent as it likes, but its powers to ensure protection are virtually zero. It can list sites but cannot do anything to ensure that they are protected, other than by political pressure. That is good as far as it goes, but it would be nice to have some legal mechanisms to enforce protection.
This is one of the reasons why the changes made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 1999 were important: for the first time there was a mechanism for people to take legal action to require the government to work and act consistently with its own legislation. There are still many areas that can be improved in the federal environment protection act as well, but there is no doubt that, with the substantial amendments made by the Democrats in 1999, we took a significant step forward in terms of national environmental protection and national environmental legislation, compared with what existed previously. Of course, you can have the best legislation in the world and still not have it used to its value if the government of the day is not prepared to enforce its legislation. Unfortunately, that has been very much the case with the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act: we have a government that has not used those powers to ensure protection of the environment. On the few occasions that it has, it has had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, through the courts to do so. That is an indictment of the government and its willingness to ensure good environmental outcomes rather than an indictment of the legislation. There is certainly still significant room for improvement. 
I need to mention a couple of things in relation to the legislation and to various amendments that have been circulated. A lot of amendments have been circulated by various senators, including some from the Democrats, and there are some still to be circulated. Can I say in advance, before we get the usual gratuitous comments about having insufficient time to examine them, that these amendments have been before the government in various forms for many months. We have simply been trying to work together constructively to get an agreed outcome. Regrettably, that has not been possible, so we will have to move those on the floor of the chamber to see what happens. At the end of the process we will make our decision as to whether the legislation has been sufficiently amended to make it worthy of support.
The problem of having to get the amendments circulated has been exacerbated by the government's strange decision to bounce these bills up the list ahead of four other bills that are ready to go, that have had their amendments circulated and, in some cases, that are part way through debate. However, if the government wishes to act in that way, that is its decision. The Democrats have a strong record of working cooperatively in this chamber to try to ensure prompt debate of issues and sufficient notice for matters to be considered. If the government wishes to act outside of that then quite frankly it can wear the consequences.
This legislation has involved a lot of consultation with groups in the community. We have had the Senate inquiry and report and attempts to consult with the government to try to get a positive outcome. Most of that has been conducted by my colleague Senator Allison, who has responsibility for the heritage portfolio. I have been involved to a lesser extent towards the end of the process. In all my time here—both as a senator, which is getting on to six years, and before that as an adviser, going back to 1990—in over 13 years of being directly involved with issues, legislation and negotiations before the Senate, I have never seen a process carried out in such bad faith and so inappropriately. Whilst I will try to rise above that and consider the legislation on its merits, I think all ministers and the poor old Manager of Government Business, Senator Campbell, who has to try to get legislation through this place, should be aware of that fact. We all know that this chamber runs predominantly on cooperation and good faith. We have disagreements about issues all the time—that is to be expected— and we can play reasonably hard ball when necessary to try to get outcomes that we like, but all of that has to be done in good faith and with some trust.
Not only is this the worst example I have seen in 13 years, but I have not seen anything that even comes remotely close to the process that has been used for these bills. That makes it very difficult to remain cooperative, not just in relation to this legislation but in relation to everything else the government does in this place. I think it is appropriate for all ministers to keep that in mind. Once the Democrats get a message that we are not going to be treated with respect, that we are going to be jerked around and treated in bad faith, it is only reasonable to assume that is acceptable to the government as a whole and it will affect negotiations, discussions and agreements we have on virtually every issue. I would be very upset if it became necessary for us to approach discussions with the government with that in mind, because it would waste a lot of our time as well as the Senate's time and the government's time. But, if that is the way the government thinks it is appropriate to behave, it becomes difficult to do anything else. 
Part of the reason we need to ensure that agreements that are reached with the government are clear cut and nailed down is past experience. Obviously, when you get burnt once you become more cautious the second time around. We have had previous agreements with the government in this area—for example, the agreement about the use of the money for the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. That has now been changed significantly from what was originally agreed to and the money in part used on things outside of what was suggested at the time. We have seen the complete ignoring of what was agreed to with the energy credit scheme and what that would become. Commitments were given—to the Senate and not just in writing to us—about how genetic technology would be assessed and overseen that were then changed. There has been no appearance of a greenhouse trigger in the EPBC Act. We have the situation of how the EPBC Act is being administered—or not administered. And that is just in this portfolio area. That being the history of things, obviously we want to get commitments nailed down as much as possible.
I will not go into chapter and verse on why I am so annoyed about the process that has been followed by the minister in this regard—unless the government wants to go down that path, in which case we can have a discussion about that. Suffice to say, people may wish to talk about the actions of various staff on all sides, but I would suggest that anytime there is an issue or a difficulty one goes to the senator. Certainly, even in correspondence and discussions I have had, what has transpired has not panned out to what was understood.
There are still significant issues with the Indigenous heritage components of the legislation. Whilst it has been suggested that ATSIC supports the legislation, significant concerns have been raised recently. Whilst it may be the view of some that it is not going to get any better, so they may as well roll over and agree to it, the Democrats nonetheless believe it is important to persist to see if there is some opportunity to get improved Indigenous heritage protection. This is particularly the case given the lack of progress on the ATSIC legislation—the separate Indigenous heritage legislation that was debated in this place some time ago and withdrawn or not proceeded with. There is some confusion about whether the government still intends to proceed with that. Certainly there are some very strong indications that it does not intend to proceed with that legislation. If that is the case then I think it is not only reasonable but appropriate and responsible to try to use the opportunity through this legislation to get some of those issues raised. The Democrats will attempt to do that when we get to the committee stage.
We have circulated some amendments, and there are more to come. Clearly, with all the various amendments around and our lack of certainty about how the government will respond to many of these issues, we may need to carry out that process precisely and carefully. Unfortunately, that may take more time than would otherwise be the case. Again, if the government wishes to do business that way then that is the way that things have to be done. The government may like to think about not doing it again if it does not want time consumed that it would rather not have consumed.
In conclusion, it is worth saying, as I said at the start, that the existing heritage situation is unacceptable. There is no serious mechanism for ensuring the protection of heritage sites, and that is the starting point for the Democrats. We recognise some of the criticisms of the legislation. We agree with some of them and will attempt to address some of them, but at the end of the day we have to look at whether the final product is an advance on the current situation overall. It is pretty hard to go backwards from a situation when there is virtually no surety of protecting heritage sites. Nonetheless, some aspects of the legislation make a good attempt at doing that. So we will see how we go in the overall debate in the committee stage.  
Australia's heritage is an important issue, and I think that needs to be emphasised. Whilst this legislation has not got the attention and the publicity of some other bills around the place, that does not in any way suggest it is not an important issue. It is a significant issue, and we need to do better in protecting our heritage. Many Australians now regret the loss of heritage in the past and the continuing loss and destruction of some of our heritage. I think the older we as a nation get, the more valuable our heritage gets, so we are certainly looking for an outcome that protects that. It is an approach that the Democrats have pursued in the past with some success. 
I mentioned the EPBC Act, but I should also mention the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust Act, which was put forward under the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, which I believe is one of the very significant and positive achievements of this government in relation to heritage and environmental protection—only for some small areas, such as our former Defence lands around Sydney Harbour, but they are areas that are certainly being far better protected and are now being properly dealt with, which was not happening before. The legislation was only passed with the support of the Democrats after significant amendment and properly constructed negotiations. The legislation was opposed at the time by the ALP, the Greens and, indeed, by Tom Uren, who has a long history with Sydney Harbour and a very positive one, but we made the judgment that the final outcome was sufficient to provide a strong likelihood of protection of those sites. 
The negative, which would have occurred if the bills had not passed, is that there would have been no protection at all. The Department of Defence could have sold them off for exceedingly large amounts of money with no guarantee of protection for any of those areas. They are more valuable for their heritage than their environmental values, although some of the remnant bushland is important. But those heritage sites such as Cockatoo Island, Georges Heights, Middle Head and the military facilities there are incredibly significant in a heritage and historical sense. Not only have they now been guaranteed protection but also they are being managed, repaired, restored and made available to the public progressively over time. 
Whilst there is always room for improvement, and there could be some criticisms about one or two things, those particular sites are now being protected as a result of legislation that was supported by the Democrats. The Democrats were essential to its passing. Despite some of the concerns at the time, which I understood, I think the judgment that we made then has been shown to be the correct one. The way things have panned out has ensured and seen a very significant improvement in the ongoing protection, preservation and use of those sites in a way that will maximise the chances of their being protected well into the future.
The contrast, of course, could not be more stark with the New South Wales Labor government's treatment of harbour front lands, which has been nothing less than appalling. We are still seeing problems there with the quarantine station, for example, on North Head. I think our record in the Democrats of being able to make these judgments on heritage protection is a very positive one, and balancing judgments about whether things overall are a step forward or not is an approach that we will take into this legislation. We have always been proud of and insisted on operating as a party independent of any interest groups and organisations, whether it is big business, unions or, frankly, even environment groups. We will consult with all of them and take on board their concerns. We often agree with their concerns. Nonetheless, we make our own decision independently about whether the final outcome is a step forward or not. That is what we will do in the committee stage, which will probably be a fairly full and thorough one.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-08-13,"—I want to say a few words about the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and related bills. Obviously any step forward could be seen as a good step forward from the current state of play. This legislation has been around for a while. I have had some discussion with the government, and I have raised some matters with the government, about the legislation. I appreciate the promptness of the response that I received to some of those matters, some of which have been positive. If I can be biased from my own state's point of view, I obviously looked at the legislation from the perspective of the development of a National Heritage List. From a Tasmanian perspective, because it is a state that has very significant heritage properties, I would be seeking to have those properties assessed and added to the list at an early stage.
Of course, there are a number of very important matters that this legislation has to deal with. I do have some concern with regard to the independence of and funding arrangements for the council. Those are matters that still concern me. I also have a concern, which I raised with the minister, with the quantum of the funding that is to be applied. Because this legislation was not implemented earlier, there has been a slippage in the funding that would have been used. Whilst the amount of money that is proposed is reasonable—I will be generous and describe it that way—in my view, it is insufficient.
The government has indicated positively the possibility of the reimplementation of a tax rebate for owners of private heritage, and that is a good step, but I think that a number of things still remain unclear. As I said, from my point of view, some of the principal matters with regard to the funding in particular and the independence of the council are still of concern to me. I will follow the debate. I have indicated to the minister that I am probably unable to support the legislation at this time, but I will listen to the debate and see what amendments are ultimately passed before I finally decide whether I will vote for the legislation.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on these heritage bills. I agree with at least two points made by Senator Bartlett a moment or two ago. The first was the importance of the issue. I am pleased that that is being recognised in terms of a national responsibility. Obviously, in relation to built heritage, the primary legislative protection has been through the states, but as our nation has evolved I think there has grown a wider recognition of a Commonwealth role and responsibility. Heritage is part of the identity of our nation. We all have an interest in ensuring that it is properly conserved. That will not occur without a level of legislative protection, it will not occur without beyond that an attitude of recognition, appreciation and conservation by the broader community and it will not occur without the various tiers of government, industry and the broader community recognising that it is an expensive business and that the cost of proper conservation and presentation must be met by the nation as a whole. So this wider appreciation and recognition of the importance of this subject matter is important, and I am pleased that it is now being more widely recognised. 
The second point I agreed with Senator Bartlett on was that the existing Commonwealth legislation is inadequate to protect our national heritage. That has been widely accepted and has led to a very long debate on how a contemporary Commonwealth regime might be developed and put in place. I can remember being part of that debate, now many years ago, as Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage, in consultation with the relevant state ministers, through ministerial councils, in consultation with the key non-government bodies in this area—the National Trust, ICOMOS and others—and in consultation with the broader community. There was wide recognition of the need for a contemporary national scheme. Despite the successes of the previous legislation in developing a national list, there was also wide recognition that the time had come for proper protection and that the existing legislation did not give such protection.
The parts of Senator Bartlett's speech I disagreed with were the suggestions of bad faith. This government has tried for many years to get to this stage in relation to Commonwealth heritage legislation. Long and slow negotiation has taken place for some years. The government has been prepared to discuss and negotiate literally hundreds of proposed amendments over many months. The fact that agreement has not been reached on all issues does not make the case for bad faith; it simply indicates that, when the time for negotiation has been completed, there will still be issues where some parties across the chamber will hold different points of view. Such will always be the case. If consensus can be achieved out of a negotiation, that is a good thing. If it cannot, then that is part of the process as well. The issue then comes into this place for a vote and, ultimately, the numbers determine the position of the Senate.
I want to make a couple of general points. The Commonwealth government, through this legislation and in other ways, is improving the way that it protects our heritage. I particularly draw the Senate's attention to the $52 million program, which we have called `Distinctively Australian', that was announced in the recent budget. This program will help us recognise the places that make Australia unique, the places that provide the cultural identity of our nation and the places that provide a source of spiritual wellbeing. The Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 underpin the Distinctively Australian program and will herald a major improvement in the way Australia identifies and protects its heritage places. The legislation will identify, conserve and protect places of national heritage significance, provide for the identification and management of Commonwealth heritage places and establish a new Australian Heritage Council.
The new heritage system will operate through a list of places of national heritage significance, which will be called the National Heritage List; the establishment of a new Commonwealth Heritage List; and the creation of an independent expert body to advise the minister on the listing and protection of heritage places, which, as I said, will be called the Australian Heritage Council. The new National Heritage List will comprise places or groups of places that are of outstanding significance to the nation. As well as places in Australia, important places overseas—that is, important to Australia but located overseas, such as Anzac Cove in Turkey—will be included in the list. There will be a public nomination process and the minister may invite nominations of places within a specified theme, such as federation, Indigenous rock art, Australian eucalyptus, gold rushes et cetera. 
A new expert body, the Australian Heritage Council, will assess nominated places against the listing criteria and advise the government on the heritage significance of places proposed for entry in the list. Public comments will be invited on proposed listings and the council will assess any comments received during this process. As with the current Australian Heritage Commission, the new council will have the ability to enter and remove heritage places from the Register of the National Estate. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage will make the final decision on entry of places on the National Heritage List. Gazettal of a place on the list may include a statement by the minister on management and funding arrangements. The proposed new arrangements, as I said, follow extensive consultation over six years with government, non-government, industry groups and community bodies.
In summary, the new legislation will provide enhanced protection of heritage places, especially heritage places of national significance and Commonwealth heritage places, with potential benefits such as better environmental and social outcomes, and will provide greater certainty of Commonwealth and state roles, responsibilities and processes relating to the environment, particularly Commonwealth involvement in heritage issues. I commend the bills to the Senate.

Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-08-13,"—The government continue to press workplace relations issues and to bring bad legislation before this chamber in relation to workplace relations. It is interesting to compare Mr Reith, the former minister for employment and workplace relations, with Mr Abbott who has taken over that role. If I recollect correctly—and I am happy to be corrected—we heard from Mr Abbott that he was going to start a new process in industrial relations that would be more collaborative, more open and more engaging. But all we have found is that he is hamstrung by his own rhetoric. We have discovered that he has not been doing that at all. He has simply followed badly the poor line that Mr Reith started—one that was never going to progress industrial relations in a cooperative or a sensible way in this country.  
Mr Abbott had the opportunity to break with the past and the path that Mr Reith had laid out. But unfortunately Mr Abbott did not—maybe he was unable to—consider a new direction in industrial relations apart from the direction Mr Reith had set. Mr Abbott has had opportunities to consult with former industrial relations spokesperson Mr McClelland, and now with Mr Emerson, to talk about a more cooperative way of dealing with industrial relations in this country. There is a need to ensure that a modern approach to industrial relations is maintained, one that progresses more than simply the negative aspects that we have heard from Mr Abbott in the last 18 months.
It is disappointing that all we have seen from Mr Abbott in the last six months—although it goes back even further than that—is the same rhetoric that Mr Reith followed. It leads to me to the conclusion that perhaps Mr Abbott is simply devoid of any new ideas to progress industrial relations in a way that is more sensible, more cooperative and more responsive to the needs of the work force generally, and that he is simply following the line set by Mr Reith because he knows no way of dealing with workplace relations other than in an antagonistic and an offensive way. Perhaps that is a failing of Mr Abbott. I am not sure and I am not in a position, in this chamber, to be able to ask Mr Abbott, although I am sure a spokesperson on the other side will be able to assist in the debate when we come to it.
When you look at workplace relations and the issues Mr Abbott has been progressing, you look at these amendments and the previous bill and you ask: where is the innovation? Where are the positive benefits for workers? Where are the ways for employers to achieve outcomes? The answers to these questions have not been presented to this house. You have to go back to the industrial relations reforms of the Labor Party which were introduced in the early nineties and which still provide a path forward. The government has been trying—not always, I suspect, in the best way—to ensure that workplace relations were going to be progressed, but instead they remain hamstrung.
— Senator Murray, my understanding is that Democrat amendments (1) and (2) amount to the effect of opposition amendment (1). Do you seek to move those two amendments separately or would you like to pursue opposition amendment (1)?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, it is probably appropriate that we deal with opposition amendment (1) as they have proposed it and then move accordingly. I want to make some general remarks before we get into the teeth of the debate.
I think it is important to restate a proposition that I put forward in my speech on the second reading, perhaps not quite in that language or as explicitly. It is my view that the parties engaged in this debate—the coalition, the Labor Party and the Democrats—all have a common interest in the transmission of business issue and all parties accept the importance of facilitating the sales of businesses whilst preserving the existing contractual obligations that are there for employees in a business that is to be sold either in part or as a whole. It is also my judgment that all parties have a view that it is useful in fact to adopt the government's new view, which is to give the Industrial Relations Commission more powers in this area and more involvement in making determinations with regard to these matters. So really what we are arguing about is the best, fairest and best constructed way in which this should be done. Therefore, if there is a starting point which is accepted, it is a question then of resolving the approach that should be adopted.  
One of the reasons that I think the government is probably right to revisit this area is the prevalence of agreements which now make it more complex for transmission of business to occur. Where under the previous legal framework in 1988 both agreements outside of awards and awards were all regarded as awards for purposes of the transmission of business, we now have a situation where agreements constructed without third party interference, namely without the Industrial Relations Commission in the case of Australian workplace agreements and in the case of certified agreements, are extremely prevalent. It was interesting to see just yesterday the minister issue a press release concerning trends in federal enterprise bargaining for the March quarter 2003. He puts these out every quarter, but what caught my eye is that at 31 March 2003 there were 9,693 federal enterprise wage agreements that were current, covering an estimated 1,567,000 employees. 
Plainly, some of those agreements will be involved in transmission of business proceedings as a natural consequence of market activity. In some of those circumstances again there will be a need, or they will believe there is a need, for the incoming business to review and revise wages and conditions of their total work force, both old and new. It is our consistent view—it has been in the past and remains so at present—that the bias in the law should be to preserving contractual relationships and to trying to ensure that the conditions and terms which are present in an agreement are preserved to the benefit of those who have made that agreement. That applies whether it is a lease, an agreement with a supplier or an agreement with employees. Within those general remarks we place the context of this bill.
When we move to the amendment before us in the bill, frankly, we are concerned that we cannot assess the real benefit of the amendment suggested. As we understand it, at present an appeal is allowed under the existing legal framework of the act, and the new appeal provision as proposed in the legislation seems to us not to be necessary and in fact may have the consequence of restraining or reducing somewhat the present provisions, or narrowing it. That is our view, and I would appreciate hearing from the shadow minister a little more of her views on the appeals matter, and of course from the minister at the table with responsibility in this area.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-13,"—I take the opportunity to speak more generally in relation to Labor's amendments and then deal specifically with amendment (1). On the basis of Democrat amendments (1) and (2), we will be happy to rely on Democrat amendments (1) and (2) and not proceed with our amendment (1).
Going to general discussion in relation to the amendments, Labor's amendments have the effect of deleting all the government's amendments and replacing them with amendments that further protect employees' entitlements in the event of business restructures. Senator Murray is correct that to various levels all parties have a commitment to preserving protections of transmission of business. I suggest that the differences between us are probably differences in degree on those points. 
These protections are primarily the role of the transmission of business provisions in industrial relations legislation to ensure that the sale or restructuring of a business does not have the effect of reducing employment conditions. Labor recognises that the sale and transfer of business is an important part of a vibrant economy. However, transmission of business legislation needs to ensure that such transfers honour existing employment rights and conditions. The current Workplace Relations Act retains provisions that are meant to ensure that awards and agreements continue to apply to successor businesses. However, the way these provisions have been interpreted has had the effect that they can easily be avoided. Labor's amendments seek to once again give these provisions meaning by requiring that consideration be given to the true nature of transmissions of business.
In contrast, the government's bill before us seeks to further undermine the existing Workplace Relations Act provisions by giving the commission the right to overturn collective agreements without the consent of employees in the event of the sale of the business or even if the sale of the business is merely likely. Labor's amendments, on the other hand, strengthen the protection of employment conditions in the event of corporate restructures. This is necessary to ensure that businesses cannot avoid the transfer of employment awards and agreements simply by carefully structuring the sale of their business. Amendment (1), which we will not proceed with, sought to delete the government's amendments that give employers the right to not only overturn agreements but appeal if the commission decided not to overturn them. We agree with the Democrats on the appeal issue. I understand that the Democrats' amendments enable one provision in the bill which rectifies a typographical error, which we overlooked. That is one of the reasons we are preferring their path.
Labor amendments (2) and (4) ensure that both awards, amendment (2), and certified agreements, amendment (4), continue to operate when a business is transferred. The current provisions in the Workplace Relations Act are inadequate to deal with the myriad corporate structures and restructures that take place in our modern economy. The High Court case of PP Consultants that was discussed in the second reading debate evidenced this problem. This case was about an agency of a bank situated within a pharmacy in Byron Bay. When the bank activities transmitted, it was held not to be a transmission of business for the purposes of the Workplace Relations Act because the business in question was found to be a pharmacy rather than a bank. This had the effect of wiping out the entitlements of the relevant employees. Labor's amendments (2) and (4) would protect employees' award and collective agreement conditions of employment in similar situations in the future by clarifying that it is the transfer of business activities that needs to be considered, not merely whether there is a total transfer of the business.
Importantly, Labor's amendments merely broaden the considerations of whether there has been a transmission of business, allowing the commission to consider a broader range of issues to decide whether or not there has been a transmission. We acknowledge that the commission should have the discretion to decide that a transmission may not have occurred in any particular case.
Our amendments (3) and (5) deal with the specific situation of ships sold to foreign operators to avoid domestic employment obligations. Surely even government senators would not approve of foreign workers taking Australian jobs at cut-price rates, which is exactly what such transmissions in the shipping industry are designed to do. This is an important issue for Australia's shipping and freight industry and its workers. Our amendments take away much of the incentive for shipping companies to transfer ships to offshore ownership and to engage foreign crews. This issue was highlighted in last week's High Court decision involving two CSL ships. That case was not strictly about the interpretation of transmission of business provisions but about the effect of a transmission of ships. That case arose when the MUA sought to include a new business as a respondent to its award. Our amendments (3) and (5) will mean that the Australian workers will not have to go to the High Court to preserve their employment conditions. Their conditions will be preserved automatically if a ship is taken offshore and brought back again—which, of course, means that shipowners will be less inclined to undertake such transfers in the first place. 
That concludes my general discussion in relation to Labor's amendments. As I have indicated, we are happy to defer to Democrat amendments (1) and (2) in favour of our amendment (1) and will do so when Senator Murray is in a position to move those amendments. I take this opportunity to inform the chamber that we have also revised our amendment (5), which dealt with another conflict in the running sheet between Labor's amendments and those of the Democrats. That explains that revision for ease of the chamber, and we will come to that when we get to those amendments. If Senator Murray is now in a position to formally move his amendments (1) and (2), we will be happy to support them.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—The Democrats oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 5 to 9), TO BE OPPOSED.
(2)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 10 to 23), TO BE OPPOSED.
I would note for the purposes of both the shadow minister and the minister at the table that we are opposing item (3) as well. I do so to be consistent, but I note the explanatory memorandum says:
Item 3 would correct a drafting error in the WR Act.
If that could be explained a little more fully, I would probably not be concerned to proceed with item (3). If the minister could explain that so we were dealing with all of those appeals matters at once, even though item (3) is not yet formally before the committee, that would be good. I turn back to the two items I have opposed. The government is repealing an existing paragraph which allows an appeal process, which we support, and adding to that appeal process through item (2). Since we seek to adjust other elements in the bill and since Labor amendments, as outlined by the shadow minister, affect the way in which an appeal would be carried out, our opinion on balance is that because there is an appeal provision we should leave it alone and let that appeal provision stand as it is— which is effectively what these two amendments do. If there were no appeal provision, I would take an entirely different view. But there is an appeal provision in the act.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—The typo that amendment (3) addresses is very simply explained on page 3 of the bill. It says to omit (eea) and substitute (eaa). It is plainly a typo correcting a drafting error. Somebody hit the `E' key instead of the `A' key or vice versa.
—In that case we withdraw that item. 
—Thank you. The opposing of these items is in effect the opposing of the absolute guts of the bill. If you oppose these items then the bill has been gutted, and maybe that is the intention. We have identified the need to deliver to the employees certainty about appeal rights. We are convinced that the general appeal provisions are too restrictive and have in practice, since the passage of the workplace relations reforms of 1996, proved to be too restrictive when it comes to the transmission of business.
It has been made abundantly clear to us, and we thought to the Australian Democrats, that we need provisions within the legislation and a regulatory framework that cover all the parties who can be affected by the negotiations that would take place—the discussions or sorting out of a post-transmission clarification of a range of different employee-employer relationships that could occur after the transfer of a business, that is, the sale or merger of businesses or whatever, where you undertake a process to ensure the new enterprise has in place sound, quality relationships and agreements to cover the employment relationships—and that can ensure that that can happen in an efficient, effective and fair way. I would have thought, from reading what Senator Murray has said about these things in the past, that he and the Democrats would share that aspiration. I might quote from something that he said—it just says the Democrats but it is to do with workplace relations, so it was probably Senator Murray who said it; I have just got a nod and a wink. It says:
It seems self-evident that the IRC should have discretion in respect of transmission of employee conditions in business acquisitions, however, particularly when more than one certified agreement affects `old', `transferred' and `new' employees in a business ... The Industrial Relations Commission needs to determine which agreement should prevail—provided, that is, that the Industrial Relations Commission continues to recognise that the intention behind the transmission of business provisions is, in the interests of fairness, to provide a protective mechanism for employees. The IRC must do this while taking into account the need to provide new or reformed businesses with necessary operational flexibility.
That could have been the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum to this bill. It is very much in tune with the government's thinking but in total conflict with the move that is before the Committee of the Whole at the moment, which is to obliterate the rights of a class of important people to appeal to the AIRC if they cannot reach an outcome in relation to the agreements that were in place prior to the business moving from one owner to another, if they cannot reach agreement about what should occur under the new owner, and we believe that the provisions in this schedule—which would be knocked out by the Democrats—is actually anti-employee and in direct conflict with what Senator Murray said in that eloquent contribution to the debate on this very issue. 
We believe that the general provisions do not provide employees with the opportunities that we think they should have. The new provisions that this bill puts in place will ensure that all the relevant parties can appeal to the AIRC. The very reason we are here with this legislation—which we think is a vast improvement on the legislation that was put forward in the last parliament, which obviously left the Notice Paper with the prorogation of the parliament—is that it really does create a much fairer system, particularly for employees. We are quite perplexed as to why this amendment would be here. If you want to stick with the general appeal provisions, it would defeat the purpose of this whole bill. I think everyone has agreed that the Workplace Relations Act as it stands needs to be improved in this particular area. 
There is agreement, as put by Senator Murray, that it needs to take into account `the need to provide new or reformed businesses with the necessary operational flexibility' and provide `a protective mechanism for employees'. The amendment we are debating actually removes fairness for employees, so we are a bit perplexed. We hope Senator Murray will think carefully about the propositions we have put before him and that he accepts—with the graciousness he did with regard to removing his amendment (3) in relation to a typo—that we have thought this through and we have got it right: we have got balance, and it actually delivers more fairness for employees. This amendment removes appeal rights for employees. We are trying to give them rights, but this amendment takes them away. It is quite bizarre.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—Sometimes when we deal with bills we get duty ministers who, frankly, are not across the field that is covered by the legislation. That is not the case with Senator Ian Campbell, because Senator Campbell in fact was at the forefront of the legislative debate on the 1996 act. The value of this discussion is that it is an informed discussion. Nevertheless, my response to Senator Campbell's remarks would be that I think he is confusing two issues. One issue is whether the Industrial Relations Commission should have expanded powers and abilities in these areas because of the complexity of the issue that is before us—namely, the number of certified agreements that are out there that have resulted in a much more complex market than used to be the case. The Senate, by virtue of the amendments before it, is agreeing with that intention of the government. The Senate is not proposing that item 10, which I regard as being at the core of the bill, be done away with. The Senate is seeking to expand, through the amendments that are before it, the discretion of the AIRC. In fact, the Democrats are trying to take the government's intentions further than they wanted. Labor's approach and ours is to give the AIRC even more powers and criteria than it has at present.
I think you have to separate out the issues that we think are at the core of the bill, which is what the AIRC can do and the issue of appeal. I have had the benefit of a briefing from the minister's advisers on this matter, and to date they have failed to persuade me that the existing section 45 is not sufficient for an objector. It is in the absence of the new provisions, as I understand the law, that an objector would rely on section 45(1)(b) or 45(1)(c), so it is not as if there is no appeal provision. I am quite happy to admit that I may not have got across all the intentions that the government might understand lie behind its proposal but, to date, I have not been persuaded by the papers before us, the original inquiry or the advice I have that these provisions as phrased are essential. I am inclined, on the precautionary principle, to stay with the appeal process that exists already and that works already. It is not as if transmission of business issues are not already handled—what the government is trying to do is make sure they are handled more efficiently and effectively.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—Hopefully, if I can convince Senator Murray of something now, it will save a lot of paperwork and toing-and-froing between the House of Representatives and the Senate. In Senator Murray's comments in the Senate committee report on this legislation, he made the statement—using words that I think another great legislator in the guise of Abraham Lincoln did:
It seems self-evident to me that the AIRC should have discretion in respect of transmission of employee conditions ... 
This amendment removes that discretion. The existing ordinary appeal rights—the general appeal provisions that Senator Murray thinks we should rely on—do not sufficiently reflect the unusual nature of proceedings about a transmission of certified agreement proceedings. The general provisions have the potential to deny appeal rights to those interested in these proceedings while giving appeal rights to those with no interest. The ordinary appeal rights are that any organisation or person bound by an order may appeal it and any organisation or person aggrieved by a refusal to make an order may appeal. The appeal rights proposed in this bill are that, in general, if a person made a submission at the hearings, they can lodge an appeal against the order. Where an order is made to the effect that a certified agreement not apply, either entirely or partially, this bill would give a right of appeal to the original applicant for the order and to any organisation or person who made submissions at the hearing into whether the order ought to be made. Where the commission refuses to make an order, only the applicant who sought the order may appeal. This reflects the beneficial nature of this legislation. If the AIRC refuses to make an order, the status quo is maintained. The agreement transmits and the employment conditions are protected. There is therefore no need for anyone other than the party who sought the order to have the ability to appeal the decision.
I hope that makes it a little bit clearer but, to restate the position: the cold, hard reality of an aye vote to this amendment will be that you are restricting the appeal rights of people who we believe should have them. The general provisions are not really adequate because, as I reiterate, the ordinary appeal rights are that any organisation or person bound by an order may appeal it and any organisation or person aggrieved by a refusal to make an order may appeal it.
That is restrictive. We are saying that the provisions as proposed in this bill guarantee fairness by ensuring that a range of people who are excluded by the general appeal provisions that I have now read out a couple of times will be given access to appeal rights and by ensuring that the AIRC will have the power to hear those appeals. An aye vote to this amendment will be detrimental to those people's rights; by doing that you will be limiting the rights that the government seeks to give them.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-13,"—Senator Ian Campbell, I am seeking clarity on the point about general provisions. Could you give us some examples of parties who have been excluded from the general provisions or parties who you foresee would be excluded? Precisely what parties, potentially, are we talking about?",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—One very good example of that is, potentially, an incoming employer. If the AIRC refused to make a decision, the incoming employer would obviously have an interest in that. But, if you rely on the general provisions, obviously that interest cannot be represented before the AIRC. We think that is something the AIRC should be empowered to hear.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—I appreciate the remarks made by the minister but, with respect to that particular point, later on we will seek an amendment to transpose `outgoing' with `incoming' employer, which would enable the incoming employer to be the applicant.
With the permission of the chamber, I need to deal with an earlier discourse so that we can correct matters. I glanced from my sheet at the bill and referred to item 3; of course, amendment (3) on my sheet opposes item 4 of the bill and we ended up discussing item 3 of the bill. Minister, could you revisit item 4, which relates to the note I wanted explanation on; we were not opposing item 3 of the bill. 
—I'm sorry.
—Do you see what we did?
—Yes.
—I probably should have been more alert, not alarmed. Minister, turning back to the substantial amendment, this is an area on which we remain unconvinced at this stage. I think we should hold with our position, because this matter is very much affected by the government's attitude, subsequent to this debate, to the remainder of the amendments that go through. The remainder of the amendments may well affect, depending on how the government deal with them and whether they accept them or not, the sorts of persons that would be covered by an appeal provision. I have listened carefully to the views you have expressed, and I think we should still hold to our amendments as they are. But I would indicate that we, as the Democrats, are always open to any suggestions that may improve an appeal procedure.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-13,—I would take this opportunity to concur with Senator Murray: we remain unconvinced. I do not think that past inquiries into this bill have highlighted this issue or that any significant advantage has been demonstrated to date. We will remain open on the matter in the future.,SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—I want to add something, which I do hope Senator Murray will consider. I was asked by Senator Jacinta Collins to give examples of people who would be excluded if we were reliant on the existing general appeal provisions. Another very important group of people would be the incoming employees of the incoming employer—a potentially very big and important group of people. If the incoming employees of the incoming employer wanted to have their views known about the sorts of arrangements that would ensue in the new workplace, by relying on the general provisions and regardless of the subsequent amendment in relation to incoming employers, the successful vote on this amendment would have the effect of excluding incoming employees from appearing before the commission to put their case.
To use Senator Murray's words, I think it is self-evident that there is a group of people whose voices you would want to have heard, in some cases, before the commission. Senator Murray's amendment will stop those voices being heard. They are very important voices. They will be sharing a workplace and they will have a view about what other agreements are in place and what remunerative and other conditions apply in that same workplace. The effect of the Democrat amendment will be to remove the right of those people to have their voices heard.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—The notion of incoming employees having a part to play in determinations which affect the sale of a business is a novel one for me, I must say—it takes me by surprise. If I reach back into my own business background, I never did consult my employees in any circumstance where I, as a business owner, business director or business executive, was seeking to buy a business. It makes it impossibly complicated to start discussing with employees the ways in which you conduct a sale. So it is a surprising concept for me. That does not mean to say I reject it out of hand. I am much more concerned with the incoming employer than with the incoming employees in this respect. I think the key people are the incoming employer, the outgoing employees and the outgoing employer; perhaps that is the best way to put it. Minister, you have made a valiant effort. I think you should accept that, for the moment, the numbers are against you. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—I could see that coming. The commission will want to look at the agreements that are in place across the work force. That will include existing agreements with the old employer and the old employees who are transferring over. It will also include the agreements that are in place between the incoming employer and the incoming employees. What you are arguing, and what you are about to vote for, is saying: `We will have a look at the agreements that affect the incoming employees, but we will tell the commission that they have to stick a blindfold on in relation to the agreements which could affect another significant part of the new work force. Just ignore those agreements.' You will go to the commission and say, `We want to resolve these issues so we can have harmonious workplace relations going forward,' but what the Democrats are saying is that the commission has to ignore all of that. That is what you are about to vote for.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—Minister, don't take this as an accusation of misrepresenting the Senate, because it is not, but I just do not believe that is true. An incoming employer would place before the commission any arguments they have, which may include tabling the agreements of their own business. The incoming employer, as the applicant—which we propose to make sure can happen, through our amendments—would be able to put up any argument they like, and their representatives would be able to argue the case and call witnesses to express that.
Perhaps your advisers in the box have an advantage over you and me. I have never appeared before an Industrial Relations Commission, so I am working on a commonsense understanding of the law. I do not think you have been a practitioner in that area either, but I do know that on the Labor side there are practitioners. Perhaps they can tell me whether my understanding of how the law would work is accurate. Surely the applicant presents such evidence as they regard as pertinent to the application and argues that case. That will include the agreements which pertain to their own employees as well as to the employees of the business, or part of the business, they are seeking to buy. I just cannot accept that your argument on that point is valid. I remind you again that our later amendments do refer to the incoming employer.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—I will put the case one more time to make it absolutely clear and so it is on the record. This is from the advisers. In the case of the AIRC refusing to make an order, the Democrat amendment would deny incoming employees a right of appeal—period.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—I ask that we return to the earlier areas of concern. I am delighted to discover that I was not so foolish as to be trying to knock out (eaa), or item 3 in the bill.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-13,"—Senator Murray, you do not address item 3, so your amendments preserve the rectification of the drafting error. Your amendment (3), which seeks to oppose item 4, however, is dealt with in our amendment (2), where we seek to do the same but to insert, basically, a more stringent test on transmission. So, if you are happy to withdraw your amendment (3), it will be dealt with in our amendments (2) and (4), except that we are seeking to insert more into the bill.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-13,"—by leave—I move:
 (2)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (lines 26 to 31), omit the item, substitute:
4 At the end of section 149
Add:
	(1B)	For the purpose of determining whether an employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee of the business or part of the business within the meaning of paragraph (1)(d), the following factors must be considered:
	(a)	whether the activities performed by the employees in the business or part of the business of the employer who was a party to the industrial dispute are substantially the same as the activities performed by the employees in the business or part of the business of the alleged successor, assignee or transmittee; and
	(b)	whether the relevant business activities of the employer who was a party to the industrial dispute are substantially the same as the relevant business activities of the alleged successor, assignee or transmittee.
The existence of either or both of these factors would tend to indicate that an employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee within the meaning of paragraph (1)(d).
	(1C)	For the purpose of determining whether to make an order that an award does not bind, or binds only to a limited extent, a successor, assignee or transmittee within the meaning of paragraph (1)(d), the Commission must consider:
	(a)	whether the successor, assignee or transmittee is already bound by another award; and
	(b)	whether the activities performed by the relevant employees in the business of the successor, assignee or transmittee can be separately identified in the business of the successor; and
	(c)	whether the relevant employees of the successor, assignee or transmittee would be disadvantaged if such an order were made; and
	(d)	the effect of such an order on the efficiency and productivity of the business.
(4)	Schedule 1, items 6 to 9, page 4 (lines 1 to 12), omit the items, substitute:
6 At the end of section 170MB
Add:
	(4)	For the purpose of determining whether a new employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee of the whole or part of a business within the meaning of paragraph (1)(c) or (2)(c), the following factors must be considered:
	(a)	whether the activities performed by the employees in the business or part of the business of the previous employer are substantially the same as the activities performed by the employees in the business or part of the business of the new employer; and 
	(b)	whether the relevant business activities of the previous employer are substantially the same as the relevant business activities of the new employer.
The existence of either or both of these factors would tend to indicate that the new employer is a successor, assignee or transmittee within the meaning of paragraph (1)(c) or (2)(c).
Perhaps I should just repeat what I indicated in my more general remarks. Opposition amendments (2) and (4) ensure that both awards, which are covered by amendment (2), and certified agreements, which are covered by amendment (4), continue to operate when a business is transferred. We feel that the current provisions of the Workplace Relations Act are inadequate to deal with the more complex market that exists today, as was suggested earlier by Senator Murray. The High Court case of PP Consultants demonstrated this point significantly. We believe that our amendments (2) and (4) will help strengthen the provisions in the act to ensure that it is not easy for a business to simply construct itself in a way to avoid its obligations and will ensure that the terms and conditions of employment are transmitted.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—The government will not support the opposition amendments. As Senator Collins said, they seek to insert a test in the act that would identify when a business is transmitted. The government is of the view that the test laid down by the Federal Court is too expansive, focusing on the transfer of work rather than on the transfer of the business. This test creates uncertainty, instead of resolving it. This bill is all about trying to resolve that uncertainty. It invites protracted litigation about the identification and characterisation of the activities of a business. In 2000 the High Court ruled that this test was inappropriate for the private sector. From my limited reading of this, it is quite clear that the government accepts the High Court's interpretation of the Federal Court's view. Therefore, yet again, we would say that these amendments would defeat the very purpose of the bill, and that is probably why they are designed that way.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—This just expands the basis on which the Industrial Relations Commission's judgment shall be exercised. It says the commission `must consider these matters'. It does not say that it has to follow that. But I think it is an attempt to recognise that the High Court has said to the parliament of Australia that the law as presently expressed introduces considerable uncertainty and it would be better for the AIRC to be resolving these matters at source than for it to go all the way along the road to the High Court. Our opinion is that if the effect of Labor's amendments is to ask the commission to consider factors then that is going in the right direction. If the government were to examine these amendments and make improvements to them, obviously we would look at that with interest. But, since you are not in a position to do that, we think the broad intention of Labor's amendments, based on the High Court provisions and our understanding of them, is of valuable assistance to the law.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—I have to put this on the record because it seems that the Democrats have got totally the wrong end of the stick. These amendments overturn the High Court's decision. The High Court's decision created clarity, yet these amendments, moved for very obvious motives by the Australian Labor Party, seek to overturn that. They want this to be tied up in legal knots. This is a `make work' scheme for industrial lawyers. They want protracted litigation. We want the AIRC to be able to rule on these issues arising from the transmission of a business. The ALP seems to want the AIRC to spend hundreds of hours determining the issue as to whether a business has been transmitted. We are saying: take these transmission of business issues to the AIRC and get a ruling, get some fairness and move on. They want to spend days in the commission arguing about whether the business has been transmitted in the first place, which is the very legal quagmire which the High Court case in 2000 resolved. So, by supporting these amendments, the Democrats turn back to the uncertainty that existed prior to 2000. They overturn the High Court's decision. So whoever has provided you with your briefing, Senator Murray, has got the argument back to front and upside down. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—I do not think you should assume I am taking instructions. I do not operate on that basis and never have.
—I do; I take expert advice.
—You may, but the government is in a different situation to us. We have to start with a basic philosophy, which I spelt out earlier. The Democrats have a view that, regardless of the nature of the contractual provisions, it is the obligation of the parliament to defend and preserve contractual relationships, whether with a landlord, a supplier or employees. There is jurisprudence and common law going back thousands of years which reinforce that principle. We do not wish to lightly see a certified agreement—which is only for three years and can then be renegotiated; it is not for ever and a day—which has been hammered out between an employer and employee, sometimes at great pains to both, lightly overturned. Our bias is towards the preservation of the contract.
What the High Court said was that it was not possible to formulate any general test to ascertain whether one employer has succeeded to the business or part of the business of another. The High Court disagreed with another court, which took an entirely different approach. So where you get court disagreements of this nature—when you get extremely capable, competent, experienced judges in different courts starting to disagree—the parliament has to recognise that it is an area where they need to intervene. The government has said that it will intervene but, astonishingly to me, seems to be proposing in debate—perhaps not in the legislation—that it wants to overturn a general bias which not only the parliament of Australia but also, as far as I know, parliaments throughout the English-speaking world have for the preservation of contractual obligations. You only overturn those if they are unconscionable or of such long duration that the circumstances and nature of events require you to overturn them.
It seems to me that the Labor amendment has then tried to say: `We recognise that general tests have been challenged. We recognise that you have greater complexity. We want to say to the Industrial Relations Commission that the following factors must be considered.' It does not say that the following factors must prevail. It says that they must consider them. The reason they say that is that right at the heart of this is the preservation of an existing contractual agreement. I fought tooth and nail in this chamber, throughout the 1996-97 negotiations on the act and subsequently, to ensure that certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements had the force and power of law and could operate in terms of the original conception that we put forward—against, I might say, great opposition from the Labor Party. I think that those contractual obligations need defending. That is why I am interested in Labor's approach. 
If the government could find a way to explain to me why I am wrong—which they have not to date either in their advice to me or in the minister's comments—then I would accept that. But I have not arrived at a view on this lightly; I have arrived at it from a position of bias. I am happy to record, on the record, a position of bias. My bias is towards the preservation, wherever possible, of the integrity of agreements that have previously been made. However, that does not mean that the Australian Democrats and I do not accept that there are circumstances in which agreements should be set aside to facilitate a transmission of business. From what I understand, I do not think that the Labor Party take that view either. They recognise that there are circumstances when that should occur. We just wish to constrain them more than you do.
I think that, in the spirit of respecting each other's arguments even when we disagree, Parliamentary Secretary, you should avoid thinking that I just accept whatever advice comes my way; I do not. I am operating from a belief system and a consistent position which the Democrats have taken. I am quite prepared and quite open to be persuaded otherwise, but I have not been to date. Therefore, in the chamber today I have to say to you that I agree with the Labor Party's intention. You may subsequently bring these matters back, and we may have further discourse, but I cannot see why you would not want the Industrial Relations Commission to consider some of these matters—rephrase them, if you like, or reframe them, I do not care. I do not see that there is a problem with asking the commission to make sure that, in considering these matters, they consider these particular issues.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—What I said in relation to advice is that you have formed a view that this would uphold the High Court decision when in fact the opposite is true: it actually overturns it. It does not really matter how you got to the position—whether you were advised that or have formed that view independently—but if someone wrote me a note or gave me some research saying that this upholds the High Court's ruling you could get up and say, `Senator Campbell, you're wrong; you've been wrongly advised.'
The Labor Party's intention is to defeat the purpose of this bill, and this amendment seeks to do that. They do not hide that; they are not interested in covering that up. What they would have occur, if this amendment is successful, and it looks as though it will be, is the AIRC spending its time analysing whether or not a transmission of business has taken place. What we want to do, and what this bill seeks to ensure, is for the IRC to have the jurisdiction to consider the matters that it already considers in relation to workplace awards—to consider those who are protected by the certified agreements. That is simply what we are seeking to do. You said in your words in the Senate committee report that it was self-evident that the AIRC should have discretion with respect to transmission of employee conditions.
—That's right, and this doesn't take it away.
—No, all it does is ensure that the AIRC spends all of its time looking into whether or not a transmission has taken place—and, obviously, probably having a whole series of appeals about whether they even have jurisdiction—rather than looking into the issues that we want them to look at. We are giving it the power to look at these agreements. The effect of it is that it is in contradiction of your stated philosophy and beliefs—many of which I share—that the AIRC should have this discretion. What you are doing is significantly hamstringing the commission, firstly, in relation to finding its jurisdiction in this area. That is what the Labor Party want to do, and the effect of these amendments is to do just that. It seems to be in conflict with one of the beliefs that you have set down in writing in the Senate report. But I respect the fact that you can have a set of beliefs, some of which can be in conflict with each other. That is clearly what you are grappling with at the moment. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"rray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—I can only judge it on the face of what I have before me. Reading the specifics of the Labor Party amendment, it says that the commission must consider whether the activities performed by the employees in the business or part of the business of the employer who was a party to the industrial dispute are substantially the same as the activities performed by the employees. Paragraph (b) goes on to refer to whether the business activities are substantially the same. If you are in a transmission of business circumstance and you wish to overturn or set aside an existing contractual agreement, the issues of whether the nature of the work— and therefore the rewards and the terms and conditions enjoyed by the employees— should continue or should be set aside in place of something else have to relate to that issue. But it does not mean to say that they cannot be set aside in argument by a commissioner who takes other factors into account—that is, the old business might be in perilous circumstances and, in agreeing to the way in which the new business is to be reshaped, it would be better for everybody all round if a new agreement prevailed. 
If the amendment said that the commission may not make a finding in contradiction of this, then I would have concern. But it does not say that—unless I am missing some words or other understandings. From my understanding of the various court cases— and I confess quite freely that I have not read the things top to bottom; I have only read summaries of them—it does make sure that they take into account matters, and it seems to me to need that sort of clarification.

Opposition amendments (3) and (R5) deal with the specific situation of ships sold to foreign operators to avoid domestic employment obligations. This is an important issue for the Australian shipping and freight industries and their workers. Our amendments take away much of the incentive for shipping companies to transfer ships to offshore ownership and engage foreign crews. Senator Campbell will be pleased to hear that this will assist in providing more certainty in that industry, as indeed I would argue our last amendments would assist in providing more certainty in terms of interpretation on when transmission should be regarded as having occurred.
This issue was also highlighted in last week's High Court decision involving two CSL ships. The case was not strictly about the interpretation of transmission of business provisions; it was about the effect of a transmission of ships. That case arose when the MUA sought to include the new business as a respondent to its awards. Our amendments (3) and (R5) will mean that Australian workers do not have to go to the High Court to preserve their employment conditions, thus providing more certainty. Their conditions will be preserved automatically if a ship is taken offshore and brought back again, which of course means that shipowners will be less inclined to undertake such transfers in the first place.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,—These new sections as proposed by the ALP would make an award or certified agreement binding on an employer who operates a ship that has switched from a coasting trade licence to a continuing voyage permit under the Navigation Act 1912. The government's policy is that Australia should have an efficient and competitive shipping industry that supports Australian trade both at home and abroad. It seems clear that the only intent of the amendments is designed to help the Maritime Union of Australia maintain its internationally uncompetitive labour practices and we will therefore oppose them. ,SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—We were talking earlier of contradictions of philosophy. It seems to me that the government have long accepted that it is quite proper for Australia to have internationally uncompetitive wages and conditions. It is part of the living standards and the quality of life that the government supports. Employees in Australia and in Australian enterprises do not have the wages and conditions of some Third World countries, so to be internationally uncompetitive I think is one of the burdens you face in a mature society of our sort. Throughout the OECD, terms and conditions could be termed internationally uncompetitive with Third World terms and conditions. I have always understood the difficulty that Australian shipowners face when they are trying to compete with foreign shipowners under foreign flags who employ the cheapest labour and have near-slave conditions. I think the government—both the past government and the present government—to their credit, have argued in the ILO for such slave conditions to be ended and have fought for better conditions.
Once again, I find this problematic to deal with. Certainly I understand the need for Australian employers to have the most competitive conditions they can, but we have here a terrible conflict. I cannot see why somebody who is allowed under law to be uncompetitive on the land of Australia should not be allowed to be uncompetitive on the sea of Australia. Somebody in a clothing factory in Melbourne—or even outworkers—has terms and conditions and wages which are far better than those in some of our neighbouring countries. We accept that. That is the price we thankfully pay for being a society which is more advanced.
I see this as a confirmation of existing policy, rather than undermining or going against existing policy. Unless you can persuade me to the contrary and show in what manner that is so—and I confess I have not asked the government for a briefing on this, nor have I delved deeply into it—on the face of what I have read, that is my understanding. The conflict we have is that our laws make us uncompetitive in certain respects because we choose to regard the terms and conditions which shall apply to Australian labour, in certain respects, to be uncompetitive internationally. Australians earn more money and have better conditions and that is the way it is.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-13,"—I did not talk about pay and conditions; I talked about uncompetitive labour practices. There is absolutely no doubt in a maritime nation like Australia that, with our fantastic ports and our maritime history, we should not have a world-competitive maritime trade, that more and more cargo should not go on coastal ships and that Australia should not become more and more competitive by ensuring that we have the most efficient labour practices throughout our ships, our handling facilities and our stevedores. If you want to reinforce the tactics of the Maritime Union of Australia by supporting what could only be called the `MUA here to stay provisions', which you are hoping to insert in this bill, then you actually stand against that amendment. Senator Murray has made it clear that the government have fought to ensure that bad workplace practices in this industry world wide are stamped out. We have never said, `Let's employ Australians at slave rates,' or put in those sorts of conditions. By standing against these amendments, we do not say that. That is an incredible thing to insinuate. 
My words were quite clearly that we support an efficient and competitive shipping industry. You do not have a competitive shipping industry by having bad human relations onboard your ships; you have it by having very good workplace and human relations on your ships, with highly efficient, highly effective, well-trained, world-class seamen—the sorts of seamen Australia has put across the oceans for over 100 years. That is what we want. But what do the Labor Party want? They want to have a special `MUA here to stay provision' in this law. They want to stand in the way of commerce and trade. They want to stand in the way of building Australia as a great maritime nation because they want it controlled hook, line and sinker—and noose—by the MUA. To make quite clear what these amendments do—by leave—I formally move:
Item 4A, heading to section 149A, before “Persons”, insert “MUA here to stay—”.
Item 10A, heading to section 170MBB, before “Successor”, insert “MUA here to stay—”.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—We really have to return to the amendments before us. The government cannot have it both ways. I am the strongest supporter you could find—perhaps not the strongest, but I am amongst the strongest supporters you could find—of certified agreements. I think that enterprise bargaining is what is required to ensure that you have a flexible and fair employment market. When you create an enterprise bargaining agreement, you create a certified agreement—that is, a contract between the employees and the employers established under the workplace relations law, which your policy and the Democrats' policy all agree with, independent of a third-party construction. This says that, in any transmission of business which affects the shipping industry, you will be bound by the certified agreement.
—We are not talking about agreements; we are talking about awards in this amendment.
—Section 2(a) on the third page says: `If the employer of the seamen employed on the ship when the ship was engaged in the coasting trade was bound by a certified agreement,' et cetera. It refers to a certified agreement. That is a three-year agreement determined by the employees who are concerned with the employer. It does not say anything about the MUA, although I recognise the reality is that the MUA run the show.
—They wrote the amendment—written and authorised.
—But the reality of that industry is that you have a monopoly on the employee side, you have an oligopoly on the employer side and on the landlord side you have another monopoly. For goodness sake! At every level of that industry are uncompetitive and constrained circumstances. But I am saying to you that in respect of the law, the policy and the principles which you and we espouse, certified agreements should bind the parties for the three years that apply.
Parliamentary Secretary, if you are saying to me that the construction of this could be better and that there are elements of it which could be better presented, I agree with you, but you cannot in argument seek to override your own policy and your own law—which the Democrats fully support—and that is: that certified agreements between employers and employees bind the parties and should continue to bind the parties. To me it is really simple. If you want to aggressively tackle some of the construction of the amendment, I will be all ears; if you want to attack that principle that certified agreements should stand, then I am sorry, I have got a closed mind. 
 (Senator Cherry)—The question is that the amendments moved by Senator Ian Campbell to opposition amendments (3) and (R5) be agreed to.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—I can see why Senator Collins is laughing there: I am standing up defending her own amendments—
—It was the heading, Senator Murray. You have to have a sense of humour!
—There we are. Our amendment (4) on sheet 3035 seeks to expand the criteria to be considered within the expanded discretion that the government is offering under item 10, which, I should reinforce for the record, the Democrats support. We have asked that the commission not make an order unless:
	(a)	the parties to the certified agreement, including the new employer, agree; or
	(b)	where the majority of employees who are parties to the agreement do not agree to the variation, the Commission is satisfied that:
	(i)	that variation does not disadvantage employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employment; or
	(ii)	the variation is part of reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term crisis in, and to assist in the revival of, the single business or part.
Then we refer to subsection 170LT(4). What we are trying to do here is ensure that the basis on which an existing certified agreement which may have a limited period still to run be set aside should clearly relate to existing provisions and existing intentions within the law. I therefore move:
(4)	Schedule 1, item 10, page 5 (after line 12), after subsection 170MBA(2), insert:
	(2A)	The Commission shall not make an order under subsection 170MBA(2) unless:
	(a)	the parties to the certified agreement, including the new employer, agree; or
	(b)	where the majority of employees who are parties to the agreement do not agree to the variation, the Commission is satisfied that:
	(i)	that variation does not disadvantage employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employment; or
	(ii)	the variation is part of reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term crisis in, and to assist in the revival of, the single business or part.
Note:	See subsection 170LT(4) for an example of a case that is not contrary to the public interest.
	(2B)	In this section, a variation disadvantages employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employ-ment if, on balance, its approval would result in a reduction in the overall terms and conditions of employment of those employees under the existing certified agreement.
Note:	Section 170XA contains the no-disadvantage test.
	(2C)	In making an order under subsection 170MBA(2) the Commission must take into account: 
	(a)	the proposed new terms and conditions that employees would be subject to and the effect of any loss of conditions; and
	(b)	the length of time remaining on the certified agreement.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-13,"—I move amendment (5) on sheet 3035:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 10, page 5 (line 22), omit “outgoing”, substitute “incoming”.
What is reflected here is our belief that the incoming employer is the one who needs to make the argument for setting aside or changing the certified agreement, not the outgoing employer. I can see that the outgoing employer has their interest in terms of a sale of the business either as a whole or in part, but it is the incoming employer who is saying that, unless you change the agreement, the sale will be uneconomic or difficult. So, as we see it, it is the incoming employer's obligation, not the outgoing employer's obligation. I had a discussion with the government advisers in their briefing with me and I remain unconvinced by their arguments, but it may simply be that I have not fully grasped them. I would have thought it is the person buying the business, who needs to shape up a new business and move on to the future, who needs to have input into this area.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TRANSMISSION OF BUSINESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

(6)	Schedule 1, item 11, page 8 (line 10) to page 9 (line 23),TO BE OPPOSED.
We oppose item 11 because it simply extends the operation of this bill to all Victorian workplaces. I am sure Senator Murray will realise the reason for this specific item is Victoria's referral of powers to the Commonwealth in 1996, schedule 1A et cetera. Labor's position on this is that, until the government gets serious about removing the ghetto that applies in relation to Victorian workers, we are not prepared to contemplate further fiddling with the current arrangements in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. We will oppose changes that simply seek to accommodate that ghetto and enable it to continue until such time as the government takes seriously the situation being put to it by the Victorian government about rectifying the terms and conditions of Victorian workers.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-08-13,"—As Australia's national broadcaster operating on taxpayer money, the ABC has a great responsibility to the community to discharge its statutory functions in a way that is fully consistent with the expectations of Australians about how our public institutions should behave. We on this side acknowledge that the ABC must exercise its functions independent of direction from the government of the day. However, being independent of government, as `our' ABC is, does not mean that it can escape accountability for its decisions and its conduct. It proclaims loudly that it has no desire to evade those responsibilities, but unfortunately its actions prove that the intention is otherwise. 
It is plain that the ABC management does not like to be questioned about the detail of its stewardship. Just as it regards audience complaints as a nuisance—and anyone who thinks that this is not the case should take the time to read the dismissive responses those judged to be from the great unwashed tend to get from them—it views questions about how and where it spends public money as beyond the pale. From the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that goes on, from managing director Russell Balding downwards, you would think that the world as we know it has come to an end. The feelings of angst on the part of the larger of the two public broadcasters—and it is interesting to note that the other one, SBS, did not take this line or, for that matter, kill off its digital television development—were substantially increased by the ABC's response of injured innocence to questions about bias and a lack of balance in its Iraq coverage.
On 26 May, in the Senate estimates hearing, I asked a number of questions on notice. The ABC has now responded to these—it had until 8 August to do so. I say it has responded to the questions but, coming into the chamber to make this speech, there is one still outstanding—fully five days after the generous 2½ plus months deadline. The missing answer concerns ABC expectations about what property sales would realise. It is interesting that, in the end, it was the issue of its Gore Hill holdings that the ABC's management has had the most difficult time in answering. For the record, it was question on notice No. 37. I am sure fellow members of the estimates committee, especially Senator Mackay—a victim of the serial clumsiness of the foot-in-the-mouth member for Melbourne, a factional enemy—will be interested to see the answer when it eventually surfaces.
Before I go too deeply into the substance of the issue of the ABC, I want to make a clear statement about the outcome of one of the questions I asked on 26 May which the ABC management took on notice. I asked whether Ms Indira Naidoo, presenter of Feedback, was paid more than $250,000 for one day's work a week. That was the information that I had before me. The ABC answered eventually—perhaps it took them some time to find the paperwork—that Ms Naidoo was paid in the vicinity of one third of that. She is paid in the area of $80,000-plus, and other substantial expenses, for one day's work a week and certain defined additional calls on her time. Most Australians would probably think even the lesser sum was on the generous side for a work schedule that, on the basis of the information the ABC management is prepared to share with the people, does not seem to be overly onerous. Nonetheless it is substantially less than the figure I cited at the estimates hearing. I stress at this point that I was asking a question at the estimates hearing, not making an accusation or stating that the information that I had been supplied with was fact. Having said this, I apologise to Ms Naidoo if, through asking that question, based on the information supplied to me, I caused her any offence. 
That said, there are aspects of the ABC's responses to my questions that are disappointing. Some of them are completely unacceptable. Frankly, some of them are reprehensible. Let me start with the issue that is of greatest significance in the context of the proper parliamentary examination of public expenditure. In response to my question about whether the government had maintained its funding in real terms since 1995-96, the ABC said that it was not and produced a spurious sequence of figures to back up this self-serving claim. As honourable senators know, it asserts that in real terms its funding has been reduced by some $5 million since 1995-96. There are many Australians who would say that $5 million is not a large sum in a funding stream of more than $740 million for 2003-04. But the important points are that the claim that the ABC's funding has been reduced in real terms is wrong and that the ABC knows this. If it does not, it should or it should find some help to tell it so. After all, it does employ a great number of economists who could help out.  
The ABC justifies its claim to have been short-changed by $5 million in real terms by citing the consumer price index. But the CPI measures the change in the prices of the goods and services that households buy—not businesses. The largest single element in the CPI is the cost of residential housing. Using the CPI to determine whether the ABC's funding has or has not diminished in real terms is a real case of counting apples and then shouting that you are short of oranges. If we compare the 1995-96 and the 2003-04 prices of the goods and services that the ABC buys, we see increases of well under one per cent a year. In other words, the ABC requires $504.1 million in 2003-04 to maintain its 1995-96 funding levels in real terms. In fact, the ABC's 2003-04 appropriation is $591.37 million, after excluding $151.21 million in transmission funding and loan funds that were not part of the ABC's 1995-96 appropriation. By this far more appropriate calculation, far from having been reduced, the ABC's funding has actually increased by 17.31 per cent in real terms between 1995-96 and 2003-04. 
Because the ABC has been protected from the fiscal disciplines that have applied to other areas of public expenditure, it is doubly important that it be seen to discharge its charter to the full satisfaction of the people— the taxpayers. The community has every right to expect that the ABC will ensure news reporting and commentary do not display systematic bias and, for that matter, systemic imbalance. It is troubling to me, and I am sure to many Australians, that the ABC has chosen to respond to the examples of implied or to-be-inferred bias and a lack of balance by hiding behind word games and mere contrivances.
I will give one example to begin with that I believe amply demonstrates the serious underlying problem. I know of no-one—bar the ABC, regrettably—that does not believe Australia is an independent country that pursues its own national interests. On 11 March 2003, the ABC reported that Australia had decided to expel an Iraqi diplomat. The decision followed the receipt of information from the US which recommended that the diplomat be expelled. On AM—the transcript can be found on the ABC's web site—Linda Mottram and Leigh Sales said the question about this decision was `whether or not Australia made the decision independently'. Having posed the question in that way, they then described the US request as `an order' and, answering their own question, asked whether `other nations have also obeyed the US order'.
Now, it is true that the latte set, their chardonnay chums and assorted academics might scoff at that. But what that segment says is that, as far as the ABC is concerned, Australia is so far from being an independent and sovereign nation that it obeys US orders. What an insult. There was, of course, in this instance, no US order, other than in the imagination of Ms Mottram. Nor does Australia `obey' US orders—other than in Ms Mottram's apparently very fertile imagination. To assume that it does, as Ms Mottram openly invites her audience to do, highlights the instinctive anti-Americanism and the institutionalised hostility to this government that has become part of AM's stock in trade. But it is not only bias. It is sloppy and shoddy journalism, which should have no place at the ABC. 
That the ABC's so-called complaints process should look at an instance such as this one and not spot a serious problem that demands correction says all that needs to be said about how well that process works and how independent it really is. And just in case the ABC miss this point, I will spell it out for them: the process simply doesn't work, and it isn't independent. We will talk later on a motion to be moved by you, as I understand it, Mr Acting Deputy President Cherry. 
Sloppy and shoddy journalism—the sort that perennially transmits the leftist coda of the media elite—is clearly evident too in the way the ABC fails to adhere to its own editorial policy to disclose the affiliation of those it interviews in the context of reporting and current affairs. The ABC, answering another of my questions it took on notice, claims that it sets a high standard of ensuring that, where the person being interviewed is associated with a particular point of view, that association is made clear. It doesn't. Consider this: when the ABC wanted comment on the allocation of contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq, it went to the Washington based Economic Policy Institute. It found a Mr Max Sawicky there. And—surprise!—he told the ABC that the US administration systematically ignores the requirement for competitive bidding for defence contracts, including contracts such as those being let for the reconstruction of Iraq. What the ABC did not disclose in that instance, and what it has not disclosed on other occasions when it tapped into the on-air talent of the Economic Policy Institute, is that the institute is far from being an impartial source of information. It actively pursues an agenda that is profoundly hostile to the free market in all of its forms.
Let me outline one example: the institute sponsors a `Global Policy Network' that lists what it regards as successes that should guide actions in developing countries. So let us not worry about the market reforms which have made Chile and Taiwan prosperous and which are being emulated in China itself. These are not successes at all, according to the Global Policy Network. For real success, we must look to places where market reforms have been prevented—to the sort of Neanderthal social and economic policies that have made Cuba a basket case and have starved millions in North Korea.
Does the ABC disclose this when it presents the views of the institute as authoritative comment? Of course it does not. What it does do is reserve what it calls `disclosure' for use with sources of comment that it regards as right wing. I canvassed that particular issue quite heavily in the estimates hearings. It chooses the easy luxury of stereotyping those it dislikes, while presenting views with which it is sympathetic as if they were impartial and objective. To describe this as sloppy is to understate the seriousness of the conduct involved.
All this is bad enough. I come now, however, to conduct which, I submit, is frankly reprehensible. I refer specifically to an instruction, which the ABC has now disclosed, by which news and current affairs staff were specifically told, through an email sent by the National Editor, News and Current Affairs, John Cameron, on 12 March, not to refer to the Australian Defence Force personnel in combat in Iraq as `our troops'. They are not `our troops', say Mr Cameron and the ABC. And why is this? Because `the ABC does not own them'. I say that this is plain evidence that the ABC has again completely lost its way in the way it demands that the news be presented. The ABC—`our ABC', as it proudly likes to say—decrees that the young men and women serving this country, at risk to their own lives, are not `our troops'. The ABC has no difficulty— and certainly exhibits no hesitation—in referring to `our cities', `our scientists' and `our athletes'. But, by the curious and plainly offensive rule book of the ABC, Australian service men and women in a war zone are not part of us. 
How is it possible that the ABC could decide to exile from our community those who have been ordered into harm's way by lawful decision, on our behalf, in what the elected government has judged to be Australia's national interest? How could the ABC senior management accept this? Were the Rats of Tobruk who stood up to Rommel and the Afrika Korps not `our troops'? Were the brave men who fought the Japanese to a standstill on the Kokoda Track not `our troops'? Were the Australians captured and incarcerated at Singapore not `our troops'?
There has to be an accounting for this. The ABC's conduct in this instance is deeply offensive. It highlights a viciously pernicious form of political correctness. It is apparently—sadly, from my point of view, and I am sure from the point of view of a great many Australians—as ingrained as it is misconceived. In this view of the world, patriotism is no more than jingoism. Love of country is disparaged. Identification with those who risk their lives for our country is prohibited. This is broadcasting without moral compass, by an organisation that apparently no longer knows what it means to be Australia's voice to the world. 
Australians—who, unlike the ABC, regard Australia's service men and women not merely as part of our community but as a part of it which we are especially proud of— deserve better from the ABC. In fact, I demand that they get better than this. The board of the ABC should apologise to Australia's service men and women. It must clearly and unambiguously repudiate the instruction I have cited, which says—in the context of warfare in Iraq, but one must ask, `Where next?'—that Australian Defence Force personnel are not to be referred to as `our troops'. The board must clearly and unambiguously repudiate all that that instruction stands for. Until it does, the ABC will not be meeting the high standards which Australians not merely are owed but can quite properly expect.
There is a lot more that I could say and want to say about the substantial matters that stand revealed by the estimates examination of the ABC. I asked a lot of questions and I have received very few answers that are an acceptable accounting of circumstances and events by the ABC.

—So you have an answer?
—I have an answer; I do not think it will totally satisfy the senator. I am told that this question is part of a comprehensive series of structured questions from Senator O'Brien to several ministers which related to the government's biofuels industry policy and ministerial and departmental involvement with the Manildra group of companies and the proposed importation of a shipment of ethanol from Brazil by Trafigura Fuels. Senator O'Brien has received answers to some of those questions. I regret that answers to some of the longer and more complex questions to several ministers remain outstanding. I am advised that answers to questions outstanding are being assembled and will be provided to Senator O'Brien and the Senate as soon as possible.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-08-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
The question on notice lodged on 18 March this year goes to a matter at the heart of the ethanol scandal which is engulfing the Howard government. It is a scandal of the government's own making and is one in which a raft of senior ministers are complicit. In noting the minister's explanation, I want to outline why the failure to provide the answer matters. The question concerns ministerial knowledge of the proposed importation of Brazilian ethanol by Trafigura Fuels Australia. It is among a number of unanswered questions to senior ministers concerning their knowledge of this matter—questions that have remained unanswered for five months. They are structured and detailed, but five months is a long time for that information to be assembled.
Usually, unanswered questions denote no more than this government's contempt for the parliament, but the questions about ethanol are different. They concern a matter about which this government has something to hide. Firstly, the government refused to comply with a Senate order for the production of documents relating to communications between senior ministers and the ethanol industry, communications which included at least one private meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr Dick Honan, the head of Manildra—and he has been in the country, Senator Ferguson, which is more than I can say for you.
Not only is Manildra a dominant fuel ethanol producer but it holds a new monopoly position in this market. According to the government's own advice, Manildra captured more than 96 per cent of ethanol subsidies paid by the Howard government last year. Mr Honan's company got $20,857,998 between September 2002 and June 2003, while its only fuel ethanol competitor, CSR, received $845,182. When the government tells the Australian people that it did not design its ethanol package with Manildra in mind, I would urge Australians to make an evidence based assessment. If you care about the development of a viable and sustainable alternative fuels industry—and Labor does—you have to wonder whether entrenching the dominance of the existing new monopoly producer is the way to do it. Of course, the Howard government does not care about alternative fuels but it does care about Manildra. It is a little surprising, therefore, that the head of the Treasurer's own fuel tax inquiry, Mr David Trebeck, has described the Howard government's ethanol policy package as `one of the craziest examples of public policy I have come across in 30 years'.
The Prime Minister failed to disclose his private meeting with Mr Honan on 1 August 2002 when asked about it in the other place on 17, 18 and 19 September last year. Mr Howard's pathetic explanation for failure to disclose his private meeting with Mr Honan has attracted the commentary it deserves. Liberal Party backbenchers have been telling the press that ethanol was not mentioned during this week's party room meeting. So, ipso facto, the issue of honesty on ethanol does not rate. Not only does the absence of discussion highlight the craven character of the Liberal party room under the Prime Minister; it flies in the face of three key realities of Australian politics.
The first is that Australian families care about the fuel they put in their cars and they know the Howard government delayed the imposition of a cap on ethanol blends because it would hurt Mr Honan's ethanol business. And, unfortunately for ordinary families—and, I guess, for the coalition as well—they cannot boast the sorts of donations Mr Honan can to the coalition parties. 
—I thought he made donations to your lot.
—I will come to that, Senator Hill—I am quite prepared to enlighten you on this subject. According to returns lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission, Manildra's donations have included $10,000 to the Prime Minister's re-election campaign in Bennelong and another $10,000 to the Prime Minister's acolyte and chief parliamentary defender, Mr Abbott, in Warringah. AEC returns also show that the member for Parramatta, Mr Cameron, has been happy to receive a $20,000 donation from Manildra, despite the known risk to motorists in Western Sydney from unregulated ethanol blends in petrol.
The second reason this issue is important is that Australian families care about the tax they pay. In relation to ethanol, they are being asked by this government to pay big-time. In the last financial year, the government handed over $21.7 million. The May budget revealed an extension of the ethanol subsidy regime and, of course, the production subsidy, and the total has grown ever upwards. Last month taxpayers' generosity grew with an announcement by the acting industry minister, Mr Hockey, that the government would expedite subsidy payments, pay tens of millions of dollars in capital grants and appoint an exclusive facilitator to give Manildra assistance in its commercial negotiations. 
I frankly do not care what personal access the Prime Minister chooses to give Liberal Party donors—and for all I care, they can spend as much time in each other's company as either can bear—but I do care about how the Prime Minister chooses to spend public money. I care very much that decisions about domestic industry protection and the provision of tens of millions of dollars to Manildra were made six weeks after Mr Howard sat down for a private chat with Mr Honan at which these specific matters were discussed—particularly when, a week after the decisions were made, the Prime Minister told the parliament no such meeting had taken place. If members of the government think Australians do not care how their tax dollars are spent then I think they are badly mistaken.
The third reason the ethanol scandal matters relates to honesty. I know using the words `honesty' and `the Howard government' in the same sentence has a jarring effect on many ears, but the parliament and the people are entitled to demand and receive an honest account of the government's dealings on all matters. On the matter of ethanol, the parliament and the people have been badly let down. It is indisputable that Mr Howard met Mr Honan on 1 August last year. It is indisputable that an industry assistance scheme, including production credits and import protection, was discussed by these men at that meeting. It is indisputable that Mr Howard denied that such a meeting occurred in answer to three questions in the parliament over three days in September last year. 
Just because no government backbencher is prepared to confront the Prime Minister about an issue does not mean that it is not important. No doubt the deception over `children overboard' is rarely discussed by the members of the government, but that does not mean that people will not hold them to account for it at the next election. First, the deception over `children overboard'; then, the false information about Iraq's uranium imports from Africa; and, now, the cover-up over ethanol. In relation to each of these incidents, Mr Howard has sought to hide behind his staff and the bureaucracy, choosing to blame others for his actions, but on ethanol he has run out of excuses. 
Despite the fact that part of the story has been exposed through a protracted and only partially complete freedom of information process, the government continues to treat the truth with contempt by refusing to disclose details about its ethanol activity. Today the Sydney Morning Herald alleges that staff of Australia's embassy in Brazil engaged in activity akin to spying on Trafigura Fuels operations. This is the company that sought to import ethanol to Australia from Brazil aboard the Oriental Wisteria. It is a company that, together with Neumann Petroleum, has paid a very heavy price for wanting to stay in the fuel ethanol business. The media report is consistent with an answer to a question taken on notice at Senate estimates last year by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in which the department confirms that it received directions from the Prime Minister's department in relation to this matter.
As reported in today's paper, the rushed decision to protect the domestic industry directly cost Trafigura and Neumann Petroleum in the order of $1 million. This is despite the fact the companies informed the government of their intention to import the ethanol. The Managing Director of Trafigura Fuels, Mr Barrie Jacobson, says he cannot understand why the government took what, due to its timing, amounted to punitive action against his company. After all, all Mr Jacobson wanted to do was compete against Manildra. He says the government's action stinks—and, frankly, I do not blame him. 
My unanswered question on notice goes to the government's knowledge of that shipment and, together with other unanswered questions on notice, seeks information about the government's action in response to that knowledge. It is a reasonable question, it is one that is capable of being answered, it is one that does not require five months of compilation to answer and it is one that, frankly, demands an answer. I am not satisfied with the minister's explanation for failing to respond, given five months have elapsed since the question was asked, just as the Australian people are not satisfied with the Howard government's ongoing deception on ethanol matters.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-08-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to the carer allowance and disability services.
Yet again, today we have seen a performance from the Minister for Family and Community Services which demonstrates why she is unsuitable to administer this portfolio. It is difficult to imagine a more deserving group for a helping hand than families caring for children with disabilities, but no group is off limits to this minister. In search of budget savings, her own department established a quota of 30,000 families to be stripped of the carer allowance. This stubborn minister has concealed and continues to conceal the full extent of these cuts.
Yesterday—only after weeks of pressure—the minister was dragged kicking and screaming to a partial backdown. Pressure from families who were brave enough to come forward and pressure from Labor have triggered a change of heart from this government, but it took the intervention from the Prime Minister's office for the movement which occurred yesterday. On Monday the minister defended the cuts and made it clear that no changes to the recognised disability list would be made until probably Christmas. She added that any conditions would be separate to the current process. But, less than 24 hours later, six conditions had been added or modified on the recognised disabilities list that confers automatic entitlement. That was a breathtaking turnaround.  
The announcement yesterday would have brought joy and happiness to some families, but thousands of others who stand to lose their allowance received no comfort. The truth is: few were affected by the announcement yesterday—a fact confirmed by the minister herself when she said that most of those families would have requalified anyway. The figure she used in passing was of the order of 98 per cent. Today we have challenged the minister to produce figures to show exactly how many of the 70,000 under review will be protected by the new additions to the recognised disability list. Families will be cut off the allowance because they do not meet the new, harsher rules. 
The minister cannot escape the fact that the child disability assessment tool was designed to further restrict access to this payment. To justify these cuts, the minister has been peddling plenty of half-truths. She makes the assertion that many children who have lost the allowance have somehow outgrown their disability. This may be the case in some instances. Fair enough. But she ignores the many families who through hard work and medical advice learn to better manage disabilities. Some examples that come to mind are chronic asthma, diabetes, ADD and ADHD—to name but a few. The fact is that conditions such as these involve considerable time and costs. Many are only under control because of the expensive treatment that the carer allowance assists with. 
Take the case of the family mentioned today who have three girls diagnosed with ADD. Two of the prescribed drugs are not on the PBS list and are not subsidised, leaving that family to foot a medicine bill of up to $135 per month per child. The carer allowance did help with this cost until it was stripped away under the current review. I make the point again that families like this have no relief from the announcement made yesterday.
Another point I would like to address is the minister's assertion that somehow one-third of the people who have lost the payment thus far have voluntarily opted out. After talking to many families, our concern is that many are intimidated by the 30 pages of forms that they believe are designed to ensure that they do not requalify. The minister says there will be another review of the assessment which will look at how multiple conditions are considered. The minister has this the wrong way around—the minister should be certain of the assessment process and ensure it works appropriately before it is applied to families. 
No review should proceed until the child disability assessment tool and the forms are redesigned to properly account for the time and cost of care as well as to reflect basic community standards. However, we do not expect the minister to listen. Senator Vanstone has demonstrated time and time again that she cannot handle the sensitive issues of this portfolio. Indeed there can be only two reasons for this mess: firstly, the whole process is deliberate and hence the minister is heartless or, alternatively, the process is driven by incompetence and hence the minister is—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Social Welfare: Carer Allowance</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-08-13,"—I stand to refute these allegations. They are unsubstantiated. In fact, they are scurrilous, unparliamentary personal accusations. Senator Bishop is playing the woman, as it were, and not the ball. I would far prefer the focus to be on the policy and the process rather than the people involved. Using people in this way is an inappropriate approach. Senator Vanstone made that point quite clear when she said that people are being used as pawns in the political point scoring that is being attempted by the opposition. 
Let us put the facts on the table. Five years ago the carer allowance was introduced by the Howard government. It is a very good allowance and it provides $87 a fortnight. So my first point is to acknowledge that it is a good policy initiative. It is paid to a carer in recognition of the workload and the impact on them in caring for someone with a disability or a severe medical condition. The carer allowance is not paid in recognition of any particular disability. It is paid to the care provider, not to the person being cared for.
Two weeks ago I spoke to the Carers Association in Scottsdale. I acknowledged the work that they do, and they appreciated my involvement in talking with them. We talked about the importance of the carer allowance to them, their families and those who need care. On 1 July 1999, there were 152,000 recipients of the carer allowance and, in July 2003, there are 298,000—nearly 300,000, nearly double the number. So it has been taken up. It is a successful policy initiative of the Howard government. Spending has increased from $400-odd million in 1999-2000 to $740-odd million in 2002-03. Those points should be acknowledged.
Yesterday's announcement made it quite clear—Senator Bishop is confusing the record—that six disabilities have been added to the recognised list of disabilities. It is clear that they have been given automatic access to the carer allowance. A review will take place, and I encourage those who have concerns, or a contribution to make, to make an input into that review. It is expected that it will be finished by Christmas. About a month ago, I made it clear in statements to the public in Tasmania that my office and I are happy to assist those who need help in completing the forms and the paperwork. It is appropriate to have a review—it is taxpayer funds. Senator Bishop said during his presentation today that some people have `outgrown their disability'. Fair enough. Indeed it is important to note that. Things change and they have changed in the last five years.
He used the example of diabetes. I know about that situation quite well because I have type 1 diabetes and I know that, particularly for young people with type 1 diabetes, the high level of care that is required changes over time as the person with diabetes learns to understand their disease and how to look after themselves in terms of diabetes management. So things change, and that is the point that Senator Bishop acknowledged in his speech, but he said very little about it. I would like to emphasise that point and say that is why we are having a review. I want to put that on the record. 
There are quite a few things we could say in terms of the things that change acute asthma early in life. It is debilitating and frightening. My elder brother had asthma and does have asthma, but as you get older and understand things differently you can manage your condition differently. These are the things that the opposition simply are not acknowledging. But the carer allowance is important, and this is something that we will stand to protect, endorse and support in the months and years ahead.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Social Welfare: Carer Allowance</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-08-13,"—I agree with Senator Barnett that of course the carer allowance is an incredibly important payment to families with disabilities.  
—Why didn't you introduce it? 
—Can I add further to his comments that it is very important, unlike Senator Knowles's interjections, to deal with the issue of policy and not the person. The critical issue on this matter is that we are dealing with two distinct matters. One is the altered recognised disabilities list and the other is the tough new child disability assessment tool. 
Unfortunately, Minister Vanstone copped some of what she asks for when she tries stunts like she did yesterday. Yesterday, after I had raised the case of one particular constituent, Ms Linda Watson, she came back into the chamber the next day, read into my question an implication that did not exist and then tried a very clumsy sidestep to avoid the issue, which is that the Prime Minister gave a commitment that people would not be affected by these reviews until the review had been conducted. Senator Vanstone tried to say that people would be reinstated on the basis of the new recognised disabilities list, but she completely sidestepped the issue of people who have already been ruled off payments by this tough and brutal assessment tool. Senator Vanstone will not answer this question: when will Ms Watson be reinstated onto her payments, consistent with the commitment given by the Prime Minister to Alan Jones that people would not be harmed whilst the government looked at this tool? She tries to sidestep and say, `Oh no, 97 per cent of people will not be taken off the recognised disabilities list and anyone who has been will be reinstated,' but that is moving away from the point. There are people who, listening to Alan Jones, would quite reasonably have felt assured that they would be reinstated onto their payments because the government recognised that the new child disability assessment tool was too tough and too brutal and the government was now reviewing it. But, no, the minister steps away from that point. So you wonder why people attack the person rather than the policy when the minister tries these stunts. 
Senator Vanstone will not address the issue of the 30,000 figure in the PBS. She will not address the issue of whether people who have already been cut off payments before the review was put on hold will be reinstated. I know, for instance, that since I raised Linda Watson's case on Monday, when the minister said she would look into it, Ms Watson has not been contacted any further. She has not been asked, `When you filled out the form, was that just some naive self-nomination and it has now been interpreted that you are no longer eligible?' No. Did anyone from Centrelink or anyone from the department talk to this woman and ask, `Why weren't you satisfied with the assessment tool process?' No. Did they give her any assurance that she would be back on payments? No. Is it any wonder that Alan Jones and the editor of the Herald Sun describe the minister as the forbidding face of the family services ministry? It is no surprise, because she stands here and tries to justify completely arbitrary cut-offs. Some people are saved because the review has been put on hold. But if your case just happened to be reviewed the day before the Prime Minister made the commitment, bad luck. Is it any wonder that Senator Vanstone is regarded as brutal and misguided when she maintains those sorts of arbitrary lines in relation to families with disabilities? The commentators on this issue are quite right: families with disabilities have enough to cope with without some brutal, tough tool involving some 30 pages of forms and some assessment that we are looking for any way to cut some people off benefits to save money in the budget.  
Minister Vanstone has been used by the government in the past to carry out these sorts of tasks. If I recall, she was demoted from cabinet after she had one particularly difficult task to do for the Howard government. Well, it looks like she has been lined up for it yet again here. Now she is picking on people receiving the carer allowance.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-08-13,"—It is just amazing to think that we can get a diatribe like that dished out by Senator Collins somehow presented to the Senate as fact. It is interesting that the carer allowance was introduced five years ago. Anyone's basic mathematics skills would tell them that the carer allowance was introduced by this Howard government. Senator Collins is stalking out now; she is not interested in the facts. Thirteen years of Labor government did not see the introduction of a carer allowance; but Senator Collins is not interested in that.
—Weren't there disabled people around in their 13 years?
—That is a very good question, Senator Eggleston. He asked, `Weren't there disabled people around in the 13 years of the Labor government?' Obviously, there were disabled people around in the 13 years of the Labor government, but at no stage did they introduce a carer allowance. So I find it a bit rich for them to come in here now abusing and accusing a government that has not only introduced a carer allowance but also since its introduction more than doubled the money paid to recipients.
In 1999, there were 152,000 recipients of the carer allowance. In 2003, there are 298,000 recipients of the carer allowance. Let us get the facts straight. The Labor opposition, when in government, did nothing. This government introduced it and has in the last five years doubled the number of people receiving it. Yet this opposition can only go out there and create a fear campaign amongst those people who least need it, in the same way that it creates fear about rising doctors fees, lack of access to doctors and all of this other nonsense. Is there a policy position that the Labor Party can contribute on this very subject? The answer is no. There is not one single, solitary policy that the Labor Party currently has or has had in the last 7½ years on the issue of the carer allowance. What would it do? Yesterday in response to the first question on the carer allowance asked of Minister Vanstone in question time, she said, `I made an announcement today,' and there was jeering across there from that useless opposition in expectation that she had taken people off the list. When she announced that in fact six more disabilities had been added to the list, there was stunned silence.
—There was stunned silence. They just could not believe it.
—That is right. They could not believe it because that is not what they wanted to hear, because that did not comply with what they had done and are doing to the most vulnerable people in our society. I wonder how many people over on that side of this chamber actually deal on a day-to-day basis with people with severe disabilities. I can tell you I do. I deal with one family in which there are very severe disabilities. In that family, three out of four children are autistic. If anyone understands the plight of the autistic children and the families that have to care for them, I can tell you that I now do—thanks to that family and many of the other families who have subsequently contacted me.
Autism and the carers of children with autism are included as part of the government's initiative, but they were totally and utterly neglected under the Labor government of 13 years. I think they should stand with their heads held in shame at the fact that they ignored for so long all those categories of people with disabilities. To think that they are now going out there and wilfully frightening people by saying that they will have their allowance removed is nothing short of disgraceful and contemptible. These are constituents for whom they should have far greater care and compassion. They are a very special group of people, and they are being treated abysmally by a Labor opposition.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-08-13,"—Minister Vanstone today in her answers, as she has done on previous days in the Senate, was both very fast and very slow. But the confusion remains as to exactly what is happening with this review or, indeed, as we have found out, with these reviews. The fear, the concern and the confusion felt by the families about which Senator Knowles has just spoken very effectively has not been caused by members of the opposition. The confusion and the concern has been caused by the review process that is being implemented by the government of the day.
As a result of an ongoing process, 70,000 families across the country have received notices that their payments are being reviewed. Attached to those notices are the quite complex forms we work through when we are working through the bureaucracy. As a result of this review process—the initial review, the review of the 70,000 families— people have had to confront these forms. In their daily lives they are coping with people and family members with severe disabilities. We are not talking about people who have mild disabilities. We are talking about families, as Senator Knowles mentioned, with whom all of us deal. We deal with them because we care and because these families are very effective members of our community. They come to us and tell us that they are confused and concerned because the justification for their receiving the payment they have been receiving quite rightly for the last few years is being reviewed.
It seems to be beyond the understanding of the government that that review is causing fear. That is symptomatic of the process, and that is something that all members of this Senate should be considering. The fact that people receive letters from the department actually causes fear. That is a point we should be considering, but that has been overlooked in the debate so far. We get into the debate about who said what and when, but we overlook the fact that the interaction between members of the community and the department that is providing payment to them is not causing support, is not causing a desire to communicate but is actually causing fear. I think that is the core issue in this debate.
We have also found out that the minister, as she said today, makes public statements— and I agree we should all be waiting to hear them—not in this house but outside. We do accept the invitation—and I hope it will come—to attend her media conferences. We found out that members of the Prime Minister's office attend them, but somehow we do not get invited. We will read the media comments to find out what is going to happen to the policy today. This is exactly the cause of some of the confusion. The initial questions asked by the opposition are asked on behalf of their constituents. This issue is not something we plucked from the air. We did not think, `Today I'm going to ask a couple of questions about the review of the carers payment.' The reason we are asking these questions is that members of the community have come to us and expressed their concerns. 
So we asked the questions. Then, in the middle of the process of responding to the questions about the initial review of the carer allowance, there was a public announcement. There was not so much a stunned silence yesterday when the announcement was made in this house after the media announcement as people asking, `How does this work? What is going to happen now?' When we found out that six conditions about which we had been speaking have now been reinserted into the allowable conditions list—in the middle of the process of reviewing people who are receiving payment—this caused a degree of concern and confusion for all of us.
We recognise—and we are very pleased to see—that the department and the minister have accepted that these conditions can now be included. Of course, they will be reviewed down the track. What we are trying to find out—as indeed the people who are living with these conditions are trying to find out— is exactly how the department is going to continue to communicate with people, and how we can have some security, some clarity and some recognition of the real issues of this debate, which should be about the extra costs, the extra responsibilities and the genuine care and concern that families have for their members who have a significant medical condition. When we can reach clarity on that issue, maybe we will be able to look at the other parts of the debate.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-08-13,"—I also wish to take note of various answers today by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, in particular the answer to the question I directed to her about pensioner education supplements going to students with disabilities. We now know pensioner education supplements have been axed, or will be axed shortly, but only for holiday periods—that is, for non-teaching periods—for students with disabilities. In her answer today, Minister Vanstone said in part that the reasoning behind that is that the supplement, the financial assistance, is just that—it is assistance for students for their education and is thus quarantined to the education period only. 
Where the minister is so wrong in both policy and process is that this ignores the fact that many students with disabilities have requirements outside of teaching hours and during the holiday period. This can act against them and ought to necessitate the assistance, rather than prohibit it. We know, for example, that many students with disabilities stay much longer than do other students in terms of their education, and are often back sooner as they have to do more preparatory work. It may even be the case that they need to organise texts in alternative formats or simply acquaint themselves with the campuses and the lecturers.
We also know that people with disabilities who are on a pension are living on very humble budgets and, overwhelmingly, they tend to budget for the entire year and work very hard to live within that as best they can. Yet the rug has been pulled out from under them in terms of this strange system where the particular assistance being directed to them is now going to be removed. That, for example, is radically different from Austudy, which is in itself an education assistance supplement which is paid throughout the whole of the year and not simply quarantined to when a campus may be teaching during a semester. To extend the analogy, should we now remove Senator Vanstone's senatorial salary on the basis that she should only be permitted to accept her ministerial salary because when the Senate is not sitting somehow she is not required or mandated to receive a senatorial payment as well? The argument is a nonsense. But the end result is that some 12,500 students with disabilities will have their pensioner education supplements cut during the summer break, forcing many, I believe, into giving up their studies altogether and therefore going back to living solely on disability pensions. 
The extra difficulty is that many people in that situation will be unable, in many cases, to take up part-time or casual work to supplement their payment. The pensioner education supplement should be consistent throughout the year and not turned off and on like a tap. Outcome 3 of the minister's portfolio is entitled `Individuals Reach their Potential'. That is its specific name, yet one of the miserly savings measures in this year's budget, found at page 140 of the portfolio budget statements, saves around $7½ million a year through matching payments just to study periods. This means that, during summer breaks, pensioners are not eligible for the extra $62.40 per fortnight.
It is important to point out though that the department itself does quite all right from this. It takes back around $2½ million to implement the measure. I find it an extraordinary situation to take back $2½ million to implement a measure that takes away $7 million in total from pensioners trying to do something to better their lives. To swallow so much of that up in the bureaucracy of administering it is quite ridiculous. 
We also know from the minister's recent answers to questions I have placed on notice, in which I asked the minister whether she agrees that there are extra difficulties and costs associated with people with disabilities studying—and I refer to her answer to my question on notice No. 1552—the minister has acknowledged that there are a range of areas—and she qualified her answer by saying that it depends on the type of disability— in which there are additional difficulties and burdens and the need for resources for students with disabilities. That is on the record from the minister. Yet contradicting that in her answer today is this extraordinary argument that somehow the particular education supplement should be quarantined to only teaching weeks and denied to these people in non-teaching weeks and, in fact, on the basis of ignoring particular difficulties.

Senator Jeannie Ferris 
Whip/Selection of Bills Committee Member",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,7,2
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-08-13,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
“The Senate's need to assert:
(a)	the continuing confidence in the ABC complaints handling process, noting that it is more comprehensive than any process in place for any other media organisation, and
(b)	the requirement for the Minister for Communications to apologise to the members of the ABC Independent Complaints Panel for questioning their independence and integrity.”
This is a very important motion, and I move it on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Over the last seven weeks—probably even over the last seven years, depending on how you count it—we have seen an increasingly shrill war of words between the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the public broadcaster, the ABC. I am not quite sure why it has become so shrill. I did notice some speculation in the media this morning that the minister for communications missed out on an overseas trip, so I suspect he may have been a little down in the mouth over the winter break. The comments that came from the minister on whether the ABC is independent, whether it has an independent complaints handling process and the general continuing attacks on its coverage should not go without public comment in this place. The minister has been trying to put out the impression to the public that the ABC does not have in place a complaints handling process. On 25 July he said:
So any means that would give public confidence and provide credibility to an outcome, I think, is in everyone's interests, including the ABC.
He said that in the wake of recent decisions they are examining other ways of ensuring a proper, independent, arms-length assessment of claims. He went on to say:
The purpose of the exercise is to ensure that all the parties concerned are confident about the outcome being independently analysed and that the public itself, which obviously is the ultimate beneficiary, it pays, all taxpayers fund the ABC, all public itself has a vested interest in being confident that the outcome is credible.
That is his syntax, not mine. He said that same day:
The Independent Complaints Review Panel is one appointed wholly by the ABC Board ... That is not entirely arm's length; that is a creature of the ABC itself.
On the issue of Russell Balding referring the matter to the independent complaints tribunal, the minister said: 
What he's now done, without consulting me, is to refer these matters to his board-appointed complaints panel. Now, he's done that because he's concerned about this appearance of objectivity and that's precisely my point, that if you think that after seven or eight weeks you can have an internal full-time employee of the ABC passing judgement on complaints and expect the public to say `well, that's fair and reasonable, that looks like an arm's length process, I'm sure the guy was utterly impartial', then I don't think that's the real world.
There are dozens of comments that I could point to where he highlights quite clearly that he has no confidence in the complaints process of the ABC and no confidence in the independent complaints panel. There are quite a number of comments that I will point to.
I would also like to look at exactly who is on the complaints panel, which is the third stage of the ABC's complaints process. The complaints panel consists of: Mr Ted Thomas, the convenor, who is a former general manager of Channel 7; Ms Margaret Jones, the deputy convenor, who is a journalist, author and member of the Australian Press Council; Professor Michael Chesterman, former dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales; Mr Stepan Kerkyasharian, New South Wales ethnic affairs commissioner, formerly of SBS radio; and Mr Bob Johnson, formerly of Channel 7 news and current affairs. The particular panel are now looking at Senator Alston's complaints, but they are doing so in an environment where he has made it quite clear that he does not have confidence in their independence. No matter what the outcome, he will criticise it because they are `creatures of the board'.
This attack on these individuals is extraordinary. In my view, they are clearly a group of eminent people who are quite capable of making judgments about whether Senator Alston's complaints have any merit or not. It is extraordinary to look at some of the commentary from other people as to whether Senator Alston's attacks on the independence of this panel are justified. The Australian Press Council made an extraordinary statement on 9 August 2003:
The Australian Press Council views with concern any moves by the federal Minister for Communications to establish a new government-appointed body to deal with complaints about the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
	...	...	...
In the Council's view, the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal supervening the established complaints systems is both unnecessary and may cause the public to believe that the government wants to interfere in the editorial processes of media organizations and, thus, limit the public's right to receive information of interest and concern to it.
Errol Simper wrote in the Australian on 31 July 2003:
This both demonstrated publicly that the national broadcaster had such a body and seemed to imply any additional, government-imposed arbitration was superfluous.
Mr Simper went on to say that the line-up is clearly `reasonably independent'. Probably the most dramatic support for the ABC came from Mark Day, from News Corporation, who said about this panel:
Nobody from the ABC sits on it, everybody is there because they have some knowledge of journalistic ethics or practice or media operations or complaints handling processes and that kind of thing. And nobody on the board has ever worked, to my knowledge, at the ABC—people like Ted Thomas ... These are people who have been around in the industry a bit and are utterly independent of the ABC. That complaints panel is in place now. What's he going on about, needing another complaints review thing?
It is quite clear when you go through these comments that senior people like Mark Day, Errol Simper, Robert Mann and the Australian Press Council itself are making it quite clear that the minister is on very shaky ground when he refers to the review panel as being anything other than independent. In fact, looking at the comments from Mark Day, it is quite clear that the ABC has probably the most rigorous and independent complaints handling process of any media organisation in the world and certainly of any media organisation in Australia. It is worth noting that, of the few complaints that have passed through the process to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABC actually has a success rate of four dismissed complaints and two upheld in the last three years. Compare that with the Channel 9 rate of 20 findings that it has breached the code of practice. 
It is certainly a matter of concern that this minister continues to attack the complaints panel and the complaints process of the ABC and draws into question the integrity and independence of the panel members. I believe the Senate should support this motion on the basis that we need to send a clear message that we stand by the fact that the ABC has an independent complaints panel. It is working, it is effective and the minister should abide by it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Matters of Urgency,10,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-08-13,"—One wonders where Senator Cherry has been in terms of really paying attention to the complaints process of the ABC. If he believes that the two points he has made in this urgency motion are true, he really has no idea about the complaints process of the ABC or the fact that it is anything but independent. In requiring in part (b) that the minister should apologise to the members of the ABC Independent Complaints Review Panel for questioning their independence and integrity, I can only say that he is wide of the mark. Senator Alston's comments were more than justified by (a) the method of appointment of the members of that panel and (b) their lack of diligence in finding the complaints to be upheld. In particular, their views about complaints lodged about the ABC's coverage of the war in Iraq showed nothing but a total lack of independence in their assessment of the bias that the ABC AM program in particular demonstrated in reporting that war.
It is almost universally acknowledged that the ABC is an important Australian cultural institution, justifying the significant amounts of public funding that it receives annually. Indeed, in its last budget the government maintained the ABC's triennial funding in real terms, allocating $760 million over the current financial year and in excess of $2.2 billion over the next three years. I remind Senator Cherry that public funding demands accountability. In return for such public largesse, the ABC has a responsibility to be fully accountable not just to the parliament but to the people of Australia. Having a transparent, arms-length complaints handling process is crucial to ensuring that the ABC is accountable both to the parliament and to the people, and that is what Senator Alston wants set up.
One cannot in any way claim that the current process is independent and able to make objective judgments. Let us just have a look at what the ABC complaints process involves. There is the Independent Complaints Review Panel, and they have now set up a complaints review executive. The decisions of both of those bodies can be appealed to the ABA if necessary, but the ABC does have the right to intervene and turn off such an appeal. Let us have a look at the Independent Complaints Review Panel. First of all, it was created by and is a creature of the ABC. All members of the panel are appointed by the ABC. The Independent Complaints Review Panel rules and procedures are set by the ABC. Reports can be edited by ABC management and the ABC management decides what action should be taken as a result of reports made by the panel. Furthermore, people who complain to the panel do not have the right of legal representation and, as I said, the ABC management itself has the right to edit reports and decide what action will be taken. So it is a pretty internalised process. 
—You're joking!
—I am serious, Senator Campbell. It is like a boys' club setting up a little body to review its activity and—surprise, surprise—it very rarely finds a complaint against the ABC justified.
—One per cent.
—One per cent? Let's look at the numbers, shall we? Over the last three months, 1,457 complaints have been made to the ABC Independent Complaints Review Panel. Of those complaints, 47 have been upheld, or just 3.4 per cent— hardly a great record of independent judgment and assessment of complaints against the ABC. Since it is appointed by the ABC, this complaints panel does not have any basis to independently judge the ABC. That is the point Senator Alston is making. We should have a complaints review panel which is truly independent of the ABC and which can independently review complaints made about the ABC.
Let us go back to the war in Iraq. After the biased presentations made, particularly on the ABC AM program by Linda Mottram, whose introductions were consistently sarcastic, cynical and characterised by a serious anti-American bias, the minister for communications made a complaint in which he detailed some 68 different incidents in which the ABC showed bias in reporting what had happened in Iraq. Those complaints were considered by the ABC Independent Complaints Review Panel executive, headed by a gentleman called Mr Murray Green. One might wonder whether Mr Murray Green was really an independent assessor. It is interesting to find that Mr Murray Green had been with the ABC since 1988. He was a senior manager during most of those 15 years. Again, one has to ask whether he was capable of forming an independent judgment on programs provided by the ABC.
—He was probably in the same union as Linda Mottram.
—He probably was, when you think about it; they were probably old mates. It is no surprise at all that, of the 68 complaints which Richard Alston lodged, Murray Green upheld only two. It is interesting to see what other journalists thought about the complaints which Richard Alston lodged. Gerald Stone, who, as we all know, is an SBS board member, a former executive producer of 60 Minutes and a former editor of the Bulletin, said of Richard Alston's dossier—the 68 complaints about bias in reporting the war in Iraq:
... As a former senior producer and editor, I must say I didn't find Alston's dossier of 68 alleged offences as far-fetched as some of my colleagues.
I noted at least 20 incidents where, as an ABC news executive, I would have called AM staff members to task for making smug and gratuitous comments blatant enough to bring the program's impartiality into question.
Gerald Stone is one of Australia's most respected and most senior journalists. He, as a genuinely independent observer, made those comments about Linda Mottram's introductions on AM and about the complaints which Richard Alston made. It is very hard to believe that Richard Alston's complaints were not justified, so let us have a look at the letter he wrote to Mr Ted Thomas, who, as Senator Cherry said, is the convener of the Independent Complaints Review Panel. Senator Alston made several points which I think Senator Cherry will find quite interesting. First of all, he pointed out in his letter of 1 August this year that the members of the ICRP may not currently be employees of the ABC but all have long records of having been senior ABC executives. The panel itself, as we said, is a creation of the ABC. Secondly, as Senator Alston said, the ABC chooses the panel members—hardly an independent factor there. The Broadcasting Act 1992 allows a complainant to seek appeal to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, but the ABC reserves the right to effectively pre-empt any decision to exercise that right. The ABC dictates the ICRP rules and procedures— (Time expired) ",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Matters of Urgency,10,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-08-13,"—Let me say at the outset that the opposition, the Labor Party, supports and commends the motion moved by Senator Cherry before the chair for discussion. In another parliament, the previous parliament, I had responsibility for communications in the Senate. That was a very interesting and useful time. From memory, when my office checked, we had written 18 or 19 minority or dissenting reports on a range of matters that were relevant at that time to the communications portfolio. One of the recurring matters under discussion and debate during that time—and it appears that we are revisiting it—was the worth of the ABC.
My strong recollection of that period of two or three years when I was handling the communications portfolio in the Senate was that the ABC was constantly under attack and review by the then and current communications minister, Senator Alston. There were constant debates because there were constant attacks on its funding, constant aspersions as to the ability of the officers of the ABC and the producers and the programmers to carry out their tasks and constant assertions—rarely, if ever, supported by any hard evidence—that the ABC was biased against the government and engaged in some ongoing cultural warfare. 
So it is back to the future when we consider the motion that is under discussion today moved by Senator Cherry. As I said, the opposition is pleased to support it. Senator Alston's war on the ABC has reached such breathtaking proportions that, over the winter break, the minister proposed that the ABC adopt an independent complaints panel, replicating one which already exists. For the benefit of Senator Alston, let me explain the ABC complaints system. Initial complaints are directed to the Complaints Review Executive, Mr Murray Green, who comprehensively blew apart Senator Alston's paranoid fantasy about the ABC bias. The Complaints Review Executive, I am informed, dismissed some 66 of the 68 complaints of bias that the minister levelled against the ABC. These were ridiculous complaints which could have come only from the most extremist paranoid mind, buried deep in the bunkers of the minister's office. 
However, if complainants are unhappy with this first step, as Senator Alston clearly was and is, they can appeal to the Independent Complaints Review Panel. This panel consists of five non-ABC staff appointed for their expertise in journalism and the media. The minister did not have the fortitude to go to this next level, so the ABC sent his ABC complaints upstairs of its own volition. This is the panel that the minister has been trying to pretend does not exist. He even hoodwinked his leader, the Prime Minister, who said in late July:
... the best way for the ABC to be seen to be dealing with complaints about bias would be to have a completely independent review process.
Of course, one already exists. It is in the act. The minister knows it and the department knows it. The minister, Senator Alston, must have received a real dressing-down from the Prime Minister when he discovered an independent complaints panel already exists, is functioning and is carrying on its duties. I am sure that Donald McDonald would have been on the phone that night pointing out to his friend the Prime Minister that Senator Alston had ill-advised him on this issue. We can also point out to the minister that complainants can also go to the Australian Broadcasting Authority if they are unhappy about the ABC's handling of their complaint. So they have another avenue of appeal to make complaints in the supposedly biased, retrograde, non-independent ABC complaints process. 
In August last year the minister, Senator Alston, was reported as being pleased with the ABC's independent complaints review system. So I ask the question: why is he unhappy now and why has he been unhappy for the best part of six months on this issue? Is it because he is embarrassed that his bizarre ABC dossier will get blown out of the water at every stage of the appeals mechanism? Is it because the minister is searching for new angles in his longstanding and ongoing war against the ABC? Was the minister trying to deflect criticism towards the government over the ABC being forced to cut popular programs like Behind the News because of ongoing government cutbacks? 
Why does the minister feel that each of the existing members of the ABC Independent Complaints Review Panel—and we should list them: Mr Ted Thomas, a former general manager of Channel 7; Ms Margaret Jones of the Australian Press Council; Professor Michael Chesterman, Dean of Law at the University of New South Wales; Stephen Kerkyasharian, the New South Wales Ethnic Affairs Commissioner; and Mr Bob Johnston, formerly of Channel 7 news and current affairs—is not sufficiently independent of the ABC? Maybe the minister has information not available to the opposition. Maybe he is correct, maybe he is completely justified. I am sure that if he is he will lay out that information in the discussion later on this afternoon.
—He's here, but he's not speaking!
—Isn't that shameful! Worse still, maybe some members of the panel may be inclined to give the minister's bizarre ABC bias dossier the shellacking that it so patently deserves. Why has the minister insisted that the ABC does not have an independent complaints panel when the ABC does have an Independent Complaints Review Panel, established by the department under the act, funded by the ABC? Just today we see another example of the ongoing attacks by the government—not by the minister. Senator Alston has, apparently, authorised his colleague in the lower house Mr Christopher Pyne to float the policy of advertising on the ABC. The agenda is the same as it was three or four years ago. It is clear: bully and starve the ABC into compliance and then, when that job is done, allow advertising and finish the job completely. Seventy years of bipartisan support for our independent, non-commercial national broadcaster, the ABC, has been thrown out of the window, and it is clear that the government intends to continue going down that particular path.
One thing is for sure: Senator Alston owes an apology to each and every one on the Independent Complaints Review Panel whom he has slurred as not being independent. He owes an apology to Ms Indira Naidoo and to Mr Max Uechtritz, to whom he still has not apologised after allowing his own colleagues loose at Senate estimates. He owes an apology to the AM program, which he has falsely accused of being anti-American. He owes an apology to rural and regional Australians in about 60 towns who will not be getting NewsRadio or Classic FM— 
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to ask Minister Alston, who is here, but as I understand not speaking—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—What is your point of order, Senator Mackay?
—In fact, the remaining government speakers are Senator Santoro and Senator McGauran. I would ask you to call the minister to order for repeated interjections.
— There is no point of order.
—On the point of order—
— There is no point of order, Senator Alston.
—I am here because my starting time for being on duty commenced at 4 p.m. I would not dream of interfering—
— I am sure that every member appreciates you being here, Senator Alston, but there is no point of order.
—As I was saying, Senator Alston owes a series of apologies. He owes an apology to the rural and regional Australians in around 60 towns who will not be getting NewsRadio or Classic FM as a result of the Howard government's rejection of the ABC's 2003 triennial funding bid. He owes an apology to the thousands of students, parents and teachers who are angry that the ABC has been forced to axe Behind the News after years of Howard government cutbacks. Labor commends Senator Cherry's motion, but it is worth while, in the last minute or two that I have available to me, to repeat so that everyone who is listening understands the background to this issue.
If complainants are unhappy with the first step, as Senator Alston clearly was, they can appeal to the Independent Complaints Review Panel. That panel consists of five non-ABC staff appointed for their expertise in journalism and media. So this independent complaints review tribunal, which was alleged not to exist, apparently does exist and has five very senior persons who come from backgrounds in media, commercial TV, journalism and non-government organisations. They receive only sitting fees for their duties and they are committed to public and community broadcasting. That independent complaints tribunal exists and has existed for many years. Senator Alston knows that it exists because in recent months, before this current mess was created by him, he was publicly commending the independent complaints review tribunal for the worth of their work, for carrying out their duties in a professional and unbiased manner.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-08-13,"—I would like to thank my Queensland Democrat colleague Senator Cherry for the opportunity to return so quickly to the issue of the ABC and the problems that it has in presenting news and current affairs. It really beggars belief that he can actually suggest that the Senate should assert continuing confidence in the ABC's complaints handling process given what occurred earlier this year over the Iraq crisis and subsequent war—all the more so when the problems that those circumstances revealed were worsened by the ABC management having a hissy fit when the government was unable to meet the full whack of the corporation's ambit funding claim. It is absolutely incredible that Senator Cherry should seek to require the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to apologise to the members of the ABC independent complaints panel. So it is with pleasure that I come back to this chamber to have two bites of the cherry on the issue of the ABC. 
There has been an extraordinary sequence of events following the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee budget estimates hearing on 26 May when the ABC gave its annual accounting to the parliament. Let me say this: it is vital that some balance be kept in this debate. It is deeply regrettable that it is in danger of becoming unbalanced because of the action of people rushing to the defence of the corporation without thinking through the real issues that lie behind the walls of self-serving rhetoric around the ABC and its defenders. Let me say this too: the ABC is a valuable public asset which, in the main, serves the Australian listening, viewing and online audience well, particularly in regional and remote areas where alternatives are hard to find. Let me further add that I genuinely believe that the majority of ABC journalists, broadcasters and other staff are decent, fair-minded Australians who do their best, and they often achieve it. That is to the ABC's credit.
But the ABC cannot be above public scrutiny on any aspect of its business. In that context it is inevitable that from time to time issues will arise on which the minister— whoever that is at the time—and the ABC will take contrary positions. The ABC exists on public money, and existing on public money requires those who receive it for public purposes to give a full account of what they have done with it. It is absolutely clear from the responses of ABC management to the budget outcome that the management believes that special pleading on its part is not something with which anyone could possibly argue. Apparently, this is particularly the case where the government is concerned.
It would appear that for the ABC—an organisation that in the media stands as a scrutineer of public spending—the matter of its funding cannot be a matter for debate. But it is a matter of priorities, of course. It is not clear at all that the ABC audience—that is, the total audience, not just the vocal part of it that in many cases is itself a willing participant in the sort of circus we have seen over the past few months—thinks that ABC priorities are necessarily correct or, more particularly, that its complaints process is valid. As other speakers have said before me, when 96.6 per cent of complaints received between 1 January and 31 March this year were found to be `baseless', even the most idle of eyebrows should have difficulty remaining unraised.
Within broad guidelines, what the ABC's priorities are is properly a matter for ABC management and the board. Both are independent of government, in the sense that government does not and should not dictate the daily dealings of the corporation or the detail of its spending. There is nothing that this government has said or done that injures that central principle, and nothing that anybody opposite says can convince this place in totality—or any individual in it—of that. But the thrust of the ABC's so-called case for special consideration in funding terms was made abundantly clear on 26 May at the estimates hearing. It was revealed by the comedy sequence in which Senator Conroy opened proceedings for the Labor Party with a dorothy dixer about the ABC's alleged financial plight and managing director Russell Balding's reading of his prepared reply. That says it all.
I want to address very specifically the issues that have been raised by Senator Mark Bishop and others in relation to the Independent Complaints Review Panel. Senator Cherry, Senator Bishop and the ABC claimed that the ICRP is a fully independent complaints appeal body. However, the fact is that the ICRP was created by the ABC, and all the members of the ICRP are appointed by the ABC board. In addition, the ABC's own editorial policies make it clear that the ICRP rules and procedures are set by the ABC. Its reports can be edited by the ABC for legal reasons, and the ABC managing director alone decides what action comes out of its reports. That is fact; it cannot be denied. The claim that Senator Alston has questioned the independence of members of the ICRP is false. He has merely criticised the fact that the ICRP is a creation of the ABC, that its members are appointed by the ABC and that the ABC sets its rules and decides what happens with its reports. The minister has sent a letter to the convener of the ICRP which makes clear that he has not impugned the independence of ICRP members. That, again, is a fact that senators opposite seek to ignore. 
But what is of greater concern is the revelation in last week's Bulletin by highly respected journalist Fred Brenchley that earlier this year the ABC tried to nobble the ICRP. The hypocrisy of it all! Despite the ABC claiming that the ICRP is fully independent, Mr Brenchley revealed that the ABC sought to have the ICRP deal with ABC staff only through the audience and consumer affairs section—which, by the way, is the very section that usually handles the initial complaint and hence is being appealed against. It was also revealed that the ABC wanted to have the opportunity to edit drafts of ICRP reports. Now if honourable senators want to dispute that, dispute it with Mr Brenchley, but he, just like the government, will give you short shrift when you make statements the way that you have.
In this additional opportunity for debate on the matter of very high public importance, I want to return to the capacity of the ABC to manage its budget and put out an objective news and current affairs service. It is something that I touched upon in an earlier speech this afternoon—that is, the issue of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington: the one that hosts the home page of those who think that Cuba and North Korea are models for developing countries to follow. I recommend the web site particularly for the headline `Success Stories'. It carries a subtitle, `Stories from the front lines: Successful struggles against privatization'. This does not seem quite to match the desirable level of objectivity for an organisation that purports to be unbiased. It brings into question the capacity of the ABC to make an objective judgment on what might constitute fair comment to be broadcast on its services. It is not only on privatisation that the EPI takes a particular view—one from which Marx might easily once have squinted at the world with his anticapital myopia.
Among other things it cites these interesting issues for virtual visitors to contemplate in terms of its fixation with successful struggle against privatisation. It also has the heading `El Salvador: Nine-Month Health Strike to End'—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have to raise a point of order: this is not relevant to the motion that is being debated. I heard all this at lunchtime; I do not want to hear it again.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the same point of order: the mere fact that it might have been canvassed elsewhere cannot possibly affect the relevance of it to this motion. This motion may in fact be very close to what was discussed at lunchtime. As I follow Senator Santoro's impeccably logical argument, he is simply setting this up as a prelude to demonstrating that this particular outfit is of a stripe which could not, in any shape or form, be characterised as independent. So I wait, with bated breath, to hear how in fact it has been characterised in this country.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the same point of order: I am having great difficulty working out how it is relevant—bouncing around the web site of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington to get back to the independence of the complaints panel. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I have listened assiduously to the contribution that Senator Santoro has made this afternoon because his speech is interesting, and I do believe that what he has said is relevant. Even if some may say that that is only peripherally relevant, it is nonetheless relevant.
—Obviously I will not be able to conclude all of my remarks but the fact is, Senator Cherry, I have not said this in this place before. I have mentioned the web site but the material I am quoting now is new. What that material shows is that that web site favours the running of stories as success stories that are anti privatisation within developed countries. The ABC quotes that particular site—
— Senator Santoro, you may care to address your last 26 seconds to the chair.
—Through you, of course, Mr Acting Deputy President. The ABC clearly quotes that particular site as one that is relevant to the way that it reports the news. That, Senator Cherry, is something that you should be very cognisant of: that the ABC displays bias towards featuring sites and featuring certain news items that are indeed biased against what this government is about, including some issues of privatisation—sites and news stories with slants that favour its own biased viewpoint.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-08-13,"—Quite frankly, I think many of us here are becoming sick and tired of having to rise in this chamber to defend the ABC from what are unrelenting and unwarranted attacks by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, who is yet again—let me tell you—here and still not contributing to the debate, but interjecting and taking points of order. It seems that Minister Alston, the Prime Minister and other members of the Howard government are determined to destroy Australia's much loved and respected independent broadcaster and will take any opportunity that they can to undermine it.
They may want to be a bit careful about that. According to Newspoll over 13 million people watch ABC television at least once a week, more than 6.5 million people listen to the ABC radio at least once a week and in excess of one million people use ABC online monthly. Even more importantly, Newspoll showed that 80 per cent of respondents last year believed that the ABC was balanced and even-handed when reporting news and current affairs. I noticed in the press today 2UE, in fact, complaining and blaming Minister Alston for the decrease in its ratings and the increase in the ABC's ratings as a result of the publicity that Minister Alston is giving the ABC. So the minister also owes 2UE an apology, I suspect.
Now for a minister with responsibility for the ABC, Senator Alston has also shown an alarming lack of understanding of the organisation and its processes. Were Minister Alston or Senator Eggleston to be one of those one million Australians who visit the ABC web site at least once a month, there they would find a clear outline of the ABC's complaints-handling mechanism.
—Senator Eggleston says, `All appointed by the ABC board.' Well, who appoints the ABC board? The government appoints the ABC board. If the government does not like what the ABC board is doing, maybe it should sack the ABC board. I suspect what has happened is that a couple of people who are on the ABC board may have ratted on the government. I noticed interjections earlier by Senator McGauran with respect to one of them in particular. Yet the minister is not satisfied. It is hard to see his ongoing attacks on the ABC other than as a fit of pique because he was made to look silly, I believe, over the out-of-hand dismissal of his allegations of bias over the reporting of the war in Iraq. 
However, I think that the motivation behind these attacks unfortunately goes somewhat deeper than that. The ongoing attacks against the ABC are part of this government's attempt to silence all voices that do not conform to their narrow ideological world view. In fact, I suspect that the only independent mechanism the government would be happy with is the Federal Council of the Liberal Party—not the National Party, Senator McGauran, but the Federal Council of the Liberal Party.
In recent days we have heard of the government's deliberate attempt and until now secret decision, highlighted by Senator Lundy, to underfund the National Museum in an attempt to bleed this important institution to death. Why would the government do this? Because the Museum does not tell the story of Australia in the way the government would like it to be told.
Like those of many other senators and members, my office has been receiving many calls from constituents who are unhappy with the effects of this government's treatment of the ABC. These calls relate to the decision that has had to be made by the ABC to end the show Behind the News—a decision I hope there is some way of overturning but one that has had to be made because of the failure of this government to adequately fund the ABC. However, I am sure this is one decision of the ABC the minister will support, because shows such as Behind the News considerably add to the awareness of young Australians of news and current affairs by presenting events in a form readily accessible to young viewers. Schools have, for the last 30 years, used this program as part of their curricula to encourage critical thinking and analysis by students of local and world events. That is something this government does not want too much of, so I am sure there will be no complaints from the minister about the axing of this program at least.
Let me return to the ABC's complaints handling mechanism—the mechanism the government clearly feels is flawed because the ABC board basically appoints the independent panel. As with every other complaint handling process or grievance process in existence in shops, workplaces, government agencies, hospitals, airlines—you name it— if someone has a complaint against the ABC, the complaint should in the first instance be taken to the ABC. For example, if the minister does not like a meal he has in a restaurant he presumably does not rush off to an independent gourmet food review panel. I presume he would take his complaint to the restaurant itself. Having done so, if he remained unhappy, unless there was a health or safety issue at stake there would be little further the minister could do other than withdraw his custom. However, in the case of the ABC, if the complainant is not happy with the outcome of this process they may ask for the complaint to be referred to an independent body, as indicated by my colleagues previously: the Independent Complaints Review Panel. This is established by the ABC board, which is appointed by the government but is completely independent of the ABC. None of the members of the panel has any past or present association with the ABC as an employee, despite Senator Alston's previous statements with respect to this. 
One might think that review by an independent panel such as this would be the end of the line for a complaint but, in the case of a complaint against the ABC, it is not. Even after these two stages of review, if a complainant is still not satisfied they can take their complaint to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the ABA. There, in the words of Professor Flint—a real favourite of the government—the `highly competent investigating staff' will examine the complaint. I would be pretty careful if I were Professor Flint. Were those `highly competent investigating staff' to uphold the previous decisions which dismissed the minister's allegations, we might begin hearing attacks on the ABA in this chamber and thinly veiled threats to the ABA's funding, as we have to the ABC's funding. But, given that it is Professor Flint, I suspect they will be all right.
The minister seems to forget that there are many important things he should be doing in his portfolio. Even in the relatively narrow area of complaints handling, perhaps the minister would be better off turning his attention to how commercial broadcasters uphold broadcasting codes of practice and deal with complaints. According to the ABA annual reports one show, A Current Affair, had 10 code breaches upheld against it whilst in the same period the ABC had one for the whole organisation.
Beyond this narrow area of complaint mechanisms the minister—and I am sure Senator Lundy will touch on this—could turn his attention to, for example, the debacle that his handling of digital TV has become. We have had a datacasting auction that failed, two channels that ended up nowhere and high definition television also going nowhere. He has had to change the rules on that several times. He has also supported multichannelling but nothing has happened. He has gone to cabinet a couple of times and sought to get multichannelling for the commercial networks, and that has gone nowhere. To add insult to injury, in spite of repeated warnings about the effects of funding constraints, the minister has had to suffer the embarrassment of the ABC cancelling its digital multichannels. The digital roll-out, which was proceeding at a digital crawl, is now in reverse. It is time the minister got his eye back on the main game and stopped lashing out at the ABC to cover his embarrassment and policy failures.
Further to the remarks of my colleague Senator Mark Bishop, we read today in the Age of a further assault on the ABC. The Liberal chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Christopher Pyne, has had published today an opinion piece supporting advertising on the ABC. I cannot believe, and I know Senator Bishop does not believe, that Mr Pyne would not have cleared it with his very close colleague and the relevant minister, Senator Alston, before writing such a piece. There we have it: a de facto communications policy announcement from the Howard government—a policy to allow advertising, a policy which will destroy the ABC's editorial independence and ability to produce quality independent public broadcasting services and a policy which can only make eventual privatisation of the ABC inevitable. I certainly hope that the minister was not consulted by Mr Pyne and that this is some terrible error by his colleague. I understand that the minister has sought to address this, but we do not necessarily believe him fully.
Perhaps we could ask the minister to concentrate on his portfolio for long enough to categorically rule out this policy change. Once that is done, the minister may be able to start spending some time coming to grips with the ABC's complaints handling process. On this side of chamber we have the utmost confidence in the ABC's complaints handling process; it is the minister in whom we lack confidence. His questioning of the independence and integrity of the members of the Independent Complaints Review Panel is but the latest in a long line of vindictive attacks. It shows hubris and complacency. I absolutely agreed with Russell Balding, Managing Director of the ABC, when he said: 
The questioning of the integrity and credibility of this group of professionals has been nothing short of offensive.
The Minister owes the panel members an immediate apology. I support this motion absolutely.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title>,Matters of Urgency,10,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-08-13,"—The irony of the Democrats rushing to defend the ABC's existing complaints system is that they are drawing the ABC further into a political mire. It is absurd. We reject the call for the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to apologise to the ABC Independent Complaints Review Panel. If the minister overseeing the operations of the taxpayer funded Broadcasting Corporation feels that the existing complaints tribunal deserves scrutiny then, acting on behalf of the public, he has a right and a duty to act accordingly. That is what this is all about: accountability, which the ABC cannot be immune to.
The minister has properly tested the processes with his own complaint regarding the coverage by the AM radio program of the Iraqi war and found it to be questionable. As the Senate would be aware, the minister submitted a very hefty and articulate document to back his 68 claims of biased reporting. In the words of the managing director, Mr Balding, the complaint `would be treated like an ordinary complaint'. In other words, Richard Alston would be treated like any other citizen. Let us see what happens to him; let us see how Richard Citizen is treated, keeping in mind that few other citizens could compile such a convincing and detailed case as he did. On 28 May the complaint went to the ABC, and it was not acknowledged until 21 July. As one wit put it, the ABC took longer to respond to the minister's complaint than the war to topple Saddam Hussein's regime. It is fair to say that if it took so long for the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to get an answer, it would have taken even longer for Joe Citizen to get an answer.
The 68 complaints against the AM program were reviewed by the complaints review executive, Mr Murray Green, as has been said by previous speakers. If the ABC want to present a fair and balanced and accurate complaints department that the public can have confidence in, they should take heed of the old saying that you must not only be independent but be seen to be independent. It is doubtful that the public would see Mr Murray Green as an independent arbitrator. Look at his background. He joined the ABC in 1988 as a manager of ABC Radio GWF in Perth. In 1992 he moved to Melbourne as manager of ABC Radio Victoria. In 1997 he was promoted to the position of ABC state manager of Victoria and in 2000 he was further advanced to the position of ABC state director of Victoria. Mr Murray Green has excellent ABC credentials.
I have read both the minister's complaints and the conclusions by the complaints review executive, Mr Murray Green. On any fair and commonsense analysis, I cannot concur with Mr Green's conclusions. In fact, I would say that it would be easier to get a free kick against Collingwood with Eddie McGuire umpiring—and that is all we are asking for in this case: a fair and independent umpire. Frankly, everyone who heard AM's coverage of the Iraqi war was stunned by its biased reporting. It came through the reporter's tone of voice, inflection and expression and was always laced with anti-Americanism in its introductions. As the minister pointed out, the reports were dripping with sarcasm and full of sneers, and they were just plain bad journalism. This style of reporting flowed over to the welcome home parade for our troops in Sydney on 18 June. My office received numerous, angry complaints about the continuing sneer style reporting of the ABC against Australia's involvement in Iraq. As an example, just one case was the stand-up report by the journalist who said that the crowd that met the troops coming home was smaller than the crowd that protested against the war, which was a false assertion and an utterly inappropriate comment, to say the least. 
These stand-up journalists do not act freely. The thrust and flavour of their reports is influenced very much by the directors, by those off camera, and that is the core problem—the hierarchy. In the case of the ABC, it is Mr Max Uechtritz, director of news and current affairs. Regrettably, Mr Uechtritz is in his own hot water. His ability to be balanced is also under question. When he attended the News World Asia conference in August 2002, he was quoted as saying:
We now know for certain that only three things in life are certain—death, taxes and the fact the military are lying bastards.
That is from the director of news and current affairs in the ABC, so we have every right to question him with regard to fair reporting of the ABC's coverage of Iraq. Is it any wonder then that the reporters which he has control over are out of control—or in control, as the case may be?
The ABC points to another appeals process, which many of the speakers have mentioned—that is, you may take the next step to the Independent Complaints Review Panel. As has been said, it is not independent at all. Every member is appointed by the ABC executives themselves. While Mr Ted Thomas vigorously defends his independ-ence as a reviewer, he is not seen to be independent. Members of the review board believe that, by titling themselves an independent review board, the assertion makes the truth. No matter how much Mr Ted Thomas defends his independence, as long as he is appointed by the ABC, he cannot be seen to be an independent umpire.
The concern by the public towards the ABC complaints process runs very deep. It is not just this high-profile case that the minister has put on the table; that simply typifies the public's concern. If you go the letters to the editor section of the Bulletin you will see a letter by Mr Ralph Zwier from Caulfield, Victoria, outlining another case, but time does not permit me to read his letter. He simply says that the ABC's reporting of many aspects of the troubles in the Middle East is also not balanced. So the minister's case is the vanguard for a whole list of public concerns against the ABC. We reject this absurd urgency motion by the Democrats and call upon the ABC to get its house in order.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—Over the past few years, but with increasing intensity over the past few months, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, has engaged in an attack on the ABC in an attempt to convert it from being an unbiased institution into a Liberal Party propaganda arm. A significant part of this attack involved making 68 spurious, highly politically motivated complaints about alleged ABC bias. If the latest contribution from Senator McGauran can be taken as any example, they do not even know whether they are arguing that this is some sort of bias from the top or some sort of uncontrolled thing happening at the grassroots of the ABC. You would think the coalition could get a consistent argument about this issue, but clearly they cannot. 
When 66 of these complaints were rejected by an initial internal review which was independent of the programs concerned, Senator Alston decided to shift his attack to the complaints process. He rejected the ABC's internal inquiry and called for an independent review panel, despite the fact that the ABC already has an independent review panel. Talk about shifty manoeuvring to pursue the vindictive cultural war against the ABC!
For the record, the ABC has the most rigorous and comprehensive complaints handling processes of any media organisation in Australia, and external review is a key element of this process. For example, following the initial internal review, the Independent Complaints Review Panel is available. This panel is used if the complainant is not satisfied with the initial response made by the ABC in its internal review. I am sure the minister is well aware that this panel was specifically established by the ABC board to facilitate independent external review. The panel of processionals is made up of a number of people from a variety of backgrounds who have expertise in media and journalism—Mr Ted Thomas, Ms Margaret Jones, Professor Michael Chesterman, Mr Stepan Kerkasharian and Mr Bob Johnson. No member of the panel has any present or former association with the ABC.
I join my colleagues in calling for Senator Alston to apologise to these people, because he has cast aspersions on their integrity and upon their commitment to the institution of the ABC. It is worth noting also that any dissatisfied complainant may seek a further review through the Australian Broadcasting Authority. However, Senator Alston's attacks have not been because he was genuinely concerned with issues of bias. This has been part of a broader coalition strategy, a strategy designed to corrupt the independence and integrity of Aunty, just as the Howard government is attempting to do with other significant cultural institutions such as the National Museum of Australia.
The ABC front of this coalition cultural war is evidenced by these current and ongoing attacks that the ABC has had to endure, and there is a pattern. There is a pattern with the National Museum of Australia and there is a pattern with the ABC. Let us look at it. In the past few months Senator Alston has: called for the ABC to institute an independent complaints panel, despite the fact that one already exists; attacked the ABC for cutting costs, ludicrously in response to the government having starved it of adequate funding—for example, the loss of Fly Tales is an absolute disgrace and will remain as one of Senator Alston's legacies to this portfolio and its failed digital TV regime; sought to editorialise and direct the ABC as to which programs it should cut, in an unprecedented defiance of the ABC's charter of independence; and made unfounded attacks on the reputations of presenters such as Indira Naidoo and Max Uechtritz.
And one more: Mr Christopher Pyne's piece today in the newspaper is advocating advertising for the ABC. Well, well, well, the favoured son to replace Senator Alston upon his, I am sure, impending retirement from this place has spoken out. Make no mistake: if Senator Alston leaves this place, I am sure it will be Christopher Pyne who has the portfolio of communications. What we have seen today is in fact an insight into what a new minister for communications under the coalition government has in mind for the ABC. So think about that when you are thinking about what will come next from the coalition.
Support for this motion before us will demonstrate that the Senate does not support and rejects completely the coalition's war on the ABC, a war which is led continually by the shambling rhetoric provided by Senator Alston. I, too, am disappointed that he has been present throughout this debate but has chosen not to take the opportunity to apologise to all those concerned, particularly the ABC, or at least say a few words outside a point of order.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-08-13,"—In closing this debate, I want to make a few points. Firstly, in response to Senator McGauran's comment that all we want is an umpire, there are four of them in the ABC complaints process. There is the very first section, which is the consumer section; there is the complaints review executive, put in as a result of a recommendation by the Auditor-General and supported at the time by the minister; there is the complaints panel; and then there is the ABA. Mark Day described the ABC complaints process as `the best complaints procedure I've ever seen, certainly in Australia'. He went on to say:
No commercial media has anything that comes close to it.
That is really what we are talking about here. We are talking about the fact that the minister has attacked this process and the panel members as not being independent, implying that the ABC is somehow judging itself.
Senator McGauran also made the point that this was a case of Caesar judging Caesar, because the board appointed the panel. Who appointed the board? Your government did, Senator McGauran, and there is not a single left winger on it. You have a former Liberal MP, Donald McDonald, described as a true conservative—and a very nice man too, I might add; and Judith Sloan and Ron Brunton, both conservatives to the core. They appointed this board. Another thing I point out is the criticism of Murray Green. According to Errol Simper's column, of the last 35 determinations he has made, six of them went against his employer. So your argument that he is not going to make any findings against his own employer is simply not justified on the facts that exist.
You talk also about Max Uechtritz's comment about the military never telling the truth. You should have a look at this morning's Courier-Mail. News Limited defence reporter Ian McPhedran has complained about the fact that the Department of Defence spends $20 million trying to ensure that journalists do not find out what the Department of Defence is doing, complaining that journalists are not allowed to cover a humanitarian mission to the Solomon Islands. That is the sort of stuff that we are dealing with and that the ABC deals with every day in dealing with government. That is why it needs to be independent, that is why it needs to stand outside government and that is why it needs to ensure that, once the board is appointed, it is allowed to do its job.
I would like to conclude by seeking to table the press release put out by the Australian Press Council in response to Senator Alston's attacks on the ABC. The council said that it believed that the minister's actions raised `the possibility of further government restrictions on the ability of the media to freely report matters of public interest and concern'. The Australian Press Council is about as independent as you can get, because that is the newspaper proprietors—not an ABC employee there either. When it says that this process that the minister is proposing is shonky and when it says that the process works, then surely this Senate should accept that. I seek to table that press release, because it is important to have in the public record that what this minister is proposing is an inappropriate intervention in press freedom. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate earlier today, Labor has a series of amendments to move in relation to the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, the Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002, and the Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002. Our support of these bills will be contingent upon Labor's amendments being supported. I want to make that very clear and I urge the crossbenchers to consider the Labor amendments. The amendments address the prevailing and profound shortcomings of these bills. They are organised into a series of groups and I want to make some general comments before I move the first set of amendments. 
The current set of bills was introduced last year after the government amended its original package to address some, but not all, of the concerns raised in a former Senate inquiry. That inquiry was carried out by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. As I have said previously, although some changes have been made, there are still far too many problems for Labor to allow these bills through without a long list of necessary amendments.
Labor is concerned that the government wants to turn back the clock and risk wiping out a generation of gains in heritage protection in Australia. Of particular concern is that we are worried that the government wants to remove independent decision making about the places that will benefit from heritage protection. It wants to replace the independent body with an advisory council effectively stripped of any meaningful powers. There is a real danger that an advisory council stripped of such powers will be a severely weakened advocate for heritage matters in Australia and the council will open the way for further politicisation of heritage protection.
I say `further politicisation' because the writing is already on the wall. The chair of the independent Heritage Commission, Mr Tom Harley, is a mate of the government and he did something quite remarkable on 18 June this year. He put out a press release welcoming reports of a deal between Senator Lees and the minister that would see the passage of these bills. Senator Lees has confirmed her support for these bills. I will quote my colleague Mr Kelvin Thompson, Labor's representative on environment matters, who said today:
Senator Lees' announcement today, “Lees Wins Heritage Deal”, shows how little she knows about the proposed Heritage legislation and how naïve she could be in trying to cut a deal with Minister Kemp.
Senator Lees' 70 amendments, applying to only one of the three Heritage Bills soon to hit the Senate, do not strengthen heritage protection to any significant degree. Maybe the Senator should have taken a leaf out of Labor's amendments, which actually cover all three Bills and do provide the heritage protection sadly lacking in the Government's proposed legislation.
In addition, Senator Lees states that her deal with Minister Kemp is supported by major environment and heritage groups—maybe she should have actually consulted the major environment and heritage groups like the Australian Conservation Foundation before making such a sweeping statement.
But getting back to Mr Harley, he did not stop there. He went on to do the government's bidding by running some of their media lines, like this one: `passage of this legislation will also mean the government will unlock $52.6 million to implement this new heritage system which was announced in the budget'. And still he did not stop. It was not enough for Mr Harley—remember, this is a very important point: he is the chair of an independent commission—to do the government's bidding and run their media line for them. He went on to put the boot into other organisations that happen to have a different view from that of the minister. Mr Harley said he totally rejected the stance of the Australian Conservation Foundation and its head, Don Henry, whose assertion that the legislation is a retreat on current heritage laws is muddleheaded and wrong. 
I think it is a remarkable age that we live in when the chair of an independent statutory agency feels so comfortable about coming out with guns blazing to do his political masters' dirty work, but I have to say this is not new. In fact, in the context of the debates in this place earlier today and indeed yesterday in relation to the National Museum, it seems that he is another foot soldier in the ongoing cultural war being perpetrated by the Howard government in this country. I think Mr Harley should go back and look at his job description. He is the chair of an independent commission. If he wants to carry on like a government apparatchik then I think the word with the minister is in order and he can perhaps apply for a job in the minister's office.
Turning back to the bills before us, as my colleagues and I have said in earlier speeches in the second reading debate, not all of the provisions in these bills are bad. In fact there are some welcome elements. That is why Labor wants to amend the flaws that we cannot live with and make changes to these bills to create a far stronger set of bills that will make improvements to heritage protection in Australia and maintain that very important principle of independence.
I will take this opportunity to reflect on the Democrats, too. It was very interesting to see a scenario being played out earlier today in the chamber that led to the delay of this debate by a significant number of hours. Senator Bartlett made clear in his speech in the second reading debate that this was the worst set of negotiations that they have observed in 13 years, which I think is a pretty big statement in the context of all of the deals that the Democrats have done with the coalition. He said that it would affect future negotiations if the government could not act in good faith. He said it was very difficult to negotiate in bad faith and when the behaviour of government ministers and staff was `upsetting'.
These bills do need to be amended, and I urge the Democrats in particular to look at our amendments. I note with interest the series of amendments that have subsequently come forth from the Democrats in the context of their deal and negotiations with the government falling apart. I would like to refer to a couple of points with respect to the Democrat amendments which, like Senator Lees's amendments, do not address the basic issues that Labor's amendments address. Do they address the problem of a weakened definition of `action'? No, they do not. Do they provide heritage protection for heritage places and associated values? No, they do not. Do they transfer all of the Register of the National Estate places owned by the Commonwealth to the Commonwealth Heritage List? No, they do not. Do they stop this decision-making process from going into the minister's hands? No, they do not. Do they maintain the independence of the Heritage Council? No, they do not. So in all of these things we still have a case before us that it is only Labor's amendments that will resolve that problem. It is only Labor's amendments that will make this bill passable. I seek leave to move Labor's first set of amendments together.
Leave granted.

As it currently stands, the Heritage Commission has a broad range of functions and it operates as an independent body. The government's plans are to replace the commission with the Australian Heritage Council. It will be a mere advisory body. The proposed new regime will give the minister the ultimate power to determine what deserves heritage protection. That decision will not be based solely on the heritage value of any site; there will be room for other factors to creep in and influence decisions. It is a move that cannot be tolerated by any heritage conscious group.
Labor's proposed amendments will divert control of the listing assessment and disclosure processes back to the Heritage Commission and keep it at arm's length from the minister. Our amendments also improve the qualifications for appointment to the commission. They better define specific membership qualifications relating to Indigenous heritage. Having moved those amendments, I will be interested to hear what other senators have to say.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-13,"—I find it interesting that with regard to what the government is doing on heritage generally Senator Lundy should say, `It is a move that cannot be tolerated by any heritage conscious group.' Yet the only group that is opposed to what the government is doing is the group that she has just mentioned, the ACF. The ACF has a record of being opposed to anything that this government does. It has opposed all previous environment measures. I am not quite sure what it is waiting for by way of improvements to environment legislation because we have had substantial improvements. No, they have not gone as far as some of us would like to go but certainly they are very substantial improvements on the status quo. 
I take real issue with what has been said about Tom Harley. You would presume that Tom Harley, chair of the Australian Heritage Commission, someone with a very wide knowledge of the entire issue and all the details therein, would be someone people would listen to and acknowledge as having some expertise and understanding. Basically the Labor Party is now trying to gut the bill, to undo the new procedures and take us back virtually to square one. 
The ACF stands alone in opposition. It is out there as the only opposing voice of all the groups that have been actively involved in this legislation, that have had any discussions and involvement with the government on the issues and negotiating amendments and looking at how improvements can be made. The other groups—and I listed them in my second reading speech—are very supportive of the government's bill. Therefore I find myself unable to support what Labor is doing, which is effectively gutting the legislation.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—I would like to take this opportunity very briefly— although it is unnecessary—to defend Mr Tom Harley. He was appointed as chair of the AHC in part because of his independence and objectivity. Just because he, in that role, puts out a statement applauding an outcome that is better in terms of protecting Australian heritage than the existing regime, he should not be condemned for doing so. You can be independent and objective and yet at the same time applaud the better outcome, and I am sure that is what he was doing.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-13,"—I indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting these amendments. It is not good enough for us to hark back to the days of old. The current arrangements did not protect heritage—and calling it a commission again seems to me to make no substantive difference. Giving the commission the responsibility for listing places on the National Heritage List would go back to a situation where listing really did not mean anything. 
Like Senator Lees we do not think the government has gone far enough in terms of the independence of the council, but we do acknowledge that it is critically important to have a tougher regime. You cannot get much weaker than the current one because being on the Register of the National Estate means absolutely nothing. So we think it is important that the decision about listing is made by the minister. 
We have sought in this legislation to make sure that that process is as accountable as possible and that the minister is required to go through the kinds of processes which would make sure the government was able to be held accountable for those decisions. So we will not be supporting this group of amendments. We do not think that in any case it is workable for them to be put up in this way. I think that the ALP probably know that these amendments are not going to be successful, which is why they have been put forward. If we have an ALP government it will be interesting to see them put in a tough heritage protection regime with a fully independent commission or council, or whatever they decide to call it, able to take decisions independently of government. I look forward to that day. If that happens we will all be celebrating, but I think the reality is that under this government, and possibly under a Labor government, we will not see that. So the Democrats will not be supporting this group of amendments.
—I seek some clarification. I take it that we are debating the first block of ALP amendments as allocated on the Clerk's running sheet—is that so? 
 (Senator McLucas)—Yes, Senator. They are amendments (1) and (2), (22) to (49), (51) to (105) and (107) to (145).",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—Part of this group of amendments is also Labor's opposition to sections 324M and 341M. I will take this opportunity to respond to comments made by other senators. Let us be really clear about this. Labor's amendments strengthen the bill. Our amendments do not remove those elements of the bill that strengthen the heritage regime. We think they are a move in the right direction. It is not appropriate, and it is untrue, to stand up and imply that Labor's amendments are some reversion to how things were in the past. That would happen, however, if this bill were to be rejected by the Senate. 
From what we have just heard, the Democrats are unwilling to support Labor's amendments. They are signalling their decision right now that they are not going to support Labor's attempt to retain independence of the Heritage Commission. I think that is extremely unfortunate and very disappointing for all concerned. It is also very clear that the process here is now a sort of competition between former Democrat Senator Lees and the Democrats to see who can move amendments first to fiddle around the edges with this bill to try to turn it into something to save them little face. Quite frankly, nothing will work because only Labor's amendments will preserve that independence of the commission.
The Democrats and Senator Lees are saying that they will support further politicisation of the process. I think that that, far from casting aspersions on Labor's integrity in this matter, is a clear message from the Democrats that they are not interested in an independent commission. To express concern is one thing; to reject amendments that will, if all are supported, work towards achieving that is another matter altogether.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-13,"—Since this debate is setting off on the path of political jibes and rhetoric we might as well continue along this vein for a short time. We have often heard in this place from the Labor Party that they cannot possibly support amendments that we might put up that would improve legislation. The usual reason is that that is what you do when you are in government. The usual reason is, `We can't do anything which is significant because we are a party in opposition. In other words, we are ready to take government after the next election and in the meantime we do not support your amendments if there is a chance they will get up because that is not what we are in the business of doing; we are in opposition.'
Senator Lundy, it does not bode well for this, your first bill, to be suggesting now that the Democrats are not wishing to join with you in creating the perfect heritage legislative environment. I think it would be more useful if we heard what your amendments did. A debate such as this is going to be very complicated and if we are just resorting to that kind of political rhetoric then we are not really going to get very far. I suggest that we focus on the effects of those amendments and leave aside from now on the question of whether this can be a perfect bill and whether the Democrats are joining with you in achieving that. We do have a political reality in this case. We do want to see the best possible heritage regime. As I said before, if Labor take government I will be the first to join with you in putting in place that regime to make sure it is as strong as it possibly can be.

This set of amendments by Labor reinstates the current level of heritage protection to a place and its associated values. The government proposes to reduce the breadth of coverage offered by heritage protection. As it stands, heritage protection currently flows to a place and its associated values. The government's proposed new regime will limit the protection to just the values of the place. Labor believes that the legislation should continue to protect places and their associated values as opposed to just relying on values alone. We reject the suggestion that this would somehow restrict the number of places that could be considered and we have always supported protection of a heritage place and its associated values rather than just the values.
A simple example illustrates the significance of why heritage place and its associated values should be used instead of just the values of a heritage place proposed by the coalition. The Great Barrier Reef has had its share of commercial shipping oil spills in the past. Do such oil spills significantly impact on the values of this heritage place? It could be argued no, not really. But do such oil spills significantly impact on the heritage place? They certainly do. In this situation, which form of wording will give better heritage protection to places such as the Great Barrier Reef? Obviously, the heritage place and its associated values is the better definition.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-13,—I want to indicate that the Democrats will not support these amendments either. Protection under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act already extends to include place and values in Commonwealth areas and this is only relevant to national heritage places. It is the case that this was argued for strenuously by some of the heritage groups at the time of the inquiry into the bill but I think that those groups have accepted that place is going to provide adequate protection for heritage. On that basis we will not support these amendments.,SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-13,"—We are not reducing coverage by moving to the idea of themes or broader definitions of what is heritage. Looking at the potential of the concept of themes, we can look at convict heritage, the goldfields, heritage rivers or wild rivers, Aboriginal trade routes and, as has been mentioned, overseas battlefields. Indeed, the potential under this legislation is much greater than trying to identify every particular convict site. Instead, it is going to be the value of the heritage generally. So I am not able to support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—I think the amendments have merit. I am concerned that the Australian Heritage Commission should have the independent control that it has had and that the wrong formula is being brought in here. What was required was for the Australian Heritage Commission not only to have its independent power to list properties in Australia but also to have the power to protect those properties. What we get instead is a formula here which abolishes the Australian Heritage Commission, sets up a council which has advisory powers only and puts into the direct purview or power of the minister the ability to list and delist properties, taking into account economic considerations—and that is a death knell for the environment. We have already seen the way in which heritage legislation can fall foul of economic considerations. Nothing could more clearly show that than the removal of forests from legislative action and heritage listing under the environment protection bill which came through with the GST—at the time supported by Senator Lees as the Leader of the Australian Democrats— in 1990. In one go all the forests of Australia, under the regional forest agreements, were removed from ministerial power to be listed and protected, through the wishes of this government. The Greens have amendments coming down the line to put forests back into this piece of legislation so that the Australian Heritage Commission, if it were to survive, would have the power to list those forests that are not listed. 
I am very concerned that what we have here is a pulling of the rug a little further from under the specific mandate of the Australian Heritage Commission to be able to independently list what is and what is not of importance to the national heritage. We will then have moved right away from what was then—and I agree with other speakers all around the place—the obvious requirement that the Heritage Commission be empowered to protect those areas. No empowerment here. No Heritage Commission. Everything goes to the office of the minister of the day—and that means that the minister, under the pressure, for example, of corporate interests, makes a decision to list and then can make a decision to delist. It does mean that places that are protected and that may have been protected for years can later, by ministerial fiat—not by the parliament but by the minister—be delisted from the heritage list to satisfy some commercial operator's wishes.
Senator Lees earlier in the day pointed to the issue of an important heritage listed area, Rous Hill, some of which, through the actions of the New South Wales government, has now been handed across to developers. That is absolutely deplorable. What is required, the area having been listed by the Australian Heritage Commission, is that we should be dealing with legislation here tonight which empowers the commission and protects that area from such piecemeal break-up. But the legislation that we are dealing with here and the amendments that come from Senator Lees and the government are not going to alter that. They are simply going to make that type of process easier: along comes the developer, the minister and even the advisory council agree that you do not need 400 hectares, that the prime part of this property is on the central 50 or 100 hectares and so the rest goes west. Where is the formula here? Where is the protection for a place that, once listed, says that that cannot simply be undone by ministerial whim further down the line? It is not there. So it is a false premise to believe that by abandoning the Australian Heritage Commission, as this legislation does, we are somehow magically going to move to an age in which there is going to be vouchsafed protection for heritage.
Madam Temporary Chairman, if you get the opportunity to buy a copy of the Bulletin this week I suggest you get it. It has already sold out at the outlet where I tried to get one, and I have no doubt that that is because there is an excellent three- or four-page article in there about Australia's biggest existing tree. That tree is in the Florentine Valley in Tasmania and it is listed at the top of Forestry Tasmania's own list of the biggest trees by volume. They actually dubbed it El Grande, the big one, because it is the biggest by volume: 18.7 metres around at the base, if you measure it at shoulder level—it would not fit into the average bedroom—and 80 metres high. Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which we are dealing with amendments to here tonight, that tree ought to have been at the top of listing and protection in Australia. I would ask Senator Lees, or Senator Hill for that matter, why it was not protected. It would be a rhetorical question. The answer is because forests were specifically excluded from protection under the legislation when it was brought in in 2000. What we should be dealing with here tonight is putting that protection back for Australian icons like that, right here and now. That is a glaring piece of evidence of the failure of that piece of legislation. What is being done about it under this legislation? Nothing. 
The Greens will move to have the forests put back into at least listing mode under the EPBC Act. If this were to go through, we would want to see that, and the minister having the responsibility for protecting absolutely stupendous parts of the Australian heritage like that. But there is no sign of that here and I will be interested to see if the Labor Party and Senator Lees support the Greens in ensuring that forests do get protected this time, because it is absolutely essential that the El Grande episode never be repeated. It was burnt by Forestry Tasmania, I might add; it was front page news in London that such a giant of the natural world could be destroyed by a regeneration burn under a forest practices code that is repeatedly broken and a protection system that does not work, sheltered by legislation that went through this place which simply said that the forests were not going to be a Commonwealth matter. If you are not going to have the forests of this nation a national matter, what about the rest of the heritage? Ditto, when you get commercial pressures—the big pressure from corporations like Gunns—and environmentally irresponsible governments like that in Tasmania at work. There needs to be a national protection mechanism, but it is not in this piece of legislation.
The first thing we are asked to do is dismantle the Australian Heritage Commission, which could at least list such places as being of national significance—get rid of that and abolish the lists of some thousands of important cultural, including Indigenous, and natural sites in Australia. If you were replacing it with some more powerful authority then it might be good legislation, but this does not do that; it removes the independence that the Australian Heritage Commission has with at least its list of places. Instead of going on and adding to that independence a power and an authority, it removes that as well. So we are left with the lowest common denominator, which is the minister sitting in the office of the minister for the environment. We know from looking at Senator Hill's performance on Jabiluka, for example, how much Indigenous people count, let alone environmentalists, when it comes to the pressure of big corporations. We have seen enough to know what the history is going to be coming down the line.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-13,"—I cannot let some of Senator Brown's comments simply go through to the keeper. Firstly, in relation to the EPBC Act, which I am very proud of—I think it is one of the very significant achievements environmentally in the time of this government—it did not reduce in any way cover of forests; it left, unfortunately, the status quo as it was. I, like Senator Brown, am very frustrated by the fact that neither the Labor Party for its reasons nor the Liberal and National parties—the coalition—for their reasons are prepared to protect forests.
—You voted for it.
—I voted for the EPBC Act, absolutely, Senator Brown, but it did not—I repeat, it did not—reduce the cover that forests have. They are left out on a limb, to use a metaphor, and they are going to stay there. I suspect they would stay there even if the Labor Party were to get into government. It is an ongoing issue and one that, no doubt, will be fought out on the ground and through various political mechanisms over the coming months and years. 
Let us look at some of the claims that Senator Brown has made about this legislation. If it is so evil, if there really are these problems, if the suggestions that Senator Brown is making are actually correct, then why do we have this enormous number of organisations who are committed to the protection of our national heritage supporting this bill? We have the Australian Heritage Commission, we have the Australian Council of National Trusts, who described it as a major step forward for heritage conservation in Australia. They went on to say:
The bills will strengthen the capacity of the Commonwealth to protect heritage places by bringing heritage protection under the umbrella of the EPBC Act.
The Humane Society International said:
We view the proposed legislation to be an advance on existing laws to protect Australia's natural and cultural heritage and we urge all parties to give them their support.
The list goes on: the World Wide Fund for Nature, Humane Society International, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and another dozen or so organisations that I listed in my speech in the second reading debate. They cannot all be wrong, Senator Brown. On one side we have the ACF; on the other side we have about 20 organisations who have been working hard with government on this legislation, who have been kept up to date, who know what is in the bill and who are supportive. That is where my support lies—with those organisations.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—On the matter of forests, Senator Lees is wrong. The Commonwealth had quite extensive powers—for example, the corporations powers—to intervene on what woodchip corporations are doing now in our forests, and the EPBC Act in one fell swoop removed that ability for the Commonwealth to intervene. What is more, it endorsed the regional forest agreement, which means that compensation goes to corporations if there is any future intervention. So it manifestly removed the powers that were there. Those powers were not used, because both Labor and Liberal governments have been unwilling to intervene using them. The EPBC legislation explicitly removed forests as a matter for future ministerial intervention.

(3A)	Immediately after this item commences, the Australian Heritage Commission must determine that the National Heritage List is taken to include any other place on the Register of the National Estate not included on the Commonwealth Heritage List because of subitem (2). This list is to be known as the Transitional National Heritage List.
(3B)	The Transitional National Heritage List ceases to have effect as soon as the Australian Heritage Commission establishes the National Heritage List under section 324C of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999which must occur within 6 months after the commencement of this item.
(153)	Schedule 3, item 1, page 73 (line 29), after “(2)”, insert “or (3A)”.
In response to Senator Lees and all this talk of the organisations that support this, why make the trade-off on the independence of the Heritage Commission? It does not make sense. As I have stated time and time again, this issue forms Labor's core problem with this bill. Our amendments present an opportunity for that fundamental flaw to be rectified, yet it seems that Senator Lees and others are willing to make that trade-off and then to make a plethora of other types of amendments that we are, of course, yet to get through in this place. 
This third lot of amendments by Labor go to the issue generally of the government not honouring its commitment to transfer Commonwealth places on the existing Register of the National Estate to the new Commonwealth Heritage List. Other people say our amendments will turn the clock back, but this absolutely turns the clock back on heritage protection in this country. A generation of heritage gains may well be wiped out in the process of change.
I looked at the web site of the Australian Heritage Commission and it states that there are now more than 12,000 places of natural, historic and Indigenous significance listed on the Register of the National Estate. The register provides a comprehensive guide that has been painstakingly compiled over the last 27 years, and many of the more than 12,000 places that have been deemed worthy of heritage protection because of their particular and unique values are Commonwealth places. The government will pull the rug from under those Commonwealth places overnight. If these bills pass as they stand, most of the Commonwealth places on the register will be stripped of any protection. They will not be guaranteed a spot on the proposed new Commonwealth Heritage List. 
The government wants to turn back the clock by almost a generation and Commonwealth assets all around Australia will certainly suffer. I am talking about places like the George's River in Sydney, Myilly Point in Darwin and Point Cook and Point Nepean in Victoria. Those are the kinds of places that will lose their protection. We know that this government cannot be trusted with such treasures. We need to look no further than Norfolk Island where there are plans to sell off crown land for a song. It is one of the major deficiencies in this package of bills. When the department were asked about this at a Senate estimates hearing on 4 June 2001 they said that in the order of six places a year would be added to the new Commonwealth Heritage List. As I mentioned, the government initially gave an undertaking to have all Commonwealth places on the Register of the National Estate immediately placed on the Commonwealth list—but that is not what the bills before us offer. The government has reneged on a promise.
Instead, the government states in its explanatory memorandum that places on the Register of the National Estate that are wholly within a Commonwealth area may be taken to be included in the Commonwealth Heritage List if the minister so determines within six months of the new regime commencing. That is not good enough in Labor's view. Without heritage protection Commonwealth properties in transition from the Commonwealth to other ownership may be vulnerable to inappropriate developments or actions. If you look at the number of Commonwealth assets that have been sold off here in my own electorate of the ACT you can understand the importance and currency of that concern. Labor's amendments overcome these problems of reduced heritage protection by transferring all of the Commonwealth places on the existing Register of the National Estate to the proposed Commonwealth Heritage List. 
Once again, I state that these amendments are designed to ensure continued protection for important heritage places across Australia. Heritage protection in Australia was the brainchild of a Labor government. It was a trailblazing regime in its time and Labor has a proud track record in caring for our heritage places. We acknowledge that the current regime needs some updating, and Labor's amendments do not prevent that updating from occurring. That is why we accept some of the government's package of legislation. But unless these real weaknesses are addressed and this amendment supported—I know that the crossbenches have not supported some other amendments that we have already moved—the clock will be wound back and a generation of heritage gains will be lost. Having moved those amendments I look forward to hearing a response.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—I support the amendments, of course. I will give an example of a place that concerns me and that illustrates why this issue is important. I hope the minister will get advice on this because I will be moving an amendment regarding that place, Recherche Bay— that is French for research—in southern Tasmania, where the north-east peninsula is under imminent threat of logging even though it has arguably the oldest intact European structure in Australasia—the wall of a French garden which was put there by the D'Entrecasteaux expedition in 1792—and remnants of the remarkable observatory which was put on Bennetts Point at the southern end of that peninsula. More particularly we have a very complete history, through the diaries of Labillardiere, botanist with the expedition, amongst others, of the remarkable meeting with the Pallevar Indigenous people on the peninsula in 1793 after the French returned, a year after their first stay there.
The problem is that the area is due to be logged, and there is enormous concern about this in the local community as well as internationally. It has been a matter of contention in France and elsewhere around the world and in academic circles in many places, including Australia. I did get a letter from the Minister for the Environment, Dr Kemp, on 24 March which led me to believe that the area might be being assessed in a way which would lead to its Indigenous and natural attributes being fully assessed before the loggers moved in. Dr Kemp began his letter:
Thank you for your letters of 10 and 22 January 2003 about the proposed forest operations on a privately owned block of land on the northern peninsula of Recherche Bay in Tasmania, and the construction of a related access road—
which, by the way, requires the permission of the state Premier, Jim Bacon—
through the Southport Lagoon Conservation Area and Extension.
Dr Kemp goes on to point to the Forest Practices Code and the regional forest agreement. As I have already told the committee, under the regional forest agreement the federal ministers have given up their power under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to intervene. I would like to ask leave to incorporate this letter, which I have circulated, into the Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
Senator Bob Brown
Senator for Tasmania
GPO Box 404
HOBART TAS 7001
24 MAR 2003
Dear Senator Brown
Thank you for your letters of 10 and 22 January 2003 about the proposed forest operations on a privately owned block of land on the northern peninsula of Recherche Bay in Tasmania, and the construction of a related access road through the Southport Lagoon Conservation Area and Extension.
I understand a Forest Practices Plan for the proposed logging is currently being prepared and a separate Forest Practices Plan for the access road was certified in April 2002. Forest Practices Plans are prepared in accordance with the Tasmanian Forest Practices Code, and must include measures for the protection of natural and cultural values, including impacts on threatened species and their habitat. Once the Forest Practices Plan for the logging has been finalised, it will be certified in accordance with the Tasmanian Forest Practices Act 1985 and the proposed forestry operations will meet the requirements of the Tasmanian Regional Forestry Agreement (RFA). As you would be aware, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 does not apply to forestry operations that are undertaken in accordance with an RFA.
In addition, I have been informed that the owners of the land have recently agreed to a six month moratorium on the proposed logging. I also understand that the Tasmanian Heritage Council has provisionally listed some of the archaeological remains at the site, including the Garden and Observatory sites, and will be considering nominations for provisional listing of other related heritage areas on the site. The Tasmanian Heritage Council has also indicated that it intends to engage independent consultants to undertake an assessment of the north eastern peninsula of Recherche Bay. I anticipate that this assessment will be of considerable benefit in determining the origin, nature and heritage significance of this area.
Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention.
Yours sincerely
(signed)
David Kemp
—At the end, the minister says:
I also understand that the Tasmanian Heritage Council has provisionally listed some of the archaeological remains at the site, including the Garden and Observatory sites, and will be considering nominations for provisional listing of other related heritage areas on the site. The Tasmanian Heritage Council has also indicated that it intends to engage independent consultants to undertake an assessment of the north eastern peninsula of Recherche Bay. I anticipate that this assessment will be of considerable benefit in determining the origin, nature and heritage significance of this area.
What I want to know from the minister—and this will be one of those sites provisionally listed on the Commonwealth heritage list, which would be transferred to this new list under Labor's amendment—is (a) what the listing status of that north-east peninsula of Recherche Bay is and (b) whether the engagement of the independent consultants has taken place and whether their work is under way.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,—I would like to take this opportunity to ask the minister: what is the government's justification for not transferring all of these Commonwealth assets to the new list proposed in their bills? ,SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—What we propose is a fundamentally different regime to what we have at the present. As we know, at present we have a very extensive Register of the National Estate, but there is in practice very little protection afforded to that list. Under the existing section 30, there are certainly obligations on the Commonwealth not to take actions that are inconsistent with the values. But, as we all know, assessments are made and so often the answer comes back that the action would not be inconsistent with the values, and the action goes ahead. It only applies to the Commonwealth, as well. What is, rather, being proposed here is a new regime that gives explicit protection according to the status of the asset. So at the highest level there will be developed a list of national heritage items that attract considerable protection under this piece of Commonwealth legislation—much better protection than exists under the current act—with real penalties attached to it. There will also be a list of the Commonwealth's own assets of heritage value, which the Commonwealth will be obliged to treat in accordance with the provision set out in the bill. There is a provision which specifically obliges the Commonwealth to care for assets that are on its list.
The question is really, `What is the rationale for going down a different path?' The rationale for going down a different path is to provide better protection. The answer to the question, `Why don't you simply transfer the existing massive list of thousands and thousands of items and apply the new protective regime to that?' is that there are many items on the existing list that do not have within them values of the stature that are designed to be protected by this new legislation. Related to that is that the explicit obligations that are imposed in the new act are more appropriate to assets of higher national significance in terms of heritage value than the massive list that already exists. If we tried to provide these obligations to the current Register of the National Estate, the whole system would be unworkable.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—That is a very important comment by the minister: the whole system would be unworkable. There is the real problem with the existing legislation and the proposed legislation—the fear that governments have that if you are going to, in a dinkum way, protect the national heritage, you are going to run into big problems with those people who want to make money out of it. People who have development interests or who will have in the future are going to line up at the minister's door asking for areas to be removed. The existing system was breached repeatedly. There is no clearer example of that than, again, wild forest regions and wildlife habitat around the country. Those areas were listed on the Australian heritage list, but then the government did not take action to back up that listing by protecting them. The wood chippers moved in and said, `We want to log those areas.' Then a range of fanciful excuses for doing nothing about it came from governments. It was not that federal governments—Labor and Liberal—did not have the power to intervene; they did. It was that they did not have the will to intervene, because it got in the way of a lucrative, one-off industry destroying this heritage—which can never come back again—to line the pockets of those who are involved in an industry that is no different to whaling.
The new system is a different take on that which serves the same purpose. It is to abolish all the places listed on the Australian heritage register and set up a new short list which takes out all the ones which have any commercial difficulties as far as this government is concerned. If you find that you have put a place on the list that is of concern to a developer down the line, the minister and the minister only can remove it. I would feel a lot safer if there were some parliamentary protection there. The obvious thing was to give the right to both houses of parliament to move to block a minister who was simply sacrificing the national heritage further down the line. But of course that is not in this legislation. This is developer's legislation and it simply abolishes the problem with the old list—which did not have proper protective power—by effectively abolishing the list itself. 
I agree with Senator Lundy and the Labor Party. If the government is dinkum about the national heritage, it should then fall in line with the years of the Australian Heritage Commission and the enormous work that has gone into assessing places as to whether they were nationally significant or not. There has been frustration many a time with citizens who found that places they had nominated were not put on the list because they did not qualify as nationally significant. Here we have the government abolishing the list altogether and saying, `Let's start again, 30 years down the line. That's good enough.' We have to hope that areas that we thought were deemed to be nationally significant will somehow get onto that list again in the future by a disempowered advisory council to a minister who—even if she or he does have the gumption to list a place—can be followed by another minister who simply takes it straight back off the list. What a system! What a national commitment by Prime Minister Howard and this government to this nation's great heritage! It is a sell-out of Australia's heritage.
I agree with Senator Lees and everybody else here—there would be some gains in this legislation if only it had teeth, but it does not. I am afraid that message has to go to those organisations out there who believe it does. They have to live in hope because this legislation does not have the teeth it should have right now and which the Greens would give it. The legislation is missing those teeth. The strongest teeth the legislation can have is giving not only legislative protection to these areas but also parliamentary protection. If there is an argument for taking something off the list then have the parliament take it off and have the debate and public input through that parliamentary system, instead of leaving it to the next minister who comes down the line and falls prey to the lobby of the sectional interest that wants to have a piece of the heritage. That is missing here.
We are effectively replacing one piece of legislation which does not have teeth with another piece of legislation which has even less teeth. There is no independent authority here to at least evaluate an area and say, `We should protect this.' We are going for the values system to boot, which means anybody can make a decision that a value is what they think it is. That means any minister can diminish the protection of the heritage item that is on the list into the future. I think Minister Hill's comment just now was straight enough. It simply meant it is too much trouble for the government to protect the current national heritage as listed and all the work of the Heritage Commission over the last 30 years because they would have the angst of some get-rich-quick developers in various places around the country saying, `My goodness, we are not going to be able to make a buck out of that forest, that national built monument, or this place of Indigenous significance that is on that list.' We have the wrong legislation here: it is all gum and no teeth.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-13,"—I have an inclination to support these amendments. The government has, over time, made some commitments to placing Commonwealth places that are currently on the RNE onto the Commonwealth list, and it was certainly something we argued consistently for. Our amendments, which we will deal with later on, go to the question of strengthening the protection for Commonwealth sites. It was our view that it should not even have been six months; it should have been possible to transfer those sites across almost immediately. 
I ask the minister to indicate what status he expects these sites to have six months after the bill is put in place and what commitments the government is prepared to make to transfer those sites on at an early stage. There are a number of them which are likely to escape the provisions within this bill because they are on the Commonwealth's list of sites to be sold off, particularly Defence land, but there is also an issue with Norfolk Island which I have raised with the minister in the past. So, as I said, we are somewhat inclined to support this, although we would sooner see the Commonwealth sites transferred in a shorter time frame. The government assures me that this is likely to be the case for the vast majority of them, but perhaps the minister can spell that out.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—I am glad Senator Allison has raised these things, because I want to follow my earlier question and ask the minister for an exact answer. There are 12,000 things on the list now; just how many will come off the list? We do not know what the number will be tomorrow if these bills pass this evening. We do not know whether the government has already worked out its preferences as to what stays and what goes. Is there a criterion? Is there a judging process by which you assess the merit of the items listed? Will the coalition only be preserving what it considers to be iconic and of importance? What are those subjective decisions going to be based on, and just how many items are going to be left on that register when we wake up tomorrow morning or the morning after that and find that this legislation has passed and protection is no longer there?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—The answer to Senator Allison's question is that within the first six months the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, provided he is satisfied that it accords with the tests in the new legislation, can transfer a Commonwealth owned asset from the Register of the National Estate to the new Commonwealth list without the need for the comprehensive evaluation process that is otherwise provided for. I am advised that a great deal of work has already been done in relation to existing Commonwealth assets and the minister should be able to complete within that time frame the task of transferring Commonwealth assets that meet the criteria.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—I am advised that about 500 Commonwealth sites have already been assessed and overwhelmingly meet the criteria for listing on the new Commonwealth list. So it seems that, largely, the assets on the current Register of the National Estate that are owned by the Commonwealth are likely to be included on the new Commonwealth list. The small number that are not remain on the existing Register of the National Estate, but of course this will not attract the very limited section 30 protection that exists in the current legislation. Those assets tend to be of a nature that is not believed to be of significant heritage importance and therefore are to be disposed of by the Commonwealth.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1

—I thought not. I will repeat it. The commitment in Minister Kemp's letter to me in March was that the Tasmanian Heritage Council was establishing an independent assessment of the heritage values at Recherche Bay.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-13,"—Pursuing the point about Norfolk Island, Minister, I have found the document. You responded to my question about it today. I have just had a chance to look at this section of your letter. For the benefit of colleagues in the chamber, essentially there are nine areas containing Commonwealth land on Norfolk Island nominated for listing in 1997 that do not appear on the list of 106 properties that remain to be assessed for transfer to the new Commonwealth heritage list. Those properties were listed by me. They are the Norfolk Island coastline, Red Road, the Cascade area, Ball Bay landscape, Steels Point landscape, Bloody Bridge landscape, western landscape, Duncombe Bay landscape, Bumborus landscape and Mission Road and landscape area.
You have responded to my question about these sites by saying that the heritage values on the lands are already protected through sections 26 and 28 of the EPBC. The most expeditious way the lands nominated to the Register of the National Estate could be protected would be by nominating the places to the Commonwealth Heritage List, thus consolidating the existing heritage protection provisions. What the Democrats are looking for here is an undertaking on the part of the government to see that that happens and to make sure that we have in place covenants, because, as I said, these are sites which are proposed, as I understand it, to be sold. So either they are quickly put onto the Commonwealth register or they have covenants and other protections applied to them so that they cannot be damaged. I think this is an important matter to resolve. I must say that I am not entirely happy with the response that we have had with regard to that protection. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—The minister has not responded to my specific questions, but his answer to another senator has given rise to many more. In particular, as I understood it, the minister said that, out of the current Commonwealth assets on the register at the moment, there are some 500 sites that are affected but that the government asset sales program will somehow help the government determine which of those items listed on the register will actually be transferred to the new list. So my question goes to the issue of the government's asset sales program and whether that asset sales program will cease or be delayed until the merits of the affected Commonwealth sites that are on the register are assessed for the purposes of this legislation and transferred to the new list. The obvious implication is: what changes with respect to that land and the opportunities beyond its current purpose for the purchaser, the new owner of that land, under this act? I am looking for information on the timing of those two processes.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—I will deal with Senator Allison's comments first. As I understand it, she is referring to nine pieces of land on Norfolk Island that have been nominated but are not currently listed on the Register of the National Estate. Assuming this legislation is passed, they would be eligible, as I understand it, for listing on the Commonwealth list if they meet the criteria and there is a process to have them nominated and evaluated. So I do not quite see how that differs from any other piece of Commonwealth property that is not on the list, except for the fact that we know that there are some within the community who do believe that they are of particular heritage value. We can assume that because there has been a nomination, even though there has not been an evaluation of that nomination.
In relation to Senator Lundy's question, I do not think the new legislation affects the Commonwealth's disposal program as such. There are two stages. The first stage, as I have already said, is that a large number of the Commonwealth assets that are on the Register of the National Estate have already been assessed and have been found to be eligible for listing on the Commonwealth list. If that occurs and the Commonwealth then determines to sell those properties, it is not prohibited from doing so under this legislation. But, as I understand it, there are obligations on the Commonwealth to ensure that, notwithstanding the sale, the heritage values are still protected.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—To follow up, this begs the question about the potential for political influence of decision making of this nature, because what we are hearing now is that these decisions will be made in the midst of that sell-off process. I think it is pertinent to make that observation, because suddenly we are talking in the context of the sale of Commonwealth assets and how heritage values are attributed to them and the decision making process about that. It potentially affects the sale price, the perceived value of that land, its potential future use and all those kinds of issues. 
Also, Minister, you are talking about this as though many decisions have been made and that in fact you are close to having almost resolved, if you like, what is going where, but information has not been made available about what sites in the context of this debate. So, as participants in the parliamentary debate, we are not informed about exactly what Commonwealth sites are affected and in what way. You are expecting everyone in this chamber to act in good faith and trust that decision making process, and I ask you to respond to that.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—The first point to make is that the existing legislation does not preclude the Commonwealth from selling its assets that are on the Register of the National Estate but, in doing so, it must satisfy itself of certain things. Under the new system, if the asset is on the Commonwealth list then the obligation to protect the Commonwealth heritage values is set out specifically in clause 341ZE at the bottom of page 63 of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 before the Senate. In relation to the process of transferring the assets to the Commonwealth list, yes, work has been done on that and I would have thought that would be something that honourable senators would be applauding, because the undertaking given by the minister was that this would be done expeditiously. As we have said earlier in this debate, it has been a six-year process to get to where we are today and therefore there has been plenty of time to give consideration to some of these matters. I am pleased to hear that the minister has been doing it.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-13,"—I think at this point in time it would be useful if the chamber had some sort of commitment from the government about the Commonwealth sites that are currently on the RNE. What is the time frame within which the commitment is to transfer them onto the Commonwealth list? We did request a list of the sites that are currently not in the position of having been assessed for transfer. We have not received that list. We also asked for a list of the interim sites and an indicative list of sites, and those lists have not yet been forthcoming.
Firstly, can the minister give the Senate a commitment that all Commonwealth sites on the RNE will be transferred; and, if so, when? In the meantime, can we have a list of the sites that will not be transferred immediately—that is, the interim list; and also a list of those sites that are nominated—that is, the indicative list, which would include the Norfolk Island sites, would it not? I raise this matter of the Norfolk Island sites because it was raised with me. As I said before, these were nominated in 1997. It is 2003 now—six years on. Why has there been no assessment in that time? Again, I am looking for commitments to making sure that these sites are protected.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,—I think the minister has already said that they will not be. I distinctly heard him say earlier that there were some assets that were scheduled for sale that would not be transferring across. I ask the minister to tell the Senate: which ones are they?,SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—Not only is it very important that we hear Senator Hill, representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, lauding the minister's work; it is also very important that the government is open with the committee about that. It is its duty to the Senate, and the question that has been asked is very reasonable: what is the indicative list of the Commonwealth properties that are going to be protected and what is the indicative list of the Commonwealth properties that will not make it and can be sold? Senator Allison is asking about some specific properties—and she has listed them—on Norfolk Island. It is important for the government to give the committee that information. If it has it, it should give it to us. I do not think it is going to change the course of this debate, except that it will give us an idea, as Senator Lundy has indicated, of the criteria and thinking of the government or its current advisers. The worst thing is for the minister to simply sit there and not respond at all to important questions like that. That is no way to treat the Senate committee process on a matter of public importance such as this. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—I accept from the outset that I will never satisfy Senator Brown; he has a very different approach to these matters. But I think I should repeat what I have said, and that is that, in an informal way—so there is not an indicative list as such, I am assured—the department, although I said `the minister', have been trawling through the Commonwealth list to see whether the properties meet the new criteria and have found overwhelmingly that they do. The figure that has been given to me is that they should very quickly be able to transfer about 500 sites. That is not a formal process that flows from this legislation, and therefore there are not lists that can be put on the table. But I think it is encouraging to learn that efforts are being made to ensure that, provided the legislation passes, the protection afforded under the new legislation will be afforded very quickly. In relation to Senator Allison's questions, I do not know that I can say much more. As I understand it, the properties that she is referring to have not been assessed. They were not assessed under the old legislation and they have not yet been assessed under the new legislation, because it has not passed.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—There is a list of Commonwealth properties in the department and they are being assessed. Whatever adjective you put to that list, it is available and should be put before this chamber. What the minister is doing here is obfuscating, and we know why: he is not prepared to present that list to Senator Lundy or to Senator Allison or to anybody else because it will show those properties that are not going to be listed—but I doubt it will show why—and we would be able to correlate that short list of properties with their saleability as Commonwealth assets. We would be able to assess what is really driving the process here: environmental and heritage considerations or commercial considerations as well. So very early in the piece, while this legislation is being considered, we get the drift that it is not just heritage considerations that are involved here. If it were, the minister would bring up the list and be able to say, with the assistance of his good advisers, why, on heritage grounds, certain places were not going to make it.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—The flaw in Senator Brown's argument, of course, is that, if that were the case, the properties could equally be sold under the existing system and there would not be the need to act in the way that he is suggesting. And why would we? With great respect to Senator Brown, he will not accept this but, when we sell assets, we certainly are interested in the financial return because it is taxpayers' money and we think that is important and we are also very interested in conservation of heritage values. If we were not, we would not be bringing before the parliament this new regime that will much better protect built and cultural heritage than anything that has existed under Commonwealth law to date. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—Very briefly, on the first matter of making sure that taxpayers have a return, I have to point to the Brighton Army Barracks in Tasmania valued at over $2 million where this minister got a return of $135,000, less than five per cent of valuation, and that was within the last 12 months. So the minister's performance there is not very good. That aside, his argument also corroborates the point of view that I have been putting forward, that there is not an advantage in this new piece of legislation. He says, `Senator Brown's argument points to the fact that the old legislation was no good.' I have agreed with that: it did not have teeth. But equally, he is failing to bring forward this list because it shows that this legislation does not have teeth and that it does not guarantee protection. If there is no worry from the minister about heritage considerations being 100 per cent behind the putative list that is being dealt with in the department, he should produce it.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-13,"—I think we really have flushed out the government very early on in this debate. I would like to take the minister to task about his claim that he could sell those assets anyway with the old act in place. Absolutely they could but what is changing here is something that is going from being on the register to not being on the register in the midst of the process of that asset going on the market. That is what is changing. We have a process of the sale of Commonwealth assets that is incredibly political. I do not think we should even begin the debate about what is fair value and how that process is being managed around the country, because it has been an absolute disgrace. What we have here is a system where we can see how the political influence starts to come into this decision making process.
I will persist in trying to extract from the government information that they obviously already have about the nature of this decision making and the subjective basis upon which these decisions about what is in and what is out actually occur to try to take it to the next level. The minister has nominated that around 500 sites are being transferred. Can the minister tell me specifically how many Commonwealth assets are on the current list so that I can get an idea of the proportion of the 500 sites that that actually represents? We will see if we can narrow it down a little further. We might get to the point of actually getting the names of the assets that are on the current list but will not be included on the new list and hence the ones that are going to miss out on that protection in the future. This can be a very slow, painful process, which will be a bit like pulling teeth, to get this information from the minister—very reminiscent I have to say of Senate estimates—or he could just provide the information up front that many senators around this chamber, including me, have requested.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-08-13,"—If I may have a moment to seek advice, it should just be a matter of adding them up. I very much regret the deliberate intention of Senator Brown to again mislead the Senate. He knows, as well as I know, that the market valuation of that property at Brighton was not as he just said to the Senate and that the property was sold for a sum slightly less than the market valuation. There was not a distortion of the type that he mentioned. He knows that. He knows that the figure that he was referring to was a valuation for a different purpose other than market: it was an asset valuation. I regret, having sat through the estimates and having that clarified for Senator Brown's benefit, that he comes in here and continues to deliberately mislead the Senate and the Australian people in that way. I hope that within that time I now have an answer.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-13,"—No, I do not. I stand by exactly what I said. The minister, through his introduction of the adjective `asset', makes no difference to the fact that he sold that property for five per cent less than he should have got for it. It was a public property and the public is out of purse because of that and he knows as well that he is using a terminology which is different to escape from that reality. It is appalling that that great property on the edge of urban Hobart was sold off to people who will now realise the real value of the property.

What we are trying to understand is why some are only nominated on that list and why some are not. Again, I will come back to Norfolk because it seems a good example of the sorts of sites that might fall through the cracks, as it were.

I would not be wasting the time of the Senate if you had given us the answer in the first place but you have not yet done that. I wish to pursue the reason for this being the case.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2003-08-13,"—I rise this evening to add some remarks to those I have delivered previously on the subject of strengthening partnerships in our region, in particular focusing on the Australia-Japan bilateral relationship. It is one into which a great deal of work has gone in recent times. We have had regular ministerial visits. Most notably, Prime Minister Koizumi's visit last year and Prime Minister Howard's recent visit to Japan demonstrate that we have a very strong desire between the two countries to continue to foster what is already a very strong partnership. Underneath all of that, of course, there is always a great deal of work going on. I think it is important to recognise and acknowledge the efforts of Japan's ambassador, Atsushi Hatakenaka, who is departing Australia at the end of this month after a very impressive term of service here, and also our own ambassador in Tokyo, John McCarthy. They have particularly tried to ensure that both countries get the most from the Australia-Japan Creative Partnership Dialogue, which the prime ministers have launched.
In the last three years, for example, Australia and Japan have each hosted one of the Australia-Japan conferences that have brought together leading representatives from the private and public sectors, from academia and from the arts and sciences in both countries. They have been the subject of wide-ranging discussions, which have covered not only the obvious—the economic, the political and the strategic—but also, importantly, cultural ties, and I do not think we can underestimate the importance of those.
I was honoured to have the opportunity to participate, with a number of parliamentary colleagues, in both conferences and I think they have been marked by their success in identifying a range of practical measures and setting time frames for achieving those goals. The most recent AJC—Australia-Japan Conference—was held in Tokyo at the end of last year. It operated with four separate groups— politics and security, economics, education exchange, and science and technology— which have each set out a range of objectives.
I was very lucky to be invited to return to Japan shortly after AJC2 at the invitation of the government of Japan to hold a series of meetings with agencies and parliamentarians, including with their Senior Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vice-Minister Yano, who is visiting Australia next week. It is fair to say that they are equally driven and equally excited about the progress that the bilateral conferences have been achieving. 
I want to comment briefly on the work of the AJC2 Political and Security Working Group, in which I participated. It recommended some areas that we should pursue further and in which more work should be done: the broad regional security environment in our region; transnational security threats and cooperation; practical support for regional neighbours focusing on institutions and capacity building; and enhancing defence cooperation. The discussions involved both academics and non-officials in the process. They are also now pursuing what are broadly known as 1.5-track discussions. They are an important part of relationship building and important in creating an understanding between nations of different cultures so that we can, as far as is ever possible in these cases, see the world in the same light and, more colloquially, `know where the other is coming from' to try to fix problems and achieve our strategic goals. The process has the strong support of Gaimusho, the Japanese foreign ministry, which funds the Japan Institute of International Affairs to drive this process. The new head of the institute, Yukio Satoh, is a former Ambassador to Australia and the UN. Together with the Director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Hugh White, both deserve an enormous amount of credit for the good work they are doing.
I think it is fair to say if you talk to older Japan hands that conversations with the bureaucracy in the past were a little rigid, but many now describe it as a much more free-flowing process and more productive, showing a genuine trust and desire to work towards our shared goals. At the end of the day that can only help Japan's strategic policy development, which in itself is becoming more fluid; for example, the bill allowing Japanese forces to be sent to Iraq and Japan's deployment of 700 Self Defence Force engineers to the UNMISET operation in East Timor are very good indications of that change and that fluidity.
It has been painful for Japan to `come out of its shell', if you like, in terms of contributing military forces to regional security, but it is an innovation that the Australian government has welcomed. Far from seeing Japanese involvement in military activities through the prism of World War II, we are reassured by the prospect of a fellow liberal democracy contributing to regional security.
I think it is fair to say that Japan is also very interested in the South Pacific. The next 1.5-track security dialogue, to be held in March of next year, will look at regional cooperation. I believe there is interest, for example, in the Australian government's assistance to the Solomon Islands.
We already have in the defence area a relationship which includes strategic dialogue, reciprocal high-level visits, service-to-service contact and working level policy exchanges, staff college exchanges and regular ship and aircraft visits. Recently, preliminary discussions have taken place between the Australian Incident Response Regiment, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Japanese military on possible future cooperation on counter-terrorism and training exchanges. In light of recent events, I think there cannot be a great enough emphasis on that level of cooperation between our countries and, broadly speaking, within the region.
The AJC2 Economic Working Group supported a very broad-based integration between our two economies to, effectively, boost economic growth in both. The working group promoted official dialogue for deepening and extending the economic relationship; the finalisation of a balanced trade and economic agreement; the enhancement of mutual recognition, regulatory linkages and cooperation in emerging areas; and the making of efforts towards economic integration in the region and also further engagement with the private sector. It is about our two countries wanting to work together as partners to promote economic and financial stability in East Asia by establishing a mechanism like an Asian monetary fund to enhance policy dialogue, surveillance and financial cooperation to prevent and resolve financial crises in the region. Both countries also want to capitalise on exciting commercial opportunities in some very interesting sectors like biotechnology, nanotechnology and information and communications technology and in the more obvious ones of manufacturing, education, health and other services. We want to assist small and medium enterprises involved in these technical sectors, in particular. There is broad consensus that the region needs better policy dialogue and surveillance and that there is scope for developing a more coordinated regional approach to preventing and dealing with financial crises. Currently there is no consensus about the scope or desirability of greater cooperation in setting monetary policy or exchange rates in East Asia, for example. 
The third working group of the AJC was that on education exchange. They recommended three particular approaches: a joint review of e-learning programs in Australia and Japan; a broadening of this process into the Asia Pacific region; and increasing cultural, and not just language, awareness. I understand that since the conference a delegation from Japan's National Institute for Multimedia Education visited Australia some months ago and had very constructive discussions with Professor Shirley Alexander, also a participant in AJC2 and a member of the Australian University Teaching Committee, who is now working with DEST to move forward recommendations on our side.
The fourth working group of the AJC2 addressed science and technology issues and also made some important recommendations: that a multidisciplinary Australia-Japan panel on ageing be established to explore opportunities for bilateral links for research and development on ageing; that population ageing be discussed in the next meeting of the Australia-Japan Joint Committee on Science and Technology; that both governments strengthen bilateral exchanges and research activities to explore options to maintain and promote healthy and productive ageing; and that the proposed panel explore initiatives for developing and evaluating assistive technologies, service delivery models, life-long learning programs and e-health for the aged.
Given the very common demographics in our countries, I think these are very important initiatives. In fact, I was struck, when reading an edition of the Weekend Australian in June of this year, by a story entitled `Long life everybody's cup of tea' which indicates that a corporation in Japan has come up with an electric kettle that sends a concerned child an email or a text message every time their parent pours water from it. It is a sort of inbuilt check that their parent is still making cups of tea at home. It costs ¥15,000 and you pay another ¥3,000 a month for the message service. Apart from anything else, it is an interesting indication of how you struggle with an ageing population in a diversely populated nation. I do not know if it will take on here but, given Australians' take-up of technology, anything is possible.
I should also comment this evening not just about the ideas generation that has come from the AJC but also about the importance of our trade and economic linkages. The engagement between Prime Minister Howard and Prime Minister Koizumi, in signing the new trade and economic framework, reflects our very strong commitment to further developing trade and investment linkages, and to liberalisation. That does not ignore our disappointment about things like the Japanese decision on the tariff on chilled beef exports known as the `snapback', which is going to have a very significant impact on Australian producers. It is a decision about which we are concerned. 
Our engagement with Japan is very broad and it is deepening through the work of these very successful bilateral conferences and by very effective ministerial visits to and from Australia and Japan. I think it is one of the success stories of Australia's engagement in the region. In many ways it provides a benchmark by which we can measure our engagement with other countries in our region and around the world.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Australia-Japan Bilateral Relationship</title>,Adjournment,21,1
