So, Senator, please do not come into this chamber and suggest that this government does not take the caretaker conventions seriously—we do—when the last Labor special minister of state, who had custodianship and responsibility for these conventions, openly and flagrantly violated them and made no excuse for doing so.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:18):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Carr and Polley today relating to higher education funding and to taxation policy.


We have just witnessed quite an extraordinary proposition where the parliament has been brought back to discuss a series of measures which the government does not have ready to bring into this chamber. It does not want to be able to present a motion and, in light of the fact that next week there is a Senate hearing into why questions about the CSIRO have not been answered, where the opposition asks a legitimate question, following a similar request yesterday in which assurances were given that questions would be answered, we discover that answers to five of the 29 questions which we were assured would arrive will, in fact, happen. What does the government do? It then chooses to filibuster for an hour and a half in a vain attempt to avoid having to deal with a number of motions that are coming up today and, probably, tomorrow, because the standing orders are very clear on this, and the resolution we have already carried makes it perfectly clear which legislation we are dealing with. That legislation has not been dealt with in this chamber because we are still waiting upon the House of Representatives.


I raised a question today with the Minister for Education concerning the government's education policies. We clearly know there are two fundamental issues at stake here: just how much is the government now planning to take out of university funding, and what is their plan in regard to deregulation? We know what the government's formal policy position is because it has been stated. It has been stated twice at Senate estimates—in October and February this year—and stated in MYEFO in December of this year, and the statement has been made by the minister on Sky TV on a number of occasions that the government is seeking to take further savings from the university system.


What we know is what their election campaign will look like, and that is where we get into interesting territory because this is a government that has said, just like the last election—remember the last elections?—'No cuts to education.' No cuts to education was the policy position they took, and what they are trying to do, once again, is slither through the election campaign without any assessment of their policy and then make the assumption that they can climb back into office and introduce a 20 per cent cut to the universities—a $5 billion cut to universities—over the forward estimates.


We now see what I understand is quite a clear proposition: Senator Birmingham, I am told, has gone off to the cabinet and sought further cuts, only to find that the cabinet has thrown him out because the cuts are not big enough. This government wants to impose additional cuts upon the university system, because we know how the universities are treated by this government. They regard the universities as fair game. We know that the Parliamentary Budget Office has made it very clear that the overwhelming reason for a blow-out in the student loan scheme is the stated policies of this government to impose a 20 per cent cut on the universities and to regulate university fees—the $100,000 degree which they are seeking to impose. If the deregulation agenda becomes law, the annual cost of the student loan program will have risen from $1.7 billion to $11.1 billion within 10 years. That is a 46 per cent increase in the public debt, and we know what the assumption for that is based on: the government's stated policy position.


What we are talking about now is that the minister claims he is continuing to consult with the sector. I have absolutely no doubt we will hear talk about another review into the implementation of the government's budget cuts. According to the PBO, on the current unlegislated higher education measures, that is a cut of $12 billion over 10 years. The minister will be forced by his Expenditure Review Committee to seek additional cuts on top of those. The Liberal policies are very clear. They have created a mountain of debt and they have now sought to impose that mountain of debt upon students and taxpayers like. They are determined to pursue the same old Liberal Party ideology: a move from public provision to private provision, a move away from a fair go, and the entrenchment of those who already have power and privilege. What they are seeking to do is to slam the door shut on opportunity for individuals and the nation, and the minister's plans are becoming abundantly clear to all those prepared to listen. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind senators that it is disorderly and against the standing orders to walk between the chair and the speaker.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:23):  You could be forgiven for thinking that yesterday was the worst day for opposition senators in the Australian Senate for a very long time. I am looking at Senator Polley from Tasmania, and I will come to her ridiculous claims about double taxation in a moment. You had to witness what we just saw in the Australian Senate over the last few moments. Senator Carr fell foul of his own strategy. He used a procedure that he thought was going to embarrass the government and disrupt proceedings, but what happened? He fell foul of his own procedure and it blew up in his face. Let's talk briefly about the substance of question time today. What is revealing is not what opposition senators want to talk about—their claims about higher education funding and their false claims about double taxation—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I will come to double taxation in a moment, Senator Polley. I am looking forward to debating you on double taxation. I want to share with you what the Daily Telegraph said about double taxation, Labor's plan to modify the carbon tax and Labor's plan for a new electricity tax. Let me get to that in a few moments. What do Labor senators not want to talk about this afternoon? They do not want to talk about their ridiculous claim earlier today that somehow the government was going to breach its caretaker conventions with regard to government advertising. Why was it a ridiculous claim? First, because we have given a clear commitment that we will not breach the long-established caretaker conventions, but, more importantly, because Labor did breach them when they were in government. In a most horrendously shameful way, Labor breached the caretaker conventions at the last federal election. I know a little bit about this. I was the senator at the Senate estimates committee process who asked David Tune about the caretaker conventions. Let me share this for senators who are not familiar with him. He is one of Australia's most well respected public servants. At that Senate estimates committee hearing in May, he was the secretary of the Department of Finance—a very significant and considerable area of the Australian Public Service.


I asked him rather innocently about the caretaker conventions and whether they had been breached in the past. It is no wonder that Labor senators are silent, because in that silence is their embarrassment and deep shame. What did the secretary of the Department of Finance, David Tune, say? He said he was directed by the then Special Minister of State—and I will come to him in a moment—to breach the caretaker conventions. It is not a rumour; it is well documented; the documents are here. He was directed by the then Special Minister of State to breach the caretaker conventions with regard to a government advertising campaign on people smugglers. What makes that more remarkable, as if that were not remarkable enough? The Special Minister of State was none other than the member for Isaacs, Mr Dreyfus QC, who was also the Attorney-General. So, not only was he the senior law officer in our country; he actively directed—those are not my words; they are David Tune's words—the secretary to breach the caretaker conventions. That is a most shameful act.


It is no accident that Senator Gallagher asked one question and not three. She realised that she had trod on a landmine. I will give this to Senator Gallagher: she was not in the Australian Senate when that matter was revealed at Senate estimates. She can be forgiven for that, but she cannot be forgiven for her poor research skills. She should not forgive the people on that side who gave her the question and set her up. It was a lazy allegation this morning from Labor that the coalition would breach its caretaker conventions . The Leader of the Government in the Senate made it very clear today that we will not. Why should Labor senators care so much? Because they were the people who actively breached the caretaker conventions and instructed, directed, David Tune to breach the caretaker conventions. It is not an allegation and it is not a rumour; it was revealed at Senate estimates. Yesterday was a bad day for the Labor Party in the Australian Senate. Today has turned out to be a worse day.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:28):  What a contribution to the Senate that was. When I asked a question today of the senator representing the Prime Minister, it was in response to one of those policy announcements by the Prime Minister that they are now trying to run away from. The comments that I referred to were from the Treasurer of the Tasmanian parliament: Liberal member, Peter Gutwein. He raised his concerns. I quoted him when he said:


... each Tasmanian would need to pay $4,500 per year in additional tax.


That is not what I have said. That is what the Treasurer of Tasmania has said. So there is no doubt.


We are getting quite used to the fact that this Prime Minister has all these thought bubbles and they just sort of float past. He will see a bubble somewhere, grab it and say, 'That seems like a good idea,' but we know his ideas do not really stand the test of time. He will announce something in the morning and, by the evening, it will be off the drawing board, yet again. We know, from the contributions that have been made through the course of yesterday and today, that there is only one thing this Prime Minister has on his mind, and that is that he will do and say whatever it takes to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian community, yet again. He will say one thing today but do something completely different tomorrow. We know, when he knifed Tony Abbott, that he did what he had to do. He did the deals within his caucus to get him that job. He has run away from the principled position that he kept espousing to the community, year in, year out. So we expect nothing different from him as Prime Minister, but the Australian people see things very differently now. They see that this government cannot be trusted. Whether it is Tony Abbott or Malcolm Turnbull—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator Polley, you should refer to him as Mr Abbott or the member for Warringah.




Senator POLLEY:
  Whether it is Mr Abbott or Mr Turnbull, Australians know that what they say before an election will be very different if they are re-elected. They said before the last election that there would be no cuts to education and no cuts to health. That was untrue. They said there would be no new taxes, and what have we seen? We have seen, time and time again—and it really does not matter whether it was Mr Abbott, when he was Prime Minister, or Mr Turnbull now—that they cannot be trusted. They are running scared and running away.


They spent all this money bringing us back to parliament for two days, and what have they done? They guillotined debate on a bill that was introduced yesterday and passed last night. They did not give each and every one of us senators the opportunity to contribute to the debate. That is the very least you should expect when you come into this chamber. When there is proposed legislation before this chamber, you have a right to make a contribution, but they guillotined the debate because all they wanted to do was spend taxpayers' money to recall parliament so that their Prime Minister could call a double dissolution of the parliament. I say: bring that election on, but let us make sure that there is some real honesty in this campaign.


This Prime Minister may say that he is nimble and agile, but we know he is not a truthful Prime Minister. If he was, he would have been up-front with the Australian community. When he wanted to extend the GST to fresh food—in fact, extend it to everything—and increase it from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, he was not being honest, but he did get the message, because the Australian people and those on this side of the chamber said, 'We will never support a GST on everything; we will never support an increase to 15 per cent.' If you want to talk about taxation and have a thought bubble every other day, that is fine, but you will be judged on that by the Australian community. They will judge you.


I would not get too self-assured if I were sitting on that side of the chamber, because we know the Australian people are smart. They will make their judgement. Of course those on the other side go into this election as frontrunners—they certainly do—but just be prepared. You will have to explain your policies in far more detail than you did at the last election. You will not get away with the hollow promises that you made that there will be no new taxes, no cuts to education and no cuts to health. You ran away from Gonski funding in years 5 and 6. You have betrayed the Australian people, and I think it may well be once too often. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-04-19,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:33):  I am delighted to contribute to the so-called double taxation debate that Senator Polley has so keenly engaged in. If one takes the very first principle that Prime Minister Turnbull mentioned when he spoke to the premiers and chief ministers, it was that there would be no net increase in taxation across the nation and there would be the opportunity for tax sharing. Senator Polley says this is an initiative of the coalition and something that Prime Minister Turnbull thought up. Let me go back to the year 1991. I do not know if Senator Polley was interested in politics in those days, but I will tell her in a moment who the Prime Minister of the day was. There was a premiers and chief ministers meeting in Adelaide on 21 November 1991 and a historic agreement was struck. The communique to emerge from the meeting is significant because of who the meeting was chaired by. Here is a guessing competition. Who was the Prime Minister in 1991, Senator Polley—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President? Anyone? Senator Smith, would you know? It was Bob Hawke. There were eight premiers and chief ministers at the meeting, six of them Labor. I will tell you who these luminaries of the Labor Party were: Kirner from Victoria, Bannon from South Australia, Lawrence from our state of WA, Goss from Queensland, Field from Tasmania and Follett from the ACT. Do you know what they did? The communique said that all leaders:


… reiterated their support for a national income tax sharing scheme based on providing States and Territories with access to the personal income tax base …


Furthermore, they agreed on a figure of six per cent—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Polley—as being appropriate, 'without impinging on fiscal equalisation arrangements'. Finally, they also agreed, under the leadership of then Labor Prime Minister Mr Bob Hawke, that the proposal was not just revenue neutral but economically sustainable. How wonderful. It was 1942, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, when the states gave up their capacity for income taxing.


Incidentally, let me go on and tell you what happened. I should, shouldn't I? What do you think happened to this breakthrough agreement by Prime Minister Hawke and six Labor premiers and chief ministers? I ask those in the gallery—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is a bit like Q&A. One month later, it got mothballed when Paul Keating, whose infamous centralist tendencies would never permit him to grant greater autonomy to the states, seized Hawke's job. What do you think happened to that thought bubble? It got scuppered. That was the end of it. It was finished because of Paul Keating, the great centralist. 'He who holds the gold makes the rules', and Keating wanted to hold the gold and make the rules.


What did Prime Minister Turnbull do? He went to the premiers and chief ministers and to the people of Australia and said, 'Let's engage in an economic debate and let's put everything on the table.' How amazing that the people of Australia would be given an opportunity to actually have everything on the table for discussion. Fortunately, as a result of decisions made in this place last night, you, the people of Australia, on 2 July are going to get an opportunity to decide whether you want the future economic, social and industrial management of this country to be run by the coalition or to be run by that rabble on the other side.


In the few minutes left to me, I do want to comment on issues associated with higher education. I have said in this place so often, and I say it again, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Kim Carr: Professor Paul Johnson, the vice-chancellor of UWA, one of the Group of Eight universities, has said that a four-year agriculture degree will cost $16,000 a year. Hands up all those who know what four times 16 is. It amounts to $64,000. Perhaps Senator Carr is an example. He ought to go back and get a calculator, because four $16,000s do not make $100,000 degrees. And it is not to the credit of people in this place to continually tell lies about those degrees.


Let me also tell you what this coalition government, through Andrew Robb, the then trade minister, has achieved: free trade agreements with three of our major trading partner countries—Japan, China and Korea—and also, of course, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As one who has had a keen interest in the higher education sector, and one who was an academic at Curtin University in Western Australia and at the University of California and at the University of Kentucky, I can say to you: the value to the university sector of the free trade agreements and the TPP will be measured in billions for years to come.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2016-04-19,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:38):  I want to take note of the answer given by Senator Birmingham to Senator Carr's question today. The answer that Senator Birmingham gave clearly indicated that the Liberals' only plan for higher education is to continue down the path of cutting university funding and allowing universities to set their own fees. Fundamentally, that will lead to the Americanisation of Australia's higher education system, and we know where that leads—that leads to massive student debts and $100,000 degrees.


It is quite a different plan from the one that the now Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, had for higher education when he was a student activist in the 1990s. Then he ran for student politics on a platform of opposing voluntary student unionism and 'fighting against funding and staffing cutbacks'. As quoted in Adelaide university's student newspaper of the time, On Dit, he said, as part of his campaign for student presidency: 'I'd like to ensure that we can take the fight up to any government, be that Liberal or Labor, state or federal, and indeed make sure that we can lobby the upper house of both parliaments quite effectively.' Now Senator Birmingham is right here in the upper house of our federal parliament, where he could effectively lobby—very effectively lobby—against the funding and staffing cutbacks that his government has foisted on our universities, and which it wants to continue to foist on them, by slashing their budgets. But, from his position as minister here in the Senate of the Parliament of Australia, what does Senator Birmingham do? What has he done since the disastrous budget announcements of 2014? Well, he has not done much. When faced with the backlash of the 2014 budget announcements on higher education, this government has been unable to move away from its passion for deregulation and saddling students with more debt.


As Senator Carr said, meanwhile, in a PBO report, we have seen that, if something is not done, Australia's HECS debt will increase massively and eventually threaten the whole HELP system. That PBO report also finds that, within 10 years—that is just one decade—the annual cost of HELP loans, now $1.7 billion, will have risen to $11.1 billion, a 46 per cent increase in our nation's public debt. That debt will be driven mainly by projected increases in student fees from 2017, due, as the PBO report says, to this government's announced higher education reforms. Those so-called higher education reforms—which consist mainly of cutting funding, with a cut of $5 million more to come—coupled with deregulation mean that universities are forced to claw back funding by enrolling students and charging them more, if the universities are able to get away with it, because that is what will happen, arising from deregulation of fees, if this government has its way. We know from other research, including that prepared by NATSEM, that course fees would double and treble under deregulation. The prospect of $100,000 degrees is not a furphy; it is very, very real.


We know that it is true because overseas experience—including in the UK, where fees were partially deregulated—is that it led to overall course increases. The UK deregulated in 2012. The British government claimed then, as this government claims now, that deregulation would mean universities would be able to compete on price. But, as we well know, what happens in the university sector is that the students, the consumers, believe that a lower priced degree is a less worthy degree, and so they do not enrol in those universities that have lower priced degrees; those universities are forced to increase their fees so that they match the higher-charging universities. And, overall, the fees for all students go up, with the detrimental effect, eventually, of fewer students enrolling in university degrees. Of course that will be fatal to the future of Australia's economy and to our innovation and to ensuring that we have good and decent jobs for all Australians. I wish Senator Birmingham would return to his student activist roots and use his position here in the Senate to advocate for better higher education funding and more support for Australian students.

(b) recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples:


(i) are imprisoned at a rate 13 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people, and are estimated to make up 3 per cent of the Australian population, but 27 per cent of the prison population, and


(ii) constituted 14 per cent of the prison population in 1991, but now make up 27 per cent of the prison population;

(i) implement in full the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and


(ii) adopt justice targets in order to close the gap and to change the record on the rates of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator RYAN:
  The government is opposed to this motion, but we are not opposed to the important work of addressing Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody. We acknowledge that any death in custody is tragic and is one too many. The government is opposed to this motion as it is not appropriate for the Commonwealth to sign up to matters which are clearly the responsibility of the states. State and territory governments are responsible for the criminal justice system, and it is appropriate that they take a lead role in addressing matters within the justice system. The Turnbull government is committed to initiatives that focus on tackling the underlying disadvantage that increases the likelihood of a person coming into contact with the justice system.

(i) the result of the election, which delivered a significant majority to the National League for Democracy (NLD), the political movement led by pro democracy campaigner Ms Aung San Suu Kyi,


(ii) the election by Myanmar's Union Parliament on 15 March 2016 of Mr Htin Kyaw as President, and

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (18:54):  As to general business notice of motion No. 1138, standing in my name and in the names of Senators Lazarus, Xenophon and Madigan, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator LAMBIE:
  This motion before the Senate today is taken almost word for word from a submission that was made to the Senate steel inquiry by the steelworkers of Wollongong in New South Wales. They know that the Australian steel industry is doomed and tens of thousands of jobs will be lost unless our major political parties back mandated local content on government projects. The purpose of this motion is to force senators to vote and publicly declare their position with regard to the compulsory use of Australian-made steel in all public procurement. Labor's steel policy, despite many comforting words, does not allow for the mandating of local steel content in government projects, despite calls from the AMWU and the AWU. The steelworkers of Australia and their supporters will carefully watch where senators vote on this motion. I move the motion standing in our names:


That the Senate calls on the Government to:


(a) merge the anti-dumping and safeguards functions into one agency, for example, the Anti Dumping and Safeguards Commission, as occurs in the United States of America (US) and other jurisdictions;


(b) enable anti-dumping applications to be made by industry bodies and trade unions by amending the interested parties definition;


(c) enable and resource the Anti Dumping Commission (ADC) to:


(i) conduct faster and more comprehensive investigations particularly around circumvention countervailing activity,


(ii) share data with overseas jurisdictions that have conducted their own investigations and imposed significantly higher duties, and


(iii) regularly 'benchmark' remedies on like products with other jurisdictions around the world, and in particular the US, Asia and the European Union;


(d) commit additional resources to the ADC to enable independent verification in investigations of importer data and documentation in all applications to ensure the integrity of these processes;


(e) mandate through legislation the use of Australian-made steel in all public procurement, and ensure that all federal grants to the states for infrastructure projects do the same;


(f) apply and enforce enhanced and agreed Australian Steel Standards and Specifications which should be enforced in all federal publicly-funded projects and grants to states for this purpose and apply at every subcontracted level of activity;


(g) ensure all defence and security-sensitive procurement of steel to be Australian-made where those products are locally-produced and can, in a reasonable timeframe, be made in Australia; and



(h) develop and implement, in consultation with industry, union and community stakeholders, an Australian steel industry sustainability plan to incorporate a holistic suite of reforms and measures such as the ones listed above to ensure the survival of this industry.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator RYAN:
  On behalf of the minister in the other place: Australia already has a robust and effective antidumping system that ensures Australian industry competes on a fair playing field. The government's most recent antidumping reforms included better support for Australian businesses engaging with the system, cracking down on uncooperative exporters, improving the merits review process, introducing measures to address circumvention of duties and improving the operational effectiveness of the Anti-Dumping Commission.


Mandating the use of Australian steel, as proposed by Labor, the Greens and others, threatens our international trade obligations and puts at risk the livelihoods of small and medium enterprises and all the jobs of those who rely on the opportunities that these agreements provide every day. The government is committed to setting the right economic environment by reducing red tape and equipping businesses with key market information and the opportunities to expand and/or export.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Labor does not support this motion because the amount of Australian steel used in public projects can be raised by more effective means than that of setting mandatory targets. Labor has already announced a six-point plan to secure the future of strategically significant metals manufacturing industries, including maintaining Australian standards for steel in all federally funded projects; seeking to maximise the use of local steel in federally funded projects; ensuring Australia's antidumping regulator has sufficient powers; working with the commission to strengthen the system, particularly on countervailing measures; appointing a steel industry advocate; halving the threshold for projects required to have Australian Industry Participation Plans; and doubling the funding for the Australian Industry Participation Authority. We are confident that our plan offers a more effective means of maximising the amount of Australian steel used in publicly funded projects.

Senator RYAN:
  Labor's six-point steel plan is a thought bubble. Labor hit manufacturing with a carbon tax bill of $1.1 billion, hit the car industry with a fringe benefits tax of $1.8 billion, provided a last-minute $215 million to GM Holden and granted Alcoa $40 million in pre-closure as they forced their carbon tax on them. Under Labor, one manufacturing job was lost every 19 minutes. The Turnbull government is bringing forward large construction projects such as the Adelaide to Tarcoola rail line. To ensure a consistent and rigorous application of the Australian Industry Participation National Framework with the states and territories, the minister has placed this on the forthcoming COAG ISC agenda. The minister has also written to state and territory colleagues to secure the sustainable delivery of the Industry Capability Network services that assist projects to identify capable and competitive Australian suppliers. While Labor created an overlapping plethora of grants and entitlements, we are setting the right economic environment by reducing red tape and equipping businesses with key market information and the opportunity to expand or export competitively.

Senator LAMBIE:
  Labor's motion reflects the Labor Party's top policy announced by the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, in Wollongong. The main policy points of this motion were half-heartedly welcomed by Australian steelworkers of both the AMWU and the AWU. However, it has become obvious that there is growing anger among steelworkers because both the Labor and Liberal parties refuse to support a policy to mandate the use of Australian steel for government projects. While this motion is full of comforting words and good first steps, both the AWU and the AMWU have put out press releases which essentially note that Labor has not mandated local steel in public projects. As a matter of fact, Labor's six-point plan is an absolute disgrace in terms of support for the steelworkers of Australia. This will not save jobs in this country. I am so disappointed in Bill Shorten. If this is the best you have got to secure their jobs for the future, you should be bloody ashamed of yourselves.

Today I introduce a bill to establish the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. The Facility will address gaps in the infrastructure finance market for northern Australia and is an integral part of the Government's plan for northern Australia. 


The White Paper on Developing Northern Australia, released in June 2015, identified the vital role that infrastructure plays in unlocking economic opportunities globally, nationally, and in northern Australia. The White Paper included almost $1.2 billion in policies to support the construction of new roads and water infrastructure in the north.


Northern Australia has just 5.6 per cent of Australia's population, but contributes over 11 per cent of Australia's GDP, and covers over 40 per cent of our land mass with significant agricultural, energy and resource assets. Its proximity to Asia, also provides an opportunity to service the burgeoning middle-class in Asia. According to Ernst and Young the Chinese middle class is expected to reach one billion by 2030 with India's middle class reaching 475 million people by 2030. Northern Australia has great potential for economic and population growth, but it needs the right backbone economic infrastructure to drive that growth. 


The Government has already committed nearly $5 billion, of its $50 billion nationwide investment in transport infrastructure, to northern Australia. 


These investments include over $3 billion for northern sections of the Bruce Highway, and over $470 million to be distributed across the Cape York Region Package, North West Coastal Highway, and Northern Territory Roads Productivity Package.


Despite this investment by the Commonwealth Government, infrastructure in northern Australia continues to face particular cost and service challenges, including accessing private sector financing. 


At a national level, financing of debt markets has become more dependent on bank lending, rather than longer term bonds. Infrastructure Australia has estimated that since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the capacity of the Australian financial market to fund infrastructure has halved due to the withdrawal of international finance providers. Also, constraints in the finance sector have resulted in longer tenor loans in excess of seven years becoming increasingly difficult to access for infrastructure projects. For example, the average duration for infrastructure debt financing has almost halved from around 11 years in 2007 to around 6 years in 2015. .


These developments are being acutely felt in northern Australia. 


Infrastructure investment in northern Australia is affected by a low population density and issues of, remoteness, extreme heat and high levels rainfall during certain times of year. The uncertainty for infrastructure investment created by these factors can result in commercially viable projects in northern Australia being unable to attract the limited investment funds available.


Infrastructure Australia released the Northern Australia Audit in January 2015. This report confirmed that infrastructure market failures were affecting northern Australia in particular. The identified failures included: limited economic scale, resulting in high costs, poor quality and an absence of competition; a 'first mover disadvantage', where the first project bears all the capital costs of infrastructure that will reduce for other projects; coordination challenges, which prevents cooperation in building more extensive infrastructure; and low socio-economic circumstances, which result in a lower capacity to pay for infrastructure services. 


Through the Facility, the Government, working with the States and Territories, will support the private sector to construct transformative economic infrastructure for northern Australia. This infrastructure will provide a basis for the longer term expansion of the economy and population in northern Australia. 


The Facility will provide an innovative approach to the funding of infrastructure projects, by offering up to $5 billion in financial assistance to encourage and complement private sector investment. This encouragement of the private sector will ensure that economic infrastructure that otherwise would not be built, or would not be built for some time, will be delivered.


Through this bill, the Commonwealth will partner with the private sector and the governments of the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia, to provide financial assistance on concessional terms for the construction of major projects. 


These major projects may include airports, ports, roads, rail, energy, water, and communications infrastructure. These are the types of economic infrastructure needed to further open the north for business, and to deliver wider public benefits for the rest of Australia.


Extensive consultation has occurred across Commonwealth agencies, relevant State and Territory governments, infrastructure owners in northern Australia, financiers and project proponents in developing this bill. Between me and my department, we have met with well over 200 stakeholders. 


Through the consultation process, forty projects with an indicative capital value of $21 billion have been identified as potential NAIF projects. Of these forty projects, around half have been identified in Infrastructure Australia's Northern Australia Audit. 


To make investment decisions, the bill establishes an independent Board that will be comprised of experts from a range of relevant fields, such as banking and infrastructure. 


The Board will ensure that assistance is targeted in an effective manner and the Facility operates in partnership with commercial lenders, not in competition. It will also ensure that the Facility only invests in projects that are able to return funds to the Commonwealth.


The expert, transparent and arm's length design of the Board established by this bill will cultivate credibility in financial markets, while ensuring that the Government invests in projects which are viable, provide public benefits and unlock the potential of the North. 


The Board will undertake its investment function according to an investment mandate. The bill specifies the matters that will be covered by the investment mandate, including eligibility criteria and loan characteristics. A draft of the mandate will be released today for public consultation. We have incorporated feedback from a previous consultation process into the new draft, including a requirement that applicants provide an Indigenous engagement strategy. We are seeking feedback on the draft investment mandate until 29 March. 


This bill enables the Facility to assist projects by providing financial assistance that is tailored to project needs, with any concessions calibrated to the particular circumstances of a project. An example of such assistance may be the provision of 'patient' capital for a new infrastructure asset that is facing a long ramp-up phase that precludes available bank financing. 


The Facility may also be used to provide additional debt finance on fully commercial terms, where a project is able to attract some, but not sufficient, debt finance.


Providing financial assistance rather than one-off grants will reduce the impact on the Budget and impose more commercial terms on recipients. 


Through partnering with the private sector, the investment decisions of the Board will leverage much more than the $5 billion provided through the Facility. To ensure the best return for taxpayer funds, the expert Board will be responsible for selecting projects. To be clear, as the responsible minister I will have no role in directing the Board to make investments in particular projects. 


However, as the NAIF is funded through public money, as the responsible minister I will retain a role to ensure that projects which are contrary to the national interest are not funded. To preserve the credibility of the Facility, this role will be subject to strict transparency requirements and the reasons for my decisions will need to be tabled in Parliament. 


To conclude, the objectives of the Facility reflect the Government's priorities for the development of northern Australia and the importance of ensuring public funds are invested responsibly and for the benefit of the wider economy. 


The establishment of the Facility is a significant step forward for the development of transformative economic infrastructure in northern Australia and for the way infrastructure is financed in this country.


The right infrastructure is vital to facilitating investment, increasing accessibility to markets, especially for remote areas, and helping to attract and retain workers. With careful planning around timing and location, it is a fundamental driver of productivity and growth.


The Australian Government is committed to laying down the foundations for strong economic and population growth through the development of northern Australia, while minimising the burden on taxpayers. 


The Government would like to recognise the efforts of the State and Territory governments for their role in progressing the development of the Facility. We would like to thank the Hon. Annastacia Palaszczuk, MP, Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Colin Barnett, MLA, Premier of Western Australia and the Hon. Adam Giles MLA Chief Minister of the Northern Territory for their cooperation. We will continue to work with the States and Territory to ensure that the Facility delivers for northern Australia. 


The Government would also like to recognise the bipartisan approach taken by the opposition in supporting this important initiative. There are significant opportunities offered by northern Australia and supporting this bill will create a key catalyst for infrastructure investment in northern Australia, which will increase the productive capacity of the north.


Through this bill, the Facility will work with the private sector and the governments of the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia to create the right conditions for innovation and investment and help our communities and businesses in northern Australia to prosper. 


I commend the bill to the House.


NORTHERN AUSTRALIA INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENT) BILL


The Consequential Amendment Bill amends the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 to enable Efic to deliver administration services on behalf of the Facility, and the States and Territory. Efic will be able to charge fees for these services to recover costs. Examples of the types of services which may be delivered include loan origination; due diligence, credit and portfolio management; and loan administration. Under this model, the Board of the Facility will retain responsibility for all investment decisions and risk. 


This amendment does not mean that Efic will have to be used as a service provider for the NAIF, but amending the Efic Act to allow Efic to undertake these services will ensure this is an option that is available to the NAIF. I am keen to utilise existing commonwealth capabilities, achieve cost-effectiveness and provide for flexibility in the delivery of this important policy. 


I commend this bill to the House.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (19:54):  I rise tonight to speak about the critical choice facing the people of Britain on 23 June. They will decide whether to stay in or leave the European Union. From where I sit, the choice is clear: Britain would be more prosperous, free and secure outside the European Union. The European Union project may have begun with good intentions, but the reality is that the EU today has strayed very far from those intentions. It has become bloated, undemocratic and hostile to the freedoms that made Britain great. The cost to the British people and their economy is real. Every week, Britain sends 350 million pounds to Brussels. The cost to Britain's economy of just the 100 top EU rules is more than 33 billion pounds each year.


The UK have lost control of their borders and their laws. They have no power to control the intake of migrants from within the EU. More than half of the laws and regulations passed each year which govern the lives of UK citizens originate not in their own parliament but in a foreign capital, enacted by people who they had no say in electing. They are subject to and bound to failed and immoral policies, like the Common Agricultural Policy, which drives up the cost of food for Europeans and erects barriers to people in the developing world who are only trying to grow food, develop their lives and sell to the Western world.


The main reason for me speaking on this issue tonight is to take the opportunity to address the most common—but, in my view, very misguided—argument for Britain staying in the EU. There are some who argue that the EU would be worse off without Britain's much-needed, sensible and responsible voice in major policy debates. They argue that Australia and the world indirectly benefit from Britain preventing the EU from making worse decisions. There are four main reasons why this is a very bad argument. No. 1 is that if that argument ever had merit, it has long since ceased to be the case. Despite Britain's urgings, the EU has lurched from crisis to crisis and continues to show no signs of willingness to enact sensible reform. The recent failed renegotiation of Britain's own membership of the EU by the Cameron government is further evidence of this.


No. 2 is that we are asking our friends and allies in the United Kingdom to bear a very, very high price for an uncertain benefit for us. To ask them to shackle themselves to the European Union—which lurches from crisis to crisis, which is clearly on the way down and which is hurtling towards possible disintegration—is too great a request to ask of our friends. 


No. 3 is that it ignores the very real cost to our relationship with Britain caused by its membership of the EU. For example, a free trade agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom cannot be negotiated because the United Kingdom has no freedom to determine its own trade policies. No. 4 is that an agreement for the free movement of people between the Commonwealth countries, such as Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, also cannot be negotiated because Britain has no freedom to determine those policies.


The best thing for Europe would be for the United Kingdom to leave the EU and to demonstrate how successful, prosperous, free and secure they could be outside the European Union. That would send the best signal to the EU of the kinds of reforms that are necessary to enjoy prosperity and freedom in the 21st century. The worst thing for the EU and the UK would be for them to decide to stay within the EU, suffer the consequences of it and lose the opportunity to demonstrate to the people of Europe that there is an alternative pathway and that there are better policies.


I urge the people of the United Kingdom to consider very carefully their vote on 23 June. It is up to you to decide whether you remain or whether you leave, but rest assured that your friends around the world—including in Australia—would welcome you back into the international community outside the European Union and that you would have a strong, prosperous and stable relationship with us if you chose to do so.
