Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be read a second time.


This bill will establish legislation for a national redress scheme (the scheme) for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.


Children placed in the trust of our institutions were some of the most vulnerable members in our community. That any were sexually abused by the very people charged with their care and protection is a disgrace. No child should ever experience what they did. That is why it is time for all institutions and governments to take responsibility for what happened.


The establishment of the scheme is an acknowledgement by the Australian government and participating governments that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings was wrong. It was a betrayal of trust. It should never have happened.


It recognises the suffering survivors have experienced and accepts that these events occurred and that institutions must take responsibility for this abuse.


The government acknowledged the need to provide public recognition of the suffering experienced by survivors and investigate the inadequate responses provided by institutions through the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (the royal commission). 


The royal commission's Redress and civil litigation report recommended the establishment of a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. All governments and individual institutions were directed to make amends and take responsibility.


The royal commission estimates that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place.


The royal commission has clearly demonstrated that thousands of vulnerable children were subject to horrendous sexual abuse in institutions throughout Australia.


The psychological, physical and emotional injuries can affect a survivor for the rest of their life. In spite of the severity of these injuries, many survivors have not sought or obtained any kind of acknowledgement or redress for this harm.


I have met many in my time as Minister for Social Services.


The establishment of a national redress scheme acknowledges the abuse that occurred. It is the most significant step in addressing the wrongs of the past and providing a just response to survivors.


It is also an important step towards healing. It ensures governments and institutions take steps to safeguard against these crimes being repeated in the future.


This bill responds to the royal commission's redress recommendations and the Commonwealth government's commitment to establish the foundation for a nationally consistent redress scheme.


I commend the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory for their leadership in being the first jurisdictions to sign up for the scheme.


Should the bill pass, the participation of these governments will mean that, from 1 July 2018, the scheme will be available for over 9,000 people who were sexually abused in New South Wales government institutions, 5,000 people in Victorian government institutions, 200 people in Australian Capital Territory institutions and 1,000 people in Commonwealth government institutions.


Detailed negotiations with other state and territory governments and non-government institutions are continuing.


The establishment of a national redress bill will mean that these government and non-government institutions can be part of the scheme into the future.


The scheme will provide survivors with three elements of redress, comprising:


a monetary payment of up to $150,000;


access to counselling or psychological services; and


a personal response from the responsible institutions.


The scheme will adopt a survivor-focused and trauma-informed approach; access to redress will be simple, and support will be available throughout the application and acceptance processes.


The scheme is not intended to replace legal avenues to seek justice. It is intended to provide a survivor with a means to access a sense of justice, through monetary redress and through restorative supports.


It is intended to be faster, simpler and less distressing for survivors and to provide governments and institutions with the means to deliver justice to their survivors.


We consulted with, and listened to, a broad range of stakeholders in developing the scheme and this bill.


The bill aligns with the views of the Independent Advisory Council on Redress, which included many survivor groups, as well as the views of jurisdictions and non-government institutions.


Under this bill, redress will be available for survivors of child sexual abuse that occurred in Commonwealth and any participating state or territory government or non-government institutions.


For the Commonwealth, this includes situations where the minors were employed and where the Commonwealth delivered state functions in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory prior to self-government.


Should the bill pass, the scheme will commence accepting applications from survivors of institutional child sexual abuse for which the Commonwealth and other participating governments and institutions are responsible from 1 July 2018.


The scheme will run for 10 years, with all applications to be finalised by 30 June 2028. The scheme can be extended if there is a need to do so.


For a person to be eligible for redress they must have suffered sexual abuse where a participating institution is responsible and it occurred when the person was a child before the scheme's commencement on 1 July 2018.


A person must also be an Australian citizen or permanent resident at the time they apply for redress, although it will be possible to deem additional classes of people eligible for redress.


While a person must have suffered sexual abuse to be eligible, the scheme will also acknowledge related non-sexual abuse, for example physical abuse. Sexual abuse rarely occurs in isolation and it is important to deal with the whole of the survivor's experience.


Applications for redress under the scheme are limited to one application per survivor, whether or not that person suffered sexual abuse in more than one institution.


This will ensure that survivors will only need to complete one form to cover all instances of child sexual abuse experienced in institutional contexts during their childhood, something the royal commission recommended to achieve equal or fair treatment between survivors.


Survivors providing the story of their experience in full will ensure the scheme can consider the totality of their experience.


In order to maintain integrity and public confidence in the scheme, there will be some limitations for people who have committed the most serious of crimes, such as homicide.


However, to ensure the scheme retains flexibility and is able to meet prevailing community standards, there will be a special assessment of applicants with serious criminal convictions.


If a person is convicted of an offence which received a custodial sentence of five or more years, the operator may determine that the person is entitled to redress if providing redress to the person would not bring the scheme into disrepute or adversely affect public confidence in the scheme.


When making this determination, the operator must take into account any relevant information such as advice given by relevant attorneys-general and the nature of the offence.


People will not be able to make an application for redress if they are in jail. However, the operator will have power to provide exemptions.


This restriction is necessary as the scheme will not be able to deliver many aspects of the scheme to incarcerated survivors.


People must be 18 years of age before the scheme sunset day to make an application for redress under the scheme. If a child who will turn 18 years of age before the scheme sunset day makes an application for redress, there will be a special assessment process.


For those eligible survivors, the amount of the monetary payment will be determined by looking closely at the circumstances of each person and applying consistent criteria. The maximum amount of redress payment available under the scheme will be $150,000.


The expected average payment will be around $76,000—$11,000 higher than that estimated by the royal commission.


The payment will not reduce the income support payments of survivors, will not be divisible property for bankruptcy and will be exempt from Commonwealth debt recovery.


A legislative instrument that details the different tiers of payments and how they work together will be publicly available and declared as an instrument to the legislation.


Eligible survivors will be provided with access to counselling or psychological services in addition to the assistance already provided by the Commonwealth through Medicare.


Depending on the residence of a survivor, they will receive either a lump sum payment to access counselling and psychological services privately, or will be given access to state or territory based services. States and territories will elect for survivors residing in their jurisdiction to either receive the lump sum payment or whether they will deliver counselling and psychological services to those survivors. Survivors residing outside Australia will receive the lump sum payment.


Responsible participating institutions will be liable for the same amount to support the delivery of counselling and psychological services. This will either be paid directly to the survivor or to the applicable jurisdiction delivering services to survivors.


These services are in addition to the redress support services and legal support services that will be available to applicants to the scheme.


Survivors will also have the opportunity to receive a direct personal response from the participating institution or institutions responsible for the abuse. A direct personal response is a statement of acknowledgement, regret or apology and will be delivered to survivors by the relevant participating institution after the survivor has accepted the offer of redress.


The response may be delivered through a range of mechanisms including a face-to-face meeting with an appropriate representative of the institution or through written engagement with the survivor.


The direct personal response will give the survivor the chance to be acknowledged and tell their personal story of what they experienced and how it has impacted them.


The aim of the redress scheme is to provide an avenue for survivors of child sexual abuse who have not been able to pursue, or have not been successful in pursuing, their common-law rights in order to obtain compensation for the damage and loss they have suffered.


Many survivors cannot successfully pursue their common-law rights because they do not have access to the necessary evidence, or because going through litigation processes would be overly traumatic for them.


Before a survivor receives redress, the survivor must accept their offer by signing an acceptance document. Accepting an offer of redress has the effect of releasing the responsible participating institution or institutions, and their associates and officials, from any future liability for all instances of sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse of the person within the scope of the scheme.


This means that the survivor cannot bring or continue any civil claim against the responsible participating institution or institutions, and their associates and officials, in relation to the specific abuse once they accept the offer of redress.


The release will not release the perpetrators of abuse themselves, provide release in relation to any other abuse outside the scope of the scheme, nor preclude any criminal liabilities of the institution or alleged perpetrator.


The release from civil liability is an important incentive for institutions as without it, institutions may be required to pay compensation through civil litigation in addition to providing redress under the scheme. It will ensure greater coverage for survivors.


Any relevant prior payments made by participating institutions in relation to the abuse for which an institution is responsible will be adjusted to acknowledge inflation and then will be subtracted from the redress payment.


In essence, these survivors would receive a 'top-up' payment. If a survivor's monetary payment is reduced to nil as a result of past redress payments, they will still be entitled to access counselling and psychological services and the direct personal response under the scheme.


The rules will also specify that where a court has previously ordered a participating institution to pay a person compensation or damages for abuse, then that person will not be eligible under the scheme for that abuse.


Where a survivor has been successful in civil litigation, a court has already applied the higher legal liability test of the 'balance of probabilities' and found that the institution is liable to pay the survivor damages.


A survivor can still apply to the scheme for any other abuse they have experienced.


The scheme is based on the principle of 'responsible entity pays', a key recommendation of the royal commission. A participating responsible institution will be expected to pay for redress for their survivors, along with a proportionate share of the administration costs of the scheme. This is the best way to ensure fairness and justice for survivors.


For a participating institution to be responsible, the abuse must have occurred in circumstances where the institution was primarily or equally responsible for the abuser having contact with the person.


The scheme will have agreed categories of cases where responsible governments will share responsibility with an institution, as set out in the national redress scheme rules.


If a case falls into an agreed category, the relevant government will automatically be determined to be equally responsible and therefore liable for redress.


Participating governments have agreed to be responsible where abuse occurs in connection with a non-government institution, the state or territory government had parental responsibility of the child or the child was a state ward, and was responsible for the placement of the child in that institution.


In cases where a government is determined to be equally responsible, they may be determined to be the funder of last resort. This will only occur when the other equally responsible institution is a defunct non-government institution.


Where a funder-of-last-resort arrangement exists, the government that shares responsibility will pay the full amount of redress. The purpose of the funder-of-last-resort policy is to pick up shortfalls in funding where an institution no longer exists. It is not intended to pick up liability for institutions that have the capacity to opt in and choose not to.


In cases where a person has suffered multiple cases of child sexual abuse which occurred across multiple institutions, the scheme operator will decide what was the responsible institution in each case. Each responsible institution will contribute a share of the redress for the survivor. The redress contribution will be apportioned in accordance with the severity and impact of each instance of abuse.


The scheme will facilitate flexible arrangements to support the different structures of institutions opting in to the scheme. This is necessary as many institutions we think of as one institution can actually consist of different institutions and entities. It is in the interest of survivors for all of these institutions to opt in and participate as a single group. This will allow larger institutions to provide the funding for their lower level institutions that may not have their own financial sources to cover redress.


The scheme will allow two or more institutions to form a participating group, who will be 'associates' of one another. To be able to form a participating group, associates must have a sufficient connection with each other, appoint a representative, and have that representative be jointly and severally liable with each associate for funding contributions.


The bill includes provisions for the use and disclosure of information under the scheme. Information-sharing protocols have been balanced against the need for the scheme to have transparency and flexibility, with a survivor's rights to privacy and the need to protect children against future abuse. This will ensure all aspects of the scheme's ability to share and gather information is underpinned by law.


Information received by the scheme will be confidential and will not be able to be further disclosed or used for an unspecified purpose. Participating institutions will also be restricted in the ways that they can use protected information provided to them from the scheme operator. Misuse or unauthorised disclosure of scheme information may constitute an offence under legislation, with appropriate jail time or fines.


To support the scheme, the government has committed $52.1 million over three years to establish redress support services to assist survivors. Redress support services will be available to all applicants, including specialised support for Indigenous people, people with disability, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.


Support services will be available nationally, and use face-to-face, telephone, online and outreach services to ensure coverage.


The scheme will appoint experienced, independent assessors, known as independent decision-makers. Independent decision-makers will provide advice to the scheme operator on applications made to the scheme, and will not report or be answerable to government.


Independent decision-makers will be supported in their decision-making by a dedicated redress recommendation team.


In line with feedback from institutions, survivors and the Independent Advisory Council on Redress following the royal commission's recommendation, the scheme will provide survivors with access to independent and impartial internal review without subjecting them to potential retraumatisation.


The scheme will be reviewed after the second and eighth anniversaries of the commencement of the scheme to provide recommendations on all aspects of the future operation of the scheme. 


Since taking on the responsibilities of Minister for Social Services, I've had the opportunity to meet with survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.


Hearing their compelling testimony, their stories, has made me more determined than ever to make this bill a reality.


It has meant that the passage of this bill has been my number one priority since I became minister.


As a nation, we owe the survivors who fought so hard and so long for truth to pass this bill and have the scheme operational by 1 July this year.


Debate adjourned.

 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (10:17):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Capability Facilities Project.


The Department of Defence is proposing to refurbish and construct new mask-testing facilities as well as logistical storage facilities that will support chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence training and capability at 14 locations across Australia. The 2016 defence white paper identifies the importance of providing Defence with enhanced domestic security capabilities, including its chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence capability, to help respond to the threat of complex terrorist attacks within Australia.


The project is expected to generate short-term employment opportunities predominantly in the building, construction and labour markets in each of the relevant locations. The project is also expected to provide opportunities for suppliers in the manufacture and distribution of construction materials and equipment. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $16.7 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs, management and design fees, contingencies and escalation allowance. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to be completed by late 2019.


I commend the motion to the House.

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (10:20):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled ASIO's questioning and detention powers: review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HASTIE:
  by leave—I am pleased to present the committee's report for its review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.


Division 3 of part III allows ASIO, upon obtaining either a questioning warrant or a questioning and detention warrant, to question a person under compulsion in order to obtain intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence.


I'll provide some background. ASIO's questioning and detention powers were enacted in July 2003 following lengthy debate in the parliament in 2002 and 2003. Their stated objective at the time was to strengthen Australia's counterterrorism capabilities.


The special powers were reviewed by the then Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in 2005 prior to their original sunset date of July 2006, and by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor in 2012 and 2016.


The powers are currently due to sunset on 7 September 2018.


The committee commenced this review in February 2017.


In undertaking the review, the committee examined ASIO's ongoing need for a compulsory questioning power and concluded, on the basis of evidence received, that it is appropriate that ASIO retain this power.


On the question of detention, however, the committee has recommended that the provisions of the ASIO Act relating to questioning and detention warrants be repealed.


In reaching this view, the committee considered evidence about the constitutional and human rights implications of detention. It also noted the availability of a range of law enforcement mechanisms that did not exist in 2003. The committee concluded, on balance, that the current provisions are no longer the appropriate response to the threat of terrorism.


While the committee has recommended that detention warrants be repealed, it supports, in principle, an alternative apprehension framework that ensures attendance at questioning, prevents contact with others, and prevents the destruction of information.


Further, it became apparent to the committee that the existing legislation has become limited in its utility.


The committee has therefore recommended that the government develop legislation for a reformed ASIO compulsory questioning power, and has made a series of findings that are intended to guide development of this legislation.


In reaching its views, the committee considered ASIO's preferred model together with the recommendation of former INSLM, the Hon. Roger Gyles, that a model based on that contained within the Australian Crime Commission Act be adopted.


The committee concluded that while there are many benefits to the Crime Commission framework, wholesale adoption of this model would see the removal of some existing safeguards. The committee also noted that ASIO has advocated for provisions that are, in the committee's view, strong and fairer than equivalent provisions under the Crime Commission Act.


Ultimately, the committee concluded that the existing framework should be modified, retaining some important safeguards and mirroring Crime Commission Act provisions where appropriate.


I will briefly summarise the committee's key findings.


First, the committee considers it appropriate that questioning warrants be authorised by the Attorney-General, as is the case for ASIO's other special powers.


Second, as I mentioned earlier, the committee supports, in principle, an alternative apprehension framework. However, an apprehension or compulsory attendance power should be limited to the power to compel the subject of a warrant to attend questioning. Any ongoing detention power must be subject to the discretion of the courts.


The committee also supports new provisions that would enable emergency authorisations, subject to certain conditions.


In relation to the examiner or prescribed authority, the committee sees merit in the creation of a permanent statutory examiner based on that in the Crime Commission Act.


The committee also finds that provision for the questioning of minors in relation to terrorism may be necessary, however additional oversight and safeguards are essential. Importantly, any compulsory questioning of a minor must be limited to those who are themselves the subject of investigation.


The committee considers access to lawyers should be facilitated in line with the Crime Commission model, and there should be a mechanism to enable a person to contact specified persons.


Importantly, all existing accountability arrangements in the ASIO Act and Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act should be retained.


On the question of whether the scope of questioning under a compulsory questioning warrant should be extended beyond terrorism offences, the committee has not stated a view. This is a matter that the government should consider in the development of legislation.


Finally, the committee considers that any proposed legislation should include an appropriate sunset clause and that this committee should conduct a further review prior to that date.


Given the impending sunset date of 7 September 2018, the committee has made the final recommendation that the ASIO Act be amended to extend the sunset provision by 12 months, to 7 September 2019. This should ensure that there is sufficient time for legislation to be developed and reviewed.


I commend the report to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:26):  As the very proud and privileged member for Canberra, I am pleased to speak on the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017 today. When the average Australian thinks about this city's development, the following names easily come to mind: Charles Scrivener, Walter Burley Griffin, King O'Malley, Lady Denman and Sir Robert Menzies. But there are very few who know the story of how the National Capital Authority, responsible for the planning and management of Commonwealth land in the Australian Capital Territory, actually came about and why it has the responsibilities it has.


Following the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901 and the eventual selection of the ACT to accommodate a capital city in 1908, surveyor Charles Scrivener was responsible for finding the city's specific site. Scrivener's selection of location, where Canberra is today, was guided by instructions to assess sites from 'a scenic standpoint, with a view to securing the picturesque and with the object of beautification'. With emphasis placed on the picturesque, it affirmed that the future capital's landscaping and aesthetics would be just as important as its functionality. It's therefore no surprise that these elements became the essence, the central theme, of Walter Burley Griffin's design for our beautiful nation's capital, our wonderful city of Canberra.


Burley Griffin's own design was strongly influenced by the design for Washington DC: Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1792 design. L'Enfant's design included wide, tree lined avenues that would visually connect significant topographical sites over the city. This became an emerging theme within the new city of Canberra, with Burley Griffin's design combining aspects, including the bush, which is very much part of our national identity and very much part of our Canberra identity. It is the bush capital. It's part of our DNA. We take great pride in the fact that we have big, beautiful skies, big, beautiful sunsets and views of the Brindabellas—although the Brindabellas can get a bit cool in winter when they're snow capped. We love our bush capital and we love that it's part of our national capital identity and our Canberra's identity. There are also the wide, tree lined avenues.


Burley Griffin's design for Canberra became the cornerstone for planning and land management decisions, starting with the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in the early 1920s. The committee proposed developing the Burley Griffin plan in three stages: stage 1 would see the transfer of parliament and key administrative staff from Sydney and Melbourne to Canberra—ironically, it took until the 1990s for that to finally happen, and those opposite are doing their level best to deconstruct that; stage 2 would include the construction of railways in addition to other key buildings; and stage 3 would create character and permanence in the capital. While the first two stages were not achieved by the committee, the garden city aspects of Canberra were developed. 


Soon after, the Federal Capital Commission was formed to construct and administer Canberra from 1925. In its first two years, the commission oversaw the completion of Old Parliament House; the Lodge; the beautiful Albert Hall; the Institute of Anatomy, which is now home to the National Film and Sound Archive; the Australian Forestry School; and Mount Stromlo Observatory. With the onset of the Great Depression, the commission was disbanded, and there was no central planning for Canberra's development until the creation of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee in 1938. The committee was intended to oversee the development of Canberra, ensure the implementation of the Burley Griffin plan and maintain the high aesthetics and high architectural standards worthy of the national capital. 


After almost 20 years, a Senate select committee inquired into Canberra's development and replaced the National Capital Planning and Development Committee with the National Development Capital Commission. The commission was granted significant funding and authority to complete the establishment of Canberra as the seat of government and was led by none other than the founder of the modern Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies. Sir Robert Menzies took some time to warm to the idea of Canberra as a worthy national capital. He said:


I cannot honestly say that I liked Canberra very much; it was to me a place of exile; but I soon began to realise that the decision had been taken, that Canberra was and would continue to be the capital of the nation, and that it was therefore imperative to make it a worthy capital; something that the Australian people would come to admire and respect; something that would be a focal point for national pride and sentiment. Once I had converted myself to this faith, I became an apostle.


That was Sir Robert Menzies. Yet Sir Robert Menzies, through a series of bold and ambitious decisions, established Canberra as the thriving city we know it as today. Despite the fact he had that original reservation about Canberra, he became an apostle. He was converted to the faith that is our national capital—and it is a great national capital. He was also a very, very strong advocate of a consolidated Public Service here in the nation's capital, here in Canberra. I am sending this message to those opposite, particularly given that, as we heard on budget night, a number of government agencies and jobs are once again moving out of Canberra, our nation's capital. I again remind them of the Sir Robert Menzies's vision. I remind them to ensure that that legacy is upheld and that we have a consolidated Public Service here in the nation's capital, which was established to be the seat of democracy, and to have those servants of democracy based here in Canberra. 


What did we get from the budget this week? We got more government agencies moving out of Canberra. The Inland Rail unit will be going to Toowoomba, Dubbo and Wodonga. The Indian Ocean Territories area of the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities is going to Perth. The Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations is going to Darwin. The Unique Student Identifier Registrar is going to Adelaide. There are a range of government agencies—that's not the full list—moving out of Canberra and into other parts of Australia. Again, I remind those opposite that, despite the Menzies vision, only 38 per cent of the Public Service is actually based here in Canberra. The rest of it is scattered throughout Australia, despite Sir Robert Menzies's vision to consolidate the Public Service here. This is the centre of policy development, and only 38 per cent of the Public Service is based here. I ask those opposite: how much more of the Public Service do you want to move out of Canberra, despite the fact that it was actually established to be the nation's capital and the seat of democracy? How much more do you want to decimate our nation's capital? 


We saw what happened with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. What a debacle, what a complete and utter debacle—that blatant and shameless relocation from Canberra of 200-plus people to Armidale to essentially shore up the election of the former Deputy Prime Minister. It was a blatant and shameless pork barrel. The government commissioned an independent review into it. What did the independent review find? It found that it was all cost and no benefit. Despite that independent review and despite the Senate inquiry, the government still went ahead with this absolutely ludicrous decision, and it's been a complete and utter disaster.


We've seen brain drain of epic proportions. We've seen hundreds of years of expertise and skill leave the agency. It's gone and it won't be coming back. We've seen APVMA approvals for agricultural pesticides plummet. We've seen industry associations completely opposed to it. We've seen public servants moving to Armidale to work from McDonald's, because there is no actual facility for them to work from. They had this thought bubble based on no evidence that it was going to work, and they didn't even have a facility for the people who went there. You can imagine what's happening in the APVMA: people are leaving in droves, there is a brain drain that will be very hard to replace for many, many years, approvals are plummeting, industry is opposed to it and people are working from McDonald's because there is no facility to work in. This is the government's vision for the agricultural industry in this country.


I remind those who are listening and those opposite that it was the then Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance who ordered this relocation, and the Deputy Prime Minister was, at that stage, the minister for agriculture. What sort of minister for agriculture decimates his own industry? That's what we've seen from those opposite. Their vision continues; the thought bubble continues. What is the cost-benefit analysis on moving these agencies and these jobs from Canberra to the regions? Where is the cost-benefit analysis? I haven't seen any cost-benefit analysis and I haven't heard of any. It was all news to me when I heard it on Tuesday night. I remind those opposite of Menzies' vision for this city, for this national capital. It was about consolidating the Public Service here, and it took a very, very long time. Some would argue that the project is still going, in that it took until the 1990s for DSD to finally come up here from Victoria Barracks. The project is still going on, and it's being deconstructed by those opposite, with this decentralisation nonsense.


I go back to the bill at hand. In terms of this bill, we're talking about the planning and land management of the Australian Capital Territory, our nation's capital. We saw those opposite do their level best to completely deconstruct Menzies' vision. In the budget we saw next to zero investment in infrastructure. We saw further cuts—another 3,500 cuts to the Public Service, many of them here in the ACT—further attacks on our national institutions and, as I said mentioned before, decentralisation.


The NCDC was disbanded in 1989, after the ACT was granted self-government, and the NCA was established. Since self-government, the NCA has shared responsibility for planning and managing land with the ACT government. The NCA is responsible for managing the Commonwealth's interest in the ACT, which is generally the tracts of land and other major assets identified as being on Commonwealth land or in nationally important areas. The ACT government is responsible for day-to-day planning decisions affecting the majority of the Territory. The existing arrangements do not provide decision-making within the NCA with sufficient oversight and transparency, nor do they provide the necessary support for the minister.


The proposed changes in this bill will update the governance arrangements of the NCA. The proposed amendment makes the authority the accountable authority, enabling it to give directions to the chief executive and allowing it to become involved in NCA operations. The amendment clarifies the relationship between the authority and the chief executive in a similar way to other agencies, such as the Organ and Tissue Authority. In this case, the NCA's chief executive remains the head of the entity for the purposes of the Public Service Act, but the authority for persons appointed by the Governor-General would become the accountable authority for the purposes of the act. These amendments also clarify the minister's existing powers by including 'must comply' provisions. These provisions oblige the authority to comply with the ministerial directive, which must be general in nature and not specific to a matter under the authority's consideration.


With the improved governance arrangements, we will see an improvement in terms of the transparency and the accountability of the NCA. That's vitally important, particularly for the people of Canberra. I've recently had a number of people from the electorate contact me about some changes to draft amendment 89, which is in the Deakin Forrest Residential Precinct. Despite the fact the NCA was engaged in an active conversation with a number of these residents in regard to changes to their planning plans and despite the fact that these planning plans were open for consultation, the NCA then sort of clamped down on making any further decisions, and these people, who were under the impression they were allowed to do a particular planning change, were then advised they couldn't do it, despite having engaged openly with the NCA for a very long time and despite the fact that the NCA had made that decision when the broader consultation process was still open. I encourage the NCA to use this opportunity, to use the changes from this bill, to actively engage in open consultation and not come to decisions on particular issues when they are still open to consultation.


Finally, I thank the NCA for the work it's done in the diplomatic enclave with 'use it or lose it'. It's been terrific work in terms of getting movement and development in the diplomatic enclave here.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:26):  As the very proud and privileged member for Canberra, I am pleased to speak on the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017 today. When the average Australian thinks about this city's development, the following names easily come to mind: Charles Scrivener, Walter Burley Griffin, King O'Malley, Lady Denman and Sir Robert Menzies. But there are very few who know the story of how the National Capital Authority, responsible for the planning and management of Commonwealth land in the Australian Capital Territory, actually came about and why it has the responsibilities it has.


Following the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901 and the eventual selection of the ACT to accommodate a capital city in 1908, surveyor Charles Scrivener was responsible for finding the city's specific site. Scrivener's selection of location, where Canberra is today, was guided by instructions to assess sites from 'a scenic standpoint, with a view to securing the picturesque and with the object of beautification'. With emphasis placed on the picturesque, it affirmed that the future capital's landscaping and aesthetics would be just as important as its functionality. It's therefore no surprise that these elements became the essence, the central theme, of Walter Burley Griffin's design for our beautiful nation's capital, our wonderful city of Canberra.


Burley Griffin's own design was strongly influenced by the design for Washington DC: Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1792 design. L'Enfant's design included wide, tree lined avenues that would visually connect significant topographical sites over the city. This became an emerging theme within the new city of Canberra, with Burley Griffin's design combining aspects, including the bush, which is very much part of our national identity and very much part of our Canberra identity. It is the bush capital. It's part of our DNA. We take great pride in the fact that we have big, beautiful skies, big, beautiful sunsets and views of the Brindabellas—although the Brindabellas can get a bit cool in winter when they're snow capped. We love our bush capital and we love that it's part of our national capital identity and our Canberra's identity. There are also the wide, tree lined avenues.


Burley Griffin's design for Canberra became the cornerstone for planning and land management decisions, starting with the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in the early 1920s. The committee proposed developing the Burley Griffin plan in three stages: stage 1 would see the transfer of parliament and key administrative staff from Sydney and Melbourne to Canberra—ironically, it took until the 1990s for that to finally happen, and those opposite are doing their level best to deconstruct that; stage 2 would include the construction of railways in addition to other key buildings; and stage 3 would create character and permanence in the capital. While the first two stages were not achieved by the committee, the garden city aspects of Canberra were developed. 


Soon after, the Federal Capital Commission was formed to construct and administer Canberra from 1925. In its first two years, the commission oversaw the completion of Old Parliament House; the Lodge; the beautiful Albert Hall; the Institute of Anatomy, which is now home to the National Film and Sound Archive; the Australian Forestry School; and Mount Stromlo Observatory. With the onset of the Great Depression, the commission was disbanded, and there was no central planning for Canberra's development until the creation of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee in 1938. The committee was intended to oversee the development of Canberra, ensure the implementation of the Burley Griffin plan and maintain the high aesthetics and high architectural standards worthy of the national capital. 


After almost 20 years, a Senate select committee inquired into Canberra's development and replaced the National Capital Planning and Development Committee with the National Development Capital Commission. The commission was granted significant funding and authority to complete the establishment of Canberra as the seat of government and was led by none other than the founder of the modern Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies. Sir Robert Menzies took some time to warm to the idea of Canberra as a worthy national capital. He said:


I cannot honestly say that I liked Canberra very much; it was to me a place of exile; but I soon began to realise that the decision had been taken, that Canberra was and would continue to be the capital of the nation, and that it was therefore imperative to make it a worthy capital; something that the Australian people would come to admire and respect; something that would be a focal point for national pride and sentiment. Once I had converted myself to this faith, I became an apostle.


That was Sir Robert Menzies. Yet Sir Robert Menzies, through a series of bold and ambitious decisions, established Canberra as the thriving city we know it as today. Despite the fact he had that original reservation about Canberra, he became an apostle. He was converted to the faith that is our national capital—and it is a great national capital. He was also a very, very strong advocate of a consolidated Public Service here in the nation's capital, here in Canberra. I am sending this message to those opposite, particularly given that, as we heard on budget night, a number of government agencies and jobs are once again moving out of Canberra, our nation's capital. I again remind them of the Sir Robert Menzies's vision.

The Unique Student Identifier Registrar is going to Adelaide. There are a range of government agencies—that's not the full list—moving out of Canberra and into other parts of Australia. Again, I remind those opposite that, despite the Menzies vision, only 38 per cent of the Public Service is actually based here in Canberra. The rest of it is scattered throughout Australia, despite Sir Robert Menzies's vision to consolidate the Public Service here. This is the centre of policy development, and only 38 per cent of the Public Service is based here. I ask those opposite: how much more of the Public Service do you want to move out of Canberra, despite the fact that it was actually established to be the nation's capital and the seat of democracy? How much more do you want to decimate our nation's capital?

The ACT government is responsible for day-to-day planning decisions affecting the majority of the Territory. The existing arrangements do not provide decision-making within the NCA with sufficient oversight and transparency, nor do they provide the necessary support for the minister.


The proposed changes in this bill will update the governance arrangements of the NCA. The proposed amendment makes the authority the accountable authority, enabling it to give directions to the chief executive and allowing it to become involved in NCA operations. The amendment clarifies the relationship between the authority and the chief executive in a similar way to other agencies, such as the Organ and Tissue Authority. In this case, the NCA's chief executive remains the head of the entity for the purposes of the Public Service Act, but the authority for persons appointed by the Governor-General would become the accountable authority for the purposes of the act. These amendments also clarify the minister's existing powers by including 'must comply' provisions. These provisions oblige the authority to comply with the ministerial directive, which must be general in nature and not specific to a matter under the authority's consideration.


With the improved governance arrangements, we will see an improvement in terms of the transparency and the accountability of the NCA. That's vitally important, particularly for the people of Canberra.

I encourage the NCA to use this opportunity, to use the changes from this bill, to actively engage in open consultation and not come to decisions on particular issues when they are still open to consultation.


Finally, I thank the NCA for the work it's done in the diplomatic enclave with 'use it or lose it'. It's been terrific work in terms of getting movement and development in the diplomatic enclave here.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:29):  I rise to recognise the National Compact on Permanent Migration that was recently signed by a wide range of Australian trade unions, businesses and civil society groups. The diverse signatories to this compact recognise:


… that Australia's permanent migration program is essential to Australian society and our economy and do not support any reduction to the scheme. … Our permanent migration program has been central to Australia's economic and social development and will be critical to Australia's future as a productive and globally integrated economy and society.


It then offers 10 sensible principles for maintaining Australia's immigration program. I agree with the signatories. Australia is an immigrant nation. Indeed, if you are not an Indigenous Australian, there is nothing more Australian than being a migrant. We have seen in this week's budget that we live in an era of ideological cleavage. I am proud of the stand Labor is taking on fighting inequality and standing up for inclusion in this ideological debate. But it is important too that there are some areas that are so fundamental to our national identity and our national interests that all sides of politics are able to unite and speak with one voice.


Congratulations to the Migration Council, the ACTU, United Voice, the Australian Industry Group, ACOSS, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia and the Settlement Council of Australia. Well done on taking a stand. This compact is even more important in light of media reports today that Senator Hanson is demanding cuts to our immigration program in exchange for her support for the Turnbull government's budget. It is important that mainstream Australia unites to reject the extremists that seek to attack the foundation of Australian identity and seek to use immigration to divide us. (Time expired)

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (15:13):  Mr Speaker, on indulgence—we acknowledge and honour the two Vietnam veterans who are joining us today—Bill McLellan, who has joined us with his wife, Kathy, and Harry Northwood, who has joined us with his wife, Marietta—who served in 1RAR Task Force, and, 50 years ago, were engaged in Australia's longest and most costly battle of the Vietnam War at Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral. The Australian Task Force commander called those battles some of the heaviest fighting that the Task Force ever undertook.


Twenty-six Australians made the supreme sacrifice in 3½ weeks at Coral and Balmoral. A hundred Australians were wounded. Five New Zealanders and five American soldiers were also wounded. At least 270 of the Vietnamese forces were killed, although we'll never know, of course, the true figure.


The battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral are not widely known in Australia, yet they are among the most important of our country's long commitment to the war in Vietnam. We remember all of those who served in those battles of Coral and Balmoral. We remember all of the Australians who served in Vietnam. We honour all of the Australians who have served, to fight and die to secure the freedoms we enjoy in this parliament. It is no accident that we look across the lake at the Australian War Memorial that honours the sacrifice of those men and women. Over 100,000 through all the generations have made the supreme sacrifice to keep us free, and their descendants are doing so today.


On Sunday there will be a memorial service at the Vietnam Forces National Memorial to honour the veterans of the battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral. At that service I know that all will remember that the best way to honour the veterans, whether of the Vietnam War or of a century ago in the trenches of Flanders—the best way to honour those men and women who fought, served and died—is to support the service men and women, the veterans and their families of today.

 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:15):  On indulgence, I want to join the Prime Minister in welcoming Bill and Kathy McLellan and Harry and Marietta Northwood to the House today. In welcoming you we pay tribute to your 26 brothers who never returned home and the 100 who were wounded over this 3½-week battle. Indeed, we also pay tribute to the 60,000 Australians who served in the Vietnam conflict. Many of the nashos were barely 20 and the regulars often enlisted at 19. 


We also acknowledge that all too often in those weeks and months after young Australians had fought for their lives many found themselves back here in Australia. The conflict you fought in was hard to imagine, but it's hard to imagine also coming back here, being demobilised, handing back your rifle and your pay book, and being plunged straight back into civilian life, with no counselling, no rehabilitation and no attempt to reconcile what you had endured in the realities of war with the realities of civilian life. It is the hard truth as we approach the memorial this weekend that too many Australians were sent into jungle dark and they were shunned on their return.


These words of a serviceman are inscribed on the Vietnam memorial, not very far from where we are here now: 'I don't seem to have many friends since I came home. If you weren't there—you can't understand.' You remind us today, gentlemen, that not only did we fail to understand then but, with a few noble exceptions, we failed to try. You remind us, gentlemen, that for too long Australia closed its eyes and its heart to our Vietnam veterans. Thank you, Bill, Harry and all those who served in that conflict. We renew our most sacred promise: lest we forget.

 (15:17):  I have a short statement about some housekeeping matters for this evening with respect to the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech. As I outlined on Tuesday, the usual courtesies of course apply to the Leader of the Opposition's speech, as they did with the Treasurer's. As with last year, I think the House conducted itself well on Tuesday evening. Again, with respect to this evening, as with all proceedings, the Leader of the Opposition will have the call and is entitled to speak without interruption. Again, if I'm required to make use of standing order 94(a), it will be in accordance with the same arrangements, where it will be by written note and the required member will need to leave the chamber immediately.


I have just one other matter. This is some experience that I've had over the last few budget speeches. Both the Clerk and I sometimes get notes or queries right near the end of the speech where the time on the clock has expired. I want to address this in advance for members. Standing order 1 provides that there is no time limit at all for the Treasurer's speech or the Leader of the Opposition's speech. In fact, they are the only speeches where there is no time limit. The clock is there merely for guidance for each of the speakers. I just want to point that out in the nicest possible way, because in the last few years I've had a few queries and I wouldn't want to point it out on budget night or during the Leader of the Opposition's speech. I thank the House.

The SPEAKER
 (15:20):  I have received a letter from the honourable member for Sydney, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: 


The Government making it even harder for Australians to get secure, well-paying jobs because of its cuts to TAFE, skills and apprenticeships.


I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:20):  I have this little quote up on the wall of my office, and I printed it off for a few of my staff as well. It's a quote from John Dewey, and he said:


What the best and wisest parent wants for his own child, that must the community want for all of its children.


I've loved that quote for many years because I think it really does tell us what our responsibility as members of parliament is when we're planning for, investing in and making decisions about what kind of society we want, what our budget priorities should be and what our education system should look like. I think about what my parents wanted for me. My parents both left school very early. Their education was disrupted by the Second World War. They were intelligent people who never had the opportunity that I and my brothers had to go to university. We were the first of our family—the first generation—to go to university. I also think about the parents that I meet in my travels around the country. Every single one of them will tell you what they want for their kids is that they get a great education so that they can have secure work in the future. 


Labor are proud of our investment in universities and the big changes we made with the demand-driven system—unravelled by those opposite—but we have always seen a TAFE education as equally important, equally valuable and equally valid. We know that, in the next few years, nine out of 10 jobs created in our economy will need either a university education or a TAFE education, and we want our university system and our TAFE system to be strong, equal partners in educating not only young Australians but also those Australians who are going back to study after time out of the workforce or because the jobs that they trained for 10, 20 and 30 years ago don't exist anymore. There are new and different jobs that will require new and different skills. 


We want to see a strong TAFE system, but is that what we've seen from those opposite? Absolutely not. We've now seen more than $3 billion cut from TAFE and training in this country. We've seen programs like the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program cut; the Productive Ageing through Community Education program cut; the Apprentice to Business Owner Program cut; the Workplace English Language and Literacy program—you'd think that would be pretty important—cut; and the National Partnership Agreement on Training Places for Single and Teenage Parents cut. How can we build the workforce of the future when we're cutting billions from our training programs? This year, you'd think they'd have taken the opportunity in this election-focused budget to actually do something to reverse some of these cuts. No, they've cut another $270 million from our TAFE system. The Skilling Australians Fund that was announced in last year's budget was set to cost $1.47 billion over four years. Guess what it shows up as in this year's budget? $1.2 billion. If anyone opposite can explain to me why there is $270 million less for TAFE and apprenticeships and training in this fund alone then I'd love to hear it.


We know that this fund is likely to see its funding fall even further in coming years. And, as I said, that comes on top of years of cuts from those opposite. We actually have 140,000 fewer apprentices today than when those opposite came to power. They talk about skills shortages and about why they have to have temporary skilled migration. After five years, we've got 140,000 fewer apprentices, and right across the country we've seen Liberal state governments closing TAFE campuses. TAFE campuses closed in Dapto, Petersham West and Crows Nest due to the New South Wales Liberals, in Ithaca in Queensland, in Newport in Victoria—the list is very long. Courses have been scaled back and fees have increased, and I tell you what: employers are noticing it.


When you ask employers what's happening with TAFE and training in Australia today, they will tell you that they are finding it harder to place their workers in appropriate courses. They are dissatisfied, particularly in regional and rural areas, with the level of support and the range of training that are available for their staff. Investment in infrastructure, so important in vocational education, has also declined. You can't learn a vocation on the equipment that people were using a generation ago or two generations ago. We have to keep our facilities in TAFE up to date so that people are learning on the same equipment that the industry is using in the workplace. The hours of training delivered by TAFE have fallen by over 30 per cent.


Look at some of the occupations that have been on the skills shortage list for years: bricklayer, carpenter, cook, hairdresser. They've been on that National Skills Needs List for the entire time that those opposite have been in government. How can that be okay? It doesn't take that long to train a cook, to train a hairdresser or to train a bricklayer. If those opposite had started training cooks and bricklayers and hairdressers when they came to government, those occupations wouldn't be on the skills shortage list today.


Labor has a different approach. We say that $2 out of every $3 spent on vocational education by the Commonwealth should go to TAFE because it is TAFE, public TAFE, that should be at the centre of our training system to make sure that we have the quality and that we can deliver to the places that need them most and the people who need them most. We've said that we will provide 10,000 pre-apprentice programs for young people who want to learn a trade and 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who need to retrain. We've said that we'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. We committed last year to reversing the government's cuts. We've said, very importantly, that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects will be filled by Australian apprentices and trainees.


We are prepared to invest in productivity-enhancing infrastructure around the country—the new roads, the new railway lines, the new port facilities, airport upgrades—all of those things that we have committed to in the past; we know that Commonwealth dollars will go to them. Let's make sure that we are seeing apprentices and trainees employed on those projects. I can tell you—I know you know this, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan—it is frustrating that many of the big employers of apprentices in the past just don't do it anymore. You will remember that big companies and big Commonwealth entities—the old Postmaster-General and so on—used to employ hundreds of apprentices, thousands. They don't anymore.


Instead of investing in TAFE, in apprentices, in traineeships and in training the next generation of young Australians and retraining Australians in the workforce today for the jobs of tomorrow, in this budget the government have locked in their previous cuts and they have added to them—a further $270 million cut. It tells you all you need to know about the priorities of those opposite that they can find $80 billion to give to big business—overseas shareholders—but they can't find the money to properly fund TAFE and trainees and apprentices. It tells you all you need to know about those opposite that they can find $17 billion to give to the big banks but they can't find the money to properly fund education and training for young Australians. I am proud to stand up in front of the roomfuls of people I meet when I'm out in our electorates—and in your electorates too, I'll tell you what—and tell them that we will invest in TAFE, in public TAFE, in training and in apprentices, because we know that Australia's economic security depends on it.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2018-05-10,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (15:30):  If Labor is ever returned to government in this country, God help vocational education. They have the most appalling record in vocational education. I am very happy to stand here today and take you through, in detail, what they have done to bring this sector to its knees. Labor's record in vocational education, when in government, was appalling. Between 2011 and 2013, Labor ripped $1.2 billion out of vocational education—$1.2 billion over a two-year period. Nine times between 2011 and 2013 they cut employer incentives to take on an apprentice—$1.2 billion and nine successive cuts over a two-year period. During that time, 2011 to 2013, 190,000 apprentices were lost to industry. During Labor's last year in government alone, they oversaw the single biggest decline in apprenticeship numbers. We lost over 100,000 apprentices-in-training to industry.


During the previous speech I heard it said that some of those apprentices lost to the system would have been trained by now, and that's right—100,000 of those who came out of that system in 2012-13 would have been qualified. They would have been out there in the workforce using their skills, but they had the opportunity ripped away from them—taken away, no chance, their dreams removed. Their opportunity for a worthwhile, fulfilling career in their choice of industry was ripped away by the Labor government, which took $1.2 billion from vocational education.


I think it's actually quite telling to look at who the responsible minister was during that time. From December 2011 to July 2013 the responsible minister was the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. There was a title change to Minister for Workplace Relations from 1 July 2013 to 18 September 2013. The minister responsible for such a significant number of apprentices coming out of the system was the member for Maribyrnong. I would be so embarrassed if I were a member of the Labor Party, sitting in here, understanding that $1.2 billion and the decimation of the vocational education sector in Australia occurred under that watch.


Labor has an absolutely appalling track record in vocational education. In 2012, they negotiated a five-year National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. They negotiated it with the states and territories. It was a $1.75 billion, five-year partnership. Of that, $1.15 billion went to reforms in the sector. Those reforms introduced contestability into the market, so they provided for the competition between TAFE and private providers. They were introduced in the 2012 to 2017 five-year agreement between the Labor government and the states. The reforms that introduced contestability between TAFE and the private providers meant that the market share of TAFEs dropped over that period from 60 per cent to 49 per cent. So, under the five-year agreement negotiated by Labor, the market share of TAFE dropped by 11 per cent—an appalling track record. Of the $1.75 billion that they had in their five-year national partnership agreement with the states, $1.15 billion went to the reforms on contestability, which dropped the market share of TAFEs, and $600 million out of that $1.75 billion went to a direct training outcome. So it was only $600 million over five years, which is clearly not a lot of money.


What we have is the red team opposite contributing $600 million to training outcomes over five years and, over this side, we have the blue team contributing $1.5 billion over five years. Six hundred million dollars or $1.5 billion? I know where I want to be. I want to be supporting vocational education and injecting $1.5 billion into direct training outcomes. Three hundred million dollars of that is on the table this year. It's there to deal with projects and address the decline in apprentice numbers, which we know are there, because they were established back in 2012-13 when we had the biggest single drop in apprentice numbers. We're working with the states and the territories and, quite frankly, there are some states that are ahead of the pack. I can assure you that I am looking forward to continuing some very, very fruitful negotiations with a number of states. I will single out the new Liberal government in South Australia, which have been very quick to come and speak with me about the proposals that they took to the election—proposals that they developed earlier this year, and towards the end of last year, I believe, to address the significant shortfall that they have, as an incoming government, in the number of apprentices in training. I am very confident that we will be reaching agreement with South Australia in the very near future. The Commonwealth and South Australia will work together to make sure that we are addressing the skills needs in South Australia.


Some states have been less interested in talking about how to address skills needs. If I look at what's happened in Victoria, particularly over the last few years, I can see that there has been a significant drop in the funding contribution from the Victorian state government to vocational education. Over a five-year period, their funding for vocational education has reduced by over 50 per cent. So the state government in Victoria dropped their funding. If we look at the last three years alone—effectively from 2014 to 2017—we can see that $250 million has been ripped out of Victoria in vocational education and training. So, in fact, we are injecting more federal money than the state governments, individually and collectively, have injected. Victoria has the most significant drop in spending over a five-year period of all of the states. My door continues to be open to every state and territory to make sure that we can work together to address the skills shortages that we have around Australia.


In the minute that I have left to speak on this particular MPI today, I must say that it's very interesting that Labor has actually put up vocational education as an MPI, because since the last election this is the first time we have spoken about vocational education. However, at every opportunity I get I certainly speak about vocational education, so I have had the opportunity during MPIs to talk about VET. As a government, we have already done a range of things to address the problems we inherited from the Labor government. Getting rid of VET FEE-HELP is so important for the future of vocational education, and particularly for the reputation of the sector. We fixed that with VET student loans. We have introduced strategies to deal with the status of vocational education because we know we've got a lot of work to do to make sure vocational education takes its place as an opportunity for our young people to get the jobs that they need.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (15:40):  That was a staggering contribution from the assistant minister. There were 10 minutes allotted to the government minister, and the only point at which they actually talked about their own reforms was in the last 30 seconds. The last 30 seconds was all we got.




Mrs Andrews:
  I'm happy to continue speaking!




Mr HUSIC:
  No, because your time, Minister, was actually the bulk of the contribution that you should have made. What was in the bulk of the contribution? A throwback to years before. The coalition have been in government for nearly five years. They had the opportunity to say what they were doing, but all they could focus on was the past, as is often the case. Why? Because it is a complete distraction from their inability to get this right.


In actual fact, what this government is doing on education, in terms of its failure to invest in skill, is intergenerationally reprehensible because it will deny the next generation of Australians what they require in terms of an investment in human capital. We know what's going to happen in work. We know what technology is going to do to profoundly change the way in which people work, and we know we need to invest in human capital right now. We need smarter Australians and more skilled Australians. We need them to have that level of support that requires that investment in human capital.


What do we get out of the coalition? In that environment where we need to invest, we get cuts to schools. In the environment where we need to lift skills, we get cuts to TAFE. In the environment where we need to prepare them for the future, we get cuts to universities. There have been cuts to schools, cuts to TAFE and cuts to uni by the government. We often hear when they talk about Gonski that it's about spending smarter, yet this is what they're doing: they are cutting the funding to education and then puncturing the budget with a massive hole, with an $80 billion handover of funds to corporate Australia through corporate tax cuts. Those are the very same businesses that are crying out for skills and wanting to see investments in people, yet this mob want to cut $80 billion out of the budget for corporate tax cuts. It gives you every sense of their priorities in this area.


Look at what they are doing to schools, with $17 billion cut, or universities, with billions cut. In particular, during the course of this government, while the coalition have been in office, $3 billion has been cut out of TAFE. As was indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition earlier, when you know that nine out of 10 positions in the Australian workforce are going to need someone trained through either TAFE or university, how do you cut $3 billion out of TAFE during the course of a government? That's why the minister didn't talk about what they are doing—because their record is so shabby, shameful and scandalous. They cut $3 billion. In this budget, what are they going to do? They are prepared to cut another $300 million. It's not enough that they cut $3 billion out; they're ready to cut another $300 million over four years. It is absolutely a disgrace. There are 140,000 fewer apprentices in this country, and we are being told all the time that there are skills shortages. How do you get away with that?


There are jobs programs that are supposed to prepare young people for work. There used to be a time when you'd always hear about Work for the Dole or PaTH, the internship program, from those opposite. It would always be in the budget, but in this one there is no mention whatsoever—no mention of what funding or what support they are providing young people to get them in jobs. The only good thing that comes out of PaTH is plasticine statistics; they are always squeezing the stats. They're always shaping them up and massaging them one way or another. You can never find out how many interns actually got jobs. Eighty per cent per cent of people who go through Work for the Dole don't have a job three months after. All that young people got in this budget was roughly $1 million for a youth employment body. That was it. That's all that you got out of those opposite. They're not preparing young people for work; they're punishing them for being out of work. 


Then you look at what's happening in terms of the future of work itself: 3.5 million jobs in Australia will be affected by technological change. In a workforce of 12 million, that's big. We get nothing out of those opposite in terms of preparing people for what's going to happen. TAFE has a huge role, particularly in the middle of people's careers, in getting them new skills and preparing them for new jobs. This is why I say that what is happening on skills under those opposite is intergenerationally reprehensible. They are selling out young people and their futures, all for the sake of handing over an $80 billion corporate tax cut. It is a disgrace.

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2018-05-10,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (15:45):  Can I say from the outset, as one of the few people in this place that actually holds a trade certificate as an electrical fitter mechanic, as someone who completed an apprenticeship, who had that opportunity in their youth, that we are very keen to see that opportunity extended to the youth of this generation. I notice that it's all about blame shifting and all those other things, but I'd like to point out to the member for Chifley that the assistant minister made a very clear point: a national partnership agreement was signed for five years. It takes five years to expire. This is the ultimate reason why we continue to be affected by Labor's decisions.


Can I also congratulate the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills. She is doing outstanding work. She is not a mechanical fitter, but she is a mechanical engineer, which is close enough. She has certainly worked with engineering services and trades across a long, broad and very extensive round of experience in that field and many others. She is doing incredibly important work in this portfolio. As part of that role she came to my electorate of Hinkler in recent weeks. We were fortunate to visit a place called Superior Pak and one of their organisers, Mark Hamilton. Can I say how pleased I was to see how successful this business was. A place which used to manufacture harvesters—it was the home of Austoft for many years—is now the home of Superior Pak, where they produce many of the nation's recycling trucks and rubbish trucks. They employ a large number of apprentices. It was good to be back on the ground with oxycutters and grinders and all those things that you see inside those trade related engineering services, and it was good to have the assistant minister with us to demonstrate what we are doing locally. 


It's beyond ridiculous that those opposite want to lecture us about what's good and bad inside the VET sector, because the assistant minister was exactly right: Labor's record on vocational education and training is, quite simply, appalling. Because of what was called at the time their grand plan—I would say it was probably a rolled-gold grand plan, given today's theme—




Mrs Prentice:
  Same sort of success!




Mr PITT:
  with the same sort of success, as I just heard from an interjection, they introduced private educators and competition into the sector. It's no surprise to me, as someone that comes from business, that that created a difficult position for TAFE. Their numbers went down and consequently their funding went down and there are now fewer of them. That is no surprise to me. The federal government does not directly fund TAFE. The coalition provides $1½ billion to states and territories to support their VET sectors. That grand plan of Labor's saw hundreds of millions of dollars cut from incentive programs. Apprentice numbers collapsed across the country, and this is now a real threat to our businesses, our industry and our economy. Through the hard work of my good friend and colleague, the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, we are taking steps. We have ended the rorts in the VET FEE-HELP system. We are looking to restore integrity and public confidence in VET, so that students and their families can be confident they are on the path to a rewarding job and career. 


I noticed the member for Chifley talking about the PaTH program. I was with one of the success stories in recent weeks. He is a young beau who works for the Bundaberg Motor Group. He, with two of his compatriots who were successful through the PaTH program, secured full-time employment. The best thing, he said, was he could buy a car. As a young man with a full-time job through the PaTH program, he could buy a car. He was excited about that. It is a great result. The $1½ billion Skilling Australians Fund will continue to do that. It will provide an extra 300,000 apprentices and trainees over four years. That is 300,000 new opportunities for Australians to gain those skilled jobs, for us to provide our youth with an opportunity that they need to continue to build their skills and experience across our sector. 


These are just some of the programs that we've introduced under the government that support VET and apprentices. Unfortunately, while the federal government has increased funding to the sector, most states are cutting theirs. We need everyone onboard. This is a critical issue for me, as a local member, as our numbers have clearly fallen for apprentices. We are providing those opportunities. I look forward to the skills fund being introduced.


The coalition government does have a positive plan to raise the profile and the status of vocational education and training. Whilst I've earned a living with my hands and I've earned a living with my mind, not everyone needs to go to university. Not everyone needs a university education. There are very highly paid, well-paid, well-developed jobs with trades across the country, but, to get those positions, we need our youth to have an opportunity. This government is providing those opportunities—300,000 of them. I'm looking forward to seeing them being engaged, being employed in business, completing their apprenticeships and getting into the workforce and not only delivering for themselves and their families but also building our economy, paying their taxes as good citizens and being part of a great Australia in the future.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (15:50):  The previous member was really proud of his achievements, and he should be. He is one of tens of thousands of people of his generation who got access to an apprenticeship because, back then, the federal government used to fund apprenticeships. Back then, the federal government owned railway yards and built things. Back then, the federal government owned the Australian defence industries and employed apprentices. That is why Labor is committed to going some way to restoring that by guaranteeing that one in 10 of the employees on government projects will be an apprentice.


I know hundreds and hundreds of people of the same generation who started out at the old ordnance factory in Bendigo. They got their apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. They're proud of that. They've done well. Some have gone on to be local councillors. Some continued to work there and were acknowledged not that long ago for their 45 or 50 years of service at Bendigo Thales. Do you know what's heartbreaking? This government signed the new Hawkei contract out at Bendigo Thales, but guess what? It didn't lock in any apprentice ratios. So guess what happened—$1.6 billion for the Hawkei contract and not one new apprentice, because this government did a contract with a for-profit, private enterprise and didn't lock in a commitment to apprentices. That is the track record of this government. It has cut so much money from apprenticeships and TAFE that it is now hard to find a decent apprenticeship which is well funded and which people can do.


The government also said that, somehow, Victoria is underfunding TAFE or not funding it. Maybe they should have read the Herald Sun last week or actually seen the commitments that the state Labor government made for the people of Victoria. They actually announced free TAFE. Maybe that's why the government didn't understand it! It was because we had a state Labor government offer free TAFE. That is $172 million towards free TAFE because we have a state Labor government putting TAFE first. That's maybe what the government have a problem with. Labor invests in TAFE. Labor believes in TAFE and will always be the party that stands up for TAFE. There was $60 million also announced last week for a new TAFE campus in Bendigo. It's another chunk of money from a state Labor government in TAFE.


Victorian Labor is not the only Labor state government that is doing that. We've seen significant investments in Queensland and in WA. Labor puts TAFE first, so you can imagine the anger on this side of the House when we learnt on budget night that the government have yet again taken the axe to TAFE. This time they've cut $270 million from TAFE, from the Skilling Australians Fund, in their budget. Last year they said that in the budget there'd be $1.47 billion over four years. In this budget, it is $1.2 billion. They're cutting funding. This fund is about seeing where we have skills gaps in this country, where we have 457 visa workers in this country, and charging the employers a fee—and that goes into training. If we're going to close the gap, if we want to reduce the number of temporary skilled migrants that we have coming into this country, then we have to invest in TAFE. We have to offer those apprenticeships, and we have to make sure that there are courses available. 


It's really concerning that the government doesn't understand that connection. It's really concerning that they're not backing Labor's plan to guarantee that two-thirds of all vocational education funding will go into TAFE. It's really concerning that they're not backing our commitment to one-in-10 apprenticeship ratios in all government contracts, guaranteeing that we do have that next generation of skilled people going forward.


I've lost count of the number of employers in regional Australia that I've met who are struggling to find fitters and turners, who are struggling to find people with the traditional trades, whether they be mechanics or people involved in any form of automation or in our building trades. We are struggling as a country. This funding that the government has cut would have gone some way to bridging the gap. It wasn't the only thing, but it was helping. It says a lot about a government when they cut TAFE funding and say loudly and clearly to the rest of the economy, 'That's okay, just keep bringing in temporary skilled workers.' They have no commitment to giving young people a go. They've got no commitment to ensuring that our TAFEs stand up as the trusted, publicly funded way of delivering vocational education in this country. (Time expired)

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-05-10,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (15:56):  Politics is a funny thing. You know that some days will be better than others and some weeks will be better than others. I think everybody in this House, across the divide here, would agree that the Leader of the Opposition, this week, is having an absolute shocker. At the end of the day, we know that he's not a very well liked bloke—and I feel for him in that regard—nor is he trusted. But, as has been emphasised by others, we have been reminded today that he did make the rolled-gold commitment, that guarantee, that none of his team in the Labor Party would be engaged in the citizenship saga, and, of course, four have had to resign. Four cannot sit in this parliament. He's been caught out.


You would think, at a time like this, his team would fall in behind him and give him a bit of support because the man is on his knees. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has brought this MPI to the House for debate. She's put on the House's agenda a debate about vocational education and training. She knows, as the loyal deputy, that her leader failed disastrously as the minister for employment. In his last gig as a minister of a government, 110,000 apprentices were lost from the system. So, the loyal deputy comes in and says: 'Let's tell Australia about it. Let's again shine a light on the Leader of the Opposition's absolute incompetence.' That's why he should never be Prime Minister. And the Leader of the Opposition's deputy probably doesn't want him to be either, because she wants the gig. I think that's actually why we're here today; I think that's why we're debating this. Why else would the Labor Party put up an MPI about getting jobs, when we have a record job-making government right now? We have over 1,000 jobs being created every single day, and they want to talk about jobs! I think they're out for the Leader of the Opposition.


But if they want to talk about history, let's talk about history. The Labor Party in government introduced two schemes, which we had to inherit because they were partnership agreements. One of those schemes was the National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. We recently replaced Labor's national partnership agreement with the Skilling Australians Fund. We also replaced Labor's VET FEE-HELP program with the VET Students Loans scheme. Let's take both of those schemes of the Labor Party. The national partnership agreement effectively disconnected the vocational education and training sector from the real market economy. A sector that provided the training was disconnected from the very industries that accepted the graduates. And Labor did this purposely, not by an accidental rule of the pencil or the pen. Labor reduced the incentives for employers nine times. A total of $1.2 billion of incentives for employers, encouraging them to take on people out of the VET system, was gone from the system, disconnecting the real economy from the suppliers of vocational education and training. What was the end result? The end result was young people in Australia being trained and having debt, but no job—no job, but debt. That is the result of their program, as well as the reduction in that final year alone of 110,000 apprentices. It's an absolute disgrace.


Let's talk about VET FEE-HELP. That has already been covered a lot in this House over the last 12 months. Incentives were provided as a big blank cheque. The Labor Party crafted this framework, and it led to dodgy providers right across the country, bringing the very sector they're talking about today into disrepute. That is why you saw TAFE become the victim of the Labor Party's actions. That is why TAFE's market share dropped from 60 per cent to 49 per cent. It was simply because of Labor's actions.


In response, are we fixing this? Yes, we are. We are fixing this now with positive action, by promoting trades. We are fixing this now with a $1.5 billion investment, as we saw in the budget. We are fixing this now with 300,000 new apprentices over the forward estimates. That's a government that cares. That's a government taking action.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (16:01):  There is nothing I like more than a debate on the history of vocational education with the government. The previous speaker said, 'Let's set the record straight.' All right, let's set the record straight. What actually happened when there was a change of government in this country was that the vocational education portfolio disappeared. That's how much priority they gave it. It disappeared. Then, much to the shock of former Minister Macfarlane, he discovered it was actually in his portfolio. That's how much focus and attention they gave to vocational education. Then the minister proceeded to criticise apprentices as wasting their money on tatts and mag wheels. That's where the history of the government started on vocational education.


The government have an abysmal five-year record on vocational education and training in this country. They never want to talk about TAFE; they never want to talk about the public provider; and they most certainly do not want to make real commitments to vocational training and apprenticeships and trainees. The minister at the table does her best in trying to rewrite history. The reality is that the VET FEE-HELP program, which the previous member referenced, blew out on their watch, time and time again. On the opposition side, the teachers unions and members of the public were screaming out warnings about what was going on. Why did that happen? That happened because, when they came to government, they specifically said to the education sector: 'We don't want any red tape. We don't want any regulation. We don't want to tie anything to requirements of performance.' And, no surprise, the market took that message and the shonks and spivs emerged and started ripping off students across this country. You only have to look at the figures on the blowout of VET FEE-HELP to see exactly when that happened and why it happened. It was because the government took their eye off the ball on vocational education and sent the message to the market: 'We don't really care. We're not going to be watching.' Unsurprisingly, what the response to that would be was the response.


Those opposite want to talk about the decrease in apprenticeship numbers under Labor. I will tell you what we did. We tightened up a system where a person was signed up to a traineeship as a 16-year-old when they went to work at McDonald's. That's what was going on. Yes, we tightened that up, as we should have done. But under their watch, even under those tighter rules, we've lost 140,000 apprentices in this country. Last year in the budget, we got this big announcement about the Skilling Australians Fund. It is failing. It is structurally flawed and it is failing. What we now see in this budget, just this week, is the reality of that, which is that the government have had to knock another $270 million off the funding. Where are the figures from the government in defending this, that indicate an increase in trainees and apprentices across the country? They can't do it, because they're failing. They're not achieving it. 


We now have a situation where, across the nation, people are looking for skilled workers. Just try as an individual to get carpenters or plumbers to your house; there is such a shortage across the nation. Despite all the government's talk—and I've heard it from numerous ministers, who have kept rolling through—they've not had a single win on it. They don't get up and say, 'These are the numbers; this is the increase we've had, and this is where we've made a difference,' because they can't. All they want to do is attack us, as always—we see that in question time, time and time again. How about defending your own policy? How about providing the evidence that it's working? You can't do it, because it's not. And that is not changing.


Our public TAFE system is reeling in regional and rural Australia. Every member of the National Party—and, indeed, the country Libs—should be going to this government and saying, 'You have to do something about TAFE. It is the backbone of our regional communities. Our people rely on it. And it is dying on the vine. You should be in this space.' But they don't; they're silent on it.


Let's not forget, either, the growth areas of the future—childcare; disability care; aged care—looking for skilled workers. Where are they trained? At TAFE. So even the emerging, developing opportunities for employment are not being provided with the skilled workers that they need.


Give me a debate in this place any time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put this up, 100 per cent backed by the Leader of the Opposition, because they get TAFE and they get apprentices. And we are going to get acting on it.

"Flint, Nicolle, MP",LP,2018-05-10,"



Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (16:06):  I'm very pleased to speak on this matter today because the Turnbull government is doing a wonderful job when it comes to vocational education and training, and I am delighted that the minister responsible, the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, is here in the chamber. She is doing a wonderful job in this space. We are inspiring so many young Australians to take up a trade and go through skills based education and training. It's really exciting stuff.


But, first of all, I just want to reflect on the fact that, when we have a strong economy, we can support as many young people as possible to get into university or to get a trade based skill, to do an apprenticeship, because we can afford to support them—and, of course, we can get them a job at the end of their education. So, as we've heard over the past few days, we are cutting personal income tax and we are cutting business taxes because we want Australians to spend their money as they choose to spend it. We want that money in their pockets. Unlike the Labor Party, who want to take money out of people's pockets, we want to keep it in their pockets so that they can make decisions for themselves. We're guaranteeing essential services, we're keeping our nation safe and secure and we are making sure the government is living within its means.


Since we have come into government, we've created around a million jobs. That is a huge achievement. We're supporting a variety of different pathways to employment, whether it is through university, where we've increased funding, or through vocational education and training.


It's really important that we recognise that not everyone wants to, needs to or should go to university. There has been far too much emphasis on young people in particular needing to go to uni. There are so many fantastic careers and employment pathways available to young people that do not involve needing to go to university. So, when I'm out and about in my electorate, speaking to school students at my 54 schools, I encourage them to think about doing a trade by going to TAFE, to think about acquiring skills through vocational education and training. And we have one of the best systems in the world, so why wouldn't they? The minister knows this. She's doing a fantastic job on a range of different programs and promoting the opportunities to young people.


There are about 4.2 million students involved in VET, gaining the skills that they need to get a good job or upskilling within their current employment. So that's nearly one in four Australians aged between 15 and 69. We are committed to supporting a VET system that provides the skilled workforce that our industries need to ensure Australia's continued economic growth. This is why we're investing in a new $1.5 billion Skilling Australians Fund. This replaces the scheme that Labor introduced in 2012, which was their five-year national partnerships agreement, under which apprenticeship and trainee numbers collapsed. We, under our agreements with the states, will see an extra 300,000 apprenticeships, traineeships, pre-apprenticeships and higher apprenticeships provided over the next four years. So, Minister, congratulations on the incredible work that you've done.


We have axed Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP scheme, and we've replaced it with VET student loans, because we should be helping students and young people in particular who want to do vocational education and training with some money to get them through their studies. We've also introduced greater protections for students who are doing a course. I'm particularly excited about the Real Skills for Real Careers strategy, which tells fantastic stories about people who have pursued a trade or skills-based training and education. There are incredible careers that people can pursue, whether plumbing, hairdressing or whatever you might choose to do. There are great opportunities.


I really hope, and I will be doing my very best to make sure, that those opposite never get back into office, because when they were in office they absolutely destroyed vocational education and training. In their last year in office, from June 2012 to 2013, when the Leader of the Opposition was employment minister, apprentice numbers collapsed by 110,000, or 22 per cent. This was the largest single annual decline on record. That is a disgrace. They gave us the VET FEE-HELP scheme that saw a lot of rorting and dodgy operators and damaged the sector. I'm delighted to speak on this, as to why the coalition government is doing such a great job in this area.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (16:11):  I think this is called the matter of public importance. It's a chance to talk about something that's important for Australia. I don't think it's called 'let's read out the coalition's speaking points'. We are supposed to talk about the future of Australia. Four speakers have had a chance to rebut what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put forward: the proposition that in the government's budget papers you've stripped $270 million from TAFE on top of the more than $1 billion that you had cut previously. We have not had a single debating speaker come back and refute that point. I see that the member for Brisbane is up next, so this is a great chance for him. He's not a member of Team Queensland; he wasn't listed as being a member of Team Queensland by the infrastructure minister. Maybe he will be the TAFE champion—he will get up and actually talk to us about how Brisbane is benefiting from that budget last night, which ripped $200-plus million out of TAFE.


I'm not a tradie myself, but I do have two siblings that are butchers and one sibling that's an electrician. I've got a few nephews that are plumbers, carpenters and construction workers. I understand what tradies do. They're some of our unsung heroes in society, and not only when your water or electricity are cut off and they come on the weekend to help you out; we need our tradies to keep our economy growing, whether it be things like helping us out with the NBN—that disaster that's being rolled out by those opposite—swinging the hammers, laying the pipes or literally building the foundations of our nation's future.


In Moreton we have a world-class training centre at Acacia Ridge called SkillsTech. It's a fantastic place. The member for Cunningham has been there with me, and I've been there with the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who was most excited to meet one of the plumbing trainers because the member for Sydney's dad was a plumber and so they were able to talk plumbing stories. They are training the future tradies and technicians, not just in a classroom but obviously with the facilities that come with creating all those jobs, like motor mechanics, sheetmetal workers, fitters, panelbeaters, vehicle painters, carpenters, joiners, plumbers, cabinet-makers, electricians, and air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, to name but a few. You can't just train those people in a classroom; you actually have to invest in infrastructure. All of those specific trades that I mentioned are on the 2017 Queensland list of skill shortages, the list put out by the Commonwealth Department of Jobs and Small Business. All of those skills are actually taught at TAFEs like SkillsTech at Acacia Ridge, yet what do we see? We see a myopic, stumbling government that is cutting funds to the training facilities that are necessary to skill our workforce.


As the member for Cunningham touched on, the other big cut and the other great need is aged care. The number of senior baby boomers is booming. We know that that population pyramid is going to work its way through. It is a sector for which the workforce will need to at least double by 2050—double its workforce! So, what are we doing? Are we investing in aged care training? No, we're making cuts to training facilities, when we need to provide extra training for workers in the aged-care sector.


Labor, obviously, would be a much more practical and visionary government under Prime Minister Shorten. I will tell you what we would be doing. We would be doing things like guaranteeing that at least two out of every three Commonwealth dollars goes to TAFE, because we know that TAFE in the bush and in the city is the backbone of training. We know that TAFE will do the right thing. We'll provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeship programs for young people who want to learn a trade and provide 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who need to retrain. We will invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country because, sadly, some of them that were built in the seventies—and some that were even built in the late sixties—are starting to look a little bit old and tired. More importantly, we will ensure that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices and Australian trainees. We will make sure that the job needs of the future are being invested in by the Commonwealth government. We know that TAFE has the track record. It's not going to jump in like the spivs did under the watch of those opposite. We know that as they enter their fifth year of government they need to step up on investing in TAFE.

"Evans, Trevor, MP",LP,2018-05-10,"



Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (16:16):  I was so pleased that the member of Moreton asked me whether I am a member of 'team Queensland' and whether Brisbane is sharing in this infrastructure pipeline promised in the budget by this government. I was delighted on Tuesday night when the Treasurer announced $300 million towards the Brisbane Metro, to make that project a reality for the people of Brisbane. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the very good people of Brisbane, all of those locals who answered my calls and signed the petitions, who helped to prove how enthusiastic the grassroots support was in Brisbane for the Brisbane Metro project. People of Brisbane, your voice has been heard.


I almost laughed out loud when I heard that in today's debate Labor was going to try to raise education and skills funding. Labor's silly line about somehow making it harder for people to get a job has come straight after the biggest ever year for job creation in Australia's history—on average, 1,100 jobs created each and every day last year. The vast majority of those jobs were full-time jobs and the vast majority went to women. Women currently have the highest participation rate in the workforce that they've ever had in Australia's history.


Labor should be embarrassed to bring up the topic of education funding. Right now, education funding is higher than it ever was under any year that Labor was ever in office, and the funding is going up, not down. I can report that Brisbane's education sector is going from strength to strength. In fact, international education is currently Brisbane city's biggest export. One of the reasons is that Australia's vocational education and training system is internationally recognised as one of the very best in the world.


There is a reason that Labor in particular should be so embarrassed to bring up their record on the funding of skills and apprenticeships when they were in government. For those playing along at home—everyone can look this up for themselves as I talk about it—you just have to Google 'NCVER apprenticeship numbers'. NCVER is the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. They publish these numbers and have done so for years—they graph them. If you do a Google image search on their numbers it will come up straight away on the front page and it will become abundantly clear within seconds to anyone who does so that apprenticeship numbers went off a cliff in 2012 when Labor were in charge, when they totally and fatally lost control of the government's budget and the nation's finances. They lost control of Australia's budget; they dropped apprenticeship funding; and the number of apprenticeships in our country went off a cliff. That is what happened. I was there. I was working with industry and with trainers in the retail sector at the time.


So, for Labor to bring up this topic in this way shows that they have absolutely no shame, and to bring it up in a week when the entire national conversation is about the federal budget and about how this country is trying to turn the corner after those horrible years when Labor did lose control of the budget, and all of the terrible consequences that had for education and training and every other area, shows that they have absolutely no idea. Labor have no shame and no idea. Rather than cuts, education funding is going up in this budget.


This week's budget has been, I must say, a fantastic budget for the people of Brisbane. More than 75,000 people across the electorate of Brisbane will receive tax cuts in 50 days. Those hardworking people right across Brisbane will be keeping more of their own money, their own hard-earned money, as reward for their efforts, because this government's strong economic plan is starting to pay dividends for the country, just as it is in jobs and just as it is in the education and training spaces. A year ago, when I got up in this House to talk about last year's budget, I predicted why supporting Australia's small and medium businesses would pay these sorts of dividends, and now here we are seeing evidence of the key planks of the government's strong economic plan: tax relief for small and medium businesses, our innovation agenda, our education and training funding, the new free trade agreements and growing our defence industry. We see evidence of these policies working right across Brisbane and right across the country. Nationwide, these policies have combined to help Australia's small and medium businesses create new jobs, more jobs, faster than at any time in Australia's history.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:21):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018 contains four tax integrity measures. Schedule 1 goes to toughening the multinational anti-avoidance law; schedule 2 goes to improving the integrity of small business capital gains tax concessions; schedule 3 is about fintech and venture capital amendments; and, finally, schedule 4 goes to tax exemption for payments made under the Defence Force Ombudsman Scheme. Labor supports schedules 1 and 4.


I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Coalition Government's failure to ensure tax integrity by improving tax haven transparency"".




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  Is the amendment seconded?




Ms Chesters:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.




Mr THISTLETHWAITE:
  In terms of schedule 1, regarding toughening the multinational anti-avoidance law, the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that the multinational anti-avoidance law applies appropriately to artificial and contrived arrangements involving trusts and partnerships entered into by multinational entities to avoid the taxation of business profits in Australia. We note that the schedule implements a technical integrity measure underpinning the multinational anti-avoidance law.


The Turnbull government has regularly made much of statements that Labor voted against the multinational anti-avoidance law, but this is simply not true. In this House, Labor supported that bill and, in the Senate, Labor voted against a government-Greens amendment. Yes, that's right: the government teamed up with the Greens to water down the tax transparency law and reporting requirements for large companies. The effect of that amendment—which was ultimately successful through the Greens and the coalition government—was to reduce the number of Australian companies who were required to report their tax arrangements each year. Some of those big companies were raking in revenue close to $16 billion but were paying no tax. The government wanted to reduce the number of those companies that were required to report every year, and guess what? The Greens teamed up with them and allowed that to occur. Labor ultimately facilitated the passage of the multinational anti-avoidance law in both houses, but we did that over protestations about reducing the exposure and the scrutiny that was allowed by that law by reducing the number of companies subject to it.


The fact is that the Turnbull government have been a light touch and have had a hands-off approach when it comes to big business and those at the top end of town, and we've seen this over the past couple of years with their approach to the banking industry. The fact is that for 600 days they avoided and actively opposed a royal commission into the banking sector in Australia. Labor's been proven right, once again, in the evidence that's come out of that inquiry—there was systemic and substantial rorting by this industry, undermining Australians' finances, and it needed to be looked at, and that's what's occurring at the moment. We welcome the fact that the commissioner's doing a fantastic job, and we await the outcomes of his interim report in September and ultimately a final report in February next year. This is a reflection of this government's ideological emphasis: checks and balances on government power but no consideration given to the checks and balances on the power of big businesses and the wealthy to avoid their community obligations, particularly when it comes to paying their fair share of tax. 


The fact is that the Turnbull government, from the top down, including the extreme free-market fringe, are more concerned with so-called red tape and the banks' cost of doing business than with appropriately regulating them. They see tax and the collection of tax revenue as the biggest cost of doing business. They call it a tax grab. But we know, of course, that one in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax for at least the past three years. That's no taxation revenue that could have been used for funding important social resources like health, education and infrastructure. Over a series of decades what we've seen is a number of these corporations being very adept at using accounting practices to make loans to subsidiaries in other countries, to transfer funds to subsidiaries in other countries where there is a lower corporate tax rate, and to avoid paying their fair share of tax in Australia. It was only when Labor began to highlight this—and, indeed, when these practices were highlighted through international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD—that we began to get action from this government. This is despite tax transparency laws that show just how much the people of Australia are losing through this light-touch approach to collecting their fair share of taxation. Yet the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have still given priority to big business over reining in some of that taxation revenue to ensure we have a fairer budget balance from the corporate sector. We all know that, in the budget that was released just a couple of days ago, there remains the $80 billion tax cut for the biggest businesses in this country. Don't worry about actually getting what's owed to the Australian people. This government, as part of the trickle-down economics philosophy, is more intent on providing a tax cut to the big end of town. 


Over the course of the past week some very interesting research has been released in the United States about the effect of the first round of corporate tax cuts in America, and—surprise, surprise!—what that research has uncovered is where that first round of corporate tax cuts went. Guess where the benefits of those corporate tax cuts went? Well, they didn't go into the pay packets of the workers of those corporations, I can tell you that; they went into profits and to the shareholders through increased dividends. It's clear, based on studies like that and a litany of others throughout the world, that this trickle-down approach to economics of cutting taxes for corporations in the wish and the hope that they will pass them on to their workers and employ more people is complete rubbish. It doesn't happen. These studies that have been released in the United States prove that. Cutting penalty rates for workers who work on weekends in the hospitality industry only makes things worse. These are the reasons why people's real incomes have not been increasing in Australia over the last decade, why families are feeling the pinch and why workers are feeling the pinch and feeling left behind by this government.


Many of these matters involve deliberate tax evasion, often through the use of overseas tax havens or complex corporate structures to avoid detection and recovery. Tax havens have been estimated to hold $7.5 trillion of the world's financial wealth, costing the global economy $200 billion in lost taxes every year. The strategy of choice used by those deliberately evading their fair share of tax is a clear and present threat to Australia's taxation base. When tax revenue gets lost to tax havens, Australians ultimately have to pay higher taxes or suffer cuts to those vital services and shared social resources that I referred to earlier, particularly health, education and infrastructure.


In 2017, Labor announced a comprehensive tax haven transparency package. The policy includes tax domicile disclosure for government procurement tenders, whistleblower protections and even rewards for reporting of tax haven exposure to shareholders, and public reporting of just how much tax is paid in jurisdictions where these firms operate. Yet this light-touch, hands-off government has been backtracking on a beneficial ownership registry—another Labor policy that we announced in 2017. This registry would help identify the ultimate owners that sit behind some of these shell companies. It's about improving the transparency that is there with regard to the operation of these companies and, ultimately, being able to hold someone accountable when they do use these tricky taxation and accounting measures to transfer profits overseas to avoid paying tax.


This government also commissioned an unrelated secret Board of Taxation review on the 2016-17 budget measures and the OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of taxation information. Of course, we only know that because of Senate estimates. The report was released only days ago because Senators Ketter and McAllister were able to get that via the Senate estimates process. The government didn't even want to release this report and what was actually going on in terms of some of the taxation transparency measures in the Australian economy.


The fact is that the Treasurer doesn't want to close a lot of these loopholes. Of course, we heard absolutely nothing from him about cracking down on tax havens in this budget. We know that the introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor, could help stem the flow of missing money that should be flowing to the Australian people. Corporate profits are soaring and, while Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack in terms of competitiveness and the actual rate of taxation for corporations, the only policy that this government has had in this area is to cut corporate taxes and to give those companies a big advantage.


Labor knows what needs to be done—and, if we're elected, we're willing to do it—to crack down on multinational tax avoidance. We have announced a plan to close those loopholes and attack the deliberate use of tax havens, first, by tightening debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies to improve their budget by billions over the medium term.


The second element of our plan is introducing the public reporting of country-by-country reports. We need to see the high-level tax information about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations.


Third is providing protection for whistleblowers who report on those entities evading tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Where a whistleblower's information results in more tax being paid, we should allow them to collect a share of the tax penalty with a reward of up to $250,000.


Fourth is introducing a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. This approach will allow the public to find out just who really owns companies and who is behind these corporate and accounting practices of setting up different shell companies to avoid the scrutiny of the public. It's clear that shareholders shouldn't be able to use complex structures and sham ownership arrangements to avoid complying with corporate transparency rules.


Fifth is introducing mandatory shareholder reporting of tax haven exposure. Companies must disclose to their shareholders, as a material tax risk, if the company is doing business in some of these tax havens. Unfortunately, that is not occurring at the moment.


Sixth is appointing a community sector representative to boards of taxation to ensure the community sector's voice is heard in tax design and review processes.


Seventh is introducing public reporting of Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, or AUSTRAC, data and requiring the annual public release of international cash flow data.


Eighth is requiring government tenders to disclose their country of tax domicile.


Ninth is developing guidelines for investment by superannuation funds. This should be done by the Australian Taxation Office in collaboration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.


The final element of our plan requires the Australian tax office's annual report to provide information on the number and size of tax settlements.


I want to make some comments in respect of schedule 2 of the bill, which goes to improving the integrity of small-business capital gains tax concessions. These changes include additional conditions that must be satisfied to apply the small-business CGT concessions to capital gains. The amendments implement the measure announced in the 2017-18 budget as 'Tax integrity package—improving small business capital gains tax concessions' and apply to CGT events that occur on or after 1 July 2017.


However, we note that the original 2017-18 budget proposal is vague in its details. Many tax professionals and stakeholders have said that it would not be until the release of the exposure draft legislation that those affected would become aware of just how they were going to be affected by this legislation. These stakeholders make the reasonable claim that, due to a lack of detail, taxpayers who have conducted their tax affairs in good faith could be caught by changes that go beyond what was flagged in the previous budget. They argue that, to help prevent adverse consequences for taxpayers who have been acting in good faith but couldn't reasonably be expected to foresee the detailed amendments finally unveiled in the exposure draft, the implementation date should be changed from 1 July 2017, as per the original budget announcement, to 8 February 2018. That's the exposure draft release date. In light of those stakeholder concerns, Labor supports the start date being 8 February 2018, as proposed by the tax professionals community.


In terms of schedule 3, which goes to fin-tech and venture capital amendments, these amendments in income tax law and the Venture Capital Act ensure that venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fin-tech businesses. This schedule partially implements a 2016-17 budget measure, the National Innovation and Science Agenda, as it expands the new arrangements for venture capital limited partnerships.


Labor notes that the main observation following consultation with key stakeholders was the timing of the concessions proposed in this measure. They still leave some uncertainty about the long-term eligibility for concessions in the commercialisation process. This has led to some uncertainty about whether investment decisions will actually be improved. Labor, again, has requested that the minister instigate a look at the impact of investment on the venture capital concession provisions overall, including the measures in this bill, to ensure that they are operating as intended. To provide an added layer of certainty, the amendments should allow Innovation and Science Australia to make public and private findings on assessments.


In conclusion, once again, Labor support the tax integrity measures in this bill, but we are somewhat sceptical about and somewhat dismayed by this government's light-handed approach when it comes to tackling tax avoidance in Australia. This particular coalition government has been very sloppy in its approach to key stakeholders on important tax matters—namely, those that go to the notions of transparency and accountability by corporations when it comes to taxation, how much they're paying and where they're paying it. Labor have laid out a clear plan of improved measures that would bring greater transparency and accountability to this industry. We commend that approach to the government and we hope that it sincerely looks at adopting some of those amendments.

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:39):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. As I am Chair of the House Committee on Tax and Revenue, this bill is close to my heart. Yes, there is a beating heart at the core of all good tax legislation. This bill fulfils the Turnbull government's commitment to ensure Australians can have confidence in a fair and equitable tax system whereby everyone plays by the same set of rules and pays their fair share of tax. This government, more than any other government in the past, has legislated tough laws to crack down on tax avoidance across the entire tax system and across all sectors of the economy.


This bill makes a number of key changes across four schedules that all work to make our tax system fairer, more cost-effective and efficient and to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules. Firstly, schedule 1, better known as MAAL, makes technical amendments to ensure that the government's multinational tax avoidance law operates as intended. As a result of this amendment, multinationals will no longer be able to use corporate structures with foreign trusts and partnerships to avoid the application of the MAAL. These changes were announced in last year's budget as part of the government's commitment to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax.


The OECD has estimated that, globally, between US$100 billion and US$240 billion of corporate tax revenue is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies developed by tax lawyers in new tax jurisdictions, like Liechtenstein and the Bahamas. As part of the global effort to combat multinational tax avoidance, the OECD G20 base erosion and profit-shifting project has delivered a number of recommendations to strengthen countries' tax integrity rules and ensure that the international tax system works as intended. Since 2015, Australia has implemented a range of such actions. The government has also taken additional action on multinational tax avoidance beyond the OECD recommendations, including implementing the multinational anti-avoidance law and the diverted profits tax, both of which discourage large multinationals from artificially diverting profits offshore.


The MAAL, which took effect from 1 January 2016, prevents multinationals from escaping Australian tax by using artificial or contrived arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence in Australia. The ATO has observed a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government. The ATO estimates that more than $7 billion in sales revenue annually is already being added to the Australian tax base as a result of the government's MAAL. Already we have seen 38 multinational entities changing, or they are in the process of changing, their tax affairs to bring their Australian sourced sales back onshore in compliance with the MAAL, including Google and Facebook. This is also competitively neutral, putting foreign multinationals on the same level as Australian owned and run businesses.


Secondly, schedule 2 of the bill improves the integrity of the small business capital gains tax concessions, in line with the measures announced in the 2017-18 budget to improve integrity and ensure that small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted. Currently, some taxpayers are able to access the small business CGT concessions for assets that are unrelated to their small businesses. The proposed amendment applies to CGT events that occur on or after 1 July 2017. This application is consistent with the 2017-18 budget announcements to ensure that small business CGT concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business—for instance, by arranging their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the test for determining eligibility of the concessions. The proposed amendments are needed to improve the integrity of the concessions and ensure that they are appropriately targeted for the benefit of genuine small businesses. The small business CGT concessions provide taxpayers with full or partial relief from taxation on capital gains on the disposal of assets related to their business.


There are four existing small business CGT concessions. The first is retirement exemption—lifetime limit exempting $500,000 of capital gains from disposing of active assets on retirement. If the taxpayer is under 55 years of age, money from the disposal of the asset must be paid into a complying superannuation fund or a retirement savings account. There is a 50 per cent active asset reduction—a 50 per cent reduction in the capital gains made from the disposal of an asset used in a business. There is a 15-year exemption—a 100 per cent exemption for active assets owned for at least 15 years where the taxpayer is over the age of 55 and is retiring or permanently incapacitated. And there is the rollover deferral of all or part of a capital gain for two years or longer if the taxpayer requires a replacement asset or incurs expenditure on making capital improvements to an existing asset. These concessions help small businesses grow and reinvest their profits as well as contribute to their retirement savings through the sale of their business. This is about ensuring that these concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small business owners. 


The proposed amendment will mean that small business CGT concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in small business, or ownership interests in a small business. As a result of the consultation process, amendments to the exposure draft were made to streamline the operation of the integrity rules surrounding the use of cash and financial instruments as part of the business. The requirement for cash and financial instruments to be inherently connected with the business will continue to apply. An additional integrity rule is also being introduced to ensure that there is no incentive for taxpayers to enter into artificial arrangements for the purpose of meeting this test. 


For the purpose of testing the size of an enterprise or company or trust being disposed of, an entity is treated as controlling another entity if its interest in that entity is 20 per cent or more. This means that more entities will be considered to be connected with each other and will need to include their assets or turnover for the purpose of this test. The lowering of this threshold to 20 per cent is a necessary tightening to ensure the concessions can only be accessed in relation to genuine small businesses. Importantly, these tests apply on an entity-by-entity basis. The taxpayer at the top of a chain of companies or trusts may not qualify for the concession in respect of shares or interest it holds—for example, because that chain includes an indirect interest in a large business. However, another taxpayer in the same chain of companies or trusts may qualify for the concessions in respect of shares or interest it holds in a small business. 


Let's take a tradesman in my electorate as an example—say, John the plumber. He started his plumbing business at the age of 25 after receiving all of his qualifications, building his business over 30 years to be a modestly successful entity, employing apprentices and becoming a local household name—in the area, of course. John, now in his mid-50s, can no longer do the arduous work he previously did over the past 30 years. John decides to sell his business and retire. This is what the Liberal Party has given John, a person who has risked going out on his own to start a business, has put his home on the line, has put his hand in his own pocket, has employed apprentices and has contributed to our community and the wider economy: he can now retire without having to pay capital gains tax, rebalancing the risk-for-reward equation. 


The Turnbull government is committed to supporting small businesses through tax relief and initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which was extended for a further 12 months in Tuesday night's budget as outlined by the Treasurer. These small business CGT concessions assist owners of small businesses by providing relief from CGT on the disposal of assets related to their business, helping them to reinvest and grow, as well as contributing to their retirement savings through the sale of the business—but, above all, by encouraging entrepreneurship. The concessions themselves are not changing and will continue to be available to genuine small businesses and taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets of less than $6 million. 


Key features of the new law include: limiting the size of the company or trust being disposed of, to ensure that it is a genuine small business; clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interests in the company or trust, to ensure that taxpayers do not benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote; and modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares in companies and interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities, which will prevent the concessions from being available where most of the value of the company or trust is unrelated to the small business activities.


Additional integrity rules also apply to ensure that the new tests cannot be manipulated or avoided. Schedule 3 of this bill delivers on a key commitment in the government's fin-tech statement, removing ambiguity from the tax law and clarifying that early stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative Australian fin-tech businesses. This bill builds on the government's $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda and highlights our commitment to support innovative—




Mr Husic:
  All front; no form.




Mr FALINSKI:
  The member for Chifley seems surprised to hear these things. The bill highlights our commitment to support innovative businesses in Australia and to build a culture of entrepreneurship and risk taking. The member for Chifley should take advantage of these great new programs that we're introducing. This will improve access to venture capital for fin-tech start-ups and assist these businesses to start, innovate, grow and succeed.


I have many fin-tech companies within my community. Unifii, for example, is a company based in my area that has developed a digital transformation platform that enables large corporate and government enterprises to create and deploy powerful business applications that in hours or days completely eliminate paper processes. Unifii has developed all the intellectual property here in Australia, and every line of code has been written by Australian software developers based in Warriewood, in Sydney. With over two million users already on the platform, the company is delivering enormous economic benefit to Australian businesses and government agencies, and it is expanding internationally to major markets. Unifii is a great example of local talent delivering enormous value to the Australian economy, with very significant export potential.


Schedule 4 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to continue to exempt from income tax the payments made as reparation to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Unlike compensation, a reparation payment represents an acknowledgement by Defence that the abuse suffered by the complainant was wrong, that it can have a lasting and serious impact and also that in the past Defence was not positioned appropriately to respond to abuse in many cases. The recipient of a reparation payment should receive the full benefit of that payment and, as such, the payment should be exempt from income tax.


Previous reparation payments made under the former Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were tax exempt. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016, and in the 2017-18 budget the government announced it was expanding the Defence Force Ombudsman's role to make recommendations on reparation payments in relation to complaints of abuse in Defence. The Defence Force Ombudsman may make recommendations in respect of historical cases of abuse occurring on or before 30 June 2014.


Tax systems at their best should be broad, even and fair to everyone. They should encourage entrepreneurship and allow it to be rewarding. They should recognise the great risk that people undertake, and with that great risk should come equivalent rewards. This bill does that, so I commend the bill to this House.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (16:53):  This Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, which deals with tax integrity and the euphemistic 'other measures', actually covers the great areas of tax havens and multinational tax. When I talk to members of my community, the taxation issue that they raise with me most after WA's distribution of the GST is the lack of a crackdown on multinationals who don't pay their tax. That is the No. 2 taxation issue that members of my community raise with me on a regular basis. I think that's a very useful point to make. It's a useful point to make because it points to the priorities of ordinary Australians. The reason they raise the need for us to ensure that multinational corporations pay tax and don't offshore tax or minimise tax is that they understand that, in order to ensure their access to the essential services they need from government, we need to be able to properly fund our education system, our health system, defence and everything else that the Commonwealth government does—as well as not giving away masses of money to the big banks—and part of that is making sure that there's some integrity to our tax system so that the money that should be paid in taxation is actually paid.


Tax havens threaten Australia's tax base. When our tax revenue gets lost to tax havens, Australians ultimately have to pay higher taxes or, as many constituents in the electorate of Burt realise, suffer cuts to vital services. For example, the Cayman Islands has been criticised by the OECD and by the tax commissioner for its excessive secrecy. There are more companies in the Cayman Islands than people. A single building in the Caymans, Ugland House, is apparently home to over 18,000 companies. The tax commissioner has said in a speech to The Tax Institute:


Many of these matters involve deliberate tax evasion, often using overseas tax havens or complex corporate structures to avoid detection and recovery.


The shock waves from the Panama Papers and similar scandals involving corporations and high-net-worth individuals aggressively minimising their tax are felt around the world. Other governments have been jolted into action on transparency measures since the public outcry over the Panama Papers. The Turnbull government, however—wait for it—has done virtually nothing.


With rising inequality and rising government debt, the time for acting on tax havens has not only come; it's almost gone. We need to get started on this. We need to make sure there's real action. Tax havens have been estimated to hold $7.5 trillion of the world's financial wealth, costing the global economy $200 billion in lost taxes every year. Labor announced, back in 2017, a comprehensive tax haven transparency package, including tax domicile disclosure for government procurement tenders; whistleblower protections and rewards; reporting of tax haven exposure to shareholders; and public reporting of how much tax is paid in jurisdictions that a firm operates in, along with related materials. Meanwhile, what has the government been doing? It has been backtracking on a beneficial ownership register and has commissioned an unreleased, secret Board of Taxation review into the 2016-17 budget measure on OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of tax.


Why has it backtracked on these measures? One in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax in at least the last three years, but the priority of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is still to give over $80 billion in tax cuts to big business. We know that Australia is missing out on billions in tax revenue thanks to the loopholes that continue to exist in our taxation system and which the Turnbull government refuses to properly close, despite Labor saying that we will cooperate with them in this area. The introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor, could help stem the flow of this missing money. But the Treasurer doesn't want to close those loopholes. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy this government seems to have is a big company tax cut.


Labor has a different plan, and I've outlined some of the parts of Labor's plan. The point here is that, unlike the many criticisms that we, on all sides, receive in politics that government and opposition can't work together, this is an area of law where we could be working together better to create better law to make sure we have more integrity in our tax system, instead of doing what the government is doing: continuing to bring forward piecemeal pieces of legislation so that it can say it's working on tax integrity and on closing down multinational tax loopholes—which it does frequently say—while in actual fact leaving loopholes open and not doing the full work, even some of the work it said it would do, to close these loopholes. These are the things that need to happen, but the government refuses to do them, which is really quite disappointing. As I said, this is the second biggest tax issue that people in my community raise with me. They know that if we don't get this fixed it results in cuts to their services.


There are other parts of what I referred to as the euphemistic use of 'other measures' in this bill. We see the improvement of tax integrity not only by looking at tax havens and other areas of multinational taxation but by looking at improving the integrity of the small-business CGT concessions. There are some amendments Labor thinks should be made in this area. One of the things that stuck out for me when I looked at this part of the bill was that, despite the fact that it was only on Tuesday—only two days ago—that the government handed down their 2018-19 budget, this is a measure from the 2017-18 budget. The government are really running the parliament well; we're still getting around to trying to deal with issues from the last budget measures, and they've just handed down the latest budget. Maybe we need to include other categories in the forward estimates: one saying, 'This is what we think we're going to do in the next financial year,' and another saying, 'These are the things we might get around to doing, but we don't really know if we'll include it, and hopefully we'll be able to work it through parliament.' These are the areas we actually want to agree with them on. These are areas we want to help them on.


It brings to mind other areas of legislation that are in this space—things like working with the fin-tech sector, which is the other part of schedule 3. Again, this is a measure that is from the last budget that we are only just now getting around to dealing with in the chamber of the House of Representatives.




Mr Husic:
  It's from 2016-17.




Mr KEOGH:
  Thank you. I refer to the member for Chifley's very eloquent point—this is from two budgets ago. I wasn't even in the parliament when they budgeted for this. I've had to come into the parliament—the people of Burt had to elect me—so we could get on with this. I thank the people of Burt for doing that. Imagine how far behind we'd be otherwise.


This is a bit like the NBN under this government. It almost goes backwards. It is amazing we have a fin-tech sector in this country, given the way the government goes around legislating for it. It's a bit like a sandbox it tried to create—despite the fact that we highlighted some of the issues that it would have with it—and realised that it doesn't actually work and now it has got to fix it again.


It's a bit like when we tried to create a better way for start-ups to raise capital online. That is another piece of legislation they put into parliament about which we said: 'This is great and we're happy to move on this. By the way, there are a few things you'd better fix up because we think it's probably not going to work the way you think it's going to work.' Then, 12 months later, they said: 'You're right about that. We'd better fix it up; we'll bring in legislation'. We are nearly 12 months past that point, and they haven't even gotten it through the parliament yet—in fact, they haven't even brought it on for debate in the Senate yet.


This really comes back to the point on the concerns we have about this piece of legislation. This is good legislation in theory, but there are things in schedules 3 and 4 in particular that we say need to be improved or fixed up. We are a party that wants to work with the government on making sure that our tax laws have integrity, that we capture multinational tax loss and that we provide an effective system of taxation and an effective regulatory environment for our fin-tech sector and start-up sector. We want to make sure we get it right. I don't want to find myself back here in six months time debating more legislation to fix this legislation, when it's taken two years to get around debating it in the first place.


Whilst overall we support this legislation and the intent of the legislation, as I said before, what it really highlights is that what we really need is Labor's plan to deal with multinational taxation to make sure we actually fix the issue of companies and high-net-wealth individuals being able to offshore their profits and their high incomes to avoid paying tax in Australia, which is where it's needed, so we can provide the services that ordinary Australians rely on. The Liberal government, when it comes to this area, are all light and mirrors. They make it look like they are doing something, and they say they are doing something, but in reality it's a half-baked approach.


It's a bit like their half-baked approach of looking at the financial sector and the big banks in this country. On one hand, they say, 'We're going to give you a big tax cut.' On the other hand, they say to the public—kicking and screaming, I might point out—'We'll hold a royal commission.' Then they look at some of the things that come out of that royal commission and say: 'Look at that bad behaviour! We'll throw the book at them. We'll make sure they get tough penalties. We'll make sure any criminal behaviour gets investigated and looked into.' Then, lo and behold, they hand down a budget, and when we go through the detail to see what's happening with ASIC, $20 million or $30 million is disappearing from ASIC, the agency that would be investigating and enforcing against the banks and our financial sector. Nearly $2 million was ripped out of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the agency that would be prosecuting them. What we see is a continuation of the protection rackets for the big banks and the financial sector in Australia. Here it is again. It's almost a protection racket. The government will say, 'We are fixing up multinational taxation,' but at the end of the day it's all smoke and mirrors.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (17:04):  I think you'd be aware, Deputy Speaker Goodenough, as many others would: in this place, you can't even scratch yourself without running into a 'parliamentary friends of' group. These groups are doing some really good work, but there are a lot of them that seem to pop up with a great degree of frequency. I have a recommendation for the coalition: given how much they talk about this sector, particularly the fin-tech sector, and their inability to get anything done, I think they need to create the 'faux friends of fin-tech'.


The coalition talk a lot about how close they are to the fin-tech community. They talk about all this legislation that they're putting forward. They're always there with the media release. They're always there with the announcement. They're always there to try to claim some credit and show that they've got a fin-tech community. The Treasurer brings together the fin-tech community in his little consultative group and says, 'We're going to be putting these things forward.' Then, when you match the words against reality, you find a massive gulf. This is definitely the case with elements in this bill.


I will restrict my comments to the venture capital component, but I think that it is telling, particularly with this section, which should be relatively straightforward—but then you realise the enormous gestation period, the time it took to get to this point, which reflects that, while the coalition talk a big game on fin-tech, they don't deliver. This schedule would give the appearance of being fairly straightforward when someone reads the explanatory memorandum and understands what's going on. It allows for early stage venture capital limited partnerships and VCLP arrangements to change the way in which they can, where they've been prohibited before, back investments in the banking, finance and insurance areas—all straightforward. But what I have been finding out when talking with stakeholders about this is how long it took to get to this point—how long it took for this straightforward move to happen.


FinTech Australia—and I went and checked this out—put out a policy paper on this very issue in February 2016. The government, in its 2016-17 budget—May of 2016—said: 'Yes, we're going to do this. We'll move ahead on this.' And it was not until October 2017 that the government, through Treasury, started to consult on amendments to allow this to happen. So from February and May 2016 we get to October 2017. Again, they make the big announcements, claim the credit and, when the hard work needs to be done, are nowhere to be seen—they drag it out. The sector and people in the sector have raised with me that they're not entirely happy with what's been put forward in this bill. Again, it's a straightforward measure, but they still don't think that it's picked up their concerns. For example—and I had highlighted to me—in 3.26 of the explanatory memorandum it states that a fin-tech may be eligible for the tax concession when developing its technology. However—and this is what has been raised with me—it then goes on to say that when a business is commercialising the technology it would no longer be eligible. As has been raised with me: 'This hardly seems like a certain, longer term platform for a venture capital firm to make an investment in a fin-tech, given that the VC is only making the investment because it's hoping the fin-tech will be able to commercialise and profit from the technology.' This is what they're raising with me, and I'm sure they have raised it with Treasury.


It's another bit of legislation after some of the other stuff that was being done in this space to reform the VCLP and ESVCLP arrangements that we've already—we haven't even debated the regulatory sandbox and the other measures that were contained in there as it pertains to venture capital. The government hasn't even bothered to bring that debate in here. We're still having those concerns, and that they're not being taken seriously, raised with us. We are going to be moving an amendment that this be reviewed so that we can see if it's actually successful, because here are some firms that simply, in the banking, finance and insurance space, if they develop their product, can provide a competitive alternative to existing arrangements. The banks are so fearful of things like opening up banking data not because of a new-found commitment to protecting certain consumers or a new-found love of privacy after some of the breaches we've seen in the last few weeks. What they're really scared witless of is the fact that the fin-tech community, particularly in Australia, will offer a very strong and competitive alternative to what people have had to cop from the banks and financial services sector in times past. We should be encouraging them. We back the government's commitment, but what we really back is concrete reform.


As I said, we have this legislation that we've already picked up stakeholder reticence about because it doesn't necessarily pick up all their concerns. They are concerned, for example, about going through with Innovation and Science Australia and expecting some of the rulings, even though admittedly this legislation is supposed to provide a bit more certainty through the public and private ruling mechanism. But there are people concerned that they can't get the green light from ISA to go ahead and then get the investment that's required. They are obviously going to be concerned in the longer term, when the broadening of the definition plays out, about how long it might take to see things happen there. So there are concerns with that.


We are not even debating the regulatory sandbox changes that need to happen. Again, the government said that this is really important, and it is important because they stuffed the first version. They had only four fin-techs go through their regulatory sandbox—less than half a dozen—and they need to fix that up now with a series of changes that still haven't been put to the parliament. The other thing that is just staggering for a government that says it is pro fin-tech—as I said, faux friends of fin-tech—how come they haven't had the wherewithal to bring in the final lot of changes through the Senate on equity crowdfunding?


Last year, when they rammed through this place the changes that we said would be overly bureaucratic, would not deliver the benefits they said would happen, and would not allow smaller firms to access the level of capital raising required to help those firms grow, they still put them through. At the time, I labelled it 'ScoMo's dodo', because we knew it was heading for one thing and one thing only—extinction—because it had to have a whole new set of changes put to it. That's what they did in September. They brought another round of legislation in to fix up the fatally flawed legislation that they had in March. They introduced it in this place in September last year and then it didn't go in through the Senate at the end of the year. We then waited for February for it to come in, and they didn't debate it then. Then we got to March and it still didn't get debated, and then we had the long break before the budget. Now it's come in, in the first week in May, and they haven't put it through the Senate. Mind you, this is after the opposition has offered every assurance that we will work with them. We want to see the time frame for the introduction shortened. We've said to the government continually that we will work with them on this—just bring the framework in. And they couldn't get it into the Senate this week. What does that mean for the fin-tech community or others in the early-stage innovation space? You now will not see this legislation debated until three-quarters of the way through June. The government has baked in a delay of six months from royal assent before the new regime takes place, which means it would be December of this year, notionally, before it comes in.


To their great credit, the government agreed with us to shorten that period of time. We wanted it even shorter. We wanted it introduced right from the start of the new financial year, but they still won't agree to it, because they're worried about ASIC, and ASIC is playing ping-pong, saying, 'It's up to the parliament to determine what happens.' They didn't even know at estimates that there was this six-month period.


But, again, ScoMo's dodo, now the 'go-slow by ScoMo', is going to create another dodo, because equity crowdfunding is now being overtaken by an alternative financing vehicle in the form of initial coin offerings, using cryptocurrency as a way to generate capital for early-stage innovators. So this is now just taking place on its own and it threatens to potentially outstrip what could be raised through equity crowdfunding anyway.


The bigger story in all this is that we've been debating this since May 2013. We made the reference to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee in May 2013 to set up the framework. The coalition government got the report in May 2014, but by 2018 we still don't have the actual framework in place. It has been five years—four under your coalition government, where you say that you're pro innovation, you say you're pro fin-tech sector, but you can't even get the reforms in. You drag it out so long that alternative vehicles for capital raisings emerge, which, I have to say, are less informative to investors and will require much more sophisticated investors to understand and interpret what's going on. It's been dragged out. You're either fair dinkum about encouraging fin-tech and the emergence of a stronger fin-tech sector in this country, or you're just fake friends of the sector, only wanting to be there for the click of the cameras and the writing of the stories. You're not there to actually put it through, and this is even when we're prepared to work with the coalition on this. It is a disgrace. This shouldn't happen. If you were pro business, if you were truly pro opening up alternative pathways for capital raising, you would have got it done, but you haven't.


It's just the same as the concerns we have with what's contained within schedule 3 of this legislation. Based on what we're hearing out of the fin-tech sector and what stakeholders are raising with us, you still haven't cleared it up. If the Treasurer's too busy, he has an assistant minister. Assign him to make sure this happens. He has enough space to be able to make this happen. I'm sure he wants to cut his teeth on this legislation—he'll do the summing-up in a few minutes time. So why don't they take the steps, task up the proper people, make this happen, get the legislation through and prove that they are more than words, that they are action, as opposed to what we're seeing right now?

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2018-05-10,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (17:16):  In summing up the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, I will say that this further delivers on this government's agenda to address multinational tax avoidance, ensures that the small-business capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted, ensures that we have the policy settings in order to foster innovation and makes the taxation of Defence abuse repatriation payments fairer. Schedule 1 of this bill demonstrates again our ongoing commitment to tackling multinational tax avoidance by further preventing large multinationals from avoiding tax on their Australian business profits through artificially structuring their affairs, which ultimately amounts to taxable income not being captured in the Australian tax net. The amendments contained in schedule 1 ensure that the multilateral anti-tax-avoidance law, which targets these egregious practices, will continue to operate as intended and deliver on the government's commitment to improving the integrity of Australia's tax system, which ultimately benefits all Australians.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to improve the integrity of the tax system and ensure that the small-business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted. These amendments give effect to the government's 2017-18 budget announcement that, from 1 July 2017, the concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. The key feature of the amendments is to test the size of the business being disposed of, to prevent inappropriate access to the concessions for assets unrelated to a small business. This ensures that these important concessions continue to benefit those who need them most, which are hardworking small businesses.


The government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global fin-tech hub. When I spoke at the fin-tech futures forum in Melbourne last week, the government were certainly congratulated on the work and support that we're providing fin-techs. Therefore, schedule 3 of this bill builds on our work to ensure that we have the policy settings best in place to foster this sort of innovation. Accordingly, schedule 3 amends the early stage venture capital limited partnership, venture capital limited partnership and tax incentives for early stage investor regimes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This clarifies that early stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses, removes ambiguity from the tax law, and provides certainty for venture capital investors. Again, we believe that this demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and risk taking in Australia and will help ensure innovative Australian businesses have access to the capital and, importantly, the expertise that they need to grow and succeed in this very competitive area.


In the 2017-18 budget the government announced it would expand the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to make recommendations for reparation payments. All complaints about abuse in the Defence Force made to the Defence Force Ombudsman will now include an assessment for a reparation payment. Similar reparation payments were previously administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. Reparation payments made by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were specifically exempt from income tax. Schedule 4 of this bill therefore ensures that the new reparation payments recommended by the Defence Force Ombudsman are exempt from income tax. Reparation payments are not intended to be compensation, and complainants will not be required to release the Commonwealth from any liability. Schedule 4 ensures the recipient of a reparation payment receives the full benefit of the payment and, importantly, is free from the obligation to pay income tax on it. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:21):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018 contains four tax integrity measures. Schedule 1 goes to toughening the multinational anti-avoidance law; schedule 2 goes to improving the integrity of small business capital gains tax concessions; schedule 3 is about fintech and venture capital amendments; and, finally, schedule 4 goes to tax exemption for payments made under the Defence Force Ombudsman Scheme. Labor supports schedules 1 and 4.


I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Coalition Government's failure to ensure tax integrity by improving tax haven transparency"".




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  Is the amendment seconded?




Ms Chesters:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.




Mr THISTLETHWAITE:
  In terms of schedule 1, regarding toughening the multinational anti-avoidance law, the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that the multinational anti-avoidance law applies appropriately to artificial and contrived arrangements involving trusts and partnerships entered into by multinational entities to avoid the taxation of business profits in Australia. We note that the schedule implements a technical integrity measure underpinning the multinational anti-avoidance law.


The Turnbull government has regularly made much of statements that Labor voted against the multinational anti-avoidance law, but this is simply not true. In this House, Labor supported that bill and, in the Senate, Labor voted against a government-Greens amendment. Yes, that's right: the government teamed up with the Greens to water down the tax transparency law and reporting requirements for large companies. The effect of that amendment—which was ultimately successful through the Greens and the coalition government—was to reduce the number of Australian companies who were required to report their tax arrangements each year. Some of those big companies were raking in revenue close to $16 billion but were paying no tax. The government wanted to reduce the number of those companies that were required to report every year, and guess what? The Greens teamed up with them and allowed that to occur. Labor ultimately facilitated the passage of the multinational anti-avoidance law in both houses, but we did that over protestations about reducing the exposure and the scrutiny that was allowed by that law by reducing the number of companies subject to it.


The fact is that the Turnbull government have been a light touch and have had a hands-off approach when it comes to big business and those at the top end of town, and we've seen this over the past couple of years with their approach to the banking industry. The fact is that for 600 days they avoided and actively opposed a royal commission into the banking sector in Australia. Labor's been proven right, once again, in the evidence that's come out of that inquiry—there was systemic and substantial rorting by this industry, undermining Australians' finances, and it needed to be looked at, and that's what's occurring at the moment. We welcome the fact that the commissioner's doing a fantastic job, and we await the outcomes of his interim report in September and ultimately a final report in February next year. This is a reflection of this government's ideological emphasis: checks and balances on government power but no consideration given to the checks and balances on the power of big businesses and the wealthy to avoid their community obligations, particularly when it comes to paying their fair share of tax. 


The fact is that the Turnbull government, from the top down, including the extreme free-market fringe, are more concerned with so-called red tape and the banks' cost of doing business than with appropriately regulating them. They see tax and the collection of tax revenue as the biggest cost of doing business. They call it a tax grab. But we know, of course, that one in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax for at least the past three years. That's no taxation revenue that could have been used for funding important social resources like health, education and infrastructure. Over a series of decades what we've seen is a number of these corporations being very adept at using accounting practices to make loans to subsidiaries in other countries, to transfer funds to subsidiaries in other countries where there is a lower corporate tax rate, and to avoid paying their fair share of tax in Australia. It was only when Labor began to highlight this—and, indeed, when these practices were highlighted through international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD—that we began to get action from this government. This is despite tax transparency laws that show just how much the people of Australia are losing through this light-touch approach to collecting their fair share of taxation. Yet the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have still given priority to big business over reining in some of that taxation revenue to ensure we have a fairer budget balance from the corporate sector. We all know that, in the budget that was released just a couple of days ago, there remains the $80 billion tax cut for the biggest businesses in this country. Don't worry about actually getting what's owed to the Australian people. This government, as part of the trickle-down economics philosophy, is more intent on providing a tax cut to the big end of town. 


Over the course of the past week some very interesting research has been released in the United States about the effect of the first round of corporate tax cuts in America, and—surprise, surprise!—what that research has uncovered is where that first round of corporate tax cuts went. Guess where the benefits of those corporate tax cuts went? Well, they didn't go into the pay packets of the workers of those corporations, I can tell you that; they went into profits and to the shareholders through increased dividends. It's clear, based on studies like that and a litany of others throughout the world, that this trickle-down approach to economics of cutting taxes for corporations in the wish and the hope that they will pass them on to their workers and employ more people is complete rubbish. It doesn't happen. These studies that have been released in the United States prove that. Cutting penalty rates for workers who work on weekends in the hospitality industry only makes things worse. These are the reasons why people's real incomes have not been increasing in Australia over the last decade, why families are feeling the pinch and why workers are feeling the pinch and feeling left behind by this government.


Many of these matters involve deliberate tax evasion, often through the use of overseas tax havens or complex corporate structures to avoid detection and recovery. Tax havens have been estimated to hold $7.5 trillion of the world's financial wealth, costing the global economy $200 billion in lost taxes every year. The strategy of choice used by those deliberately evading their fair share of tax is a clear and present threat to Australia's taxation base. When tax revenue gets lost to tax havens, Australians ultimately have to pay higher taxes or suffer cuts to those vital services and shared social resources that I referred to earlier, particularly health, education and infrastructure.


In 2017, Labor announced a comprehensive tax haven transparency package. The policy includes tax domicile disclosure for government procurement tenders, whistleblower protections and even rewards for reporting of tax haven exposure to shareholders, and public reporting of just how much tax is paid in jurisdictions where these firms operate. Yet this light-touch, hands-off government has been backtracking on a beneficial ownership registry—another Labor policy that we announced in 2017. This registry would help identify the ultimate owners that sit behind some of these shell companies. It's about improving the transparency that is there with regard to the operation of these companies and, ultimately, being able to hold someone accountable when they do use these tricky taxation and accounting measures to transfer profits overseas to avoid paying tax.


This government also commissioned an unrelated secret Board of Taxation review on the 2016-17 budget measures and the OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of taxation information. Of course, we only know that because of Senate estimates. The report was released only days ago because Senators Ketter and McAllister were able to get that via the Senate estimates process. The government didn't even want to release this report and what was actually going on in terms of some of the taxation transparency measures in the Australian economy.


The fact is that the Treasurer doesn't want to close a lot of these loopholes. Of course, we heard absolutely nothing from him about cracking down on tax havens in this budget. We know that the introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor, could help stem the flow of missing money that should be flowing to the Australian people. Corporate profits are soaring and, while Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack in terms of competitiveness and the actual rate of taxation for corporations, the only policy that this government has had in this area is to cut corporate taxes and to give those companies a big advantage.


Labor knows what needs to be done—and, if we're elected, we're willing to do it—to crack down on multinational tax avoidance. We have announced a plan to close those loopholes and attack the deliberate use of tax havens, first, by tightening debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies to improve their budget by billions over the medium term.


The second element of our plan is introducing the public reporting of country-by-country reports. We need to see the high-level tax information about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations.


Third is providing protection for whistleblowers who report on those entities evading tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Where a whistleblower's information results in more tax being paid, we should allow them to collect a share of the tax penalty with a reward of up to $250,000.


Fourth is introducing a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. This approach will allow the public to find out just who really owns companies and who is behind these corporate and accounting practices of setting up different shell companies to avoid the scrutiny of the public. It's clear that shareholders shouldn't be able to use complex structures and sham ownership arrangements to avoid complying with corporate transparency rules.


Fifth is introducing mandatory shareholder reporting of tax haven exposure. Companies must disclose to their shareholders, as a material tax risk, if the company is doing business in some of these tax havens. Unfortunately, that is not occurring at the moment.


Sixth is appointing a community sector representative to boards of taxation to ensure the community sector's voice is heard in tax design and review processes.


Seventh is introducing public reporting of Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, or AUSTRAC, data and requiring the annual public release of international cash flow data.


Eighth is requiring government tenders to disclose their country of tax domicile.


Ninth is developing guidelines for investment by superannuation funds. This should be done by the Australian Taxation Office in collaboration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.


The final element of our plan requires the Australian tax office's annual report to provide information on the number and size of tax settlements.


I want to make some comments in respect of schedule 2 of the bill, which goes to improving the integrity of small-business capital gains tax concessions. These changes include additional conditions that must be satisfied to apply the small-business CGT concessions to capital gains. The amendments implement the measure announced in the 2017-18 budget as 'Tax integrity package—improving small business capital gains tax concessions' and apply to CGT events that occur on or after 1 July 2017.


However, we note that the original 2017-18 budget proposal is vague in its details. Many tax professionals and stakeholders have said that it would not be until the release of the exposure draft legislation that those affected would become aware of just how they were going to be affected by this legislation. These stakeholders make the reasonable claim that, due to a lack of detail, taxpayers who have conducted their tax affairs in good faith could be caught by changes that go beyond what was flagged in the previous budget. They argue that, to help prevent adverse consequences for taxpayers who have been acting in good faith but couldn't reasonably be expected to foresee the detailed amendments finally unveiled in the exposure draft, the implementation date should be changed from 1 July 2017, as per the original budget announcement, to 8 February 2018. That's the exposure draft release date. In light of those stakeholder concerns, Labor supports the start date being 8 February 2018, as proposed by the tax professionals community.


In terms of schedule 3, which goes to fin-tech and venture capital amendments, these amendments in income tax law and the Venture Capital Act ensure that venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fin-tech businesses. This schedule partially implements a 2016-17 budget measure, the National Innovation and Science Agenda, as it expands the new arrangements for venture capital limited partnerships.


Labor notes that the main observation following consultation with key stakeholders was the timing of the concessions proposed in this measure. They still leave some uncertainty about the long-term eligibility for concessions in the commercialisation process. This has led to some uncertainty about whether investment decisions will actually be improved. Labor, again, has requested that the minister instigate a look at the impact of investment on the venture capital concession provisions overall, including the measures in this bill, to ensure that they are operating as intended. To provide an added layer of certainty, the amendments should allow Innovation and Science Australia to make public and private findings on assessments.


In conclusion, once again, Labor support the tax integrity measures in this bill, but we are somewhat sceptical about and somewhat dismayed by this government's light-handed approach when it comes to tackling tax avoidance in Australia. This particular coalition government has been very sloppy in its approach to key stakeholders on important tax matters—namely, those that go to the notions of transparency and accountability by corporations when it comes to taxation, how much they're paying and where they're paying it. Labor have laid out a clear plan of improved measures that would bring greater transparency and accountability to this industry. We commend that approach to the government and we hope that it sincerely looks at adopting some of those amendments.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-05-10,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (16:39):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. As I am Chair of the House Committee on Tax and Revenue, this bill is close to my heart. Yes, there is a beating heart at the core of all good tax legislation. This bill fulfils the Turnbull government's commitment to ensure Australians can have confidence in a fair and equitable tax system whereby everyone plays by the same set of rules and pays their fair share of tax. This government, more than any other government in the past, has legislated tough laws to crack down on tax avoidance across the entire tax system and across all sectors of the economy.


This bill makes a number of key changes across four schedules that all work to make our tax system fairer, more cost-effective and efficient and to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules. Firstly, schedule 1, better known as MAAL, makes technical amendments to ensure that the government's multinational tax avoidance law operates as intended. As a result of this amendment, multinationals will no longer be able to use corporate structures with foreign trusts and partnerships to avoid the application of the MAAL. These changes were announced in last year's budget as part of the government's commitment to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax.


The OECD has estimated that, globally, between US$100 billion and US$240 billion of corporate tax revenue is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies developed by tax lawyers in new tax jurisdictions, like Liechtenstein and the Bahamas. As part of the global effort to combat multinational tax avoidance, the OECD G20 base erosion and profit-shifting project has delivered a number of recommendations to strengthen countries' tax integrity rules and ensure that the international tax system works as intended. Since 2015, Australia has implemented a range of such actions. The government has also taken additional action on multinational tax avoidance beyond the OECD recommendations, including implementing the multinational anti-avoidance law and the diverted profits tax, both of which discourage large multinationals from artificially diverting profits offshore.


The MAAL, which took effect from 1 January 2016, prevents multinationals from escaping Australian tax by using artificial or contrived arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence in Australia. The ATO has observed a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government. The ATO estimates that more than $7 billion in sales revenue annually is already being added to the Australian tax base as a result of the government's MAAL. Already we have seen 38 multinational entities changing, or they are in the process of changing, their tax affairs to bring their Australian sourced sales back onshore in compliance with the MAAL, including Google and Facebook. This is also competitively neutral, putting foreign multinationals on the same level as Australian owned and run businesses.


Secondly, schedule 2 of the bill improves the integrity of the small business capital gains tax concessions, in line with the measures announced in the 2017-18 budget to improve integrity and ensure that small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted. Currently, some taxpayers are able to access the small business CGT concessions for assets that are unrelated to their small businesses. The proposed amendment applies to CGT events that occur on or after 1 July 2017. This application is consistent with the 2017-18 budget announcements to ensure that small business CGT concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business—for instance, by arranging their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the test for determining eligibility of the concessions. The proposed amendments are needed to improve the integrity of the concessions and ensure that they are appropriately targeted for the benefit of genuine small businesses. The small business CGT concessions provide taxpayers with full or partial relief from taxation on capital gains on the disposal of assets related to their business.


There are four existing small business CGT concessions. The first is retirement exemption—lifetime limit exempting $500,000 of capital gains from disposing of active assets on retirement. If the taxpayer is under 55 years of age, money from the disposal of the asset must be paid into a complying superannuation fund or a retirement savings account. There is a 50 per cent active asset reduction—a 50 per cent reduction in the capital gains made from the disposal of an asset used in a business. There is a 15-year exemption—a 100 per cent exemption for active assets owned for at least 15 years where the taxpayer is over the age of 55 and is retiring or permanently incapacitated. And there is the rollover deferral of all or part of a capital gain for two years or longer if the taxpayer requires a replacement asset or incurs expenditure on making capital improvements to an existing asset. These concessions help small businesses grow and reinvest their profits as well as contribute to their retirement savings through the sale of their business. This is about ensuring that these concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small business owners. 


The proposed amendment will mean that small business CGT concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in small business, or ownership interests in a small business. As a result of the consultation process, amendments to the exposure draft were made to streamline the operation of the integrity rules surrounding the use of cash and financial instruments as part of the business. The requirement for cash and financial instruments to be inherently connected with the business will continue to apply. An additional integrity rule is also being introduced to ensure that there is no incentive for taxpayers to enter into artificial arrangements for the purpose of meeting this test. 


For the purpose of testing the size of an enterprise or company or trust being disposed of, an entity is treated as controlling another entity if its interest in that entity is 20 per cent or more. This means that more entities will be considered to be connected with each other and will need to include their assets or turnover for the purpose of this test. The lowering of this threshold to 20 per cent is a necessary tightening to ensure the concessions can only be accessed in relation to genuine small businesses. Importantly, these tests apply on an entity-by-entity basis. The taxpayer at the top of a chain of companies or trusts may not qualify for the concession in respect of shares or interest it holds—for example, because that chain includes an indirect interest in a large business. However, another taxpayer in the same chain of companies or trusts may qualify for the concessions in respect of shares or interest it holds in a small business. 


Let's take a tradesman in my electorate as an example—say, John the plumber. He started his plumbing business at the age of 25 after receiving all of his qualifications, building his business over 30 years to be a modestly successful entity, employing apprentices and becoming a local household name—in the area, of course. John, now in his mid-50s, can no longer do the arduous work he previously did over the past 30 years. John decides to sell his business and retire. This is what the Liberal Party has given John, a person who has risked going out on his own to start a business, has put his home on the line, has put his hand in his own pocket, has employed apprentices and has contributed to our community and the wider economy: he can now retire without having to pay capital gains tax, rebalancing the risk-for-reward equation. 


The Turnbull government is committed to supporting small businesses through tax relief and initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which was extended for a further 12 months in Tuesday night's budget as outlined by the Treasurer. These small business CGT concessions assist owners of small businesses by providing relief from CGT on the disposal of assets related to their business, helping them to reinvest and grow, as well as contributing to their retirement savings through the sale of the business—but, above all, by encouraging entrepreneurship. The concessions themselves are not changing and will continue to be available to genuine small businesses and taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets of less than $6 million. 


Key features of the new law include: limiting the size of the company or trust being disposed of, to ensure that it is a genuine small business; clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interests in the company or trust, to ensure that taxpayers do not benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote; and modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares in companies and interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities, which will prevent the concessions from being available where most of the value of the company or trust is unrelated to the small business activities.


Additional integrity rules also apply to ensure that the new tests cannot be manipulated or avoided. Schedule 3 of this bill delivers on a key commitment in the government's fin-tech statement, removing ambiguity from the tax law and clarifying that early stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative Australian fin-tech businesses. This bill builds on the government's $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda and highlights our commitment to support innovative—




Mr Husic:
  All front; no form.




Mr FALINSKI:
  The member for Chifley seems surprised to hear these things. The bill highlights our commitment to support innovative businesses in Australia and to build a culture of entrepreneurship and risk taking. The member for Chifley should take advantage of these great new programs that we're introducing. This will improve access to venture capital for fin-tech start-ups and assist these businesses to start, innovate, grow and succeed.


I have many fin-tech companies within my community. Unifii, for example, is a company based in my area that has developed a digital transformation platform that enables large corporate and government enterprises to create and deploy powerful business applications that in hours or days completely eliminate paper processes. Unifii has developed all the intellectual property here in Australia, and every line of code has been written by Australian software developers based in Warriewood, in Sydney. With over two million users already on the platform, the company is delivering enormous economic benefit to Australian businesses and government agencies, and it is expanding internationally to major markets. Unifii is a great example of local talent delivering enormous value to the Australian economy, with very significant export potential.


Schedule 4 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to continue to exempt from income tax the payments made as reparation to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Unlike compensation, a reparation payment represents an acknowledgement by Defence that the abuse suffered by the complainant was wrong, that it can have a lasting and serious impact and also that in the past Defence was not positioned appropriately to respond to abuse in many cases. The recipient of a reparation payment should receive the full benefit of that payment and, as such, the payment should be exempt from income tax.


Previous reparation payments made under the former Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were tax exempt. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016, and in the 2017-18 budget the government announced it was expanding the Defence Force Ombudsman's role to make recommendations on reparation payments in relation to complaints of abuse in Defence. The Defence Force Ombudsman may make recommendations in respect of historical cases of abuse occurring on or before 30 June 2014.


Tax systems at their best should be broad, even and fair to everyone. They should encourage entrepreneurship and allow it to be rewarding. They should recognise the great risk that people undertake, and with that great risk should come equivalent rewards. This bill does that, so I commend the bill to this House.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (16:53):  This Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, which deals with tax integrity and the euphemistic 'other measures', actually covers the great areas of tax havens and multinational tax. When I talk to members of my community, the taxation issue that they raise with me most after WA's distribution of the GST is the lack of a crackdown on multinationals who don't pay their tax. That is the No. 2 taxation issue that members of my community raise with me on a regular basis. I think that's a very useful point to make. It's a useful point to make because it points to the priorities of ordinary Australians. The reason they raise the need for us to ensure that multinational corporations pay tax and don't offshore tax or minimise tax is that they understand that, in order to ensure their access to the essential services they need from government, we need to be able to properly fund our education system, our health system, defence and everything else that the Commonwealth government does—as well as not giving away masses of money to the big banks—and part of that is making sure that there's some integrity to our tax system so that the money that should be paid in taxation is actually paid.


Tax havens threaten Australia's tax base. When our tax revenue gets lost to tax havens, Australians ultimately have to pay higher taxes or, as many constituents in the electorate of Burt realise, suffer cuts to vital services. For example, the Cayman Islands has been criticised by the OECD and by the tax commissioner for its excessive secrecy. There are more companies in the Cayman Islands than people. A single building in the Caymans, Ugland House, is apparently home to over 18,000 companies. The tax commissioner has said in a speech to The Tax Institute:


Many of these matters involve deliberate tax evasion, often using overseas tax havens or complex corporate structures to avoid detection and recovery.


The shock waves from the Panama Papers and similar scandals involving corporations and high-net-worth individuals aggressively minimising their tax are felt around the world. Other governments have been jolted into action on transparency measures since the public outcry over the Panama Papers. The Turnbull government, however—wait for it—has done virtually nothing.


With rising inequality and rising government debt, the time for acting on tax havens has not only come; it's almost gone. We need to get started on this. We need to make sure there's real action. Tax havens have been estimated to hold $7.5 trillion of the world's financial wealth, costing the global economy $200 billion in lost taxes every year. Labor announced, back in 2017, a comprehensive tax haven transparency package, including tax domicile disclosure for government procurement tenders; whistleblower protections and rewards; reporting of tax haven exposure to shareholders; and public reporting of how much tax is paid in jurisdictions that a firm operates in, along with related materials. Meanwhile, what has the government been doing? It has been backtracking on a beneficial ownership register and has commissioned an unreleased, secret Board of Taxation review into the 2016-17 budget measure on OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of tax.


Why has it backtracked on these measures? One in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax in at least the last three years, but the priority of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is still to give over $80 billion in tax cuts to big business. We know that Australia is missing out on billions in tax revenue thanks to the loopholes that continue to exist in our taxation system and which the Turnbull government refuses to properly close, despite Labor saying that we will cooperate with them in this area. The introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor, could help stem the flow of this missing money. But the Treasurer doesn't want to close those loopholes. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy this government seems to have is a big company tax cut.


Labor has a different plan, and I've outlined some of the parts of Labor's plan. The point here is that, unlike the many criticisms that we, on all sides, receive in politics that government and opposition can't work together, this is an area of law where we could be working together better to create better law to make sure we have more integrity in our tax system, instead of doing what the government is doing: continuing to bring forward piecemeal pieces of legislation so that it can say it's working on tax integrity and on closing down multinational tax loopholes—which it does frequently say—while in actual fact leaving loopholes open and not doing the full work, even some of the work it said it would do, to close these loopholes. These are the things that need to happen, but the government refuses to do them, which is really quite disappointing. As I said, this is the second biggest tax issue that people in my community raise with me. They know that if we don't get this fixed it results in cuts to their services.


There are other parts of what I referred to as the euphemistic use of 'other measures' in this bill. We see the improvement of tax integrity not only by looking at tax havens and other areas of multinational taxation but by looking at improving the integrity of the small-business CGT concessions. There are some amendments Labor thinks should be made in this area. One of the things that stuck out for me when I looked at this part of the bill was that, despite the fact that it was only on Tuesday—only two days ago—that the government handed down their 2018-19 budget, this is a measure from the 2017-18 budget. The government are really running the parliament well; we're still getting around to trying to deal with issues from the last budget measures, and they've just handed down the latest budget. Maybe we need to include other categories in the forward estimates: one saying, 'This is what we think we're going to do in the next financial year,' and another saying, 'These are the things we might get around to doing, but we don't really know if we'll include it, and hopefully we'll be able to work it through parliament.' These are the areas we actually want to agree with them on. These are areas we want to help them on.


It brings to mind other areas of legislation that are in this space—things like working with the fin-tech sector, which is the other part of schedule 3. Again, this is a measure that is from the last budget that we are only just now getting around to dealing with in the chamber of the House of Representatives.




Mr Husic:
  It's from 2016-17.




Mr KEOGH:
  Thank you. I refer to the member for Chifley's very eloquent point—this is from two budgets ago. I wasn't even in the parliament when they budgeted for this. I've had to come into the parliament—the people of Burt had to elect me—so we could get on with this. I thank the people of Burt for doing that. Imagine how far behind we'd be otherwise.


This is a bit like the NBN under this government. It almost goes backwards. It is amazing we have a fin-tech sector in this country, given the way the government goes around legislating for it. It's a bit like a sandbox it tried to create—despite the fact that we highlighted some of the issues that it would have with it—and realised that it doesn't actually work and now it has got to fix it again.


It's a bit like when we tried to create a better way for start-ups to raise capital online. That is another piece of legislation they put into parliament about which we said: 'This is great and we're happy to move on this. By the way, there are a few things you'd better fix up because we think it's probably not going to work the way you think it's going to work.' Then, 12 months later, they said: 'You're right about that. We'd better fix it up; we'll bring in legislation'. We are nearly 12 months past that point, and they haven't even gotten it through the parliament yet—in fact, they haven't even brought it on for debate in the Senate yet.


This really comes back to the point on the concerns we have about this piece of legislation. This is good legislation in theory, but there are things in schedules 3 and 4 in particular that we say need to be improved or fixed up. We are a party that wants to work with the government on making sure that our tax laws have integrity, that we capture multinational tax loss and that we provide an effective system of taxation and an effective regulatory environment for our fin-tech sector and start-up sector. We want to make sure we get it right. I don't want to find myself back here in six months time debating more legislation to fix this legislation, when it's taken two years to get around debating it in the first place.


Whilst overall we support this legislation and the intent of the legislation, as I said before, what it really highlights is that what we really need is Labor's plan to deal with multinational taxation to make sure we actually fix the issue of companies and high-net-wealth individuals being able to offshore their profits and their high incomes to avoid paying tax in Australia, which is where it's needed, so we can provide the services that ordinary Australians rely on. The Liberal government, when it comes to this area, are all light and mirrors. They make it look like they are doing something, and they say they are doing something, but in reality it's a half-baked approach.


It's a bit like their half-baked approach of looking at the financial sector and the big banks in this country. On one hand, they say, 'We're going to give you a big tax cut.' On the other hand, they say to the public—kicking and screaming, I might point out—'We'll hold a royal commission.' Then they look at some of the things that come out of that royal commission and say: 'Look at that bad behaviour! We'll throw the book at them. We'll make sure they get tough penalties. We'll make sure any criminal behaviour gets investigated and looked into.' Then, lo and behold, they hand down a budget, and when we go through the detail to see what's happening with ASIC, $20 million or $30 million is disappearing from ASIC, the agency that would be investigating and enforcing against the banks and our financial sector. Nearly $2 million was ripped out of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the agency that would be prosecuting them. What we see is a continuation of the protection rackets for the big banks and the financial sector in Australia. Here it is again. It's almost a protection racket. The government will say, 'We are fixing up multinational taxation,' but at the end of the day it's all smoke and mirrors.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (17:04):  I think you'd be aware, Deputy Speaker Goodenough, as many others would: in this place, you can't even scratch yourself without running into a 'parliamentary friends of' group. These groups are doing some really good work, but there are a lot of them that seem to pop up with a great degree of frequency. I have a recommendation for the coalition: given how much they talk about this sector, particularly the fin-tech sector, and their inability to get anything done, I think they need to create the 'faux friends of fin-tech'.


The coalition talk a lot about how close they are to the fin-tech community. They talk about all this legislation that they're putting forward. They're always there with the media release. They're always there with the announcement. They're always there to try to claim some credit and show that they've got a fin-tech community. The Treasurer brings together the fin-tech community in his little consultative group and says, 'We're going to be putting these things forward.' Then, when you match the words against reality, you find a massive gulf. This is definitely the case with elements in this bill.


I will restrict my comments to the venture capital component, but I think that it is telling, particularly with this section, which should be relatively straightforward—but then you realise the enormous gestation period, the time it took to get to this point, which reflects that, while the coalition talk a big game on fin-tech, they don't deliver. This schedule would give the appearance of being fairly straightforward when someone reads the explanatory memorandum and understands what's going on. It allows for early stage venture capital limited partnerships and VCLP arrangements to change the way in which they can, where they've been prohibited before, back investments in the banking, finance and insurance areas—all straightforward. But what I have been finding out when talking with stakeholders about this is how long it took to get to this point—how long it took for this straightforward move to happen.


FinTech Australia—and I went and checked this out—put out a policy paper on this very issue in February 2016. The government, in its 2016-17 budget—May of 2016—said: 'Yes, we're going to do this. We'll move ahead on this.' And it was not until October 2017 that the government, through Treasury, started to consult on amendments to allow this to happen. So from February and May 2016 we get to October 2017. Again, they make the big announcements, claim the credit and, when the hard work needs to be done, are nowhere to be seen—they drag it out. The sector and people in the sector have raised with me that they're not entirely happy with what's been put forward in this bill. Again, it's a straightforward measure, but they still don't think that it's picked up their concerns. For example—and I had highlighted to me—in 3.26 of the explanatory memorandum it states that a fin-tech may be eligible for the tax concession when developing its technology. However—and this is what has been raised with me—it then goes on to say that when a business is commercialising the technology it would no longer be eligible. As has been raised with me: 'This hardly seems like a certain, longer term platform for a venture capital firm to make an investment in a fin-tech, given that the VC is only making the investment because it's hoping the fin-tech will be able to commercialise and profit from the technology.' This is what they're raising with me, and I'm sure they have raised it with Treasury.


It's another bit of legislation after some of the other stuff that was being done in this space to reform the VCLP and ESVCLP arrangements that we've already—we haven't even debated the regulatory sandbox and the other measures that were contained in there as it pertains to venture capital. The government hasn't even bothered to bring that debate in here. We're still having those concerns, and that they're not being taken seriously, raised with us. We are going to be moving an amendment that this be reviewed so that we can see if it's actually successful, because here are some firms that simply, in the banking, finance and insurance space, if they develop their product, can provide a competitive alternative to existing arrangements. The banks are so fearful of things like opening up banking data not because of a new-found commitment to protecting certain consumers or a new-found love of privacy after some of the breaches we've seen in the last few weeks. What they're really scared witless of is the fact that the fin-tech community, particularly in Australia, will offer a very strong and competitive alternative to what people have had to cop from the banks and financial services sector in times past. We should be encouraging them. We back the government's commitment, but what we really back is concrete reform.


As I said, we have this legislation that we've already picked up stakeholder reticence about because it doesn't necessarily pick up all their concerns. They are concerned, for example, about going through with Innovation and Science Australia and expecting some of the rulings, even though admittedly this legislation is supposed to provide a bit more certainty through the public and private ruling mechanism. But there are people concerned that they can't get the green light from ISA to go ahead and then get the investment that's required. They are obviously going to be concerned in the longer term, when the broadening of the definition plays out, about how long it might take to see things happen there. So there are concerns with that.


We are not even debating the regulatory sandbox changes that need to happen. Again, the government said that this is really important, and it is important because they stuffed the first version. They had only four fin-techs go through their regulatory sandbox—less than half a dozen—and they need to fix that up now with a series of changes that still haven't been put to the parliament. The other thing that is just staggering for a government that says it is pro fin-tech—as I said, faux friends of fin-tech—how come they haven't had the wherewithal to bring in the final lot of changes through the Senate on equity crowdfunding?


Last year, when they rammed through this place the changes that we said would be overly bureaucratic, would not deliver the benefits they said would happen, and would not allow smaller firms to access the level of capital raising required to help those firms grow, they still put them through. At the time, I labelled it 'ScoMo's dodo', because we knew it was heading for one thing and one thing only—extinction—because it had to have a whole new set of changes put to it. That's what they did in September. They brought another round of legislation in to fix up the fatally flawed legislation that they had in March. They introduced it in this place in September last year and then it didn't go in through the Senate at the end of the year. We then waited for February for it to come in, and they didn't debate it then. Then we got to March and it still didn't get debated, and then we had the long break before the budget. Now it's come in, in the first week in May, and they haven't put it through the Senate. Mind you, this is after the opposition has offered every assurance that we will work with them. We want to see the time frame for the introduction shortened. We've said to the government continually that we will work with them on this—just bring the framework in. And they couldn't get it into the Senate this week. What does that mean for the fin-tech community or others in the early-stage innovation space? You now will not see this legislation debated until three-quarters of the way through June. The government has baked in a delay of six months from royal assent before the new regime takes place, which means it would be December of this year, notionally, before it comes in.


To their great credit, the government agreed with us to shorten that period of time. We wanted it even shorter. We wanted it introduced right from the start of the new financial year, but they still won't agree to it, because they're worried about ASIC, and ASIC is playing ping-pong, saying, 'It's up to the parliament to determine what happens.' They didn't even know at estimates that there was this six-month period.


But, again, ScoMo's dodo, now the 'go-slow by ScoMo', is going to create another dodo, because equity crowdfunding is now being overtaken by an alternative financing vehicle in the form of initial coin offerings, using cryptocurrency as a way to generate capital for early-stage innovators. So this is now just taking place on its own and it threatens to potentially outstrip what could be raised through equity crowdfunding anyway.


The bigger story in all this is that we've been debating this since May 2013. We made the reference to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee in May 2013 to set up the framework. The coalition government got the report in May 2014, but by 2018 we still don't have the actual framework in place. It has been five years—four under your coalition government, where you say that you're pro innovation, you say you're pro fin-tech sector, but you can't even get the reforms in. You drag it out so long that alternative vehicles for capital raisings emerge, which, I have to say, are less informative to investors and will require much more sophisticated investors to understand and interpret what's going on. It's been dragged out. You're either fair dinkum about encouraging fin-tech and the emergence of a stronger fin-tech sector in this country, or you're just fake friends of the sector, only wanting to be there for the click of the cameras and the writing of the stories. You're not there to actually put it through, and this is even when we're prepared to work with the coalition on this. It is a disgrace. This shouldn't happen. If you were pro business, if you were truly pro opening up alternative pathways for capital raising, you would have got it done, but you haven't.


It's just the same as the concerns we have with what's contained within schedule 3 of this legislation. Based on what we're hearing out of the fin-tech sector and what stakeholders are raising with us, you still haven't cleared it up. If the Treasurer's too busy, he has an assistant minister. Assign him to make sure this happens. He has enough space to be able to make this happen. I'm sure he wants to cut his teeth on this legislation—he'll do the summing-up in a few minutes time. So why don't they take the steps, task up the proper people, make this happen, get the legislation through and prove that they are more than words, that they are action, as opposed to what we're seeing right now?

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2018-05-10,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (17:16):  In summing up the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, I will say that this further delivers on this government's agenda to address multinational tax avoidance, ensures that the small-business capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted, ensures that we have the policy settings in order to foster innovation and makes the taxation of Defence abuse repatriation payments fairer. Schedule 1 of this bill demonstrates again our ongoing commitment to tackling multinational tax avoidance by further preventing large multinationals from avoiding tax on their Australian business profits through artificially structuring their affairs, which ultimately amounts to taxable income not being captured in the Australian tax net. The amendments contained in schedule 1 ensure that the multilateral anti-tax-avoidance law, which targets these egregious practices, will continue to operate as intended and deliver on the government's commitment to improving the integrity of Australia's tax system, which ultimately benefits all Australians.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to improve the integrity of the tax system and ensure that the small-business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted. These amendments give effect to the government's 2017-18 budget announcement that, from 1 July 2017, the concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. The key feature of the amendments is to test the size of the business being disposed of, to prevent inappropriate access to the concessions for assets unrelated to a small business. This ensures that these important concessions continue to benefit those who need them most, which are hardworking small businesses.


The government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global fin-tech hub. When I spoke at the fin-tech futures forum in Melbourne last week, the government were certainly congratulated on the work and support that we're providing fin-techs. Therefore, schedule 3 of this bill builds on our work to ensure that we have the policy settings best in place to foster this sort of innovation. Accordingly, schedule 3 amends the early stage venture capital limited partnership, venture capital limited partnership and tax incentives for early stage investor regimes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This clarifies that early stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses, removes ambiguity from the tax law, and provides certainty for venture capital investors. Again, we believe that this demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and risk taking in Australia and will help ensure innovative Australian businesses have access to the capital and, importantly, the expertise that they need to grow and succeed in this very competitive area.


In the 2017-18 budget the government announced it would expand the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to make recommendations for reparation payments. All complaints about abuse in the Defence Force made to the Defence Force Ombudsman will now include an assessment for a reparation payment. Similar reparation payments were previously administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. Reparation payments made by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were specifically exempt from income tax. Schedule 4 of this bill therefore ensures that the new reparation payments recommended by the Defence Force Ombudsman are exempt from income tax. Reparation payments are not intended to be compensation, and complainants will not be required to release the Commonwealth from any liability. Schedule 4 ensures the recipient of a reparation payment receives the full benefit of the payment and, importantly, is free from the obligation to pay income tax on it. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (19:31):  My fellow Australians, as I listened to the government's fifth budget on Tuesday night, I knew immediately we can do better than this, the people of Australia deserve better than this and a Labor government will deliver better than this—better than 10 years of cuts to schools and hospitals in exchange for $10 a week. Ten dollars a week! That's all that the Liberals think it will take for you to forgive and forget. They think that for $10 you'll forget they tried to put up your taxes last year, that for $10 you won't care about the cuts to your child's school, that for $10 you'll forgive waiting for elective surgery at Australia's hospitals and that for $10 you won't mind if your Internet's no good or your local TAFE is closing or your daughter can't find a place at uni. They think that, if you get $10 a week, you won't notice that you're losing $70 in penalty rates from your Sunday pay. This Prime Minister is so out of touch. He thinks that, if you get $10 a week, you'll be fine with the banks getting a $17 billion giveaway.


The Liberals desperately want you to believe that this budget is fair, but here's what the Prime Minister isn't telling you: his $715 million cut to hospitals is still in the budget; his $17 billion cut to schools is still in the budget; and his $80 billion handout to big business, banks and multinationals is most certainly still in the budget. This budget still cuts money from our universities, and it contains a sneaky new $270 million cut to TAFE. The Prime Minister's still cutting $14 from pensioners every fortnight. He's cutting dental care for veterans. He's cutting the ABC, yet again. He's keeping Medicare frozen for specialist visits. He's even keeping the GST on tampons. And he is still increasing the retirement age to 70. So tonight Australians should ask themselves: if your family relies on any of these services, what kind of future is this Prime Minister really offering you?


My fellow Australians, I'm here to outline Labor's plan to bring the fair go back into the heart of our nation, a plan to properly fund health and education, a plan to boost your wages and a plan for real tax cuts to help you with your family budget. It's a plan that we can afford, because we are not going to spend $80 billion of tax expenditure on big business and the big banks. It's a plan that will work, because Australia thrives when middle- and working-class Australians can get ahead. Tonight is about a fair go for everyone who wants the best for their kids and their future, a fair go for every part of our nation, from bush to coast, from growing cities and suburbs right throughout the country, a fair go for the real forgotten people: working families, pensioners, and Australians doing it tough.


Our plan begins with a better and fairer tax system. After years of flat wages, rising power bills and increasing health costs under the government, it is a time for a fair dinkum tax cut for middle-class and working-class Australians. I've already said that Labor will support the government's modest tax cuts, starting on 1 July this year. But tonight I'm pleased to announce that a Labor government will go further and do better on tax cuts for working-class and middle-class Australians. Tonight, I'm pleased to advise that in our first budget we will deliver a bigger, better and fairer tax cut for 10 million working Australians—almost double, in fact, what the government offered on Tuesday. This is our pledge to 10 million working Australians: under Labor you will pay less income tax because I think that you are more important than multinationals, big banks and big business.


In our first term of government, a teacher earning $65,000 will be $2,780 better off under Labor, an extra $928 each year. A married couple, one serving in our defence forces earning $90,000 and the other working in aged care on $50,000, will be $5,565 better off under Labor, a combined $1,855 extra each year under Labor. We can afford to do more to help these 10 million Australians because we are not giving $80 billion to big business and the big four banks and because we have already made hard choices for budget repair: creating a level playing field for first home buyers by reforming negative gearing and capital gains; cracking down on tax minimisation by eliminating income splitting in discretionary trusts, without affecting our farmers; and ending unsustainable tax refunds for people who currently pay no income tax, while protecting pensioners and charities.


At the next election there will be a very clear choice on tax: 10 million Australians will pay less income tax under Labor, and we can afford to cut the taxes of 10 million Australians without cutting services, because unlike the Liberals we are not wasting $80 billion on a discredited corporate tax giveaway to the top end of town.


Labor's plans mean that we can deliver a winning trifecta in government: a genuine tax cut for middle-class and working-class Australians; proper funding for hospitals, schools and the safety net; and paying back more of Australia's national debt faster. There was a time, I remember, when the Liberals ran around saying that a national debt of $227 billion was a budget emergency. There was a time, I remember, when they were first elected, that they said that every man, woman and child owed $9,000. But on Tuesday night I do not remember hearing the Treasurer admit that national debt has more than doubled under the Liberals. I do not remember him admitting that it's now $21,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. I do not remember him admitting that next year total interest payments on national debt will pass $18 billion—$18 billion every year, Treasurer; that's what you've achieved. It is more than the Commonwealth spends on the NDIS, or aged care, or child care. It's about twice as much as Australia spends on our public schools.


But the Liberals' only strategy is to cross their fingers and hope. This is not good enough in a time of trade conflict between America and China, in an age of soaring global debt and rising US bond markets. No Australian government can prevent global bad news, but good governments prepare for it. It may not be politically fashionable but it is time to be responsible. Labor's economic reforms put us in a much stronger position to cope with international uncertainty over the coming decade. We can pay down national debt faster because we're not giving $80 billion away to multinationals and because we have made the tough decisions to reform our taxation system.


On Tuesday night we discovered that the Liberals are planning to radically rewrite the tax rules of the nation, and the more that Australians learn about this latest scheme, the less they like it. How on earth can it be fair for a nurse on $40,000 to pay the same tax rate as a doctor on $200,000 or for a cleaner to pay the same tax rate as a CEO? How can it be fair that, under this tax experiment, the doctor earns five times as much as the nurse but his tax cut is 16 times bigger? Today, new research has revealed that, under this plan, $6 in every $10 will go to the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians. Very quickly, this is looking like another mates rates tax plan from the Liberal Party. At a time of flat wages, growing inequality and a greater sense of unfairness in this community, when too many jobseekers are stuck in poverty, when children go to school hungry, when women fleeing family violence cannot find safe accommodation, people are worried that this plan is neither fair nor affordable. Frankly, Australians are entitled to be pretty sceptical of the whole thing and to wonder if this 'come and talk to me after two elections' plan, this promise on the never-never, will ever happen. My team and I are ready to vote for tax cuts for working families. We will not allow the Prime Minister to threaten to block tax cuts for 10 million Aussies unless the parliament writes a cheque for high-income earners seven years hence.


Every Australian understands that wages have grown by just two per cent in the past year, slower than the price of things you need to buy, way less than your bills. Yet this government in its budget is pretending that wages will increase by over 13 per cent in the next four years. We know that the Liberals haven't the slightest idea of how this will be achieved. And, when the current wages system is demonstrably not delivering for workers, they are dreaming if they think that same system will magically deliver much better outcomes. Tonight, Labor have shown that we are a party of lower taxes for working and middle-class families, and for more than 120 years we have been the party of higher wages for workers. We have a real wages policy. Our wages policy will restore Sunday penalty rates. We will crack down on wages theft, the abuse of labour hire where companies shift their permanent jobs onto labour hire jobs just to cut their pay. We will get enterprise bargaining off life support and employees and employers back to the negotiating table for more productive workplaces, more profitable enterprises and higher wages. We will lead a new push to deliver genuine pay equity for Australia's working women. Labor's wages policy is better for workers; our income tax policy is better for households; and both are better for the economy.


We've also got real plans for job creation. We are committed to a tax cut for every Australian small business, for 93 per cent of all Australian businesses. We will provide tax incentives for companies who invest here in their own productivity, in new plant and equipment—new utes for tradies, new software, new technology—and our advanced manufacturing future fund will ensure that auto firms abandoned by the current governments in South Australia and Victoria can adapt and modernise. Our commitments to defence, manufacturing and local procurement, to agriculture, science and research, to tourism and renewable energy and to a better NBN are all about creating the jobs and industries for Australia's future. We can afford to invest in small business, productivity and growth because we choose Australian small businesses and Australian jobs over tax giveaways for multinationals, big banks and big business. 


In the past couple of days, we've heard the government boast about record funding for hospitals. Let us take a closer look at this record. The cost of seeing a doctor is the highest on record. The average wait time for elective surgery is the longest on record. The number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record. The number of people presenting in emergency departments is the highest on record—and yet one in three patients considered urgent don't get seen on time. But, in this budget, the government locked in a further cut of $2.1 billion to hospitals across every part of the nation. The health of Australians should never take a back seat to a hand-out for big business. Tonight, I'm pleased to announce Labor will reverse the Prime Minister's cuts to hospitals and create a $2.8 billion better hospitals fund. We'll put more beds in emergency departments and on the wards so we can reduce the wait for people sitting in emergency rooms, worrying about a child or a loved one who's hurt or unwell. Our fund will launch a blitz on waiting lists for elective surgery so people can get that knee replacement to walk without pain, or have their cataracts removed so they can watch their grandchildren grow up. We'll start in Tasmania, which has the worst waiting times in the nation—a year waiting for cataracts and up to 435 days for a knee replacement. And our fund will upgrade emergency department facilities in the suburbs and the regions, including better security measures for staff and patients to handle the scourge of ice. 


If someone you love has cancer, it consumes your whole world. It is a terrible disease. Chloe and I have been through it with dear friends. My own mum battled breast cancer for many years. As everyone who has been part of the fight knows, there are endless scans and tests involved. For too many people outside our big cities, either their hospital does not have an MRI machine or it's not covered by Medicare. If you live in Emerald, you have to drive three hours to Rockhampton, or you have to pay hundreds of dollars out of your own pocket each time. Cancer does not care where you live or who it strikes, and you should never have to worry about where to go to get the treatment that you can afford. Health care should just be there for you when you need it. That's what Medicare's all about. Tonight I'm pleased to announce that Labor will provide new MRIs to 20 hospitals and imaging centres in the regions and outer suburbs so Australians have a better level of care, and we will make sure that every one of these machines is covered by Medicare. And we can properly fund our hospitals, reverse the cuts of the government and invest new money in Medicare because we've made hard choices on tax reform and because we're not wasting billions on big business and big banks. 


I also believe every government has a responsibility to leave the nation better than we find it. That is why we will create a national integrity commission, a federal ICAC, to improve accountability of politics and public life. And we will do the right thing by people who've been let down by social institutions—national redress for the courageous survivors of child sex abuse, and new healing initiatives for the stolen generations and to reduce the shocking number of Aboriginal kids growing up away from country and culture.


We will ensure justice for people who have been ripped off by the banks. The banking royal commission has lifted the lid, at long last, on a pathology of exploitation. After years of trying to stop the royal commission, in this budget the Prime Minister is giving the big four banks $17 billion of taxpayer money, but it's cutting money from ASIC, its tough cop on the beat. This is a disgrace, it is immoral and Labor will have no part of your actions. The government tried talking tough on this, but wagging your finger in the banks' faces means little when you're giving them a tax cut with your other hand, and upping penalties will do nothing if corporate criminals with deep pockets and big legal teams know they can outspend the government. That is why tonight I announce that Labor will create a special task force inside the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to see justice done. We will deliver $25 million in funding to make sure that public prosecutors have the resources to follow through on the work of the royal commission. In this fight, as always, we stand on the side of ordinary Australians.


Every budget should strive to deliver Australians a better deal today, but I understand that so many of the sacrifices people make are about tomorrow, about passing on a better set of opportunities for their children. But this budget does nothing for the next generation; it betrays them. Young Australians always get a dud deal from a conservative government. Young people volunteer, give back to our community, work to support their studies, pay their GST, are funding Medicare and contribute to super from their first day on the job. In return, the Liberals are cutting school funding, closing off university opportunities, taking us backwards on climate change, locking first home buyers out of the market and making it harder to get an apprenticeship or go to TAFE. Young Australians deserve better, so tonight I promise young Australians: Labor will create a level playing field for first home buyers, because I don't want us to live in a country where your only chance of owning a home is to inherit one. We're serious too about tackling climate change and helping the environment: 50 per cent renewables by 2030, a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 and zero net emissions by 2050. I promise young Australians: we will not leave you a ruined reef and rivers and oceans choked with waste, and we will always invest in your education—schools, TAFE and uni—because we know that when you get opportunities Australia gets opportunities. When you succeed, Australia succeeds.


My twin brother, Robert, is here tonight, so happy birthday for Saturday. He knows that our mother sacrificed everything for our education, and it changed our lives. If I'm elected Prime Minister, I'll make it my mission to ensure that every Australian child gets the life-changing opportunity of a properly funded, quality education: reading and writing, maths and coding, science and languages, individual attention in the classroom and protection from bullying, be it online or in the schoolyard. I want children to discover and fall in love with what they're good at, and I want every public school to be able to offer music, drama, sport and camps. This government can announce as many education reviews as it wants; everyone knows that cutting school funding does not deliver better results. That is why Labor will put back every dollar the Liberals have cut from schools. The government's cuts have hit public schools and their 2½ million students the hardest. It's public schools that will benefit the most when we invest and restore the extra $17 billion over the next 10 years. It's our public system teaching 82 per cent of Australia's poorest kids, 84 per cent of Indigenous kids and 74 per cent of children with disabilities. We want the same when it comes to schools, the very best. So, when it comes to schools at the next election, the choice is simple: Labor will put $17 billion back into the schools and the Prime Minister will put $17 billion back into banks.


Nine out of 10 new jobs created in the next four years will need either a university degree or a TAFE qualification. It's why Labor believes in quality universities and strong public TAFEs, working side by side, equal partners in our nation's future. Yet, in this budget, the Liberals are cutting more money from university and TAFE. In government, Labor uncapped degree places and opened the doors of university to a new generation. Tens of thousands of students became the first person in their family to go to university. That's the fair go in action. But the Liberal freeze on university funding means 10,000 fewer places are available next year. By 2032, over 200,000 people will miss out. Millions of families in our regions want their child to go to an Australian university. They understand what it means to hold a degree from our country. The government's freeze won't affect them. No, it will simply lock out working-class kids and students from regional Australia. So tonight I am pleased to announce that Labor will restore funding certainty to our universities and we will uncap places, providing our nation with more than 200,000 university graduates. Under Labor, a university education is not a privilege you inherit; it's an opportunity you earn. We will always choose better university opportunities over better tax breaks for the big end of town.


Labor's plan for training is crystal clear. We will stop the slide to dodgy private providers and back public TAFE all the way. We'll renovate the campuses and rebuild the workshops. We'll ensure that, as a minimum, two out of three of our training dollars go to public TAFE. We will invest in programs to help older workers retrain in later life. We already know the expertise our nation will need in the next decade: more workers for the NDIS and in aged care; more construction workers for national infrastructure and housing; and more programmers and technicians for the digital age. I don't want Australia to meet these needs with skills visas; I want to train our people for these jobs. There is no excuse for a skills vacancy to last one day longer than it takes to train an Australian to do that job. So tonight I am pleased to announce that a Labor government will cover all up-front fees of 100,000 TAFE places in our first term in high-priority sectors from ag and engineering to disability and plumbing. We would expect at least half of these opportunities to go to the women of Australia. We'll get jobs like carpenters, cooks and bricklayers off the national skills shortage list and we will keep them off it. Instead of looking overseas or relying on temporary visas, employers will have a skilled local workforce ready to go. And we can make this happen because we put 100,000 TAFE places ahead of $80 billion of corporate tax giveaway.


This budget falls hardest on the young and the old. The Prime Minister is still cutting $14 a fortnight from pensioners, still telling Australians to work until they're 70, with no idea what it means to people who've spent their lives doing jobs that are hard on their bodies and tough on their backs. But I actually think that one of the sneakiest tricks in this year's budget is the fraud perpetrated on Australians in need of aged care. Around 105,000 older Australians are waiting for homecare packages. Despite all the hype, the government is offering only 14,000 places over the next four years. That's 14,000 places in four years, when 20,000 people joined the waiting list in the last six months alone. Worse still, in question time today we learned that there is no new funding here. They're simply taking the money away from residential care places and putting it into homecare places—nothing new. The people who raised us, cared for us and loved us deserve so much better than this money-go-round in aged care, cuts to their energy supplement and the world's oldest retirement age. If I'm Prime Minister, tackling dementia and delivering better aged care will be a national priority backed by real resources, because we know that giving older Australians the security and dignity they deserve matters more than an $80 billion corporate tax cut.


The same Liberal accounting trickery is at work in infrastructure. Across the four years of this budget, Commonwealth investment in infrastructure projects actually falls from $8 billion to $4½ billion. For the Western Sydney rail link, there's only money for a study—a report. The same goes for the train to Tullamarine—not a single dollar for construction. Apparently, this government can do it for free! Only Labor believes in nation building and in good public transport projects, like Cross River Rail, in Brisbane, or the Western Sydney rail line. When we invest in tourism infrastructure in northern Australia and Tasmania, when we improve the Bass Highway in Tassie, when we expand the Mitchell Freeway to cut congestion in WA and when we deliver long-overdue upgrades to the Bruce Highway, in Queensland—when we fund and build these projects—we'll prioritise Australian-made steel, we'll prioritise local workers and we'll require that one in every 10 people employed is an Australian apprentice. Labor can put real dollars into Australian infrastructure because we are not going to give $80 billion to multinationals and big corporations.


So, in conclusion, my fellow Australians, here is what the fair go means under a Labor government: rescuing hospitals and reinvesting in Medicare; proper funding for schools, TAFE and university; and a bigger, better income tax cut for 10 million working Australians. This is our plan, and this is my challenge to the Prime Minister: if you think that your budget is fair, if you think that your sneaky cuts can survive scrutiny, put it to the test. Put it to the test in Caboolture. Put it to the test in Burnie. Put it to the test in Fremantle and in Perth. I will put my better, fairer, bigger income tax cut against yours. I'll put my plans to rescue hospitals and fund Medicare against your cuts. I'll put my plans to properly fund schools against your cuts. I'll put my plan to boost wages against your plan to cut penalty rates. I'll put my plans for 100,000 TAFE places against your cuts to apprenticeships and training. I'll fight for the ABC against your cuts. House by house, street by street and suburb by suburb, my team and I will make this a referendum on your $80 billion corporate tax giveaway to multinationals, big business and the big banks. This nation needs a leader that gets it; it needs a party with a plan for the future; and it needs a government that will deliver a fair go for all Australians. That is what we deliver. That is our promise.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (19:31):  My fellow Australians, as I listened to the government's fifth budget on Tuesday night, I knew immediately we can do better than this, the people of Australia deserve better than this and a Labor government will deliver better than this—better than 10 years of cuts to schools and hospitals in exchange for $10 a week. Ten dollars a week! That's all that the Liberals think it will take for you to forgive and forget. They think that for $10 you'll forget they tried to put up your taxes last year, that for $10 you won't care about the cuts to your child's school, that for $10 you'll forgive waiting for elective surgery at Australia's hospitals and that for $10 you won't mind if your Internet's no good or your local TAFE is closing or your daughter can't find a place at uni. They think that, if you get $10 a week, you won't notice that you're losing $70 in penalty rates from your Sunday pay. This Prime Minister is so out of touch. He thinks that, if you get $10 a week, you'll be fine with the banks getting a $17 billion giveaway.


The Liberals desperately want you to believe that this budget is fair, but here's what the Prime Minister isn't telling you: his $715 million cut to hospitals is still in the budget; his $17 billion cut to schools is still in the budget; and his $80 billion handout to big business, banks and multinationals is most certainly still in the budget. This budget still cuts money from our universities, and it contains a sneaky new $270 million cut to TAFE. The Prime Minister's still cutting $14 from pensioners every fortnight. He's cutting dental care for veterans. He's cutting the ABC, yet again. He's keeping Medicare frozen for specialist visits. He's even keeping the GST on tampons. And he is still increasing the retirement age to 70. So tonight Australians should ask themselves: if your family relies on any of these services, what kind of future is this Prime Minister really offering you?


My fellow Australians, I'm here to outline Labor's plan to bring the fair go back into the heart of our nation, a plan to properly fund health and education, a plan to boost your wages and a plan for real tax cuts to help you with your family budget. It's a plan that we can afford, because we are not going to spend $80 billion of tax expenditure on big business and the big banks. It's a plan that will work, because Australia thrives when middle- and working-class Australians can get ahead. Tonight is about a fair go for everyone who wants the best for their kids and their future, a fair go for every part of our nation, from bush to coast, from growing cities and suburbs right throughout the country, a fair go for the real forgotten people: working families, pensioners, and Australians doing it tough.


Our plan begins with a better and fairer tax system. After years of flat wages, rising power bills and increasing health costs under the government, it is a time for a fair dinkum tax cut for middle-class and working-class Australians. I've already said that Labor will support the government's modest tax cuts, starting on 1 July this year. But tonight I'm pleased to announce that a Labor government will go further and do better on tax cuts for working-class and middle-class Australians. Tonight, I'm pleased to advise that in our first budget we will deliver a bigger, better and fairer tax cut for 10 million working Australians—almost double, in fact, what the government offered on Tuesday. This is our pledge to 10 million working Australians: under Labor you will pay less income tax because I think that you are more important than multinationals, big banks and big business.


In our first term of government, a teacher earning $65,000 will be $2,780 better off under Labor, an extra $928 each year. A married couple, one serving in our defence forces earning $90,000 and the other working in aged care on $50,000, will be $5,565 better off under Labor, a combined $1,855 extra each year under Labor. We can afford to do more to help these 10 million Australians because we are not giving $80 billion to big business and the big four banks and because we have already made hard choices for budget repair: creating a level playing field for first home buyers by reforming negative gearing and capital gains; cracking down on tax minimisation by eliminating income splitting in discretionary trusts, without affecting our farmers; and ending unsustainable tax refunds for people who currently pay no income tax, while protecting pensioners and charities.


At the next election there will be a very clear choice on tax: 10 million Australians will pay less income tax under Labor, and we can afford to cut the taxes of 10 million Australians without cutting services, because unlike the Liberals we are not wasting $80 billion on a discredited corporate tax giveaway to the top end of town.


Labor's plans mean that we can deliver a winning trifecta in government: a genuine tax cut for middle-class and working-class Australians; proper funding for hospitals, schools and the safety net; and paying back more of Australia's national debt faster. There was a time, I remember, when the Liberals ran around saying that a national debt of $227 billion was a budget emergency. There was a time, I remember, when they were first elected, that they said that every man, woman and child owed $9,000. But on Tuesday night I do not remember hearing the Treasurer admit that national debt has more than doubled under the Liberals. I do not remember him admitting that it's now $21,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. I do not remember him admitting that next year total interest payments on national debt will pass $18 billion—$18 billion every year, Treasurer; that's what you've achieved. It is more than the Commonwealth spends on the NDIS, or aged care, or child care. It's about twice as much as Australia spends on our public schools.


But the Liberals' only strategy is to cross their fingers and hope. This is not good enough in a time of trade conflict between America and China, in an age of soaring global debt and rising US bond markets. No Australian government can prevent global bad news, but good governments prepare for it. It may not be politically fashionable but it is time to be responsible. Labor's economic reforms put us in a much stronger position to cope with international uncertainty over the coming decade. We can pay down national debt faster because we're not giving $80 billion away to multinationals and because we have made the tough decisions to reform our taxation system.


On Tuesday night we discovered that the Liberals are planning to radically rewrite the tax rules of the nation, and the more that Australians learn about this latest scheme, the less they like it. How on earth can it be fair for a nurse on $40,000 to pay the same tax rate as a doctor on $200,000 or for a cleaner to pay the same tax rate as a CEO? How can it be fair that, under this tax experiment, the doctor earns five times as much as the nurse but his tax cut is 16 times bigger? Today, new research has revealed that, under this plan, $6 in every $10 will go to the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians. Very quickly, this is looking like another mates rates tax plan from the Liberal Party. At a time of flat wages, growing inequality and a greater sense of unfairness in this community, when too many jobseekers are stuck in poverty, when children go to school hungry, when women fleeing family violence cannot find safe accommodation, people are worried that this plan is neither fair nor affordable. Frankly, Australians are entitled to be pretty sceptical of the whole thing and to wonder if this 'come and talk to me after two elections' plan, this promise on the never-never, will ever happen. My team and I are ready to vote for tax cuts for working families. We will not allow the Prime Minister to threaten to block tax cuts for 10 million Aussies unless the parliament writes a cheque for high-income earners seven years hence.


Every Australian understands that wages have grown by just two per cent in the past year, slower than the price of things you need to buy, way less than your bills. Yet this government in its budget is pretending that wages will increase by over 13 per cent in the next four years. We know that the Liberals haven't the slightest idea of how this will be achieved. And, when the current wages system is demonstrably not delivering for workers, they are dreaming if they think that same system will magically deliver much better outcomes. Tonight, Labor have shown that we are a party of lower taxes for working and middle-class families, and for more than 120 years we have been the party of higher wages for workers. We have a real wages policy. Our wages policy will restore Sunday penalty rates. We will crack down on wages theft, the abuse of labour hire where companies shift their permanent jobs onto labour hire jobs just to cut their pay. We will get enterprise bargaining off life support and employees and employers back to the negotiating table for more productive workplaces, more profitable enterprises and higher wages. We will lead a new push to deliver genuine pay equity for Australia's working women. Labor's wages policy is better for workers; our income tax policy is better for households; and both are better for the economy.


We've also got real plans for job creation. We are committed to a tax cut for every Australian small business, for 93 per cent of all Australian businesses. We will provide tax incentives for companies who invest here in their own productivity, in new plant and equipment—new utes for tradies, new software, new technology—and our advanced manufacturing future fund will ensure that auto firms abandoned by the current governments in South Australia and Victoria can adapt and modernise. Our commitments to defence, manufacturing and local procurement, to agriculture, science and research, to tourism and renewable energy and to a better NBN are all about creating the jobs and industries for Australia's future. We can afford to invest in small business, productivity and growth because we choose Australian small businesses and Australian jobs over tax giveaways for multinationals, big banks and big business. 


In the past couple of days, we've heard the government boast about record funding for hospitals. Let us take a closer look at this record. The cost of seeing a doctor is the highest on record. The average wait time for elective surgery is the longest on record. The number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record. The number of people presenting in emergency departments is the highest on record—and yet one in three patients considered urgent don't get seen on time. But, in this budget, the government locked in a further cut of $2.1 billion to hospitals across every part of the nation. The health of Australians should never take a back seat to a hand-out for big business. Tonight, I'm pleased to announce Labor will reverse the Prime Minister's cuts to hospitals and create a $2.8 billion better hospitals fund. We'll put more beds in emergency departments and on the wards so we can reduce the wait for people sitting in emergency rooms, worrying about a child or a loved one who's hurt or unwell. Our fund will launch a blitz on waiting lists for elective surgery so people can get that knee replacement to walk without pain, or have their cataracts removed so they can watch their grandchildren grow up. We'll start in Tasmania, which has the worst waiting times in the nation—a year waiting for cataracts and up to 435 days for a knee replacement. And our fund will upgrade emergency department facilities in the suburbs and the regions, including better security measures for staff and patients to handle the scourge of ice. 


If someone you love has cancer, it consumes your whole world. It is a terrible disease. Chloe and I have been through it with dear friends. My own mum battled breast cancer for many years. As everyone who has been part of the fight knows, there are endless scans and tests involved. For too many people outside our big cities, either their hospital does not have an MRI machine or it's not covered by Medicare. If you live in Emerald, you have to drive three hours to Rockhampton, or you have to pay hundreds of dollars out of your own pocket each time. Cancer does not care where you live or who it strikes, and you should never have to worry about where to go to get the treatment that you can afford. Health care should just be there for you when you need it. That's what Medicare's all about. Tonight I'm pleased to announce that Labor will provide new MRIs to 20 hospitals and imaging centres in the regions and outer suburbs so Australians have a better level of care, and we will make sure that every one of these machines is covered by Medicare. And we can properly fund our hospitals, reverse the cuts of the government and invest new money in Medicare because we've made hard choices on tax reform and because we're not wasting billions on big business and big banks. 


I also believe every government has a responsibility to leave the nation better than we find it. That is why we will create a national integrity commission, a federal ICAC, to improve accountability of politics and public life. And we will do the right thing by people who've been let down by social institutions—national redress for the courageous survivors of child sex abuse, and new healing initiatives for the stolen generations and to reduce the shocking number of Aboriginal kids growing up away from country and culture.


We will ensure justice for people who have been ripped off by the banks. The banking royal commission has lifted the lid, at long last, on a pathology of exploitation. After years of trying to stop the royal commission, in this budget the Prime Minister is giving the big four banks $17 billion of taxpayer money, but it's cutting money from ASIC, its tough cop on the beat. This is a disgrace, it is immoral and Labor will have no part of your actions. The government tried talking tough on this, but wagging your finger in the banks' faces means little when you're giving them a tax cut with your other hand, and upping penalties will do nothing if corporate criminals with deep pockets and big legal teams know they can outspend the government. That is why tonight I announce that Labor will create a special task force inside the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to see justice done. We will deliver $25 million in funding to make sure that public prosecutors have the resources to follow through on the work of the royal commission. In this fight, as always, we stand on the side of ordinary Australians.


Every budget should strive to deliver Australians a better deal today, but I understand that so many of the sacrifices people make are about tomorrow, about passing on a better set of opportunities for their children. But this budget does nothing for the next generation; it betrays them. Young Australians always get a dud deal from a conservative government. Young people volunteer, give back to our community, work to support their studies, pay their GST, are funding Medicare and contribute to super from their first day on the job. In return, the Liberals are cutting school funding, closing off university opportunities, taking us backwards on climate change, locking first home buyers out of the market and making it harder to get an apprenticeship or go to TAFE. Young Australians deserve better, so tonight I promise young Australians: Labor will create a level playing field for first home buyers, because I don't want us to live in a country where your only chance of owning a home is to inherit one. We're serious too about tackling climate change and helping the environment: 50 per cent renewables by 2030, a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 and zero net emissions by 2050. I promise young Australians: we will not leave you a ruined reef and rivers and oceans choked with waste, and we will always invest in your education—schools, TAFE and uni—because we know that when you get opportunities Australia gets opportunities. When you succeed, Australia succeeds.


My twin brother, Robert, is here tonight, so happy birthday for Saturday. He knows that our mother sacrificed everything for our education, and it changed our lives. If I'm elected Prime Minister, I'll make it my mission to ensure that every Australian child gets the life-changing opportunity of a properly funded, quality education: reading and writing, maths and coding, science and languages, individual attention in the classroom and protection from bullying, be it online or in the schoolyard.

I don't want Australia to meet these needs with skills visas; I want to train our people for these jobs. There is no excuse for a skills vacancy to last one day longer than it takes to train an Australian to do that job. So tonight I am pleased to announce that a Labor government will cover all up-front fees of 100,000 TAFE places in our first term in high-priority sectors from ag and engineering to disability and plumbing. We would expect at least half of these opportunities to go to the women of Australia. We'll get jobs like carpenters, cooks and bricklayers off the national skills shortage list and we will keep them off it. Instead of looking overseas or relying on temporary visas, employers will have a skilled local workforce ready to go. And we can make this happen because we put 100,000 TAFE places ahead of $80 billion of corporate tax giveaway.


This budget falls hardest on the young and the old. The Prime Minister is still cutting $14 a fortnight from pensioners, still telling Australians to work until they're 70, with no idea what it means to people who've spent their lives doing jobs that are hard on their bodies and tough on their backs. But I actually think that one of the sneakiest tricks in this year's budget is the fraud perpetrated on Australians in need of aged care. Around 105,000 older Australians are waiting for homecare packages. Despite all the hype, the government is offering only 14,000 places over the next four years.

Labor can put real dollars into Australian infrastructure because we are not going to give $80 billion to multinationals and big corporations.


So, in conclusion, my fellow Australians, here is what the fair go means under a Labor government: rescuing hospitals and reinvesting in Medicare; proper funding for schools, TAFE and university; and a bigger, better income tax cut for 10 million working Australians. This is our plan, and this is my challenge to the Prime Minister: if you think that your budget is fair, if you think that your sneaky cuts can survive scrutiny, put it to the test. Put it to the test in Caboolture. Put it to the test in Burnie. Put it to the test in Fremantle and in Perth. I will put my better, fairer, bigger income tax cut against yours. I'll put my plans to rescue hospitals and fund Medicare against your cuts. I'll put my plans to properly fund schools against your cuts. I'll put my plan to boost wages against your plan to cut penalty rates. I'll put my plans for 100,000 TAFE places against your cuts to apprenticeships and training.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-05-10,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (10:00):  I've been visiting childcare centres in my electorate, from Blaxland to Blackheath and across the Hawkesbury, including Pitt Town preschool; Richmond preschool, which had its 41st birthday last month; and Greenhills in South Windsor. I've met with Euroka preschool in Blaxland, where parents have petitioned to see an increase in wages for their children's early educators. Early childhood educators are some of the lowest paid professionals in the country, receiving as low as $21 an hour. Parents know that the people they entrust their kids to deserve more. 


One of the many things missing from the budget was funding for early childhood education. There was no new funding for universal access to early childhood education in this budget. The changes to the childcare subsidy that start in July are also causing serious concern, with one in four families worse off. One of the consequences being raised with me by parents is that two-parent families where one parent works and the other stays at home have been overlooked by the government's changes to child care. These are families whose combined family income falls between the $66,000 and $171,000 bracket. The new activity test means that a stay-at-home parent with a child younger than four will have to work or study a minimum of eight hours each week to access any subsidised hours. If you don't meet those requirements, your care isn't subsidised. When you're a mum or a dad who's the primary carer for a couple of small children, you may not also be working outside the home. In fact, I seem to remember not being able to manage to make it out of pyjamas some days when I was looking after two small children. 


Long day care centres tell me the loss of subsidy is already leading to parents indicating they'll have to reduce or cut entirely their child's days of care, when we know the educational benefits good-quality child care provides. Parents and centres tell me they're confused and anxious about how they're going to be affected. Childcare centres will now be required to log the exact hours of when children enter and leave care—a deluge of paperwork. Parents will need to report changes to their work—a nightmare for casual workers. Parents and directors tell me information that clearly outlines the changes and the impacts on families hasn't reached those who need it most. The myGov site is difficult for many families to navigate, and parents report that Centrelink can't provide answers until after 2 July. 


Child care is not simply, as this government believes, about babysitting so that parents can work. Everything we know about child development tells us the early education we do with children under the age of five, before they go to school, is vital; it's an investment in their future education and prospects. If children miss out on a preschool education because of this package, that is a fail for our newest generation and a fail for this government.

Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (11:30):  I rise to speak on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters advisory report on the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017. I want to echo the comments from my colleague the member for Scullin, who yesterday spoke on this matter in the House.


This report on the issue of foreign donations and the protection of our democratic integrity has received a high level of attention by the media and many stakeholder groups since this matter was first announced by the Turnbull government. The report deals with very difficult and important matters forming part of a complicated bill, and I'll briefly go through these matters. These include limiting or capping donations and expenditure, more or less public funding, reducing the disclosure threshold, real-time disclosure of donations, the regulation of third-party campaigners, charities receiving income from overseas, banning donations from types of classes of donors and increasing penalties for breaching the rules.


After considering many submissions and listening to feedback and evidence from stakeholder groups, it's clear that there are fundamental flaws in this legislation. This is outlined in the list of recommendations, which show just how unworkable the legislation would have been regardless of what the government tried to say. On the other hand, I'm very proud to say that for more than 10 years the Australian Labor Party has put forward a considered package of proposals to advance this debate, rather than the encompassing one-size-fits-all approach that the government wanted to take. I know this because my Labor colleagues recognise that these types of reforms must be a matter upon which the parties can reach substantial agreement. We have been trying to reach that agreement for some time, and I'm pleased to say that this report gives further avenues as to how this might be achieved. Consensus on this matter cannot come for the sake of some narrow political advantage or attempting, in an unfair way, to regulate some groups within civil society in a way that clearly seems designed to regulate them, in my opinion, out of existence.


A strong democracy requires a strong civil society. When we talk about a level playing field in politics, in political speech and in political donations, we have to recognise that a level playing field treats stakeholders appropriately and not as if they are all exactly the same with the same interests. Under the current proposal, this is what the government seeks to impose. As we debate this, and if the government brings the legislation back on, we also have to recognise that we all have a great duty to all of our constituents to raise the standards of political disclosure and to build trust in our political institutions. This requires us to look at the influence of money on politics and to provide for much, much greater transparency. As I mentioned, the Labor Party has, for some time, set out a series of propositions which would go a long way towards this and, I hope, would contribute to further debates on this sensitive and important issue.


Rather than attempting to silence those we disagree with through legislation, we should be legislating and debating the real issues that the Australian people have charged us with. Whether it's proper funding for our schools and hospitals, a decent wage for a decent job or building appropriate infrastructure for the 21st century, we need to make sure that everyone has a say in the future of our country and not silence those who may speak out against us.


I'm pleased that this is substantially a consensus report. In speaking today I also want to place on record that there is a lot more work to be done. My Labor colleagues and I stand ready to work with the government and with the Greens and other crossbenchers on advancing donation reform, noting that this report deals with a package of legislative proposals that don't and can't constitute the whole of this debate. As I said, there is much more to be done, and I am looking forward to playing a constructive role as part of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.


I acknowledge the hard work of the chair, Senator Reynolds, and, in particular, the deputy chair, the member for Scullin, along with Senator Brown and Senator Ketter, who have all made important contributions. The report now lays the foundation for further debate and consideration of this important topic. As I mentioned, my Labor colleagues and I stand ready to work with all parties to advance this matter, and I look forward to more constructive work yet to come between the parties.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (11:36):  At the completion of this speech, I'll be heading to the launch of the Labor women's budget statement. One of the key areas of policy leadership is in our commitment to support victims of domestic and family violence. We all know about the harm caused by domestic and family violence around Australia and we all know the horrific statistics. It never gets any easier to read them out, but I think it's important to remind people that, in 2017 alone, 45 women were killed through domestic violence. It is the leading cause of death, disability and illness among women 15 to 44 years of age. One in six women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a cohabiting partner since the age of 15, and on average one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner. And we know that men can also be the victims of domestic and family violence. In the Northern Territory, between 2010 and 2014, nine per cent of all Territorians were victims of domestic violence. We have a serious problem in the Territory with domestic violence. Nine out of 10 of those people were Aboriginal, with Aboriginal women the victims in eight out of 10 cases. Obviously more needs to be done.


I recently met with Anna Davis and Rachael Uebergang from the NT Working Women's Centre and got an update on the important work that they are doing for women in the Territory. I've also spoken with other organisations, such as the YMCA and the YWCA, about the services that they provide to all victims of domestic and family violence. The Working Women's Centre stressed the importance of not only legislating paid domestic violence leave but also equipping employers with the knowledge and capacity to properly support employees experiencing domestic or family violence, as in some cases employers have been found to inadvertently and unintentionally compound their employees' suffering during these most difficult of times. The Working Women's Centre made the important point that, while workplace policies cannot solve domestic violence, employers have an important role in mitigating the harm and should know their policies and be able to implement them effectively. There is a gap in resources to support workplaces introducing domestic and family violence leave and to help employers to implement their policies. They suggested that the reintroduction of the Safe at Home, Safe at Work program could be part of the solution, and I think it is a suggestion that should be explored further. After all, apart from being a social issue, family violence is an industrial issue, which in four years time could cost the Australian economy an estimated $15.6 billion per year.


I do note the government's efforts in combating family violence, and I will support any worthy initiative. However, their commitment to just 40 hours of unpaid leave is simply not enough. I can say with confidence that the electorate I represent, Solomon, which is Darwin and Palmerston, was pleased to hear that a Shorten-Plibersek Labor government would legislate 10 days of paid domestic and family violence leave in the National Employment Standards. This leave can provide valuable time for victims to seek legal advice, access counselling services and access medical treatment, without compounding a victim's fear of losing employment or valuable income that they need, regardless of whether they are a man or a woman. They need that valuable income to support themselves and their families. This should not be seen as a cost on business or an additional burden for employers. For businesses, including additional domestic violence leave as a workplace right will prevent loss of productivity, will increase employee retention and will reduce unpredictable absenteeism.


Labor is also committed to reforming the Family Law Act 1975 to prevent victims of domestic violence being cross-examined in court by their abusers. The fact that in 2018 a perpetrator of domestic violence can subject their victim to hostile questioning in a courtroom is a disgrace. Labor has committed to providing $88 million over two years for a new safe housing fund to increase transitional housing options for vulnerable people escaping domestic and family violence. We must all stand up against domestic and family violence. It's an issue that affects us all.
