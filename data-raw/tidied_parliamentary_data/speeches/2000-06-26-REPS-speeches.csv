"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2000-06-26,"—I present the report of the Australia Parliamentary Delegation to the 103rd Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in Amman, Jordan, and a bilateral visit to Tanzania, 22 April to 6 May 2000.
The 103rd Inter-Parliamentary Conference discussed a wide range of topics including achieving peace and stability, dialogue among civilisations and cultures, and people-smuggling and refugees. All members of the delegation participated fully in all facets of the conference agenda. I would like to thank them for their hard work and assistance throughout the conference as well as the bilateral visit. The Australian delegation played a major role at the IPU conference and was instrumental in helping to formulate two of the three resolutions adopted. In particular, the delegation was successful in having its people-smuggling proposal accepted by the conference as its supplementary item. We also secured two positions on drafting committees, one of which was chaired by the honourable member for Fairfax.
I cannot stress sufficiently the role played at IPU conferences by our permanent delegates and the recognition of Australia as a significant contributor to debates. Special mention belongs to not only the honourable member for Fairfax as chair of a drafting committee but also to Senator McKiernan who played a pivotal role on the drafting committee on people-smuggling and refugees. His advocacy of Australia's position on this issue ensured that the drafting committee report was balanced. It was a matter of some regret to us that the plenary session amended the committee's draft resolution. Another significant achievement was the election of the honourable member for Prospect to the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians. I will leave it to my colleagues to discuss some of these issues.
Turning now to the bilateral visit to Tanzania, I would make a few brief comments. The visit to Tanzania coincided with Easter and Anzac Day. We commemorated Anzac Day at a dawn service at the Commonwealth War Grave in Dar es Salaam with representatives from New Zealand, Turkey, Canada, Britain, India, Pakistan, France and South Africa. The official program included meetings with President Mkapa, Mr Speaker Msekwa and a number of parliamentarians from both the government and opposition. These meetings enabled the delegation to discuss a range of issues including the bilateral relationship; the progress of economic reforms in Tanzania; the opening up of the economy and foreign investment; the plight of refugees on the borders with Burundi and Rwanda; the political tensions in Zanzibar; constitutional and parliamentary reform and the readiness to accept a fully operational multiparty system; and the scope to direct more funds into areas such as health and education. The discussions were both frank and informative. They left the delegation with a very clear impression that Tanzania, although still very poor, is making steady progress and is prepared to undertake necessary economic and other governmental reforms.
Of particular interest to the delegation was the opportunity to see the impact of Australian investment and the expenditure of Australian aid money. The delegation visited an Australian run goldmine at Nzega, 700 kilometres north-west of Dar es Salaam. It is owned and operated by Resolute Mines of Western Australia. The company not only is providing employment opportunities for people in the region but also has undertaken a very comprehensive community development program. The delegation had the honour of attending and participating in opening ceremonies at the area's primary and secondary schools. Both schools have been funded by Resolute Mines and major assistance was provided by the Australian government in establishing the secondary school. The company has set a very worthwhile benchmark for other foreign investors. It has implemented a very innovative community based strategy which contributes significantly to the economic and social development of the area. The Golden Pride Mine is an open-cut operation producing around 180,000 ounces of gold per annum. The company has taken great care to revegetate the land around the site and has put in place world's best practice to deal with its waste and by-products. 
AusAID has a small but nonetheless beneficial role to play in a number of other key areas. The delegation attended a very enthusiastic and entertaining opening of a water and sanitation project in the Kibaha district. It is not very often that one gets to ceremonially declare open a toilet, and the significance of that was not lost on my colleagues. It was a memorable day and it proved once again that targeted projects such as these can directly benefit thousands of people through the delivery of year-round safe and clean drinking water and proper sanitation systems. In summary, it was a very informative and rewarding visit. It was many years since an Australian delegation had visited Tanzania. It was evident that much progress had been made and that Australian investment, which amounts to around $600 million, is playing a leading role in a number of sectors. This investment has been made possible by the continued strong relationship between our countries.
On behalf of the delegation, I pay particular tribute to the excellent support provided by the Australian High Commissioner, Mr Philip Green, his wife, Dr Grace Moshi, and the staff of the High Commission based in Nairobi, Kenya. It was outstanding. I also thank the Ambassador, Mr Ian Russell, and the staff of the Australian Embassy in Amman. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Tanzania and the 103rd Inter-Parliamentary Conference, Amman</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—Mr Speaker, I would like to make a short statement on the report you have just tabled. In complimenting our wonderful ambassadorial staff, I would like to put on record our thanks also to the High Commissioner, David Connolly, for the assistance he provided to us as a delegation in South Africa. It was a difficult period, being around the Easter break, but he certainly helped and assisted us. 
As you have mentioned, Mr Speaker, as a nation we did very well indeed at the IPU conference. I thank you for the mention of the position I took. I join you in complimenting the Australian delegation for the work done. Four people from Australia were on the floor for seven days and nights and I can understand the difficulty that we had not only in putting our motions up but also in taking part in the debate that was occurring and following the different resolutions that were happening at that time. 
At this 103rd conference, 124 countries participated, so it was a very large assembly of people. You have to get around to cover them, converse with them and, I suppose, liaise with them. I want to put on the record also, Mr Speaker, our appreciation of your leadership. It was a very difficult time in that, our colleague, the member for Hume, had an accident in Tanzania which left us one short when we arrived in Jordan. I not only thank my fellow delegates but I also compliment you on the leadership that you provided right throughout that seven-day conference. 
I would also like to mention the Tanzanian visit where we attended a clean water opening ceremony. Other than those who have experienced it, no-one could believe where those people were originally getting their water from—a dirty hole in the ground. Thousands of people walked for 20 miles to celebrate the opening of this pump in the middle of a village. These are things that we in this nation take for granted. In complimenting or congratulating AusAID, or any other NGO development, I note that one of the things the delegation came away with after our visit is that to provide these villages with clean water is one of the greatest things mankind can do for fellow human beings. 
I wish to speak as well on the Resolute goldmine. We had the opportunity to participate in the opening of two schools, the primary school and the secondary school. These people now have the ability to send their children to school. Again, those children would walk for miles just to have the opportunity of attending school. As our report has indicated, the goldmine, which was operated by the Western Australian firm Resolute, is the first modern goldmine to be built in Tanzania. The investment itself is worth an estimated $A200 million. In the region where Resolute are operating they are so much involved in community development work that the primary school we visited was only one of the four primary schools. They have operated four primary schools or paid for the installation of the building of those to the tune of 16.5 million shillings. I put on record our congratulations to them. The funding of the water in the sanitation project by Plan International and AusAID cost around 250 million shillings. It was money well spent. I hope we continue to do that. As you have indicated, Mr Speaker, the delegation was certainly welcomed by the Tanzanian government. It was a very cordial visit. We have certainly built a lot of bridges by that bilateral visit.  
More importantly, moving on to the IPU conference, all of us were very appreciative that we as a nation were able to make such a wide contribution. For those who may not know, and to those people in the gallery, when we talk about an IPU conference, it is a conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. It is a worldwide parliamentary conference which allows dialogue between nations on political, economic, social and cultural issues of international significance. Australia not only got their resolutions up but participated in the drafting committees, with my colleague the honourable member for Fairfax and Senator McKiernan. I was very proud indeed to be elected to the women's coordination committee as well as being a substitute member on the Middle East inquiry. 
I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that the parliament certainly got their value from this particular delegation. I think it also shows that you get good results when you have consistency. I have been to a conference in the past. The first time I went there I was overwhelmed at what it was about. But when you have an opportunity of being a delegate for the term of the parliament you provide that consistency because you understand and appreciate where your role is and how you can forward Australia as a nation. More particularly, you network with a number of other countries which then provide the basis on which we can go back and say, `We have a particular point that we want to get across, and we want your support to do it.' Again, I commend all staff—particularly Peter Keele, Peter Gibson and Jonathon Brown—for the wonderful briefings we had before we went.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, 26 April to 4 May 2000. It is inevitable, when events that have occurred since a delegation has left the Solomons, that our remarks as contained in the report will be read in the light of those subsequent events. Before I go to those matters, however, let me first indicate that I believe that the delegation undertook a very valuable role in its visit to Papua New Guinea in consolidating a relationship with that country. But for the fact of the coup that occurred in the Solomon Islands, it would have been a very valuable relationship-building delegation in the Solomons. But unfortunately I need to reflect on what seems to be a very significant failure of the Australian government to respond in the national interest in relation to the Solomons. 
When the delegation arrived, there was clearly tension because there had been the establishment of militia groups, particularly on Guadalcanal, and the fact that up to 20,000 Malaitans had been pressed out of that community and forced to return to their home island. When we met with the Prime Minister, he raised with us his concerns that the stability of his country was at risk. He discussed problems in his police force. He indicated that it was suffering from ethnic tensions and that his senior management was resistant to change. He suggested that a number of his police officers were corrupt and active supporters of ethnic tensions as a means of protecting their own position. His view was that the police force was non-operational but, underneath the senior level, there were a lot of very good and committed police officers who needed some leadership and he asked for assistance—a group of 50 outside police officers, 10 of whom we hoped would come from Australia, as part of a Commonwealth delegation to assist. His view that outside intervention was necessary to secure the stability of his country was supported by the Chief Justice of the Solomon Islands and by the Leader of the Opposition. The details of the discussions that the delegation had are included in the report. 
Unfortunately, it appears that those concerns were taken far too lightly by our government. I have remarked that on returning from the delegation I wrote immediately to the foreign minister passing on my particular concerns arising from those conversations. I have not yet had a reply formally from the foreign minister. But what disturbs me more is that there seemed to be a complacency and an insufficient engagement by our local representatives. Australia ought to be the dominant and most important presence throughout the South Pacific. We are the largest economy and, in terms of influence, we are a point at which communities seek assistance. They look to Australia in that regard. But when they looked in this case they found us looking away.
I was particularly disappointed that the delegation was not even briefed by the Australian High Commission of the concerns of the Prime Minister before we met. It struck me at that time, and subsequently, that the message was not being reported with sufficient rigour to the Australian government and that the Australian government itself perhaps was deliberately closing its ears to representations that were being made about the state of the country. The suggestion that Australia's interests were not at stake, I think, has been shown to be false by the fact that there had to be an evacuation of many thousands and that large economic interests involving Australia, including the Gold Ridge Mine in the Uepi Island Resort and a number of other places visited by the delegation, have suffered substantially.
We see the foreign minister wandering around in a cloud of ineffectuality, floating around looking for a place to settle. This morning he talked about women's groups and civil society needing to play a part in restoring democracy. When it was pointed out to him by a journalist that those women were saying that they desperately wanted Australian help, he said, `What we need before we can provide help is a request from a democratically elected, established government.' That is precisely what he had when the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands was making those desperate requests for months before the collapse of the society. We have got what we might call the `hole in the bucket society', where you start out by saying, `There's a hole in my bucket, Dear Liza, Dear Liza' and, in this case, asking: how do we fix it? There is an offer; it cannot be responded to. Eventually it returns to its point of origin, but we are still ineffectual: we are not reaching the standard expected of Australia in the region.

"Forrest, John, MP",NP,2000-06-26,"—It was a great honour to participate in this very valuable delegation to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. A number of highlights and special occasions occurred in both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The member for Denison has focused his remarks on the Solomon Islands. It was very important to meet with dignitaries and leaders from both countries. I cannot help but reflect on how very sad it is that security is so badly affected in both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands by the deteriorating social disruption that is occurring there. Events in the Solomon Islands have confirmed that. It is very sad, too, that both countries have such enormous potential in making a contribution in the world community.
Probably the most striking impression made upon me personally in regard to the visit to the Solomon Islands was at a meeting with the Prime Minister, the Hon. Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, which the member for Denison has referred to. The Prime Minister opened our meeting with one of the most fervent prayers of desperation I have ever heard. It was the most earnest of prayers. It has left me with a permanent impression of a good man in a desperate situation, seeing the erosion of democracy in his precious country. His prayer contained all the anxiety of a leader caught up in the spiralling downhill demise of his country, paralysed by ethnic tensions and violence—ethnic tensions that go back centuries. It is so sad that a man with a capacity to pray as he did with us was not able to prevent the circumstances which have subsequently occurred in the Solomon Islands. 
At the meeting which the member for Denison has referred to, the Prime Minister made reference to requests that Australia be involved in a 50-person multinational task force. I have to say, contrary to the member for Denison, that I had deep reservations about how such a move, if Australia approved it, would be interpreted. The problems of the Solomon Islands can only be solved by the people of the Solomon Islands. To have a big brother move in there left me with some uneasiness. More will be said, I guess, as things continue to occur in that country.
In the few minutes that are available it is not possible to reflect on everything that occurs on a delegation: there are many things. But I would like to make reference to Papua New Guinea. The delegation had an opportunity to look at several engineering and resource development projects being undertaken—one with Australian interests and another with United States interests. One was the Moro gas fields, developed by Chevron Niugini, from which a pipeline will be built to supply gas to Queensland, which holds active interest for us in Australia.
The other mining operation is the Ok Tedi copper mine in the Star Mountains in the far north-west of Papua New Guinea. Much has been written about this mine over the years. As someone who has practised for 25 years as a consulting and practising engineer and who has lectured in mining subjects for some of that period, I believe they are very sad circumstances. The Ok Tedi mine now stands as a testimony to a monumental mistake. A deliberate policy to release rock waste and tailings waste into the Ok Tedi River, finding its way to the Fly River, which is now a very badly silted river, is an appalling situation to see. Claims that the value of the mine in terms of the development and prosperity it has brought to the Papua New Guinea community have to be tested against the cost and deterioration that has occurred in that river. I believe we need to keep up international pressure on the operators of the Ok Tedi mine to ensure that, as the mine closes down, the river is not left in a situation that leaves the Papua New Guinea people with a poor legacy and, therefore, a poor opinion of what Australian mining operations can do for their country. In speaking with a former Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, the Hon. Michael Somare, in Port Moresby after the visit, I found he was very concerned that he was the Prime Minister who signed off on the environmental requirements to operate that mine. I believe the pressure and desire for international revenue was abused in this situation. (Time expired)

"Mr HAWKER,MP",LP,2000-06-26,"—On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 1998-99, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration reviews monetary policy and the operation of the Reserve Bank, particularly over the past six months. It is based on the committee's public hearing with the Governor of the Reserve Bank held on 22 May this year. 
The committee was pleased to note that the evidence indicates that the reforms of the last few years have strengthened the fundamental structure of the Australian economy. This has, in turn, permitted a higher rate of growth to be maintained without the rapid increase in inflation that ended our earlier growth periods. The report also examines the likely impact of the new tax system after 1 July. The committee notes that an initial increase in the level of inflation is anticipated, but it will watch closely to see whether inflation returns to normal levels as quickly as the bank expects. This outcome will be crucial to the economy's growth over the next two or three years, and a round of wage claims seeking additional compensation for the GST would not be helpful. In the bank's opinion, such claims would not be necessary, as the income tax changes more than compensate for the GST. 
A major issue of concern to the committee, addressed in the report, is the fact that the Reserve Bank had acted to increase the key interest rate—the overnight cash rate—four times between 3 November last year and 3 May this year. Those increases, totalling 1.25 per cent, raised the cash rate from 4.75 per cent to six per cent. The Reserve Bank said the increases were required to restrain inflation because the underlying measures of inflation were increasing and credit transactions were growing at a rate that could not be sustained in the long run. The bank stressed that, until the end of 1999, Australia had applied an expansionary monetary policy and that, in the changed economic circumstances in world markets, this was no longer appropriate. The bank said that the aim of its monetary policy was to continue Australia's long period of continuous growth—already approaching nine years and longer than the periods of growth achieved in the 1970s and the 1980s. The committee, while accepting this reasoning, was very concerned about the effects that increasing interest rates could have, particularly in sectors such as housing loans. It was also concerned at indications of a sharp decline in consumer spending. The committee will continue to monitor these matters in the months ahead. In recent statements, the bank has begun referring to the exchange rate as a factor in its decisions on interest rates. The committee questioned this and the bank explained that exports were now playing a much greater role in Australia's growth. This change, combined with a decline in the value of the Australian dollar, had produced inflationary effects that had been absent in the last few years. 
In the report there was also considerable discussion on whether the Reserve Bank is truly independent of government. The 1996 agreement on the conduct of monetary policy made between the government and the Governor of the Reserve Bank clearly states that it is appropriate for the government to comment on monetary policy from time to time. In evidence, the governor assured the committee that there has been no pressure on the Reserve Bank board to do anything other than that which the board would normally wish to do. The committee will be probing this matter further at its next hearing.
Other issues addressed in the report include the transparency of the Reserve Bank's decision making process, links between monetary and fiscal policy, the relationship between the Australian and the US economies, the bank's intervention in the foreign exchange market, new data on the bank's assessment of bank fees charged to consumers, particularly householders and small business, and progress with examination of interchange fees between credit card providers and the banks. The committee will continue to follow up these matters at its next hearing with the governor to be held in Wagga Wagga, in the electorate of the member for Riverina, Mrs Kay Hull, on 11 December. That will be the first Reserve Bank hearing ever to be held outside metropolitan capitals. 
I thank the Reserve Bank officers, especially the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, for their assistance with this review of the bank's policies and activities. I would also like to thank the committee members, the secretariat staff, particularly Bev Forbes and Tas Luttrell, the Parliamentary Library, the Parliamentary Education Office and the Liaison and Projects Office for their contributions to this inquiry and report. 
In conclusion, once more on behalf of the committee members and secretariat staff, I express our sorrow over the untimely death of the Deputy Chairman Greg Wilton. Greg, like other members of this committee, worked hard to achieve a bipartisan approach to the committee's work. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Report</title>,Delegation Reports,1,2
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—In the weeks preceding the committee's hearing with the Reserve Bank, the federal government politicised the conduct of monetary policy. In a concerted public campaign, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and even the Secretary to the Treasury placed pressure on the RBA not to further lift interest rates. The success of this campaign was reflected in the governor's testimony to the committee. He went out of his way to avoid any further controversy with the government, leaving commentators and market analysts with the clear impression that interest rates were in fact on hold. This is not a good way to conduct monetary policy in this country. It is the reason why the opposition members on the committee, the members for Grayndler and Chisholm and I, have produced a minority report which is quite critical of the Reserve Bank and the government.
Our criticisms go to four issues. First, Mr Macfarlane insisted that the introduction of the GST package was not a factor in the conduct of monetary policy even though, according to his own evidence, the GST was having an adverse impact on inflationary risks and inflationary expectations, as well as second round wage impacts and overheating in a few markets. Second, it was the governor's view that the recent deterioration in the federal budget surplus was not making the Reserve Bank's job any harder, so there was no desire for a different fiscal policy, even though in November 1999 he told the committee that it was in fact wise to run big surpluses in the latter years of an economic expansion. Third, the governor refused to answer questions concerning the observation in the bank's semiannual statement that some political comments about interest rates triggered a depreciation in the Australian dollar in late January this year. He dismissed this as a media event not an economic event. Finally, there was the governor's claim that the RBA is independent of the government, even though the government's chief economic official, the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, sits on the RBA board. In each of these instances the credibility of the Reserve Bank has been diminished. Particularly on the question of fiscal policy, it is unacceptable for the RBA to point to political considerations when the bank itself is supposed to be independent of the political process. Further, it is unacceptable for the RBA to refuse to answer questions on material published in its own semiannual statement. This is a failing in the bank's accountability to this parliament.
The RBA spends a lot of time and effort backgrounding journalists. It has a number of economic writers well and truly on the drip. It was somewhat inevitable, therefore, that one day the Reserve Bank would be caught up in a media war with the federal government. In the end, the government won this contest and the conduct of monetary policy has been compromised. It is now appropriate for our parliamentary committee to closely examine the relationship between the Reserve Bank and the government. Much needs to be done to enhance the independence and transparency of the Reserve Bank. In our past hearings this issue has been raised continually, particularly regarding the publication of Reserve Bank board minutes and also the possible removal of the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury from the Reserve Bank board. 
Accordingly, the dissenting Labor members on the committee have produced a minority report. We would request that the committee commission research work to examine the following four proposals: first, that the RBA board be made fully independent of the federal government by removing the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury; second, that one of the board members demonstrate particular expertise in regional and labour market policy, a measure which would address public concerns about the impact of monetary policy on regional development; third, that the RBA publish its board's minutes at a suitable period of time after each meeting, which is standard practice among many central banks internationally and which would add to our processes in this country; and, finally, that the arrangements specified in the 1996 exchange of letters between the RBA and the government be converted into legislation. These arrangements for the independence, transparency and accountability of the bank would have a stronger standing at law plus greater credibility in the eyes of the financial markets if they were to be included in the RBA statute. We look forward to the further work of the committee and the close examination of those four worthy proposals.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Report</title>,Delegation Reports,1,2
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2000-06-26,"—Today I would like to comment on three points in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration on our hearings in relation to the Reserve Bank. Firstly, I would like to comment on the governor's endorsement of the government's handling of the economy. Secondly, I would like to endorse the governor's comments in respect of the effect of the new tax system in putting pressure on wages—that is, wages being increased to meet increases in prices. Thirdly, I would like to comment on the farcical debate regarding the independence of the Reserve Bank of Australia.
I am embarrassed for the Labor Party that they would have a minority report on such an innocuous hearing with the Reserve Bank governor. It is disappointing and, unfortunately, their claims ring hollow because of the fact that, under their tenure of government for 13 years, including the time the member for Werriwa was a member of that government, all the requirements that they now stipulate for the Reserve Bank and its management were never implemented. In fact, they continued with an entirely controlled Reserve Bank. If I remember rightly—and I am sure members of this House remember—former Prime Minister Paul Keating would talk about the Reserve Bank governor being in his back pocket. He used to say, `Don't worry about the Reserve Bank governor, I've got him in my back pocket.' This was from a Labor Party that now stands up in this House and demands that we introduce four changes which will ensure the independence of the Reserve Bank. This government is the first government in the history of the Commonwealth to actually introduce an agreement with the Reserve Bank guaranteeing their independence. The whole debate about the independence of the Reserve Bank was a comic festival.
The Governor of the Reserve Bank himself made the very important point that it is an absurdity to suggest that, because there was controversy over the position of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the governor earlier this year with regard to monetary policy, that somehow indicates that the Reserve Bank is not independent. In fact, it indicates that it is independent because if the Reserve Bank were not independent, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister would only need to ring the Reserve Bank governor to tell him or her their view on what monetary policy should be. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and others felt the need to make public comments about monetary policy, which they are entirely entitled to do, because they cannot control the Reserve Bank and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It is in the board of the Reserve Bank's fiat to decide monetary policy; it is not the role of the government of this day, unlike the government of the Labor Party, which did tell the Reserve Bank how to set monetary policy. The governor had good things to say, for instance: 
I think one of the reasons for this attracting a lot of attention is that it can happen only when you have an independent central bank. It cannot happen if the government is making monetary policy; it cannot get up and criticise itself and give alternative views. It seems to me that it is just an inevitable result of having an independent central bank in a democratic society.
I agree with that and I think the Reserve Bank governor has encapsulated in that remark the speciousness of the Labor Party's tactics today and of their minority report dealing with the independence of the Reserve Bank. I would also like to draw the House's attention to the remarks of the governor with regard to the conduct of fiscal policy in this country. The Governor of the Reserve Bank believes that the country's fiscal policy is being run in a perfectly acceptable fashion. The governor said:
. . . I think internationally we are regarded as having a very good fiscal policy. We are probably regarded as having fiscal policy which is almost second to none . . .
He also said:
. . . the current stance of fiscal policy is not making the Reserve Bank's job any harder, so we have no desire for a different fiscal policy . . . this is the fourth year in a row of surplus, there is no borrowing and the outstanding stock of government debt to GDP is lower in Australia than in any developed country.
This is high praise indeed from the central bank governor to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister, to praise the good fiscal policy which is not having an effect on monetary policy. The governor knows that he can place his confidence in the hands of the government to manage fiscal policy successfully.
With respect to the member for Werriwa, who commented on the governor saying that surpluses should be high over the last four years, the governor said that they should be high in principle, but he also went on to say—which was left out, conveniently, by the member for Werriwa—what confidence he had in the government's handling of fiscal policy. I do not think the governor had such high praise for the government's handling of fiscal policy in any of the 13 years that Labor was in office. In conclusion, I would like to endorse the governor's comments on pressure of wages. He said, and I agree with him:
We are working on the assumption that the income tax changes more than compensate for the GST and that wage earners will not expect another compensation for the wage bargaining process. I would be very disappointed if there were generalised wage pressure for what I would call `double compensation'.
I support that statement. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Report</title>,Delegation Reports,1,2
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I rise today to welcome the review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's annual report. The appearance of the Reserve Bank of Australia before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is one of the major elements of the bank's accountability to the federal parliament. This process of open reporting ensures that the setting of monetary policy in Australia is transparent. It is a major plank in the committee's role and I believe it greatly enhances the committee process in the parliament. At the outset I wish to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank and his staff for making themselves available to the committee and for all the extra work they have undertaken for the committee. The review of bank fees and charges was not an easy exercise to undertake, but the RBA has done so at our request and has produced some useful and interesting findings, many of which the committee will continue to monitor and explore.
The governor's willingness to appear before the committee is in stark contrast to other heads of key institutions and agencies who appear before Senate estimates only when they are dragged there kicking and screaming. The reporting to the committee is most welcome and ensures a level of openness and accountability which other institutions could take note of. The governor's openness before the committee and indeed the governor's accessibility to the market, analysts and the press have ensured that there has been understanding around monetary policy. Therefore, less speculation and negative impact on the Australian dollar and the Australian economy have occurred. Of late, there has been growing concern amongst the market players, business groups, economic analysts, financial journalists and politicians from the Prime Minister down that there has been a lack of clarity on monetary policy, which is uncharacteristic of the Reserve Bank and its governor. 
There has been much reporting in the financial and mainstream press, both prior to our last hearing in November and the most recent one, about the decision making process of the board and its impact on recent interest rate movements. There seems to be a void of understanding behind the most recent interest rate rises. This has had a negative impact on the Australian dollar. The uncharacteristic nature of this action on behalf of the RBA prompted me at our last report tabling to state that I would pursue the issue of tabling of the RBA board minutes. Recent events are making it imperative that the board undertake to make transparent their decision making process and the economic data on which they form this view. The governor's polite answer on the voting process of the board raises significant questions about how the board are operating at present. As stated in our minority report, it is time that the board made these minutes available. 
The sanguine view of the governor towards current fiscal policy is astounding, particularly in light of recent fiscal loosening. The governor's pat remark that this was political reality and something one had to factor in is a rather relaxed and naive view, given its impact on monetary policy. I thought the fundamental tenet of the RBA was to be independent of all influences and not to factor in political reality—that is for the likes of us to do. Monetary policy should be beyond political influence. It is worrying to see the governor so lightly disregard the current trends in fiscal policy. This is most concerning in light of the latest national accounts, which show that the economy is continuing to grow in the four percentage range. While this is good news at one level, it is worrying that the governor is not concerned about what impact fiscal loosening will have on inflation, particularly in light of continued growth. This will be a worry if the government is proved right and we see a lift in spending when people receive the GST tax cut bribes. The issue which the RBA has steadfastly refused to mention—the Fawlty Towers of the RBA—is the GST. There is no mention of the GST impact on inflation, which again is astounding, given that the governor has admitted that he is relying totally on Treasury modelling and the RBA has done none of its own. This is most worrying when you consider that the RBA's chief role is to ensure that inflation stays within a desirable range.
The RBA has identified the risk to inflation and the prospect of wages break-out that the GST may have, but the governor has simply assumed it away. This leaves one to assume that the RBA is relying totally on the government's perspective of the impact of the GST on inflation. Again I state that this is a worrying trend. The governor has continually stated that the RBA has done no modelling itself and is relying on Treasury for its analysis. Given the impact the GST will have on inflation, this leaves one wondering about the rigorous independence of current monetary policy.
This leads me to a positive point—the fine work of the committee and the normally frank exchange of views which happen when the governor comes before our committee. This has generated much interest in the operation of the RBA and the structure of the bank and its board. The work of the committee has ensured that these issues have been debated in the press. It is now an ideal time to review the operations of the bank and its structures. To have a clear understanding behind the thinking of the bank on interest rate movements and the basis on which these decisions are made can only strengthen the bank's standing. Notions that the board has been Sydneycentric could be disavowed if we undertook a review of its structure and the composition of its board. This is an ideal time as the changes from Wallis are now being bedded down. This has been canvassed in our minority report. The RBA should be commended for its role in international forums and for its continued recognition as a world leader in monetary policy and sound financial management. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—From this Saturday, for the first time in 50 years, Australian women will pay tax on their tampons and sanitary products. Over 10,000 Australians signed an electronic petition at the beginning of this year calling for the tax on tampons to be abolished. But the government has refused to listen, and from this Saturday five million everyday Australian women will pay more for their already expensive tampons. How much more? 
Let us have a look at the ACCC Everyday shopping guide and how prices with the GST will affect everyday Australians. Of course, they are not under food, clothing, housing, household equipment and operations or transport. Maybe they are under health and personal care. The government, of course, does not consider them health products, so they must be under personal care products—but I cannot find them. Multivitamins are there, estimated to go up by 8½ per cent; nappies are there, estimated to go up 8.6 per cent, but, of course, tampons are not listed. The government does not think they are a health product. Maybe it thinks they are a recreational product—but, no, tampons are not in that list either. But there are those other everyday purchases that we everyday Australians purchase, like fishing rods or cricket bats. Thanks to the ACCC, we can monitor how these prices will change and make sure that we are not being ripped off, but there is no estimation for the five million Australian women who must purchase tampons and sanitary products.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2000-06-26,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts, I present the committee's report entitled Regional radio racing services—Inquiry into the impact of the decision by ABC Radio to discontinue its radio racing service, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I acknowledge members in the chamber here today, including the members for Lowe, Moreton and Bendigo, who were active participants in this inquiry. In the very first chapter of our report we make the following opening statement, which came from a submission by Mr Crane:
The beauty of having a broadcast you can hear is that you can place your bets then go home and listen to them on the radio and be with the family ... Now twenty years on we cannot even hear them. They call that progress. We can land a man on the moon but we can't hear a race.
I thought that was a very poignant start from one of the early submissions to our inquiry. The whole business of this inquiry was to try to re-establish in regional Australia something that had become an icon for people with regard to their Saturday and public holiday entertainment. It was strange that when we announced the terms of reference for the inquiry, and even before the inquiry proper had got under way or gained any momentum, the ABC issued a press release that said that claims by the racing industry that `there is a groundswell of support from ABC regional listeners for the return of the service' were far from the truth. It also said that 80 per cent of ABC radio regional listeners `had not the slightest interest in horse racing coverage'. We found that quite extraordinary and, as the inquiry unfolded, we received 208 submissions. Hardly a reflection of no interest! We received 200 form letters and 500 signatures on petitions.
As the committee went out and visited Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart and Barraba, in north-western New South Wales, as well as holding hearings in Canberra, it became clearly obvious that people were very much affected by this decision. The interesting feature about this is that the submissions came from ordinary people—ordinary, rank and file people. It became clear that the best and most effective solution for the restoration of this radio racing service would be for the ABC to restore it. Clearly, however, that is now no longer possible because: (a) the whole system within the ABC has been dismantled; and (b) the ABC having dismantled their own service and being reliant in some states on the TAB, there are conflicts with the charter of the ABC.
We were surprised at the inadequacy of the ABC's research on audience needs and preferences. Surveys were actually held after the inquiry commenced, which we found most unusual. There was a lack of public consultation, and the ABC did not even refer this matter to its national advisory council. If you were going to cut out something that was fairly widely liked in regional and rural Australia, wouldn't you think you would call on your advisory council to provide you with some advice? 
We have decided that the best way of doing this is to expand the TAB services, be that 4TAB, 927, 2KY or whichever service is available in each state, and we will require alterations to licences to give those race broadcasters greater certainty. My colleague the member for Lowe is going to expand on that, as will other members of the committee, including the member for Throsby, in the Main Committee.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I would like to endorse the remarks of the member for Hinkler, and I would also like to commend the committee secretariat, in particular Jan Connaughton for the solid work she has put into the report. People from all over regional Australia were very concerned about the withdrawal of this service, because a whole range of other services has been pulled out of regional Australia over the last 10 years. We have seen small towns where chemists and banks have closed and Telstra services have been wound down. This is all a result of the way the economic situation works at the moment. Of course, they see this radio racing service as just another service that is lost.
As the member for Hinkler has pointed out, a considerable number of people took an interest in this issue, and many people signed petitions. During the course of the inquiry, a couple of anomalies came into being—in particular relation to the ABC—which the member for Hinkler has addressed. One area that he did not touch on is the licence area planning organisation which is administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. This organisation has come under quite considerable criticism in the report, justifiably in my view. I have had one particular experience with this organisation in Bendigo. A group called Gospel Radio has been offering a very worthwhile radio service throughout regional Victoria for some 15 years. For the last two years it has been operating without cost to government. It has been entirely funding itself, and its licence was withdrawn some months ago. It was taken away totally by the ABA. One of the worst things about that is that the ABA have yet to determine just what available spectrum there is, not only in regional Victoria but all over Australia—a task that was, I understand, given it some 25 years ago with still no result. They come under considerable criticism, and that criticism is justified. 
One of the other problem areas with the reduction of radio racing services by the ABC is that commercial stations have not been able to fill the gap, and there have been some very good reasons for that. The main one is the establishment of the low power open narrowcast licensing system. At the moment, those licences are put up for auction. Obviously, some of the commercial radio stations are very interested in buying those, but they are forced to pay a premium for them at auction by people who go to auctions and push the bidding up but have no use for that particular licence. Of course, that prevents the commercial stations from taking up the slack that the ABC has left, because they are not able to buy these licences. 
The report makes some very interesting recommendations in relation to dealing with that matter and I certainly hope that the minister is able to take those up. As I said, it has been a very good committee to be on. I commend the report to the House.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I present the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill 2000 in the hope that it will draw, but not the anticipation that it will draw, support from the government. There is no doubt in the public mind that there is a great deal of disquiet over the way in which the government has used taxpayers' funds to advertise its political position, particularly in relation to the goods and services tax. The figures of this advertising campaign are now well known: a cost of some $431 million. It is, by its dimension, an act without precedent in the history of the Commonwealth—an extraordinary waste of public resources. One of the outstanding features of it is that, at the conclusion of it all, we see recorded from small business and we see recorded in the most recent public opinion poll that at least a majority of the public have come out of it with basically no understanding of the obligations which are about to hit them.  
In the case of those who are the government's taxpayers, it is inducing a state of desperation and a position of blind fury when they confront the Australian Taxation Office and those who are supposed to be able to give them information. When they sit in their lounge rooms and see the television component of this campaign talking about simpler taxes and talking about a tax regime that is beneficial to the Australian public—and while millions are being spent on that—but they cannot get answers to simple questions, it aggravates them beyond belief. What the more general taxpayers—those who are going to pay the tax rather than organise it—see in that $431 million is disappearing primary school teachers, disappearing high school teachers, unbuilt hospitals, closed hospital wards, unbuilt public nursing homes and all the plethora of public investment that this country so desperately needs but which has been scoured to provide the government with resources to pay the upper income tax cut that is associated with the goods and services tax. 
The only people unambiguously benefiting from the changes in the taxation arrangements are the top 15 per cent of income earners. They are benefiting not from the implementation of the GST but from the expenditure of amounts of money that were raised by taking a billion off universities, billions off R&D concessions to business, hundreds of millions off public hospitals, hundreds of millions off the public education system and programs like the dental care program for the elderly, and billions off programs training the unemployed to get themselves back into the work force. Those are the opportunity costs of the government's payment of income tax breaks to those on upper incomes. Within that, I suppose you would have to incorporate the $431 million that has come from the budget to support the government's advertising campaign.
Let me say what this bill does and where it comes from. The bill will amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to require government advertising to meet minimum standards with respect to objectivity, fairness and accountability, and to prohibit the expenditure of taxpayers' money on advertising which promotes party political interests. It expressly makes it an improper use of public money to use or permit to be used any public money for a government information program unless that program is in accordance with the principles and guidelines for the use of government advertising—that is, in addition to the other ways in which public money may be improperly used or disposed of. 
We set out the principles and guidelines for the use of government advertising which are substantially identical to the draft guidelines recommended in October 1998 by the Auditor-General following a report on the government's $20 million tax reform advertising campaign in the lead-up to the 1998 federal election. The Auditor-General, while not approving of that particular campaign, decided that the act rendered the government, or, more specifically, himself, powerless to comment on what he regarded as a completely inappropriate expenditure of public funds.
You will recollect that $20 million campaign. That was put in place immediately after the release of their documentation. We remember it well for one cardinal element of it: nowhere in the two weeks of campaigning and the $20 million worth of expenditure were the words `goods and services tax' mentioned—nowhere. The Auditor-General clearly found that an absurdity, given that at the heart of the government's proposals was a $30 billion new tax. It was the only elephant unrecognised in any advertising campaign involving elephants which any of us could recollect. It was like Bullen's Circus being advertised without the animals. It was an extraordinary use of public funds at that stage. It broke all records both in amounts expended and in proximity to elections. Precedents were seen and perceived in past behaviours of governments, including our own, but the big difference was in quantum and location and in the complete abandonment of any pretence that the core elements of the package being advertised were actually going to be mentioned in the advertising campaign. Nowhere in the advertising in relation to the superannuation campaign or the employment services campaign that had been run by previous Labor governments months and months before elections—not a fortnight before—was there any removal of a core feature of it from any form of the advertising. The core feature of this particular campaign was well and truly removed from government consideration. 
At that tiddling stage, we can now say—it looked substantial at the time—at that minuscule, embryonic stage of what has been the greatest act of theft from the public purse by a government for its own benefit in the history of this country, the Auditor-General recommended a set of guidelines and principles that a government ought to operate on. This is not an exclusion of government advertising. Obviously, governments have to advertise. There is a plethora of programs that governments adopt, there are issues that governments must take up—health warnings, health problems and the like—which will oblige governments to spend not insubstantial sums of money on informing the community about what is going on, what benefits they might access and what things they must do in order to comply with the requirements of a particular government policy. All these things have to be done; there is no doubt about that. Because they have to be done, the potential is there for abuse. In most situations, where there is an obligation to do something in terms of public policy or public activity, where that obligation is capable of being abused for purposes that are at variance with the principles of that particular activity, there are sensible safeguards. Those sensible safeguards have been proposed by the Auditor-General and are contained within the provisions of the private member's bill which I am introducing. Among other things, the principles and guidelines provide:
Government advertising material should be relevant to government responsibilities. 
Material should be presented in an objective and fair manner.
This particular campaign hits its first rock. It has skated past the initial rock and now it has hit its first. It then moves on:
Information should be based on accurate, verifiable facts, carefully and precisely expressed in conformity with those facts. 
It is now mounting the reef. It has some speed and momentum behind it, this one. It continues:
No claim or statement should  be made which cannot be substantiated.
The recipient of the information should always be able to distinguish clearly and easily between facts on the one hand and comment, opinion and analysis on the other.
Material should not be liable to misrepresentation as party political.
Information campaigns should not intentionally promote, or be perceived as promoting, party-political interests. 
Material should be presented in unbiased and objective language, and in a manner free from partisan promotion of government policy and political argument. 
Material should not directly attack or scorn the views, policies or actions of others such as the policies and opinions of opposition parties or groups. Information should avoid party political slogans or images.
The `Unchain my heart' advertising was of a piece with the Liberal Party's advertising at the previous election. It continues:
No information campaign should be undertaken without a justifiable cost/benefit analysis.
What a ripper that would produce in this particular case. It continues:
The cost of the chosen scale and methods of communicating information must be justifiable in terms of achieving the identified objective(s) for the least practicable expenses. Objectives which have little prospect of being achieved, or which are likely to be achieved only at disproportionate cost, should not be pursued without good reasons.
Very few of those criteria would see this government's advertising campaign skating safely through them. They would be wrecked comprehensively on this reef—and so they should be. This campaign has been an absolute disgrace. Not only did the phrase `goods and services tax' not make it into the lexicon of the advertising for the initial $20 million campaign which caused the Auditor-General to suggest that these sorts of standards ought to be imposed upon governments, but it was scarcely mentioned during the $430 million full `adult' version of the initial $20 million embryo, even though there is now an obligation on very large numbers of Australians to implement the government's legislation on pain of quite severe penalties if they fail to do so.  
We seek to put in an act the suggestions of the Auditor-General which call for objectivity in advertising. Contemplate those suggestions in the context of the `John and Wendy' component of this advertising, which we demonstrated conclusively was misleading. We demonstrated that conclusively enough for those ads to disappear: the government was not completely shameless as far as that was concerned. Recollect how John and Wendy would be demonstrably worse off in a reasonably anticipated set of circumstances. Given the birth dates of about half the children in this country, a reasonably anticipated set of circumstances would see ordinary Australian families effectively bereft of any compensation that matched the size and weight of the goods and services tax.
In this advertising, we have had not an information campaign but a disinformation campaign, which has been put forward by the government to defend its position on tax. The government is hoping desperately that from all of this it can drive into the public mind the notion that somehow or other, for all its faults in shifting the basis of tax away from those who can afford to pay towards Australian families in particular, the tax is good. The government engaged in this process hopes that those who are now the principal taxpayers of this nation, those who are now the principal, unpaid tax agents of the Commonwealth, will suspend all judgment about the complexities that now confront their lives and the unfairness of the situation they now confront and say, `Well, whatever else it is, it is good for the country.' Nothing that requires this sort of advertising campaign, with this sort of expenditure of money, can be described as `good for the country'. Nothing that requires this level of complexity in its administration, with more than a million new Commonwealth tax agents, can remotely be described as `good for the country'. Nothing which shifts the burden of taxation onto ordinary Australian families can be described as `good for the country'. A $430 million campaign, whatever else it does, is incapable of delivering that. So it is the opportunity cost here that we must lament—the $430 million campaign as a political task has been a massive failure. But what has been lost to our schools and hospitals, in care for our elderly and in public investment, is untold. I ask leave of the House to present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.
Leave granted.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—Let me tell the House why the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 2000 [No. 2] is necessary and why it is urgent. This nation and this economy are going through a period in which industrial disputes are longer and more vexatious than in any time since the Labor government set up the enterprise bargaining system. A principal reason for this is that the government, and especially its Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, has stripped the Industrial Relations Commission of much of its power and resources to prevent and to settle disputes. The bill seeks therefore to try to give back this power to the commission, and it demonstrates our intention when in government to do so. In other words, we will restore to the commission the capacity to meet its central and historical obligation to promote fairness, to keep the peace in the workplace and, in the process, to protect the public interest. The reason for this and the need for urgency are obvious. There is a violence in industrial relations nowadays, in both action and language, that we have not seen for many years. We saw what happened to the picket line in Sydney during the waterfront dispute and in Melbourne more recently. Strikes by employers have become more vicious. G&K O'Connor's Meatworks in country Victoria, in an action labelled `a baseball bat lockout' by Justice Spender of the Federal Court, locked out its employees for eight months because they refused to accept 10 per cent to 17.5 per cent pay cuts. ACI in Melbourne locked out its employees on Christmas Eve last year and kept them out for five months. The Joy mining machinery workplace in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales has locked its workers out for more than two months. 
The minister makes much of the statistics which show that the level of all industrial disputes is relatively low—so it is. When he has tipped the balance of workplace justice so far against individual working people, that is not all that surprising. When he has spent every waking moment for four years finding ways to vitiate the role of the commission to keep the peace and the obligation of unions to protect working people, why wouldn't it be? But the point that the Labor Party is making—the point that the minister cannot avoid, try as he might to put daylight between himself and the facts—is that the level of strikes that tend to be longer, more bitter and less easy to solve is higher than it used to be. This is against the good of the economy and against the good of society.
The minister says that we are wrong. He does so in his usual way, comparing like with unlike, apples with oranges—the tricks that have led so many people to have much trouble believing anything he says. We are not wrong. ABS figures on industrial disputes in the enterprise bargaining era that began in 1992 clearly show that strikes lasting 20 days or more—the kinds of disputes that beg for action by an independent umpire—are something like 116 per cent higher under the coalition than they were under Labor. A 116 per cent change in anybody's language is a massive trend. The figures are clear. What we see as we look around the industrial scene is clear. We have a problem here. We have moved well away from the coalition's pledge, when it was promising whatever it took to win office, that its industrial policies would bring about a more inclusive and cooperative workplace. We cannot be shocked when a national study of workers' attitudes carried out for the Australian Industry Group discovers a workplace environment in which the values of cooperation have been driven out by the raw drive to survive. I quote the report:
Employees have never competed so ruthlessly against each other for jobs and money. Loyalty between employer and employee is being eroded across the board and many young people don't experience it.
Some people have done well out of this situation, but the sense of insecurity that is engendered among workers generally is great and growing. It can be found not only in the AIG study that I have just mentioned but also in the surveys done regularly by the Roy Morgan organisation and—most notably, because the canvass was so broad—for the ACTU by Yann Campbell Hoare Wheeler. So, on the one hand, we have the government's claim that it is a system that, by banishing the old complexities of industrial law and practice, brings about a more productive and flexible workplace and increased living standards by encouraging greater cooperation and participation. On the other, the reality is a steadily more insecure and apprehensive work force in which the gap is widening between the haves and have-nots and disputes are increasing and becoming more poisonous and complicated.
Why has this happened? It is because, from the moment he assumed office, the minister has been making industrial relations in this country over in his own image—confrontational, bullying, aggressive and partial. The minister was handed this confrontational brief by the Prime Minister, who told parliament back in 1992, when asked about the coalition's plans for the commission `we will stab them in the stomach'. He was quite upfront about it. He would not come around and stab the commission in the back—he said that he would tackle them head-on and `stab them in the stomach'. The minister has been following orders without question ever since. Here is a man who has spent the last four years indulging his obsession of exempting working people from forms of protection offered for nearly 100 years by the commission, sending them out to fend for themselves in a workplace environment where only the strong can survive. And the strong, I might say, cannot only survive but they become confrontational. We will see the consequences of that confrontation in the next round of enterprise bargaining foreshadowed for Victoria. 
The person to blame for that exclusively—the system in operation exclusively in Victoria is the minister's system—is the minister. This facade that we have seen, firstly in their defeated legislation and now in their serial legislation, so he seeks to be a serial offender in this regard, all of that cobbled together is part of one thing: politically attempting to get himself exempted from the consequences of his own legislation when it comes home to roost over the course of the next month or so.
Among the first changes the minister made to industrial legislation in 1996, he transferred jurisdiction over various matters, including the conduct of industrial action, from the commission to the Federal Court, though its experience of industrial disputes settlement was quite limited. Presumably he anticipated that the Federal Court, since it was uncontaminated by any noxious IR club influence, would do the right thing to the noisy and troublesome proletariat. But the minister has been disappointed. The court has refused to be one of his poodles. He has therefore been forced to cast around for alternatives. One was to piggyback industrial relations matters on to the authority of the new Federal Magistrates Court, to which all parties agreed basically to deal with the overflow of matters from the Family Court. Twice the minister tried to add industrial relations matters to the authority of the new court and twice this parliament has stopped him. 
His second alternative was in his pattern bargaining bill, which, among other things, proposed to extend the jurisdiction over the conduct of protected action from the Federal Court to state and Territory courts—anywhere, it must be noted, but the commission. The minister tried to argue that the bill proposed more, not less, power to the commission relating to industrial action. It did nothing of the kind. What it actually proposed was to put limits on protected action and then direct the commission not only to police these limits but also to do so within a very limited timetable—once more what we might call the minister's Patrick syndrome: his epic and often unavailing struggle to explain what the facts actually are.
The role of the commission may well be different in a bargaining system than in an arbitral one. Its principal obligation should remain, however, to be the independent umpire to see that peace is maintained and justice is done in the workplace. The minister disagrees. He has set out to clip the commission's wings from the day the Prime Minister gave him his orders. His 1996 legislation restricted its power to arbitrate and, in so doing, its capacity to conciliate. It restricted the commission's power to make awards. In doing so, it limited its capacity to prevent and settle disputes. The courts have become the arena for settling industrial disputes. We know why this is so. The minister understands full well what it means in terms of the financial and other costs to unions and their members and to individual working people. He understands what it means when the financial and other capabilities of the interests involved are compared. The Hunter Valley dispute has been dragging on for years while lawyers have carried out complicated and expensive manoeuvres to deny employees access to what is left of the arbitration powers of the commission. The waterfront dispute, with all its implications for the national economy, had to wend its way through the Federal Court and up to the High Court before it could be settled. The Victorian and Queensland governments have explained to the Senate committee looking into the second wave proposals how this emasculation of the commission was causing problems for them. In addition, the commission has had to cope with a stream of morale sapping criticism whenever it has threatened to get in the minister's way. It has been censured as an unwanted third party in workplace relations. It has been accused from the Senate of frustrating the minister's strategy. It has been criticised for not dealing quickly enough with famously nitpicking award stripping processes. And when the minister did not like some of its award stripping provisions he referred them to the full bench, displeased with what he calls its generous living wage adjustments. He suggested in his notorious letter to John Howard in December 1998 that it share its wage decision making with bureaucrats from the Productivity Commission, the Reserve Bank and Treasury.  
The minister himself may be well pleased about all of this. Some interests have done rather well out of it, but it is hard to see many advantages in it for working people, for the community as a whole or for our future as a knowledge nation. The Labor Party therefore intends to restore the capacity of the commission to oversee industrial relations and to ensure that the system serves the national interest and not just partial interests. This bill is intended to kick-start this process. Let me describe its provisions in general terms. Its purpose is to facilitate and maintain a cooperative industrial system which promotes the economic prosperity of all Australians, meaning, among other things, that with the commission's protection wages and conditions will be determined on the foundation of minimum standards by agreement among employees, employers and their organisations; that an effective award system will provide for secure, relevant and consistent wages and conditions; and that there will be a framework of rights and responsibilities for employers, employees and their organisations which supports fair and effective bargaining and ensures that the parties abide by the awards and agreements that apply to them. The bill provides that the functions of the commission shall be to prevent and settle disputes, by conciliation if possible or arbitration where necessary. To this end, it provides that the commission will have the limitations put on it by the government removed so that it can make or vary awards. Finally, and significantly, it will be able to make orders ensuring that parties negotiate in good faith and genuinely try to reach agreement, that they do not tried to obstruct negotiations or the conclusion of agreement. An enterprise bargaining system cannot be fair or effective unless the law insists on good faith bargaining. If we are to be a sophisticated and skilled economy and society, we must have an impartial, fair, orderly and effective industrial system. We cannot have or sustain such a system when the authority overseeing it is under constant assault, as it has been under this government. 
The Labor Party in government will thoroughly overhaul and modernise the legislation so that it reflects this century's economic and social conditions rather than those of two centuries ago. For the moment, this bill is a first and urgently needed step. This is at the heart of our industrial relations strategy. The only defence this government has is to misrepresent our positions. We saw that again here in question time today. One of the first things we did in industrial relations was to take the penal provisions out of the Trade Practices Act—not eliminate them but take them out of the Trade Practices Act and put them where they belong, in the Industrial Relations Act. It is a piece of the same process. While this government has sought to throw out into dozens of different situations the industrial powers of the Commonwealth, we see it, relevantly, as resting with the body which has built up expertise and the trust of ordinary Australians over a century of activity. That is because we are about ordinary Australians. We are not about the few; we are about the many. We are about their sense of security, their sense of a capacity to be able to provide for their families without fear, their ability to operate in workplaces which constitute a third of their lifetime's activity without threat and without fear, and this bill is going to help.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—Few people would not be moved by hearing the words of Sydney grandmother Judie Stephens concerning her grandson Jackson, who was just three months old when a car crash left him brain injured, blind and quadriplegic. Mrs Stephens's daughter and her husband—Jackson's mother and father—were killed in the accident. Mrs Stephens says, `Jackson is unlikely to ever be able to work and will need care for the rest of his life. When I am dead, a structured settlement will absolutely guarantee that Jackson has quality care for the rest of his life.' She says `Our government must act quickly to ensure that structured settlements are made available to protect people like Jackson.' Let me pay tribute to Judie's tireless efforts to reform the law to encourage structured settlements, and say to her that Labor has listened to her. I announce today Labor's interest in making periodic payments for accident victims tax free, as lump sums presently are. 
Labor will now engage in a round of consultation with representatives of victims, the insurance industry, the legal profession and relevant state authorities with a view to finalising our position prior to the election campaign. At present a person who permanently loses all or a significant part of their earning capacity and who requires extensive long-term care due to the injuries they have suffered may well be entitled, depending on the circumstances of the injury, to a large amount of compensation. In Australia this is almost invariably taken in the form of a lump sum. The reason for this is essentially twofold. First, there is no doubt a lump sum mentality, partly due to the attractiveness of finality. Claimants like to receive a final payment which they can spend as they please, and defendant insurers also like to make a final payment so that they can close their files. Secondly, there is the current uncertainty regarding the tax treatment in Australia of periodic compensation payments. If a claimant receives compensation as a lump sum, it is generally received tax free. But a claimant who receives compensation in the form of periodic annuity payments payable for an indefinite period, such as the claimant's life, may be subject to income tax. While the tax office's attitude to these periodic payments remains unclear, injury victims are not prepared to accept their compensation in the form of periodic payments and take the risk that they will be income taxed.
The object of personal injury compensation is, as best one can do this with money, to put the victim back in the position they would have been but for the accident. Lump sum compensation frequently fails to achieve this. Because a whole series of calculations are required about the victim's life expectancy, inflation, investment returns, their capacity to return to work, and the cost of injury related care and medical attention, lump sums frequently get it wrong. Sometimes a victim dies shortly afterwards and their dependants receive a windfall gain. More frequently the lump sum compensation turns out to be inadequate and the victim ends up as a social security recipient. A Business Review Weekly report suggested that 60 per cent of recipients who receive lump sum payments have dissipated the amount within five years. Sometimes lump sums run out because they are improperly managed. The anecdotal stories of this kind are dreadful. One recent Victorian case involved a woman who had gambled her quadriplegic son's compensation payment on poker machines.
Acutely aware of these shortcomings, a number of victims' families, members of the legal profession and insurance companies have developed and have been campaigning for the alternative to lump sums—periodic payments. This alternative is referred to as a `structured settlement'—a technique that enables those who are injured to receive all or part of their compensation in the form of a periodic payment rather than wholly in the form of a lump sum. The essence of the structured settlement arrangement is as follows. It does not completely exclude a lump sum; most structured settlements include an up-front lump sum component. It is optional rather than mandatory, only entered into with the agreement of both claimant and defendant. It is usually an out of court periodic payment settlement agreement between the parties, although such an arrangement could be ordered by a court. It applies in the context of compensation for personal injuries where the victim has an action for damages against a defendant and where the defendant is liable for damages and is insured in respect of that liability. It is most appropriate where the damages are large and include substantial future care and lost future earning capacity components.
There are obvious advantages for victims in having an annuity rather than a lump sum. The payment is not dependent on investment returns and continues right throughout the person's life. There are also advantages for defendant insurance companies. Based on overseas experience, the introduction of structured settlements may result in savings to general insurers of the order of eight to 15 per cent. This is because the settlement sum which the defendant insurer has to pay to settle the case in a structured settlement is generally eight to 15 per cent less than the sum which would otherwise have to be paid out as a traditional lump sum. 
There are also savings to Commonwealth and state governments. Despite the fact that the advocates of structured settlements want the Commonwealth to provide that annuities will not be taxed as income and therefore to forgo revenue as a result, investigations into the impact of this change suggest that it will save money for both the Commonwealth and state governments. The New South Wales Motor Accidents Authority 1998 report on structured settlements contains quite detailed financial modelling of the structured settlements proposal. This analysis of their estimated over 5,000 claimants each year who receive a lump sum in excess of $100,000 in settlement for personal injury is that these claimants cost the Commonwealth some $225 million per annum. That is made up of $540 million in social security costs and $94 million in health and welfare costs offset by taxation revenue of $408 million, leaving a net cost of $225 million. If you model the structured settlement alternative, the social security cost is reduced to $324 million and the health and welfare cost to $14 million, leaving a total of $338 million. Although the taxation revenue comes down from $408 million to $332 million, the net cost is $6 million, saving $218 million for the Commonwealth.
Another survey of potential costs and savings from structured settlements was carried out by consulting actuaries Cumpston Sarjeant in February this year. This report produces a much lower saving to the government of between $1.7 million and $3 million. That is because it uses a much more conservative estimate of the number of people who would actually take up a structured settlement option. Based on UK figures, it suggests that in Australia there would be 30 to 60 structured settlements each year. While these reports rest on a number of assumptions, they are a reasonable basis for believing that such a measure would not be a cost to revenue. I have asked a number of questions on notice designed to elicit information about the government's own assessment of this issue.
The international position is interesting. The common law countries Britain, the United States and Canada have similar legal systems to our own. It is highly significant that each has moved in recent years to facilitate structured settlements. In 1982 in the United States, the Internal Revenue code was amended to exclude from gross income any damages received `whether as a lump sum or periodic payments' on account of personal injuries or sickness. Money paid out in structured settlement annuities has grown from under US$1 billion in 1982 to $5¼ billion by 1996. In Canada, Revenue Canada announced in 1979 and refined in 1981 and 1987 an advance ruling that periodic payments received by a claimant as part of a settlement agreement were tax free. In the United Kingdom in 1984, Inland Revenue gave tax clearance to a hypothetical structured settlement case and from 1990 structured settlement cases began to be settled. So in each of these three countries we have seen movements in the direction of structured settlements.
A recently formed group in Australia, the Structured Settlement Group, has as members the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association, Injuries Australia, the Insurance Council of Australia, the Law Council of Australia and United Medical Protection. This organisation has been heavily lobbying the Howard government and a number of government members of parliament—one is in the chamber—have given their support to the group's objectives. Regrettably, however, the government has failed to respond to their proposals. I challenge the government either to indicate clearly to Judie Stephens and to the rest of the country what its objections to this proposal are or to adopt it.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Personal Injury Compensation</title>,Grievance Debate,11,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I rise to speak to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 and the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2000. I knew that if we waited long enough we would finally see just how far this government would go when it came to a free market economy. We have seen this government put a price on emergency evacuation from a world trouble spot. We have seen this government put a price on everything from child care to aged care. But now we have seen it all. This government has put a price on motherhood. How much is a mother worth? According to this government, a mother is worth $35,000 or, if you take the package deal, it will throw in dad as well for $64,000. That is the price of entry to Australia. That is what it will cost you to get your parents into Australia.
What kind of nation have we become when we put a dollar value on citizenship? Are we to join the ranks of Monaco and Switzerland in checking an applicant's bank balance rather than character before admitting them to our society? And will we judge an application only in terms of the costs rather than the value that they may bring to a family and to our nation? This heartless government look at parent migration and see only costs. They judge human beings like entries in a cashbook. As Oscar Wilde put it, they know the price of everything and the value of nothing. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs told us in his second read speech:
... many participants who wished to bring their parents to Australia indicated that they would meet all the costs associated with the migration of their parents.
He told us that he learned this from his community consultations on the 2000-01 immigration intake. But if you ask which communities he consulted, you might not be so surprised by that result. Did the minister consult in my electorate of Fowler, the electorate with the highest level of migrants in Australia? No. Did he consult in nearby electorates, such as Prospect or Blaxland, which also have high levels of migrant residents? No. So where did he conduct his community consultations? As the shadow minister has told us, the minister travelled from one end of the country to the other carefully avoiding electorates with high numbers of migrants.
The results of the consultations are not surprising. Given the cultural obligation of caring for parents held by many of my constituents, I do not doubt that a majority would go to great expense to bring their parents to Australia. Many would go into debt to pay the costs. Unlike this government, they do not put a price on motherhood. They will suffer any hardship to meet that cost. But the $64,000 cost represents quite a different burden for a family on $30,000 a year with no cash assets, as is common in my electorate, and a family with an income of over $100,000 a year with large cash assets. That is the difference between a price and a value. The value is the same for both families, but the price, or the burden of paying that price, is different. That is what this government cannot see.
This is a government which is prepared to exploit the bond between children and parents. It knows the strength of that bond and it knows that it can charge whatever it likes: people will pay what they must. The minister did not have to go on a round of consultations to find that out. The question he did not ask, though, was how people in electorates such as Fowler could afford to pay the ransom that this bill is demanding. In describing the previous entry arrangements, which were disallowed by the Senate, the minister said:
The government was not creating a visa class for the rich. We wanted to allow more parents to live in Australia, in a way which ensured a fair deal for the Australian taxpayer.
I am still looking for `the' Australian taxpayer. I, for one, would like to thank him or her for keeping us all in the style that we would like to become accustomed to. The fact is, and the government is quick to overlook this, `the' Australian taxpayer also includes the many thousands of Australians whose parents live overseas. And so far as ensuring a fair deal for the Australian taxpayer, how fair is it for them to pay taxes to support the health and welfare costs of parents other than their own? 
What the minister fails to recognise is that migration has given Australia the advantage of a much younger population than would have occurred naturally. We have already received benefit from not having to meet the expense of education and child care for a large proportion of our population. The fact is that we got a free ride on the backs of migrants who arrived in Australia ready to work—a free ride at the expense of the parents of those migrants. We did not have to feed and clothe them until they were old enough to work. We did not have to provide them with an education. We did not have to provide them with the skills which we now demand that they have before migrating here. That was all done for us and, in most cases, was funded by their parents. So do we say `thank you'? Not likely—not unless your kids can come up with $64,000. The minister insists that they are not visas for the rich and he goes on to explain—and I quote again, `that the previously disallowed arrangements may not have been a good deal for the Australian taxpayer.' The minister went on to list the total health costs for each parent as $120,000 in addition to $160,000 in welfare costs—a total lifetime cost of $280,000 for each parent or, you could say, $560,000 for both. So let us say that for an investment of $64,000 you could get a payout of $560,000. That, the minister would tell you, is getting a good deal for the Australian taxpayer. There is no mention of fairness for families who cannot afford to pay the ransom.
The fact is that the Australian taxpayer is still going to pay the bulk of the cost. But if you can come up with a down payment of $64,000, you can jump the queue. There is no need to consider each case on its merits. There is no need to consider the situation of the family in Australia that may desperately need the assistance of a parent to help a family member who is ill or disabled. There is no need to consider the plight of parents in areas such as the former Yugoslavia or, as is becoming apparent, Fiji, where their safety and wellbeing are under threat. But that is how the government see it. It all comes down to the bottom line or, in the minister's words:
... the negative budgetary impact of parent migration...
But that is not the whole picture. What this issue really comes down to is not a matter of fairness to the Australian taxpayer and it is certainly not a matter of fairness to families with parents overseas; it comes down to the policy of this government. This is made clear by the minister's actions and words. Faced with the disallowance by the Senate of his visas for the rich, he restricted the number of parent visas to 500. He then told us that he has reserved 4,000 places for designated parent visas over two years. That is 2,000 places per year. That is four times as many places for his visas for the rich than the 500 places for this year's intake. And that assumes that the present program will not be scrapped altogether and that the only applications approved will be for those capable of paying the $64,000
An intake of aged parents of 2,500 per year should be compared with intakes of over 11,000 per year 10 years ago. When you consider that there is a waiting list of more than 20,000, it is clear that only a very small proportion of applicants will ever be approved. So when it comes to fairness, it is not really about fairness to the Australian taxpayer, and it certainly is not about fairness to the many thousands of Australian families who will never be able to have their parents living with them. It all comes down to price. That, after all, is what the market system is all about. It is not about need and it is not about human factors. It is the same type of policy that this government are putting into place in areas of health and education. If you have private health insurance, you can jump the queue. Private schools can count on more and more taxpayer funding while public education gets less and less. That is the principle that drives this government's policies. If the rich are prepared to pay a little, they can feel entitled to grab a larger share of the cake when it comes to public resources. If you can afford to pay $64,000 to bring your parents into the country, they will be four times as likely to be accepted and that entitles them to nearly five times their investment in potential health and welfare payments. Whichever way you look at it, it is definitely not fair. This legislation deserves to be defeated.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-26,"—So the legislation is defeated; what happens to the parents? Do you want them to stay overseas? You did not answer the question of how much the Labor Party will charge them. Perhaps the member for Lowe, when he speaks, might like to tell the House what the party's intention is. The Labor Party have agreed, and I do not know if the member for Fowler is aware of this, with this legislation in principle but will not say how much they will charge. Why not? Why won't you say? That surely shows up the hypocrisy of your speech, that in fact the Labor Party are prepared to charge but are not prepared to tell the Australian people how much it might be. But they are prepared to say, `We will defeat this legislation and leave the parents overseas.' I ask the member for Fowler: how fair is that?
I am pleased to speak on this Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill tonight, because the coalition acknowledges and celebrates Australia's multicultural heritage. That, of course, goes back to the First Fleet. We have shown our commitment to ensuring that Australia's cultural diversity is a unifying force, both in the interests of the individual and of society as a whole. I see this, as you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, when we attend our respective citizenship ceremonies. I make a point of attending every citizenship ceremony that I can in Townsville and Thuringowa to reinforce this point about Australia's cultural diversity. We are probably the most culturally diverse nation in the world today, and I am pretty proud of that.
There are currently about 20,000 parents waiting to migrate to Australia, and if they were all allowed to migrate under current arrangements, the cost to Australian taxpayers would be measured in literally huge amounts of money. Indeed, the member for Fowler alluded to that. She gave an idea of the quantum of money, but she is saying that they should come at no cost. Whilst the entry of parents assists in providing support to their Australian families, and I recognise that, research shows that people who migrate to Australia late in life make minimal contribution to revenue and incur a very substantial cost in terms of social security and health. I believe the member for Fowler also recognised that.
The coalition is committed to maintaining the Australian community's confidence in the migration program. That is something the Labor Party do not recognise, but it is certainly something the government recognise. The program is currently being run in Australia's national interest so that all can enjoy the many benefits that a well-focused program brings to the country. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is likely you will remember that the Labor Party when in government recognised this cost, and still do today. It was the Labor Party that introduced the assurance of support bond and health charge in the early 1990s. Was that somehow or other discriminatory, as the member for Fowler said? During consultations with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on the 2000-01 immigration intake, many participants who wished to bring their parents to Australia indicated to the government, indicated to the minister, that they would meet all of the costs associated with the migration of their parents.
In response to the preparedness of sponsors to contribute to the costs of aged parents migrating to Australia, the government announced on 3 April 2000 that it would introduce new entry arrangements for parents in the 2000-01 program. These new arrangements will provide for a significant increase in the number of parents who will be able to come to Australia to be reunited with their children. I certainly have a significant number of ethnic groups in my community, and I would like to pause for a moment to thank the people from the Townsville and Thuringowa Migrant Resource Centre, who very ably work with me to look after the concerns of people in my community. They said to me that they welcome the government's initiative which is being debated tonight. They understand that there is a program where 500 applicants can enter Australia at no cost. That program still exists and it is likely that it will continue to exist. They also understand that the amount that the Australian government and the Australian taxpayer are asking parents to pay covers only one-fifth of the actual cost of bringing them to Australia. That is a huge concession.  
I ask the question: should the Australian taxpayer be expected to pay? The member for Fowler seems to think that the Australian taxpayer can pay for everything. That is what got this country into difficulty some 4½ years ago when the Labor government spent $10,000 million a year more than they had, and that is not something this government are prepared to be a party to. We believe the budget should be maintained in surplus, and we believe that we should not spend more than we have. I see we have some young people in the gallery tonight. Thank you for coming along to the parliament to be with us. Many of them would know that when they get their pocket money they cannot spend more than they have; and if they do they get into trouble. It is the same with the Commonwealth of Australia. The Australian government gets itself into trouble if it spends more money than it has. 
I am intrigued that the Labor Party have said that they agree in principle with what the government are trying to do, but they are going to vote against the legislation. Also, they have never said how much money should be charged. I call on the Australian Labor Party to say what their policy might be. I ask the member for Lowe, who is going to speak next: what is the Labor Party's policy? He will not say, even though he is a fine representative for Lowe and a person whom I consider to be a good colleague. He should say to the Australian people: `This is the policy of the Australian Labor Party', and I would like to hear a response from him tonight. 
A contingency reserve of 4,000 visa places is available for the parent category over the next two program years. This is in addition to places for other parent categories. The Senate voted to disallow the previous entry arrangements for parents, as they believed them to be visas for the rich. The member for Bowman would have you believe that this program is a Maserati visa or a visa for wealthy people. I can assure the House and the gallery that the government are not creating a visa for the rich. We want to allow more parents to live in Australia, in a way which ensures a fair deal for the Australian taxpayer. 
As a result of the disallowance and the negative budgetary impact of parent migration, the government were able to accommodate only 500 parents in the migration program intake for 1999-2000. I can tell you that there were many Australians who were disappointed at the actions of the Senate and the Australian Labor Party in preventing their parents from having the opportunity to come to Australia. How fair is that? We heard the member for Fowler complaining that these are visas for the rich but, on the other hand, we hear Australians saying that the Australian Labor Party have stopped their parents from coming to Australia. I ask the House: how fair is that? 
The designated parent visa category was introduced in November 1999 and was specifically designed to assist those parents who were adversely affected by the Senate's disallowance of the previous parent entry arrangements. The designated parent visa class incorporates key elements of the previously disallowed parent entry arrangements, including the payment of a $5,000 health charge for each parent. A very high level of interest in the designated parent visa category has been demonstrated by almost full acceptance of the minister's invitation to lodge an application under this category. Around 1,100 parent visas have been granted since November 1999, with the remaining 1,100 to be granted in the 2000-01 program year.
The introduction of the designated parent visa category was accompanied by an announcement of a more flexible visitor visa arrangement for parents with an ongoing migration application. This was in recognition of the extended processing times faced by parents and has resulted in a greater number of parents being able to visit their children in Australia. With its immigration policies, the coalition has sought to achieve a proper balance between its social, economic, environmental and humanitarian objectives in a nondiscriminatory way. Isn't that Australia all over? We are indeed lucky to live in this country. 
We are committed to the rights of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and to be treated with equal respect, regardless of race, colour, creed or origin. We strongly support the building of an Australia that is a culturally diverse, accepting and open society united by an overriding commitment to our nation and to its democratic institutions and values. We denounce racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society that we are and that we want to be. I strongly support Minister Ruddock and this legislation this evening, as do the constituents in my electorate of Herbert—in Townsville and Thuringowa. I look forward to the member for Lowe indicating that Labor agree in principle with this particular bill and indicating to this parliament tonight how much Labor would set its entry requirements at. I doubt that he will do it. ",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000. I would like to respond to the invitation from the member for Herbert, and I will start by returning the compliment—he is a fine person, and we enjoy a good working relationship on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communication, Transport and the Arts. He has invited me to respond and to put a figure on the cost of parent visas, but I make the point to the member for Herbert that only those who can afford to pay $65,000 can have those parent visas. He knows as well as I do that most of those who are seeking those visas come from Third World countries. The bulk of my work in the electorate of Lowe is immigration work, and it is a monumental triumph for double standards for the member for Herbert to expect me to stand up and put a figure on it. This is something for affluent people who can afford to bring out their parents. As the member for Herbert said, we are here to support parents being reunited with their families here in Australia, but if he honestly thinks people from Third World countries can afford $65,000—I am sorry, that is not possible.
I will start by supporting the amendment moved by the shadow minister for immigration and shadow minister assisting the Leader of the Opposition on multicultural affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca. There is a strong sense of deja vu in this bill before the House this evening—here we are again facing a bill that is substantially the same as the bill last year. The bill is one that is close to my heart, because it affects a number of constituents in my electorate of Lowe. Members will know that the federal electorate of Lowe is located in the inner west of Sydney. Lowe is one of the most ethnically diverse electorates of Australia and, according to the 1996 census figures, held by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are more than 20 statistically significant ethnic groups in my electorate. Every one of them has approached my electorate office on migration matters since I was elected to this House.
There are more than 500 active constituent files at any one time in my electorate office, and the bulk of these inquiries—some 80 per cent of all constituent inquiries—are about immigration matters. On this basis, I can say that I have a gained a degree of expertise in the matters. I will be most interested to hear other members of this House who have a significant migration practice give their testimonies as to the impact this will present in their electorate. I and my parliamentary colleagues on this side of the House oppose schedules 2 and 3 of the bill. We do so on ethical grounds, and I will address these grounds in a moment. Firstly, though, I wish to highlight the relevant provisions of this bill as it relates to family stream migration and specifically parent migration. Family stream migration includes the following visa subclasses: the spouse visa, the prospective marriage visa and the parent visa. In my experience, each of these visas has caused significant distress among Australian and non-Australian family members. Each of these visas involves significant delays in processing. Some of these delays are unavoidable, such as medical and character checks; other delays I say are the direct result of mismanagement on the part of the government.
I wish to recount the history of this bill and the disastrous consequence of the government's handling of a similar bill last year. Members will recall that, between March and November last year, the government introduced the new 113 subclass parent visa. The 113 visa was designed to replace the current 103 parent visa. The critical mismanagement by this government occurred when it introduced the 113 visa before the passing of last year's bill—essentially the same bill before us today. The critical mistake of this government was that it introduced the 113 visa administratively before the bill was passed by the Senate. This government receives applications from Australian embassies and high commissions throughout the world. Fees were taken that were upwards of $16,000 per retired couple seeking to enter Australia. This acceptance of 113 applications was taken by the government only to see the bill similar to this bill defeated in the Senate. 
The administrative repercussions were catastrophic. Applications were received on a visa which no longer existed. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs lumped all 113 subclass visas into the 103 subclass visa queue. This resulted in a massive visa waiting list blow-out. Members of this House will know that the current situation with the 103 parent visa waiting lists is both a farce and a disgrace. There are some 20,000 applications worldwide, with capping and queuing provisions of the department permitting an allocation of only 500 parent 103 visas per year. Hence the waiting period for a parent visa applicant is approximately 40 years—40 years for a parent visa applicant to wait for migration to Australia.
By definition, these parent visa applicants are already retirees. Most of us in this House will be dead in 40 years. A parent visa applicant lodging his or her application today may have their application processed in the year 2040. You can imagine the impact the decision had on existing applicants to lump 113 applications with 103 applicants once the 113 visa subclass had evaporated. I received many complaints from relatives arguing, with complete justification, that this administrative decision was a fundamental denial of natural justice. And so it was. The fact is, in administrative legal terms a legitimate expectation had been created by this government in its active acceptance of applications and the considerable sum of money for the purpose of applying under the new 113 subclass visa, thus drastically reducing the waiting period for entry to Australia.
Last year the opposition attempted to introduce more flexibility into the harsh conditions imposed by this legislation by including assets in the assessment of suitability of those offering assurances of support. The government rejected this proposal, instead promising to replace the taxable income level to $23,500 per annum with a cash saving component. Real assets remained ineligible. Further, the opposition attempted to deny the worst case scenario in seeing the existing pipeline of some 17,500 applicants abandoned in favour of the new elite 113 visa class getting red carpet entry to Australia. A token response was made by the government, offering to place some 25 per cent of the new applicants in the old pipeline. There is an annual intake of 2,800 parent visas. Twenty-five per cent of these equals approximately 700 applicants. The 25 per cent intake means that it would take an estimated 25 years to clear the backlog. It is totally academic whether the waiting period is 25 years or 40 years—both these periods are prohibitively long.
This bill, the proposals contained therein and the government's response are totally inadequate to the magnitude of the task. The government has failed to accept reality on this matter. The government has completely failed to adequately address the problem. This is a disgrace against the rights of the family, the rights of citizens and the natural law. This is why the Senate opposed the 113 visa last year and looks set to do the same again, in that those who could afford to pay the substantial fee for this visa were entitled to immediate entry into Australia while those who could not afford the $16,000 fee were essentially left to die. The only way a 103 visa applicant was going to enter Australia was in a coffin. The result was a messy situation, resulting in those applicants who lodged between March and November last year being entitled to be processed under the 113 queue but only after considerable outrage and distress was caused. I also understand that legal action under judicial review proceedings was afoot. The government, to its eternal shame, punished both the applicants and the Australian people with a public interest in this matter by resorting to the original system of 500 capped applications under the old 103 subclass visa. It did this as punishment for the Senate's refusal to participate in its inequitable and unjust law—a law we are again being called upon to enact.  
This bill seeks to close applications for the 103 parent visa. This visa has become a notorious visa worldwide, in that it demonstrates perhaps one of the most mismanaged visas this government has administered in its term of office. The bill before us repeats the regime of error that was defeated by this parliament last year. During World War II, Field Marshall Rommel said of the British Army in North Africa: `They came in the same old way and they died in the same old way.' If ever there was a case of old dogs performing old tricks it is the government today. This government has demonstrated today in this bill that it is too tired to think of innovative policies based on sound ethical reasoning. It is serving up the same old tripe. This government is simply serving up an old mouldy dish, a reheated dinner, that was bitterly unpleasant in the first place. Parliament did not like the bill last year and I anticipate that it will not like the bill any better now. The only thing that has changed is the number of people discriminated by the current regime.
This bill is about amendments to our migration laws, as it affects the sanctity of the family. I am reminded of the papal encyclical familiaris consortio as I say this. I am particularly reminded of the immediate rights of every family member to be united with their family. This is a natural law right in the hands of each of us. To deny reunification breaches the natural law. I do not concern myself with using terms such as human rights or reliance on the United Nations instruments. These instruments are secondary policy only to the more fundamental laws of the natural law and right reason. Let us be clear of the fundamental policy rationale that underpins family stream migration—the very ethic of family stream migration itself. The ethic is found in the right of families to be united. It is a fundamental and inalienable right of persons to exist as families. Family stream migration means that there is a judicial and policy recognition by our government in Australia that spouses may be united, that parents and their children may be united and that orphans and last remaining relatives may be united. This is a fundamental reason why the Australian government has separate visa subclasses for these and other personal circumstances. It is for this basic ethical reason that parents, spouses, last remaining relatives, orphans and others should be entitled to circumvent other criteria, such as working skills and language fluency, and be entitled to become permanent residents in this country without satisfying such qualifying criteria. 
The sanctity of the family is paramount. Any policy which trammels this sanctity is anathema to good governance. It is both manifestly unreasonable and unjust to impose restrictions on parent migration. The approach by the government today is as reproachable now as it was last year—I say again that it is substantially the same bill, and I say that particularly for the benefit of the member for Herbert—because only those who are well off can afford to be reunited with their parents. The ethical error of this government is at once immediate and obvious. The bill seeks to use money to financially discriminate between those who can afford to pay a sum of money—now up to $65,000 for a retired couple, as I have been saying—for the new subclass visa and thus gain immediate entry to Australia, whilst those who cannot afford the money are totally denied entry to Australia forever. The new subclass will require an application fee of $1,075 for offshore applications or $1,695 onshore plus a social security bond of $10,000 for the main applicant and $4,000 for secondary applicants and a health levy, which has increased from $960 per applicant under the present 103 visa to a whopping $25,000 fee per applicant. Remember that these fees are for each applicant.
Under the present regime the 103 subclass continues to exist. The proposed legislation will eliminate the AX103 visa entirely. This will mean that only persons who can afford to pay the $65,000 can enter Australia on parent visas. To put it bluntly, everyone else will be economically locked out of the visa. This is the hidden agenda of the government—the way it will manage the 20,000 queue of parent visa applications. New parent visa applicants will simply be denied absolutely the right of entry because they will be economically prohibited from entering Australia. There is a policy rationale that asserts that these parent visa applicants have not contributed to the Commonwealth of Australia through the taxation system. This is true. As permanent residents, they are entitled to the benefits of the social welfare system, including Medicare and our health system. However, this is anticipated through the other family stream migration that lends itself to the rights to sponsor parent visa applications. The benefits to the government in this bill are blatantly financially driven. The government expects to reap a profit of between $127 million and $155 million on fees recovered from the new parent visa over the first four years. The financial gains from this expedition are offset against the moral injustice afforded to family members. 
What this government has failed to understand is that migration in the other migration streams has compounding consequences on other visa subclasses, including the parent visa. For example, inducing a person to enter Australia as a skilled migrant carries with it the reasonable expectation that this skilled migrant also has living parents, perhaps a spouse and even a last remaining relative living abroad. Hence, the skilled migrant's rights as an Australian citizen include the right to sponsor his or her spouse, parent or last remaining relative to Australia. In certain circumstances this can result in a significant number of people. These are rights in the hands of permanent residents and Australian citizens which skilled migrants inevitably and predictably become. It is inconceivable that this government does not have these facts in contemplation when it wishes to increase the migration intake of, say, skilled migrants. When the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Phillip Ruddock, proudly boasted of increasing skilled migration this year, he must also have reasonably contemplated that every one of these applicants may have spouses, parents and last remaining relatives in another country. It is therefore manifestly unreasonable to deny the skilled migrants their rights as citizens and permanent residents of Australia in sponsoring such people.
This bill is an attempt to deny this basic fact and is a serious defect in reasoning in Australian migration policy. Australia is decreasing alarmingly in population. Our fertility rate is now so low that we are not populating sufficiently to enable sustainable economic and social growth. Without an increase in our migration program, Australia will simply go backwards as a country. The government wants to have its cake and eat it too. Through constraints created in the business visa program, it wants young, English literate, educated, productive, skilled immigrants to enter Australia and thus be immediately productive in the Australian economy. On the other hand, it is placing economic barriers to these people's extended families and denying them basic rights by economically separating them from their parents and those for whom their family duties make them natural carers.
This government has failed to acknowledge that, if a skilled man or woman makes the decision to bring their skills and expertise to Australia and to settle here permanently, they will obviously leave behind their ageing parents, who will not usually have anyone else to look after them. In time, the obvious happens: the parents are in need of constant care with the onset of age. These people apply to migrate to Australia, only to be told that they must pay $65,000 per couple for entry. This is unjust. This government cannot have its cake and eat it too. It must acknowledge that it cannot avoid the reality that Australia must `populate or perish'. If it chooses to encourage skilled migration, then it must accept the social costs of that migration. The social costs include the possibility of parent stream migration, that these parents may be a direct financial burden on the Australian taxpayer for the rest of their natural lives and that there will be no return on investment to the Australian government.
We cannot enjoy the benefits of the skilled immigrant on the one hand and deny our moral obligations to that new Australian on the other. If the government was honest with itself, it would seek to deny undue reliance on immigration as a solution to our disastrous and economically unsustainable population decline in Australia; it would provide economic incentives and create a suitable social environment for increasing local population in Australia. Instead, it has chosen this backdoor approach to population increase, whilst avoiding the difficult choices involved in addressing the collapse of local population fertility, which is slightly less than two children per female. 
The injustice presented by the government in this bill is manifest. The bill discriminates against the poor. The bill violates the legitimate expectations of the Australian citizen or permanent resident flowing from their legal rights. The bill abandons those who cannot pay so that they are never permanently reunited with their immediate families. The bill creates a new, elite visa class of those who can afford to enter Australia on economic grounds. I hope this patchy, ill-conceived legislation serves as a salient reminder to the government that it can no longer simply rely on short-sighted legal drafting to overcome economic and social fundamentals. We have seen the government enact over 40 separate acts in respect of the new taxation system. These laws covered every aspect of our financial lives. It seems it was not beyond the government to perform a thorough overhaul of our taxation system. Yet, in respect of the social policy of population trends, we see a government that is too weak and too scared to address the fundamentals of social policy and, in particular, population decline in Australia and economically sustainable domestic population growth.
Instead, this government lives this fool's paradise, thinking it can increase skilled labour whilst pretending that it can abrogate its broader social responsibilities, denying family stream migration by financially taxing and discriminating against it. In doing so, Australia has become the social policy pariah of the developed world. We have become discriminatory in our policies. The origin of this issue is our lack of population growth. The conclusion is that the government seeks to penalise family reunion, thus compounding a sin upon a sin. It is timely to remind ourselves of the sin of Saul, and what will happen if this government fails to address the real issues that lie at the heart of this bill. I urge every member of this parliament to support the amendments proposed by the Hon. Con Sciacca.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,2000-06-26,"—May I just say to the member for Lowe that the only thing that your opposition to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 and your amendments to it will do is to ensure that the Labor Party is not accepted in northern Australia. People in northern Australia do not want the Labor Party's regional treaties. They do not want to pay for people to come into this country. You forget what a family is. A family is the Australian family, and they do not want to have to pay for the Labor Party's mistakes. The member for Lowe is living an urban delusion. Let me talk to you about family. The coalition believes that family is a basic unit of our society, and that is a fundamental belief of the government. This bill reflects that philosophy in a practical, sensible and humane way.
—Who can afford $65,000?
—The taxpayers of Australia—is that what you want? The member for Lowe wants the taxpayers of Australia to pay. He wants 20,000 families reunited in Australia at a cost to the taxpayer.
—One Nation lives!
—The Labor Party lives now by reaching into taxpayers' pockets! Later in my address, I am going to go into the figures of what it will cost the taxpayer for your extravagant spending on this. The opposition has tried to claim that sponsoring families who make a contribution to their parents' ongoing care and welfare is a scheme for the rich. That is untrue. I want to address what the minister, the Hon. Phillip Ruddock, said in response to the member for Bowman. The member for Bowman basically said:
We're opposed to a scheme that would favour people with money.
The minister said:
He is really saying, `We are opposed to those people who have the funds to support their parents using those funds and taking their parents out of the queue for the places that are available on a fully subsidised basis.' 
The member for Lowe has said:
Only those that are well off.
What he really means is that those in Australia who are not well off can pay for all of the immigrants. He talks about profit for the government. What he means is that taxpayers can pay. He talks about relief and profit for the government. What he should be looking at is the burden on taxpayers. He talks about rights as a citizen and why the birth rate in Australia is so low. Let me suggest one thing. Women in Australia work very hard. You and I know that, Madam Deputy Speaker Gash. One of the reasons is that for 13 years the Labor Party put up taxes and fuel excise. No wonder families work so hard. Let me go through the figures about why, under the Labor Party's regime, 20,000 age immigrants will come into this country and cost Australian taxpayers, on average, $280,000 per immigrant. That is what you want to siphon out of the pockets of taxpayers. It is a disgrace—more Labor Party siphoning out of taxpayers' pockets.
Let me talk about the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs who, by the way, is a good minister. It is a hard job, a difficult job, with not a lot of credit. He has to stand up and stand strong for taxpayers. In Northern Australia, where I come from, where illegal immigrants are constantly coming in, this minister is absolutely admired. I want to talk about the comments the minister has made about the opposition. The opposition is saying—in the minister's words—that 20,000 parents should be allowed into Australia on the basis of those costs being met fully. In the context of the charter for budget honesty, the opposition ought to be prepared to go out and argue the case, to put to the Australian taxpayer that their responsibility should be to support those sponsored parents whose families are saying that they have no intention of asking the taxpayer to pay. Don't you love to reach into people's pockets! When I spoke about the concept of family being central to the beliefs and philosophy of this government, I meant a commitment to the total Australian family, the national family, and about them not being asked to shoulder the full burden. It is important that the details of the legislation be understood and that the deceitful misrepresentation of the opposition be exposed.
Let me tell you about the cost of ageing migrants to this country, reaching into taxpayers' pockets—that is what they are doing. Let me give you the figures. The Department of Health and Aged Care estimates that the health costs for a person aged 65 is $6,000 a year while the cost of the special benefit that an aged person can access in lieu of the age pension is $8,500 per person per year. This cannot be recovered from the sponsor once the current two-year assurance of support period is passed. Let me go into what this works out to be. The total health costs of a person over the age of 65 means $120,000 given a remaining life span of 20 years. The total welfare costs in special benefit and age pension payments have the potential to be around $160,000 per person over a remaining life span of 20 years. Thus, the average lifetime costs for an aged person coming into this country would be about $280,000 in today's dollars, but of course the real costs would be much higher.
The opposition believes that the Australian taxpayer should be responsible for this cost, especially when there are responsible migrant families who are not only able but fully prepared to make a contribution to the welfare of their aged parents. In fact, what is being asked of those families in this legislation is quite modest. The proposed new visa classes will be accessible to aged parents and will require undertakings from their sponsor that he or she will pay a social security bond of $10,000 for the principal applicant and $4,000 for each adult dependant. This bond is refundable with interest in 10 years after arrival if no welfare benefits are accessed. It will ensure that the 10-year residency requirement for access to the age pension has real meaning. There is also a not unreasonable requirement that such aged parent immigrants take out private health insurance, as most Australians are being encouraged to do, to cover the first 10 years after arrival or, if there is no such facility available, demonstrably to pay a health services charge of $25,000 a person. That is not an unreasonable request by Australian taxpayers when we are looking at the alternative of $280,000 per person in today's dollars for their care. Let me give you the current figure of the bonds. They are set at $3,500 and $1,500 and operate for only two years, while the designated parent visa class applicants pay a $5,000 charge and other parent visa applicants pay a $960 health levy. 
One of the arguments that the opposition has is that a principle is not in place. Of course there is a principle in place: that of a family contribution to the care and welfare of aged parents. This principle already exists in legislation, so this bill is not groundbreaking legislation. It is not overturning some sacred rule; it is a fair, reasonable and absolutely appropriate readjustment to the contribution required. In any case, the contributions proposed by this legislation are only a fraction of the possible cost. They are not draconian, and it is untrue to say that only the rich could access them.
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, when explaining this in parliament on 15 March, provided some very illuminating data. He stated that very few aged parents currently access special benefits during the first two years after their arrival. Allow me to quote him:
But what it does show is that two years after arrival, and for up to 10 years after arrival, when costs are not recoverable, the special benefits are accessed in lieu of the age pension. At about $8,500 for a single person, based on eight years of use, it represents a total cost per person of $68,000. When you know that after 10 years residency they could also access an age pension, based on a life expectancy of 20 years after arrival it represents another $95,000 in lifetime costs.
The minister made the point that the cost to the Australian taxpayer that the Labor Party wants us to pay for an aged immigrant parent over 20 years is some $280,000 in current costs. The opposition wants to bring in 20,000 aged immigrant parents to be paid for by the taxpayer. With a little simple arithmetic, 20 years brings that to the huge financial burden on Australian taxpayers of $5.6 billion. They are big spenders on the opposition benches, when there are families willing to make that contribution themselves.
I would like to make some general comments on the issue. The government, and particularly Minister Ruddock, has been subjected to some criticisms over the handling of refugees recently that frankly have almost been hysterical. I read in the Australian on 21 June an article by Mr Gary Klintworth, a former member of the Refugee Review Tribunal. This was a very thoughtful and insightful article that should be considered by every member in the House. He made the points that the inhumane people smuggling business—of which we have had evidence recently—is a multimillion-dollar global enterprise and that illegal immigrants protesting their plight in detention centres deserved a fair hearing. He also said:
If the detainees deserve greater understanding, so too does Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock. The publicity thus far has favoured the detainees, as though they were somehow the innocent victims of an inhumane Minister and an unjust Australian refugee policy.
The fact is that 62 per cent of Iraqi and Iranian applicants who applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal in 1998-99 were allowed to stay. This bill before us addresses the family—not just the immigrant family but the whole Australian family. Unlike the Labor Party that tries to pander to immigrants at a cost to decent, hardworking Australians, the government's bill looks to the Australian family. I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—I know I have not got the usual amount of time to speak in the debate this evening on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000, but I cannot start my speech until I answer some of the comments that the member for Dawson raised in her speech. I was astounded to hear the initial comments of the member for Dawson, who is walking out the door now. In those comments, she was discriminating between white Australian born families and those Australian families who are born in countries other than this one which we fortunately live in now. The member for Dawson said that white Australian families should not have to bear the brunt of supporting those Australian families who were not born in this country, and I think that comment is an absolute disgrace. 
The comments of the member for Lowe, which were scathingly attacked by the member for Dawson, were very moral comments. The member for Lowe spoke about families as a whole. He spoke about all Australian families and the need for all Australian families to obtain the support that they deserve from their government and to be united in this country. The member for Lowe did not discriminate between Australian families, and I would encourage all members following that scathing attack from the member for Dawson to go back and read the comments from the member for Lowe so that he is not misrepresented as she tried to do. The member for Dawson also made some comments about the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, saying what a good minister he is. I do not have any quarrels with that statement. In my time here and in my relationship with Minister Ruddock, I have found him to be a basically good and decent person, a man who has been given the hard jobs in a conservative government of furthering the cause of reconciliation and of immigration and multicultural affairs. However, in this case I believe that the minister is wrong. This piece of legislation is ill-planned and misconceived.
While there are currently 20,000 aged parents on waiting lists around the world waiting to come in and be reunited with their families in this country, this bill allows for an intake of only 4,000 over the next two years. And that is only if those people can pay: only if they can pay their fees and levies, substantial social security bonds and health care levies, and pay up to $64,000 per parent couple waiting to come into this country. I will quote from an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald which was published on 7 April this year. The editorial referred to these measures as `hard nosed'. These were the measures requiring people to put up a $10,000 social security bond and also requiring them to take out private health insurance for 10 years or pay a health services charge of $25,000. The editorial goes on to say:
In practice this means the scheme will be open only to people with access to serious money. The scheme seems more rigorous than necessary to protect against welfare benefits claims.
This government has already collected over $21 million from these 20,000 people who are still on waiting lists. Last year Minister Ruddock tried unsuccessfully by regulation to introduce user-pays measures, these visas for the rich. He was defeated in the Senate. I will call on the Democrats in the Senate to continue to exercise some semblance of morality and defeat this particular bill in the Senate. Make no mistake: aged parent couples can jump this queue of 20,000 if they or their family can afford to pay $64,000 plus airfares. As Labor's immigration spokesman, Con Sciacca, said:
It would be very difficult for us to support a measure which, in effect, creates an absolute gold Rolls-Royce class where, if you have got $64,000, you can bring your parents in.
That is why we are opposing this piece of legislation, because it is unjust, unfair and discriminatory. However, we do support schedule 1 proposed in this bill, which, in the main, corrects an anomaly which existed following the introduction of the three-year temporary protection visas—which Labor supported, I might point out to the member for Dawson. Under that visa category at that time, the minister decided that the refugees were not entitled to access Medicare assistance for the majority of that three-year period. The minister was forced into this current position, which provides that holders of temporary protection visas are entitled to Medicare without needing to apply for a further visa, once it was pointed out to the government that, being a signatory to the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees, we as a nation have a responsibility and an obligation to provide appropriate services to those assessed as being in need of protection. Labor supports this schedule because it is fair and just. However, as I have stated before, we do not support schedule 2 and schedule 3 because they are unfair and unjust. There is currently a cost associated, as Minister Ruddock emphasised in his second reading speech. He said:
Whilst the entry of parents assists in providing support to their Australian sponsors, research shows that people who migrate to Australia late in life make a minimal contribution to revenue but incur a very substantial cost in terms of social security and health. 
I must say this statement was reiterated—and basically screeched across this chamber—by the member for Dawson. These statements from government members and these equations do not include the human factor; they do not include the humanity factor. When debating how much it is going to cost for Australian families to be reunited with their parents, the minister and government members speak in terms of `contribution to revenue' and `substantial costs'. I was listening to the member for Dawson's contribution to this debate. It was not until her last two or three sentences that the member for Dawson actually mentioned the word `families'. Not once in her tirade of attack against the member for Lowe and the Labor Party in general did she speak of families.
As I said, we understand that there is a cost associated with this. Labor introduced a cost structure of around $8,000 for families to be reunited with their parents who were living overseas. We support mutual obligation. That is why we introduced the original cost structure. But we also understand the commitment of families to support their older members. The cost comparison that has been made by the minister and government members denies part of the actual circumstances which would occur. We know currently that if an aged pension couple are living together they receive less pension than two single pensioners living apart. That situation goes for a range of government services. Even in our private lives, we find that, living together as a couple or with two or three people sharing a house, the costs are much cheaper. With these families who have given a commitment to support and to sponsor their aged parents—so they can come out here and live their final days with their children and their grandchildren to provide some kind of semblance of a family structure—the costs would not go anywhere near those cited by the minister and government members, because these families have a commitment to their family structure and they have a commitment to support their parents when they come out here. In his second reading speech the minister referred to costs and equations without considering the humanity factor. He said:
... on average the total health costs for persons over 65 years of age are around $6,000 per year. For a person with a remaining lifespan of 20 years, the total may be around $120,000. The total welfare costs in special benefit and age pension payment could be as large as $160,000 per person over the same period.
As I just stated, the costs of family care versus the cost of state care are two completely different areas. If anybody would study a lot more closely the particular bottom line equations that the government has used, they would find that the costs of the care of these parents who are migrating here to spend the rest of their time with their families would be much lower.
The other issue that has been raised is the issue of skilled migrants in relation to the migration to Australia of aged parents. We in the Labor Party support a ratio of roughly 50 per cent skilled migration and 50 per cent family reunion. We think that is about right. We have said that we would establish an Office of Population and we would actually engage demographers to determine Australia's optimal population level. It cannot be done on an ad hoc basis, as the minister is trying to do with this piece of legislation. When we compare the skilled migrant intake to the aged parent intake, we are expecting migrants to come here with their skills to contribute to the Australian economy, which many of them do and have done over the past century. We take their taxes, we take their productivity and we take their hard work. We take their hours away from their family as well. They contribute. Yet, when it comes the time that they want to bring their parents here to spend the rest of their days with them, we say, `You have given us everything you possibly can. You have given us your work commitments, you have given us your time, you have paid your taxes, yet we are going to charge you $65,000 to bring your parents out here so that they can form your final family structure in the last years of their lives.' That is unfair and that is discriminatory. 
We are a multicultural society. Migrants from all over the world have made Australia their home. We are constantly emphasising that Australia was built on the backs of migrants. We had the first European settlers and the importation of the convicts. You can drive around the back roads of New South Wales and probably most other states across the country—you would know these roads from your area, Madam Deputy Speaker Gash—and see roads built by the convicts when they were first brought out here. In the early 20th century we had a wave of migrants from Europe and the United Kingdom to help build infrastructure. We have just recently had the 50th anniversary of the completion of the Snowy Mountains scheme. There were large numbers of Greek and Italian migrants who came to call Australia home and contributed to the rich fabric of our society today. I have a Macedonian friend whose mum and dad came to Australia. His dad stepped off the boat one day and landed a job at BHP as a steelworker the next day, and he worked there until the day he retired. Then we saw a wave of migration from Asian nations bringing further expansion in the tourism industry as well as specific skills related to information technology. These Australians have a right to ask the government, `If we were relied on so heavily, why can't we expect to bring our family members here so that we can see ourselves as a total family structure and our aged parents can live out their lives with their children and grandchildren?' 
There has been a lot of talk about the budget implications of this. Government members talk about the financial implications and the cost to revenue, without considering the family or the humanity factor. It has been said that there is a positive budget implication of these measures of between $127 million and $155 million over four years. A piece of legislation like this will cause so much angst and heartache for a large part of our community, I do not think it is very fair for this government to be raising these amounts of money. We are talking about $155 million over four years compared with $430 million this government has spent advertising its propaganda on the GST. These families have a right to feel hard done by. In conclusion, I support Labor's amendments. I call on the Democrats to exercise some morality in the Senate and to reject this piece of legislation, which is ill-conceived, ill-planned, discriminatory and just plain unfair.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2000-06-26,"—From the outset, I wish to indicate my absolute support for the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 and the benefits it will create for the people of my electorate. My electorate of Riverina is very multicultural, with the city of Griffith alone having 140 nationalities represented. It is for this reason that I have become deeply involved in immigration issues and constantly seek ways to assist the Riverina's multicultural community. At the recent National Party federal convention, I coordinated a workshop which covered a range of issues relating to the developing nature of our population and issues from immigration to natural increases and attracting people to regional Australia. The current situation is that our population is increasing by 1.2 per cent per year, or about 250,000 people. On current population trends, it is to peak at around 23 million in 2051. Sixty-two per cent of our population live in cities with more than 100,000 people, and 83 per cent of our population live within 50 kilometres of the coast. The fertility rate, that is, the number of births per woman, needed to replace the population is 2.1. Australia's current fertility rate is at 1.7.
The issues we discussed in depth at that conference included the consequences of having a higher or lower population level than the projected 23 million people by 2051. This was discussed, and we came to the conclusion that the population should be higher than this. The advantages this would bring to Australia included increased domestic markets, economic growth and stability, cultural diversity and an increase of the skills base. There were some areas of concern in increasing our population, such as resource and water issues, general environmental degradation issues, local social problems and problems of unemployment. These areas would have to be addressed to facilitate increasing the population. The tools to increase the population are natural increase and immigration.
Promoting natural increase was seen as a priority. To do this we should promote parenthood and place a very high value on it, promoting family values and the advantages of staying as a unit. There is also the need to support parents in offering parents a choice to stay at home working with their children in comparison to working for a boss and the need to be proactive in encouraging workplaces to adopt family friendly practices, including child-care facilities and flexible working hours for both mothers and fathers in the role of parenthood. 
Immigration issues were discussed in depth. The benefit from the skills of migrants is valuable to Australians and I support a controlled increase in immigration numbers. Attracting people to regional Australia was also identified as a priority. I support the promotion of policies that encourage economic development outside core regions rather than just population resettlement. It was recommended that a platform be developed in a number of areas including the promotion of policies to naturally increase the population, support for responsible increased overseas adoption, support for the controlled increase of immigration and support for a population summit to get the experts and community together to discuss this important issue. There is an urgent need to ensure that the infrastructure is available in rural and regional areas to enable all of our immigrants to experience a quality of life when they resettle. This infrastructure should include the easy access to English speaking classes. 
Through initiation of some of the proposed reforms identified at our convention and with the benefits of this bill, the future looks encouraging. This bill allows for places to be made available to people who cannot afford to pay up-front to sponsor their parents to join them in Australia, but it also makes other options available for those who can afford to pay bonds. The member for Charlton constantly spoke about the minister's concern about the cost of immigration and of everyone else's concern about the cost of immigration. Of course the minister takes costs into consideration. This is exactly why we had a $10 billion deficit in 1996—because nobody took costs into consideration. This attitude obviously has not changed. You do not go and do your weekly grocery shopping without the thought of cost. You do not buy the most expensive motor vehicle without the thought of cost. You do not buy the most expensive house without the thought of cost and how you are going to pay for it. It does nobody any favours to not consider the cost of immigration, because if you have not considered the cost you are not providing a valuable resource and a valuable form of life and quality of life for our immigrants that come into Australia. It is only responsible of the minister and the government to constantly consider costs. There is an urgent need to ensure that infrastructure is available in rural and regional areas to enable all of our immigrants to experience a quality of life when they resettle. That is a cost. This infrastructure should include the easy access to English speaking classes, as I suggested. That is a cost.
I believe parents should be able to be reunited with family members and if these families are able to bear the cost then it will free up more places for those immigrants who are unable to afford payments. Believe me, there are many families who are only too happy to bear costs outlined within this legislation. I maintain a second electorate office in Griffith and much of the time spent in this office involves immigration issues. One of the more common issues brought to my attention is for people wishing to reunite their families by sponsoring their families to join them. There is currently a very long line of people waiting to bring their parents into this country. This was highlighted in no uncertain fashion in recent meetings held with constituents. One constituent had both parents die overseas while they were on the waiting list to gain access to Australia. This family would have dearly loved to have had this legislation available to them in order to have their parents live out their last days with members of the family that they had not seen for many years. Another constituent interview indicated that both parents had been on the waiting list but one had since passed away, leaving their partner alone overseas, separated from his sons all of whom are living in Australia. These sons gladly bore the cost to have their parent reunited with them and, again, freed up space to move up in the waiting line for another family that could ill afford the cost. 
This bill and the closely associated Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2000 seek to implement the government's recent announcements on visa arrangements for parents wishing to migrate to Australia. We currently have a situation whereby some 20,000 parents are waiting to migrate to Australia. If they were all allowed to migrate under current arrangements, as mentioned by the member for Charlton, the cost to the Australian taxpayer would be enormous. Whilst the entry of parents assists in providing support to their Australian sponsors, research shows that people who migrate to Australia late in life make a minimal contribution to revenue but incur a very substantial cost in terms of social security and health. Many people who wish to bring their parents to Australia have expressed their willingness to meet all of these costs associated with the migration of their parents in order to reunite their families.
In response to the preparedness of sponsors to contribute to the costs of aged parents migrating to Australia, the immigration minister announced on 3 April 2000 that the government would introduce new entry arrangements for parents in the 2000-01 program year. These welcome new arrangements will provide for a significant increase in the number of parents who will be able to come to Australia to be reunited with their families. This initiative is very positive and by allowing an increased ability for families to be reunited it will be warmly welcomed by multicultural communities across Australia. Initial concern with this bill was that it only allowed the rich to be able to access visas into Australia. For this reason, the Senate voted to disallow the previous entry arrangements for parents. This devastated many of my people in my electorate who had made applications in good faith and were willing to bear the substantial cost to have their families reunited, because they could afford to. They do not want handouts from the Australian government. They are proud people. They are proud to have their family and proud to have their origins. They are wanting to bring their family members into Australia to give them a better quality of life.
I support the government in its view that the aim was not to create a visa class for the rich. The government wanted to allow more parents to live in Australia in a way that ensured a fair deal for the Australian taxpayer. The Australian taxpayers are the families of these immigrants—and, believe me, many of our migrant families support the creation of this category. As a result of the disallowance and of the negative budgetary impact of parent migration, the government was able to accommodate only 500 parents in the migration program intake for the year 1999-2000. The designated parent visa category was introduced in November 1999 and was specifically designed to assist those parents who were adversely affected by the Senate's disallowance of the previous parent entry arrangements. The designated parent visa classes incorporate key elements of the previously disallowed parent entry arrangements, including the payment of a $5,000 health charge for each parent.
The level of interest in the designated parent visa category has been demonstrated by an almost full acceptance of the invitation to lodge an application under this category. Around 1,100 designated parent visas have been granted since November 1999, with the remaining 1,100 to be granted in the 2000-01 program year. Some of those people in my electorate happily accessed that great invitation. The introduction of the designated parent visa category was accompanied by an announcement of a more flexible visitor visa arrangement for parents with an ongoing migration application. This was in recognition of the extended processing times faced by parents and has resulted in a greater number of parents being able to visit their children in Australia.
The value of uniting the family cannot be underestimated. Health and welfare costs for aged parents suggest that the previously disallowed arrangements may not have been suitable for the Australian taxpayer. On average, the total health cost for persons over 65 years is around $6,000 per year. For a person with a remaining life span of 20 years, the total cost may be around $120,000. The total welfare cost in special benefit and age pension payments could be as high as $160,000 per person over the same period. Faced with these potential lifetime costs totalling $280,000, the new arrangements introduced by this bill involve a very reasonable contribution by applicants and sponsors, particularly for the cost of health services. 
The most important features of the new visa classes are an extended assurance of support period of 10 years instead of the current two years; an increased bond payable in respect of an assurance of support—the amount will go up from $3,500 for the main applicant and $1,500 for other adults, to $10,000 and $4,000 respectively—and a choice for applicants to either obtain suitable private health insurance for the first 10 years in Australia should such a product be available or pay an up-front health services charge of $25,000 per person. It is important that we recognise that those who can afford to sponsor their parents are able to do so and that those in a weaker financial position are also able to get their parents hastened along the list. This is all about equity. The extended assurance of support period is consistent with the longstanding 10-year residency bar for access to the age pension. The increased bond is refundable with interest after 10 years—so it is not something that a family loses for all eternity—less any welfare benefits that may have been accessed during that time. 
The health services charge of $25,000 per person represents only about one-fifth of the potential health costs. While the current parent visa class will be closed to new applicants upon implementation of the new visa category for aged parents, those in the pipeline currently will continue to be processed within current capped levels. Given the greater financial commitment of applicants and the consequent lower budgetary impact, it should be possible to increase parent visa places over the next two program years without placing an unsustainable burden on the Australian community as a whole. My electorate, and I am sure a great many others with a significant multicultural flavour, will welcome this with open arms.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—Because of the inherent injustice contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000, I am happy to support the amendment to the motion for the second reading as moved by the shadow minister for immigration. The aim of the amendment is to ensure that an increase in the quota for parent visas does not automatically exclude people on the basis of economic position. This bill as it stands is indicative of the mean-spirited nature of this government. It encapsulates the `us and them' mentality that pervades all this government's policy. As in the government's health and education policy, this bill moves immigration towards a two-tiered system, between the haves with economic means and the have-nots. 
It is interesting to note too that, while the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has been quick to condemn onshore asylum seekers as queuejumpers, he is happy to institutionalise a form of queue jumping based upon economic means. The minister for immigration, while hiding behind the principle of user pays, has made migrating to Australia far more expensive—so much so that it is a burden that would-be migrants from poorer backgrounds cannot bear. Furthermore, while publicly welcoming skilled migrants regardless of their cultural background, the minister has made English language proficiency a prerequisite. People from countries where English is rarely taught in schools are automatically excluded from the process. If passed, this bill will entrench in our immigration policy a principle that, if you are wealthy, you are welcome, and, if not, you are welcome to apply but do not expect to have your application processed. The result of such discriminatory legislation is that people from wealthier, often predominantly white, countries will be able to access our immigration program more readily than people from poorer, often non-white, countries. This is a disgrace. It shows this government's hidden agenda to limit the diversity of the people migrating to Australia.
This is the government's second attempt to entrench discrimination into the preferential family program. Some 18 months ago, the minister sought to introduce a new parent visa category that gave applicants an opportunity to jump the already lengthy queue. In March 1999, Labor moved to disallow these changes on equity grounds. It was unfair that some applicants would be given preferential treatment simply because they were wealthier. The minister's anger at the time was palpable. In retaliation, he slashed the already reduced parent visa intake to just 500 a year. At this level, given the queue was 20,000, it would have taken people up to 40 years before their parents could join them in Australia—a ludicrous situation. Applicants will either die of old age in the queue or, by the time there is a place for them, they will be too frail to meet the rigorous medical requirements. 
The government was only too happy to accept some $10 million in application fees, but it is not prepared to process the applications, let alone issue a reasonable number of visas. This government talks big about accountability. But where is the accountability here—10 million hard-earned dollars and nothing to show for them? Even if the government increased the existing quota 10 times over, there are still people waiting in the queue that will never get here because, with every year that passes, their age is against them when it comes to meeting the health criteria.
Therefore, as a matter of decency, I call on the government to allow existing applicants the choice of whether they want to stay in line or whether they want a refund of the application fee which has been gained on the basis of fraud. If you are told that your parents are eligible to apply for a parent visa and the department of immigration happily takes your $1,075 application fee, it is reasonable to expect that the department will actually follow through and process the application. The reality is, however, that in the majority of cases a departmental officer would have barely looked at the application. So what does the minister do to address this? Does he offer to refund application fees? No. Does he increase the allocation of parent visa subclass 103? No. Instead, he tries once more to introduce a new discriminatory visa that automatically excludes those who have few financial resources at their disposal.
On the whole, the families in my electorate who have parents waiting to migrate to Australia cannot afford to pay such a huge sum of money to bring out their parents. However, they will do everything in their power to get the money together to pay the increased visa costs. What this government has never understood has been the vital importance of parents and elderly relatives to most migrant families. The Liberal Party pretended to understand this basic issue before the 1996 election when it promised, and I quote:
Family reunion and refugee/humanitarian immigration will remain central parts of the immigration program. The family unit is the foundation of our society and must be at the core of immigration policy.
It has abandoned that policy. Clearly, the Howard government has no understanding of the importance of family reunion to migrant families. Labor, on the other hand, recognises the cultural importance that many migrant communities place on caring for their elders. We also acknowledge that a united family is an economically productive family. They play an important role in the diverse fabric of our society and they should not be treated like parasites whose only aim is to drain the health system dry. It is a nonsense. My office deals with a large volume of immigration related inquiries, most of them relating to the family reunion program. My electorate is full of families who are heartbroken as they realise that the chances of being reunited with their parents get slimmer and slimmer by the day—families who originally migrated from China, Vietnam, Lebanon, Greece, Russia, Poland, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Thailand and the Philippines; families for whom $64,000 is an unbelievable sum of money.
The $25,000 figure the government has come up with as the new health service charge is also of great concern to the opposition, because there has been no basis for this figure. This really is policy on the run. The program is less accessible to people from non-English-speaking backgrounds and from poorer countries. But the minister's actions have not taken place in a vacuum. They should be placed in the context of a Prime Minister who has difficulty even saying the word `multiculturalism'. It ranks close to `sorry' in his top 10 of taboo words. This is a government that is not short on glossy brochures promoting multiculturalism and tolerance but, when it comes to actual commitment, the story is quite different. The people of my electorate have come to know this the hard way, through years of waiting for their parents to arrive. It is a bit like waiting for Godot. The characters in Beckett's play want to believe Godot will eventually arrive but, as the curtain closes, they are still waiting. 
Motion (by Miss Jackie Kelly) put:
That the question be now put.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2000-06-26,"—These government amendments are to update some youth allowance, Austudy and disability support pension rates contained in the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999. The rates were correct at the time the bill was introduced on 11 February 1999 but have become out of date during the delayed passage of the bill. The rates in the bill were current on 1 January 1999; however, an indexation increase was due on 1 January 2000. Furthermore, an increase to compensation for the introduction of the goods and services tax is due on 1 July 2000.
These amendments provide two alternative sets of rates in each case. Which set commences will depend on whether royal assent is given to the bill before or after 1 July 2000. The outcome in either case will be to bring the rates up to date. These amendments are technical in nature and are non-controversial. I table the further amendments for the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—Labor has no difficulty with the amendments that have come back to the House tonight. They provide for the fact that this bill has been delayed for some time. The government must take some responsibility for this delay. As with most of the bills that come along, mildly beneficial measures are mingled with the usual line-up of mean-spirited cuts. These amendments make necessary technical changes to the basic rates of rent assistance. That is all. These amendments do nothing to actually alleviate the unfair `family pays' principle of the government's youth allowance scheme. They do nothing to ease the fact that when the Youth Allowance Scheme was first introduced 12,800 young people lost all their benefits and 33,250 young people had their benefits reduced. 
These amendments do nothing to compensate Australian families for the $5 billion worth of cuts to social services in this country and the $4.2 billion cut from education and training programs. These amendments in no way compensate for the abolition of the CES, the gutting of the Public Service, the closure of Medicare offices all around the country, the attacks made by this government on aged care and child care, and the billions of dollars lost to our health care system. These amendments may give a little, but since 1996 the government has taken away much more. When this bill was being debated in the Senate, Labor and the Democrats took the opportunity to move amendments to address some of the most pressing issues surrounding the operation of youth allowance. We have also ensured that students who, through no fault of their own, must study for less than 75 per cent of a full-time load are not disadvantaged as a result.  
We also sought to make the government accountable for its 1996 election promise to lift the farm discount on assets to 75 per cent. However, the government, having argued against its own promise, now intends to gain the credit for announcing the same measure in its recent budget. Having been forced to be accountable, the government is now cynically trying to claim it was all its idea. We have seen many broken promises from this government. The most recent examples have torn at the heart of the coalition and forced the Minister for Community Services to at last show his true colours. Before the last election, the government promised not to impose the GST on rents. The government promised rents would rise by only 2.3 per cent. Now the line has changed. Australians living in boarding houses and residential parks will be paying the GST on their rent. Private rents will rise by at least 4.7 per cent, according to the Econtech report—probably more—and these breaches of promise will have a direct and negative impact on some youth allowance recipients and on those most vulnerable in our community. 
This government's modus operandi is to make poorly conceived, hasty policy and then spend a considerable amount of time trying to patch up its mistakes. Its grand new tax system is fraying at the edges. Instead of fixing the core problems that lie at the heart of this unfair tax, the government chooses to create elaborate compensation schemes that do nothing to address the source of the inequity—government decisions. It just hopes that people will not notice that the $33 million increase in rent assistance is a one-off payment, paid to those who receive the maximum rate of rent assistance. This payment is a one-off, whereas the GST will last forever. The government hopes that young people—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. We are here to discuss youth allowance and the member has talked about everything other than youth allowance.
 (Mr Nehl)—Before calling the honourable member for Grayndler, I do encourage him to speak about the youth allowance.
—I will, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the government does not want to discuss any issues relating to the financial impact of its decisions, whether they be on young people or people in other sectors. As I was saying, the government hopes that young people will be so thrilled by the minor increases to their rent assistance contained in this bill that they will forget that, in this year's budget, the government spent six times more money on advertising for the GST than it spent on new funding for the nation's schools.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are talking on the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999. The member for Grayndler gets carried away at times, but I encourage you to bring him back onto the bill.
—I thank the minister. I do not need his encouragement. The honourable member for Grayndler has the call and will, of course, speak to the subject of the debate.
—Many thousands of Youth Allowance recipients do not receive the maximum rate of rent assistance and will get nothing from this deal. They should be sceptical of any claim by this government that they are being given more. It is not surprising that the government runs and hides from debate. The minister, even tonight, has spoken on this issue for only one or two minutes and has attempted once again to stifle the opposition from putting forward our position on this issue. (Time expired)

That the further requested amendments be made.",REPS,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—It is a rare event and a rare pleasure to speak in this House on government legislation relating to our defence forces. Over the past two years, the only defence legislative effort that we have debated has been a series of private member's bills introduced by the opposition relating to employment protection and defence leave as an allowable matter, both of which obviously concern the reserves. That said, the Defence Legislation Amendment (Flexible Career Practices) Bill 2000 proposes three separate changes to the personnel provisions of current legislation governing Army and Navy personnel. The government has indicated that parallel changes impacting on the RAAF will be made through changes to the relevant Air Force regulations. The bill is described as helping to achieve more flexible career practices in the Defence Force. In his second reading speech the Minister for Veterans' Affairs indicated that this move had its origins in the 1995 strategic review of defence personnel policy, better known as the Glenn report.
The former Labor government commissioned that report. It arose out of the 1994 defence white paper that emphasised the ongoing challenge to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in the face of demographic, social, technological, industrial, legal and cultural changes. The review had extensive terms of reference, which could be summarised as being principally to examine and to report on the adequacy, applicability and implementation across the three services of the ADF's then personnel policies and to identify the key principles which should form the basis of the ADF's future personnel policy strategy. On page 55 of that report, it is stated:
Those principles would be to achieve a versatile and flexible fighting force, attract and retain the right people and lead and manage people for organisational change.
The resulting report is officially entitled Serving Australia: the Australian Defence Force in the 21st Century. It contains a host of findings and recommendations to do with employment and work practices, industrial relations, reward, recognition and entitlements, and support for members and their families. I would note on that front a very significant broad series of suggestions to essentially help to understand the relationship of retention and the degree of happiness and interest of families. The reserves were also covered: skilled deployment and the need to adopt a new management style. While aspects of the environment in which the Defence Force operates have since changed, these fundamental issues remain relevant to the development of a comprehensive personnel recruitment and retention strategy that is essential if the Defence Force is to be able to fulfil the requirements set for it by the government.
Since 1996, the coalition has found itself unable to properly come to terms with these issues. Under the previous minister we were simply assured that greater efficiencies, massive outsourcing and job cuts would automatically, ipso facto, solve all the problems of the portfolio. We now know, of course, that many of the coalition's so-called cures have actually left the patient in a worse state, as evidenced by the disastrous state of the reserves, the parlous position acknowledged by the Secretary to the Department, Dr Hawke, and a series of damning reports by the Auditor-General. The opposition will be closely examining the government's discussion paper on the future of the Defence Force, being released tomorrow, to see whether it is finally beginning to face up to these fundamental issues. 
I turn now to the specific provisions of the bill. In doing so, I indicate that two of the three measures in the bill are quite straightforward and do not cause any problems for the opposition or for the various interest groups that we have consulted. It has been necessary for us to seek clarification from the government on the remaining measure, and we do have some reservations about it that I will mention later. The first aspect of the bill seeks to extend the reach of the limited tenure promotion scheme. This scheme was introduced by the former Labor government to give the ADF greater flexibility in managing its senior officer work force. Under rules that took effect from June 1995, service chiefs can promote such officers to a specific appointment for a set period. At present this applies to the level of colonel and above in the Army and to the equivalent ranks in the Navy and the Air Force. The bill seeks to extend this provision to the next lower officer rank in each service—to lieutenant-colonels in the Army, to commanders in the Navy and, by regulation, to wing commanders in the Air Force. The Glenn report actually proposed a more radical recommendation that limited tenure promotions be extended to a much wider category of personnel, not just to middle ranking and senior officers, to give more flexibility to defence management. That was their suggestion. On the other hand, that report indicated that such an expanded provision should be used only very sparingly. 
The cautious approach that the government has taken to the issue in this bill is, I believe, appropriate. The current arrangement, where such a mechanism is only applicable to senior officer positions, does not appear to have generated many problems. As identified in the Glenn report, there are of course situations where it is sensible for Defence to use a person's skills and experience for a set time to carry out a specific task on fixed term promotion, recognising that they would not otherwise have received a permanent promotion. The person concerned understands that at the end of such a posting they will either return to their previous rank or they will retire from the service. Extending the concept of limited tenure too widely, or using the provision too frequently, could cause problems. For this reason, I am comfortable with the approach taken in the bill.
The next aspect of the bill that I want to refer to is the two amendments—one for the Army, the other for the Navy—enabling a serving member to convert an open-ended enlistment or appointment to a fixed term one. Currently, personnel who complete an initial period of enlistment, or appointment in the case of officers, can volunteer to serve further, either on an open-ended basis, theoretically until retirement, or for a fixed term. I note in passing that an open-ended enlistment is often only theoretically until retirement, as the context of such service has been changing because of other government policy changes. The most obvious changes have been the coalition's individual readiness requirements regarding fitness and proficiency and its staff cuts due to massive outsourcing of various support and logistic functions. These mean that `open-ended' enlistments decreasingly end up being `permanent' in actual practice, as the number of redundancies and discharges has grown enormously. There has been speculation in the last day or so about further decreases with regard to the number of people in the armed forces. 
While the current legislation allows serving personnel to later seek to convert a fixed term enlistment or appointment into a permanent one, the reverse is not the case. This means there is no provision for them to seek to convert an open-ended enlistment or appointment into a fixed term one. This is an anomaly that the bill seeks to rectify. I note that the Glenn report actually recommended that all defence personnel be engaged on a fixed term of employment—FTE—basis, accompanied by completion incentives and resettlement assistance. That report argued that the ADF should move away from offering lifetime careers and from managing wastage through recruitment. It argued that the ADF should have full discretion about whether to offer personnel further periods of employment. It saw this as the only way that separations, either too many or too few, could be dealt with. In mentioning this argument I make it clear that Labor reject the model of across-the-board fixed term employment. We see the model as being too loaded in favour of the employer. We believe the Defence Force can and should offer long-term careers to as many personnel as possible. While recognising that the prevalence of lifelong service has been declining and will probably continue to do so, our vision of the Defence Force involves its offering more than just fixed term or temporary jobs. That reality is obviously going to undermine the whole morale of the force. We do not see flexible career practices as just giving all choices to the employer and removing the rights of serving personnel. The bill adopts the cautious approach of enabling serving personnel to convert their permanent enlistment or appointment into a fixed term one where they volunteer to do so—and I stress that point. It is on this basis that we support the change proposed by the government. 
The final aspect of the bill clarifies the circumstances in which a service chief can, without reference to the Governor-General, reject the resignation of an officer. The Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act currently set out narrowly defined grounds on which an officer's resignation can be rejected. These grounds include the existence of a war or defence emergency, the possibility that the resignation would seriously prejudice Defence's ability to carry out military operations, that the resignation occurred within 12 months of an officer's promotion to the position of colonel or above or the Navy equivalent, where an officer in the reserves seeks to resign during a period in which they are required to provide continuous full-time service under the call-out provisions or, finally, that the officer had not completed his or her required minimum period of service after undertaking training, a period of special duties or employment outside Australia or after being transferred to Australia. This requirement is known as the return of service obligation or ROSO. 
It is to do with the last mentioned circumstance—regarding a so-called minimum period of initial service by an officer—that this bill seeks to make a change in the legislation. It has taken some effort on the part of the opposition to establish the true import of the change. The explanatory memorandum circulated by the minister when he introduced the bill on 7 June was of little help. It essentially avoided the issue—the reality of what the government is trying to do. After partly summarising the current legislative situation, that memorandum indicated that:
In order to require officers to serve for an initial period of service ... The provisions provide that the officer's initial period of service will be determined by instrument in writing by the relevant Service Chief.
It also noted that this section of the bill would apply only to officers who were appointed after the amending act commences. All this begged the questions as to what the proposed initial period of service for an officer would be, how this relates to their existing return of service obligation and whether the new requirements would be the same for all officers. The best I could establish, after quite a number of phone calls, was that the real purpose of the amendment appears to be to resolve doubts about the enforceability of a change that Defence actually made in 1998—two years ago. The ROSO system was put in place to ensure that Defence gets an adequate return for the extensive and expensive training that it provides to serving members. It operates on the basis that personnel have to serve one year for each year of defence training plus one year. Thus an officer cadet who completes four years of training—three years at ADFA plus a year of military training—is in turn required to serve for a further five years, or nine years in total. During the period, a service chief can refuse such an officer's resignation or, at the ADF's discretion, accept financial payment in lieu thereof or waive the obligation. These arrangements are legally enforceable.
Concurrent with but separate from the ROSO period is a new concept of fixed periods of service that Defence introduced on 1 July 1998. All new entrants from that date have been required to enlist for a fixed period that has varied from situation to situation. For officer cadets, their fixed period of service is generally nine years, as with their ROSO. Doctors, dentists and chaplains can be appointed with a more lenient fixed term of service. While these requirements are detailed in a Defence instruction, they appear not to be legally enforceable without legislative backing. It appears it is this that the bill seeks to ensure by, in effect, equating the fixed period of service concept with the proposed initial period of service for officers that each service chief will determine should the bill be carried. I seek the assistance of the minister in clarifying at last—finally, after many attempts to get the clarification—what the expected initial period of service for officers will be. I note that the minister's office kindly provided me with a written answer on this matter earlier today. I believe it would be appropriate for this answer to be shared with the parliament. I do so because, in the absence of such details, the Senate may well decide that any determinations by service chiefs should become disallowable instruments. I also seek the minister's assurance that serving personnel have been advised of the proposal and have been consulted about the details. I have received some indications to this effect. I would not like changes to occur that come as a surprise to serving personnel or that cause any difficulty with future recruitment and retention. 
In his second reading speech, the minister indicated that the bill removed what he described as `legislative encumbrances' to some personnel policy changes that have already been made. To that extent, the bill is less than revolutionary: it is a case of the legislation catching up with current practice in the Defence Force. The opposition does not seek to obstruct passage of the bill. This does not mean we are happy with the coalition's approach to Defence personnel issues—we are not. We have constantly highlighted the state of the reserves and asked: where is the government's call-out legislation or its employment protection measures? It was because of our efforts that the government was forced to announce two separate sets of concessions on the issue of reporting fringe benefits on the group certificates of serving personnel. We have highlighted the government's failure to respond to the major report on the military justice system by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. We have noted the Auditor-General's scathing reports on the redress of grievance system, on the retention of military personnel, on tactical fighter operations and on the Army individual readiness system, amongst other indictments against the government.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2000-06-26,"—It is time to examine the effect of the Howard government's policies on the Australian car manufacturing industry and in particular on Mitsubishi. The thing that has had the greatest bearing on the car industry over the last 12 months has been the introduction of the GST. Like all of the Howard government's other claims about the benefits of the GST, the benefits for both Australian car buyers and Australian car makers have been exaggerated. I do not expect to see the massive increase in demand for new cars that the government promised when it unveiled its GST before the last election.
The government's message was that, with lower personal taxes and a drop in the indirect tax on cars, volumes would increase dramatically, benefiting both buyers and car makers. The reality is something much less than that. First, the drop in indirect taxes is not from 22 per cent down to 10 per cent because the 22 per cent is a wholesale sales tax and the GST is 10 per cent at the retail level. The real difference is from 14 per cent—the rate of wholesale sales tax equivalent to the GST—down to 10 per cent. Second, most buyers trade in their old cars. To the extent that new car prices are reduced, so too will the value of second-hand cars be reduced. The changeover cost will therefore tend to be maintained. Third, John Howard's deal with the Democrats to remove some food items from the GST included some reduction in the tax cuts for higher income earners. That means they do not have as much to spend on new cars as they had been promised. Fourth, while the indirect tax burden on an Australian made car will fall slightly, the indirect tax burden on cheaper imported four-cylinder cars will fall by an equivalent amount, making them even cheaper. It is reasonable to assume that they will continue to erode the Australian car makers' market share.
Fifth, because the government refused to provide an adequate GST transitional arrangement between the passage of the GST legislation and it coming into effect, there was a GST car buyers strike. The government should have reduced the wholesale sales tax to the GST equivalent rate but refused to in order to save wholesale sales tax revenue. The local car makers were left to carry all the financial burden of the buyers strike. The Australian car makers were putting $4,000 and $5,000 worth of free extras into their cars to sustain a modest level of sales and help keep their factories operating. Paradoxically, this has resulted in the period of the GST buyers strike being an excellent time for consumers to buy a new car. Unfortunately, that also means that with the GST coming into effect the only direction for car prices to go will be up. The boost in sales that was expected to follow the introduction of the GST is likely to be less than might otherwise have been anticipated. 
Sixth, the only GST transitional arrangement which the government put in place for cars was one to reduce the incentive for business fleet buyers to defer expenditure until after the GST came in so that they could claim input tax credits. The mechanism they chose was designed to maximise the revenue that would be collected. The availability of input tax credits will be phased over two years. Fleet business buyers will not enjoy the benefit of being able to deduct the full amount of the GST they pay on business vehicles from their GST liability for the goods and services they sell for two years. This transitional arrangement will disrupt and distort sales to the fleet market for a further two years. Given that 70 to 80 per cent of Australian made cars are sold to fleet buyers, that will continue to be a serious issue. The government should scrap the phasing arrangement for input credits, but they are short of revenue and will not. Our local car manufacturers will have to carry the combined burden of restricted access to input credits and lower residual values for vehicles, making investment in a vehicle fleet much less attractive. Those are the six factors which bear on the state of the car industry as a result of the GST.
A recent indicator of the Howard government's lack of interest in the local car manufacturing industry was its decision to put three imported four-cylinder sports cars on the list of eligible vehicles to be available to senior public servants as part of their remuneration package. The cars were the Toyota MR2, the Nissan 200SX and the Toyota Celica. Previously, cars leased under the scheme had all come off an Australian production line, except where there were compelling reasons such as the need for business purposes to have a four-wheel drive, a people-mover or a small four-cylinder sedan. This change would have resulted in serious inroads being made into the number of Australian made cars being acquired under the scheme. I ensured this decision was given the sort of adverse publicity it deserved and, as a result, the government quietly amended the list of eligible vehicles, omitting the offending sports cars.
We discovered a couple of weeks later that the reason this reversal was executed so quietly was that the government had also taken a decision to allow more junior public servants to lease any imported car of their choosing under salary sacrifice arrangements utilising FBT motor vehicle concessions. To date there has been no reversal of this policy. The industry minister, Senator Minchin, has in fact defended it, saying that allowing public servants to choose a taxpayer subsidised imported car is a human rights issue. Frankly, I am more concerned about the livelihoods of Australian car workers and their families. This government has shown a callous disregard not only for the welfare of car workers and their families but also for the fate of the Australian car industry. The government chose early to deny there was a GST car buyers strike. The loss of volume and the need to discount stock to move it were detrimental to profitability.
