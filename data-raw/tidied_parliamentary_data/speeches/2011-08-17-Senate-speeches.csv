Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:31):  I spoke to government amendment (1) yesterday and indicated the coalition's support for it. It is, as I indicated at that time, similar or almost identical to an amendment the coalition was also proposing. This is an amendment strongly advocated by the National Farmers Federation that we have championed and that we are very pleased that the government has agreed to pick up and include. Our support for this amendment is clear and strong.


I equally highlighted yesterday that the government tabled this amendment back when the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills were being debated in the first week of July sittings, so the government's intention to make this amendment has been known for some time. The government, of course, has known that this amendment would pass, because it is the same amendment as the one the opposition was proposing. The govern­ment has known that the numbers were always here for this amendment to pass and therefore has known for quite a few weeks that this addition to clause 56 of the additional part (e), 'land access for agricultural production', as a consideration for the so-called negative list would pass and would become part of this bill.


Given that, I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, noting the draft regulations for the so-called negative list that he tabled in this place yesterday—and he did not have a chance to respond at that time—what steps the government has taken to ensure that this new section for the development of these regulations has been taken into account and how and where such protection of farmland, as proposed by this new part (e), is reflected in the draft regulations the minister has tabled. I would appreciate it if he were able to inform the Senate accordingly.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:34):  Clearly the obvious answer is that once the bill passes it will be able to be used as part of the positive list. The simple answer is that as soon as we can pass the bill—as soon as we can get the Carbon Farming Initiative up and running, out there in the public domain—then people can access the positive list, people can bring forward their methodologies and provide opportunities for sequestered carbon, and an income stream can be given to farmers.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:34):  These regulations, which were tabled yesterday, do set out the terms for the eligible offsets projects, the additionality test and the types of projects. Within that, they provide for what has become known as the negative list. However, the amendment we are considering is to clause 56—to the excluded offsets projects—and will add another term of reference as such for how we might consider what the negative risks or negative impacts of certain kinds of projects would be. As I see it, these draft regulations have been developed looking at the terms of clause 56(2) as it exists in this bill to date, with part (a) being the availability of water, (b) being the conservation of biodiversity, (c) being employment factors and (d) being the impact on the local community. Those four things are, to varying degrees, considered and captured in the draft regulations as to how excluded offsets projects would be taken into account. This part (e), of course, is not in the printed bill, but the government has known for a long period of time now that it would become part of the bill and, should the bill pass into law, become part of the act. So, whilst I understand the minister saying that it becomes a factor, in a sense, for the reverse consideration of eligible projects on the positive list, this of course is a section detailing the excluded projects and the process by which the negative list is constructed. So I again ask the minister: for the purposes of these regulations—which, presumably, your departmental officers have been working on throughout the last five weeks of the recess period; we presume that because we only got to see them yesterday morning—what consideration has been given in their development to this proposed new section (e) around land access for agricultural production? And, if you can point me to it in these draft regulations, how is that reflected in the draft that is before us? Because, frankly, I cannot see that any consideration has been given to date.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:38):  That is the purpose of the draft regulations—they can raise them. I am sure you can have an input into it as well, and maybe use your opportunity here more constructively.


This is about ensuring that we can consult with the community and include their views in the process. It is always open to view it as an additional criterion which will impact on matters listed, so it is an opportunity. We have already had 59 submissions on the discussion paper that strongly supported this position. The provision will be there, if we pass this—and the sooner we can get it passed, the sooner we can provide the landholders out there with an opportunity, and of course they can consult on the draft regulations.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:38):  Aside from the backhanded swipe at me and the process, I think the minister's answer there was: no, it is not reflected in the draft regulations, it is not something we have given any consideration to over the five weeks since we have known that we would be making this amendment to the bill, and so it is just not in here. But that is of course quite typical of the whole process as to how this legislation has been developed. The minister even came in here yesterday and proudly produced his draft regulations and sort of said, 'Okay, there you go: you've being saying you want these, you've being saying that because so much of the operation of this bill hinges on the regulations, we're now going to give you the regulations.' But what we find is that the regulations have not fully considered all that is going to be in the bill, that the regulations are still, in that sense, very much a draft rather than something that has been developed in tandem with the bill, in a manner such that the entire operation of this legislation can be seen in a transparent way.


It is just so typical of the ad hoc manner in which this government chooses to develop all of its policies, frankly, in this area. We have seen the many different policy disasters in the ways in which this government has attempted to go about emissions reductions or carbon abatement activities—many different policy disasters, all of them because things are so poorly thought through, so poorly structured, that the process applied by this government is just so very terrible with regard to all of these areas. And yet here we go again.


The reason that the opposition are subjecting this to close scrutiny, the reason we have called from day one to have all the complementary regulations that sit alongside this legislation in place, is that we do not want to see the same mistakes happen again. We do not want to see these types of errors happen again, because the implications of that with regard to this legislation are very serious. They are very serious to Australia's farm base, our agricultural productive base, and all of these issues should be thoroughly sorted and determined before we get to the point of finalising this legislation.


The government seems to be all too happy to continue to take an ad hoc approach to all of the different bills, policies and pieces of legislation it applies with regard to emissions reduction and carbon abatement. We have seen an ad hoc approach from the govern­ment on its alleged big-picture policy, its on-again off-again support for carbon taxes or an ETS. We have seen the government, as we have extensively debated—and will continue to extensively debate—run away from its crystal clear election commitments on not pricing carbon, on not having a tax on carbon. We have seen the government, when it has attempted to apply other policies, be they in the home insulation sphere, be they in the renewable energy sphere, create all sorts of conse­quences along the way.


If we look at the renewable energy target as a classic example, another major piece of legislation—a piece of legislation that attempts to provide a pathway for Australia to develop a stronger renewable energy sector in this country—what do we have from that at present? We have had a roller-coaster ride for the price of renewable energy certificates. We have a clearing house that is just dysfunctional and not working, because of course the clearing-house price is set way above the price that is in operation in the market for renewable energy certificates at present. As a result, many people who expected that the clearing-house price would be a floor price, not a ceiling price, as it is basically operating, are finding that their investments in this space are under enormous pressure. All of this is, of course, because the government cannot manage to get its sums right to start with, cannot manage to approach these policy areas having done all of the necessary work in advance and made sure that it all stacks up.


So, with this legislation, and the complementary regulations, we have genuine concerns that, if we simply sit back and allow the legislation to pass through as the government intends it to pass through, what are we going to have at the end of that? The risk is that we are going to still have too much of a blank cheque, too much of an open slather that depends on how these regulations are finalised. In this regard we have an amendment, an amendment that enjoys bipartisan support, an amendment that everybody agrees is very serious and an amendment that the minister himself concedes had widespread stakeholder support during their consultation process. It is an amendment that they chose to adopt nearly a couple of months ago and that we have supported all along to ensure that when projects are put on the negative list, so when excluded offsets projects are considered, that one of the adverse impact factors that is considered is whether there is a risk of an adverse impact on land access for agri­cultural production. We all support that but, of course, they are just words in the bill. How that applies under the bill that the government is putting forward depends entirely on the regulations: how they are developed and how they operate. So it is not at all unreasonable to expect, if the govern­ment is going to wander in here and present us with some draft regulations, that surely there should be some consideration in these draft regulations of how this clause operates, otherwise these draft regulations are simply and only a temporary holding pattern measure that will have to be replaced by not a new final version but by a further draft version at some later stage that actually takes this into account. Or is the government proposing to simply put this in the legislation but ignore it in the regulations? Is that what we are looking at here? Is this simply a case of putting an extra five words into the legislation but ignoring it when it comes to the regulations? Do the government think this is actually a tokenistic, meaningless amendment and is that why they have not bothered to consider it in their draft regs?


What is the status of this amendment for the government if they have been supporting it for so long? It is their amendment. They are the ones who have brought it before us. They knew they would enjoy our support all along. If they are serious about having this as a serious amendment to reflect the concerns of the NFF and others, why is it not reflected in any way in the regulations? The minister cannot draw our attention to anywhere where it is reflected, so why can't we manage to see proper, thoroughly drafted regulations that actually take into account this aspect as well? Yesterday I posed some other questions about these regs which the minister took on notice until we return to some amendments that Senator Xenophon has deferred for the time being. But in regard to this one there is a very simple issue of how the government, in its regulations, is going to enact this new clause that would see adverse impact on land access for agricultural production be one of the factors that could see a particular kind of project put on the negative list. How is that going to be reflected in these regulations? Minister, can you tell us what we should expect to see, what the high-jump bar will be and what in fact this clause will actually mean when it is applied to the regs that are so fundamental to the actual operation of this legislation?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (09:48):  I can see that the minister was resisting getting up and answering the very legitimate questions that were put by Senator Birmingham.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I thought you'd jumped up.




Senator CORMANN:
  Well, we were sitting back waiting for you to jump up and you seemed very reluctant to get yourself out of your chair, Minister.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I thought you'd jumped.




Senator CORMANN:
  I rise to endorse Senator Birmingham's comments. Senator Birmingham hit the nail on the head. This is a government that does not think things through. This is a government that has to pursue policy on the run because it does not think things through and it chops and changes, breaks promises and does not know what it is doing. This is a sensible amend­ment, but why is it an amendment? Why did the government not include this provision in the bill right upfront? Senator Birmingham very eloquently made the point that this is not a new issue as this is an issue that was raised by stakeholders all the way through. This government is so blinded by ideology, is so incompetent and is so incapable of actually properly considering the issues that are raised with it legitimately by stake­holders that on occasions it has to mop up. To give the government credit, at least here it is trying to mop up its mistakes and it is trying to sort something out given that clearly there is a major deficiency in the legislation as introduced by the government.


Of course, land access for agricultural production should be one of the criteria that are considered and Senator Birmingham is quite right to be suspicious of this govern­ment given that it is pursuing this policy on the run and so there is no detail in the regulations that have been put forward by the minister. Clearly, it still does not quite know how to deal with this. And this is not an isolated incident. This is not an isolated case. Again and again this government does not think things through, is driven by ideology and is cutting corners and, ultimately, is forced to chop and change and pursue policy on the run when the error of its ways become too obvious. If only the government were prepared to see the error of its ways in relation to the carbon tax, which is part of the broader policy agenda that the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 is part of.


We are here looking at the excluded offsets projects and what criteria should be considered in deciding whether to recommend to the Governor-General that regulations should be made to specify a particular kind of project 'that the minister must have regard to', as I am reading in the bill, and whether there is a significant risk that kind of project will have a significant adverse impact 'on one or more of the following'. One of the criteria to be part of the excluded offsets projects, according to this amendment, will be land access for agricultural production. But there was another process that the government went through in the context of the carbon tax whereby they made decisions on the run to exclude certain things—or so we were told. You might remember that there was a thing called the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Before the last election we were promised that there would be a citizens assembly with 150 people—which we all thought was the House of Representatives! But, no, the Prime Minister had a different view. The Prime Minister thought there was going to be a citizens assembly which was going to build a consensus around the nation on climate change. The Prime Minister was not going to pursue a price on carbon until and unless there was a consensus across the Australian community to put a price on carbon. Chair, I put it to you that this country is more divided than it ever has been. This Prime Minister is a divisive Prime Minister. The way this Prime Minister has pursued this process through this so-called Multi-Party Climate Change Committee has divided our nation. We have got the broken promise, the promise given five days before the last election, that there will be 'no carbon tax under the government I lead'. There was a promise that she would do what she could as the leader of this nation to build a community consensus. Of course, none of this has happened. What we have had though—and I am looking at it now—is a press release put out by one of the members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee on, the federal member for New England, Tony Windsor. I will quote from the press release that he put out on 10 July 2011. He said that fuel would be 'excluded from the carbon tax'. So there is another exclusion. There are a couple of other quotes that I think are quite worthwhile sharing with the chamber, such as:


The decision to exclude fuel from the carbon tax has been welcomed by the Independent member for New England, Tony Windsor. 


Further:


Several months ago I stated publicly that I wouldn't support a carbon tax if it allied applied to transport fuels.


And then: 


A price of $23 per tonne of carbon, if applied to fuel, would equate to a price rise of around 6 cents a litre. 


That is right. It is actually 6.21c a litre. And this is the absolutely critical one:


That's why I decided I wouldn't support a carbon tax if it applied to fuel.


The news flash is: the carbon tax does apply to fuel. And it does not only apply to fuel from 1 July 2014, the carbon tax will also apply to fuel from 1 July 2012. Don't take my word for it. That is the evidence that the Secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency put to the Senate Select Committee on the Scrutiny of New Taxes last Wednesday.


Again, it is worthwhile going through some of the Hansard record in relation to that. I asked the secretary: 


I would like to refer you to the exposure draft of the Fuel Tax Legislation Amendment (Clean Energy) Bill 2011—


which is another one of these bills that relates to the broader action on climate change agenda put forward by this government, in a very bad way in our view—


and specifically clause 43(8). This is a clause to impose a carbon price on fuel through a reduction in the fuel tax credit, correct? 



Mr Comley:  This is on page 5? 



CHAIR:  That is right. 


Then he said he had the bill in front of him, which is good.



CHAIR:  I am looking at the exposure draft, page 5, 43(8), 'working out the amount of carbon reduction'. This clause effectively imposes a carbon price on fuel through a reduction in the fuel tax credit, does it not? 



Mr 
Comley
:  That is correct. 


So the government is actually imposing a price on carbon, what we would call a carbon tax, from 1 July 2012 on fuel. When Mr Windsor in his press release on 10 July said that he has decided he would not support a carbon tax if it applied to fuel, the coalition calls on him to be true to his word, because there will be carbon tax on fuel from 1 July 2012. Who knows? This might be another occasion, as with this amendment that we are discussing now, where the government might make policy on the run and might decide that, yes, it did make a commitment to the member for New England to exclude the carbon tax on fuel. If that is so, then that particular provision is no doubt going to disappear from that legislation as well—the same way the government is adding an amendment here to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011. No doubt there will be an amendment to the carbon tax. I certainly, along with Senator Williams, who is on the scrutiny of new taxes committee, am very keen to see Tony Windsor, the member for New England, call on the government to amend its carbon tax legislation to ensure that all fuel is excluded, because he said he would not vote for it unless all fuel was excluded. So we will see whether that is happening.


Just to conclude the evidence that was quite relevant from Mr Comley, the Secretary of the Department Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I asked him:


Doesn't this mean that recipients of the fuel tax rebate are paying a carbon price from the word go by the wording of your own legislation?



Mr 
Comley:  It certainly means that they are having a reduction in their credit linked to the carbon price, yes.



CHAIR:

 From day 1, as of 1 July 2012 under your exposure draft?



Mr 
Comley:  Yes, that is correct.


So there are no ifs, no buts, no question marks: the government is planning to impose a carbon tax on fuel from 1 July 2012 and on all transport fuels from 1 July 2014. However much anybody wants to wriggle around it and say, 'By then the government will have lost the election and a new Abbott coalition government won't allow that to happen anyway,' the current government has $510 million in their forward estimates, courtesy of revenue to be collected from truckies around Australia.


The government's whole approach to climate change is a farce. It is a complete fraud. They are wanting to make people believe that they can actually do something about reducing global greenhouse gas emissions when they are not even trying. Before the government's most recent modelling came out, I actually thought that they would be able to reduce emissions domestically but I thought they were reducing emissions domestically in a way that would then increase emissions by more in other parts of the world. What has turned out to be the case is that they are not even trying to reduce emissions domestically. This government is not even in a position through their carbon tax, which will push up the cost of everything, which will make Australia less competitive internationally, which will cost jobs, which will hurt small business, to reduce emissions domestically, with emissions, according to the government's own figures, expected to go up from about 578 million tonnes of CO2 in 2009-10 to about 621 million tonnes of CO2 in 2020.


The government then says: 'You can't look at it that way. Emissions are going to go up, sure, but you have got to compare them to the business-as-usual scenario. They're going to be lower than what they would have been.' Okay. So, even though they are going up, you are saying they are going down because they are going to be lower than what they would have been. What about jobs? Jobs are going up but, hang on, jobs are going to be lower than they would have been. So, according to your logic, jobs are going down. If you say emissions are going down because they are lower than they would have been, then, if jobs are going to be lower than they would have been, presumably jobs are going down. But no, jobs are going up. So why are jobs going up? Because if you compare where we are today to where we are going to be in 2020, there are going to be more jobs in 2020 than there are in 2011. Sure, the population will continue to grow so it will be very sad if we did not have more people in employment in 2020. But, here you are, you have a government that wants to have it both ways.


It wants us to look at what the situation would have been in relation to emissions, but it wants us to compare where we start now and where we will be in 2020 in the job situation. The truth of the matter is that the carbon tax will cost jobs and it will put downward pressure on wages. It will result in lower real wages.


I talked about China yesterday and I did not quite get to the end of what I was trying to get across. Just in the last three years, Treasury's expectations as to what would happen—




Senator Milne:
  Mr Chair, I rise on point of order and refer to standing order 144(5):


In committee senators may speak more than once to the same question, and, when a question has been proposed from the chair, shall confine themselves to that question.


The question before the chair is the government's amendment. Unless Senator Cormann is referring to the Chinese buying up land in Australia and wants to take action on that, I cannot see how it is relevant to the government's amendment.




The CHAIRMAN:
  Thank you, Senator Milne. Senator Cormann, I draw your attention to the question before the chair and ask you to continue.




Senator CORMANN:
  Thank you, Chair. It is very much related because all of these measures are completely about Australia's efforts to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. They are about what we do in Australia in deciding whether or not land access for agricultural production is part of the criteria to pursue carbon farming initiatives under this legislation and whether these will have an impact on our contribution as part of the global community to try to address global greenhouse gas emissions. We have to put our efforts under this legislation, and under the carbon tax, into the context of what our trade partners and competitors in other parts of the world do. I draw your attention, Chair, to the fact that in China emissions will go up from about 10.3 billion tonnes now to about 17.9 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2020 according to the government's own Clean Energy Future modelling. That is an increase of 7.6 billion tonnes, which is more than 10 times the amount of annual emissions that we put out here in Australia.


The figure that really struck me was that back in 2008, when the government did this really comprehensive modelling on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Treasury thought that China by 2020 would put out 16.1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions. Just in the last three years, the government's expectations of how much CO2 emissions will be put out by China have gone up by 1.8 billion tonnes. Just the variation is more than three times as much as Australia puts out in a year.


Amendments like this one that we are talking about now are quite important, but we always have to put in context what our efforts here in Australia can do and put those into the context of what is happening currently in China. The government often talks about emissions intensity. I make the point very quickly in the short time that I have remaining: emissions intensity in Australia is lower than it is in China. It was 0.8 kilograms of CO2 per year per US$ of production in 2005 when it was 1.38 in China. In 2010 it was 0.66 in Australia and it was 1.06 in China. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (10:04):  As has been indicated by previous speakers on this motion, the coalition is proposing a very similar amendment in relation to the protection of agricultural land. I have to say I am quite confused as to where the government really sits on this matter. We have seen a decision made by government in the last fortnight which places enormous pressure on the availability of agricultural land in Tasmania from forestry.


When the Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania signed the intergovernmental agreement on forests in Tasmania, based on the statement of principles processes that have been negotiated between the forest industry and environmental groups over the last 12 months or so, one of the elements of that process was effectively to move the industry out of native forests—out of our forest estate—and into a plantation regime. That plantation regime does not exist at the moment and the calculation that has been made, and widely accepted as part of that process, is that you will need an extra 100,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania to replace the lost forests that are proposed to be locked up, or claimed for lockup, by the environmental groups.


I am trying to get a sense of consistency of policy from a government perspective. It does one thing under this initiative, and the coalition agrees with that. As Senator Birmingham has said, we had an amendment to the bill to do exactly the same things with slightly different wording but the same effect. But here we have the government making an agreement with the Tasmanian government that, if it is put into effect, is effectively going to take up to 10 per cent of Tasmania's prime agricultural land for forestry.


Where is the consistency in the approach that the government is taking in these matters? It says it wants to protect agricultural land, yet its actual policy actions, the decisions that it makes, are completely contrary to that. As I said, these plantations do not exist. There are some in the environmental movement who claim that we can just magically change the manage­ment regime in our existing plantations and suddenly make them usable for solid timber. That is patently absurd. I do not know whether they are just being mischievous, whether they do not understand forestry or whether they are just trying to push a barrow. I do not know the answer to that. Let us be charitable and say, 'They just don't understand it.' But those who do understand it have said quite clearly, 'The lockup of these Tasmanian forests will require up to 100,000 hectares of Tasmanian agricultural land if the industry is to have some form of equivalence.' Of course, we know that there are some who want to go further; they want to lock up all of Tasmania's agricultural land. 


If we are going to do that, we need to transition to a sawlog product that comes from a plantation base. We all understand that that will be required, but the reality is that that estate does not exist. The foundation research work for that has not been done. The species in Tasmania have not been properly identified. The methodologies are still being worked on. Some research is occurring but not enough has occurred yet. Where is the consistency in the government's policy? On the one hand they say, 'Yes, we would like to look after agricultural land; we would like to support prime agricultural land,' as they are saying through this amendment. The reality of what they are doing is the inverse. 


Through the intergovernmental agreement that the Prime Minister signed a week and a half ago, the government are in effect condemning 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land to plantation use. I really struggle to understand where the consistency is in all that. The minister has completely vacated the ground on this. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has taken over the negotiations in Tasmania, with the Prime Minister. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is playing no part in this that I can see, not visibly anyway. All of the work that is occurring is being done through the minister for the environment. Even then, there is no consistency. I would like to see consistent policy developed here.


For all the reasons colleagues discussed this morning, we all know that there is a strong basis for a managed regime in our native forests. It will provide for the long-term storage of carbon. If it is scaled at the right scale, it will have an absolutely negligible impact on our carbon stocks over time. And you need to recognise the carbon that is stored in solid timber products. I have referred before in this place to our magnificent surroundings here. The desk at the centre of this chamber is in fact a carbon sink. The carbon locked up in that stays there for the life of that product. I spoke to Gerry Harvey a couple of weeks ago and he had bought the propaganda peddled by some in the environmental movement that when you cut down a tree all its carbon expires to the atmosphere. He did not know that every piece of timber furniture that he sells is in fact a carbon sink. He has been put under enormous pressure from people in the environmental movement who are running a direct campaign against our forest industries—a dishonest campaign, I have to say—to not use native forests and to not use any native forest timbers out of Tasmania. That very campaign provides a direct threat to this amendment, to this legislation. 


A number of forest scientists that I have spoken to have confirmed that the require­ment is 100,000 hectares. We are talking about a lonely tree concept in this circum­stance. We are not talking about a plantation that might have 1,400 or 1,500 stems to the hectare; we are talking about a plantation in Tasmania that will have about 100 stems to the hectare so that you can get the right size over time. Those sorts of things will take up to 35 years to develop. Some in the environ­mental movement think that we can magic­ally transform from a native forest regime in three to five years. I am not sure what sort of management regime they are talking about. 


This direct action of the government is directly opposed to the intent of this particular government amendment. I would really like the minister to explain to me how that works. The coalition put up an amendment to do a very similar thing: to provide protection for prime agricultural land. There is enormous scope for putting native vegetation back into the landscape. The coalition have said that all along. We have supported the concept of enabling farmers to put vegetation back onto their farms, and, to a reasonable extent, without having a negative impact on their product­ivity. There is enormous capacity to do that. 


Through this government's actions, it is placing 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultur­al land at risk—and it is highly productive land—because it wants to appease its Green partners. It wants to stay in government both at a state level and at a federal level. So much of the policy that we are now seeing is being dictated by that arrangement and there is complete inconsistency in the govern­ment's approach. I would sincerely like the minister to explain that to me and explain how we are magically going to change the management regimes in forestry in Tasmania. I heard Dr Pullinger say on the radio last week that there are 300,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania and that we need to change the management regime of those so that we can use them for timber. That is just complete garbage. That is patently wrong. We have done tests on the plantation estate in Tasmania. They have been grown for fibre. A species called Eucalyptusnitens was put in the ground and those trees have largely been managed for the production of fibre for woodchips. That is a specific purpose and we know that there is a market for that. There is a proposal, which I know both the government and the coalition support, for the development of a pulp mill in Tasmania to utilise that resource. So we both have the same objective in respect of that. Dr Pullinger completely forgets that a large proportion of those 300,000 hectares is owned by the proponent of the pulp mill to go into the pulp mill. He does not tell that to the community when he says that we should just magically change our regime of forest management into a sawn timber process. But what do we find when we have do the scientific work and test that product? Can we use it for a sawn product? We find that it has a 35 to 40 per cent internal checking rate. That means that it is not commercially viable as a sawn timber product. It has not been managed for that and it is not suitable for that. So you just cannot switch over in three to five years, as some have suggested, to a plantation estate through some magical change in management practices.


When you are going to grow trees in a plantation estate for the purposes of solid timber you plan that process from before the time you start. You plan your regime, you plant your trees to that regime, you manage them to that regime and then, over the cycle, you will get the results. There is a lot of work to be done on that at the moment and yet here we have a government that is acting in a completely and utterly contradictory manner. It says that it wants to protect agricultural land through this amendment to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill but its real actions on the ground are doing exactly the opposite. I think that the government should be prepared to reconcile why it is doing that—although in the funding arrangement that the government has put together with the Tasmanian government there is absolutely nothing to encourage that shift to plantation, so I am not sure whether the government is just accepting that it will let the forest industry fall over in Tasmania. I am not sure if the government is accepting that or not. Where is this plantation resource going to come from and how is it going to be developed? If it is going to be developed it is going to take up to 100,000 hectares of agricultural land in Tasmania.


We have heard the government say a number of times, 'We are talking about developing evidence based policy.' My contention is that they are not even doing that. They say 'this is what we are going to do' but when they act they do something completely contradictory. We have heard a lot of times that you should watch what people do and not what they say, and here we have a government that have acted in a completely contradictory manner. They have devastated people in Tasmania with the concept that their fine timbers will be lost and that our craftspeople will lose access to the timbers. If you go to Salamanca market in Hobart on a Saturday morning there are stalls everywhere that use our fine Tasmanian timbers that come from our native forests. It is a huge tourist attraction. We are told that the tourist industry is going to be a substitute for our native forest sector, but here we are taking away a huge chunk of that. So the attitude of the government on this really needs to be considered very carefully.


As I have said, the coalition support the concept of protecting agricultural land, but we remain extremely concerned that the government are acting in an absolutely opposite fashion by threatening 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land. In conjunc­tion with the Greens, they want to lock away up to 572,000 hectares of our native forests which can be sustainably harvested and should be managed through a sustainable and properly scaled regime to produce those fine products. It will be very interesting to hear what the minister's response to that is.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:19):  I note that Senator Colbeck concluded his remarks with an invitation for the minister to respond—




Senator Ludwig:
  It was not relevant to the bill.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  If the minister felt that, he could have stood up and said that rather than simply quietly ignoring what Senator Colbeck had to say.




Senator Ludwig:
  Senator Colbeck should know it for himself. It is not my place to educate him.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, if you want your bills to pass smoothly through the parliament it is your place to educate us, I am sorry to say. That is part of the process. You bring the proposal here to the chamber—




Senator Ludwig:
  It is a Greens amendment.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  It is your amendment; it is a government amendment.




Senator Ludwig:
  And you agreed to it. In fact, you put the same amendment up.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Yes, except that you are now trying to tell me that it is a Greens amendment. It is certainly not a Greens amendment. When Senator Cormann took the call earlier, you suggested that you were going to respond to some of the issues that I had raised. I again invite you to respond to those, Minister—that is, how do you functionally and practically see this amendment operating in the regulations that you have put forward? The explanatory memorandum to the bill talks about how the excluded projects or the negative list system will work. It highlights the four original adverse impact areas. We are now planning to include a fifth, and that has been planned to be done for some time. Part 1.27 of the explanatory memorandum says:


These impacts may be in, or in the vicinity of, the project area, or any of the project areas, for that kind of project … The intention is that vicinity may be interpreted broadly, including water resource availability in associated catchments.


So how are 'vicinity' and 'adverse impact on land access for agricultural production' going to be defined? In the regulations we have been presented with some definitions for 'adverse impact on the availability of water', and there is a threshold level of 600 millilitres of annual rainfall and a whole lot of terms about how that operates and waivers and so on. They are all there for good debate, good analysis and good consideration by interested stakeholders. The question is, how will this new paragraph (e) in clause 56 of the bill, about land access for agricultural production, work? What will the thresholds for that be? How will that be defined in the regulations? Yes we think it should be done, but we want to have confidence that it is done well, that it is done right, that it is done effectively. If it is worth doing, it is worth making sure it is an effective amendment to the bill. 


Minister, can you explain for the record how you expect these regulations to reflect this amendment? What will the threshold considerations for land access for agricultural production be for inclusion on the negative list of projects or kinds of projects? What will be taken into account? What will be the tipping point? How can Senator Williams for his constituency or Senator Nash, who has raised these issues before, for her constituency know with confidence that this new paragraph is going to protect prime agricultural land and ensure that it is not subject to projects that would see it taken out of agricultural production?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:24):  I have waited because I just wanted to make sure that Senator Birmingham's filibustering attempts were exhausted as far as they could be before I responded to the two questions that he asked some hour ago, as I understand it. Everyone in the chamber agrees with this amendment. Why? It is a clarifying amendment. It is as simple as that. It makes plain the matters to be taken into account. Clearly, it is supported, and we should pass it as soon as possible. 


I will cover this first question in a little more detail so that Senator Birmingham does not get up for another 15 minutes and filibuster on an agreed amendment that he also has a proposal for. Because it is a clarifying amendment in relation to the substantive legislation, the regulations will not change. That is plain—it is plain from your side, it is plain from our side and it is plain from the Greens' perspective. He has made much of that but I suspect it is just a case of filibustering. Senator Birmingham knows the answer; I have provided it to him. The reason he put up the amendment, the reason we put up the amendment, was to clarify it. It is as simple as that and he knows it. 


The regulations are out there for consultation and community engagement. If Senator Birmingham wants to add his voice to that he certainly can, but I ask him to save some of his breath for the legislation currently before us. Some of the other speakers seem to have ranged quite widely outside the amendment. As the person responsible for the passage of the legislation, Senator Birmingham may have enjoyed listening to them and I am sure he may even have agreed with some of their filibustering attempts. Notwithstanding that, let us focus on the legislation and the amendment before us. By filibustering he is now preventing his own farming communities, his own supporters, from accessing the Carbon Farming Initiative. Let us look at the bigger picture. This is about ensuring that we do sequester carbon. I know he is fundamentally opposed to that but, notwithstanding that, he might be able to consider that some of those on his side do actually want this to pass so that farmers can sequester carbon and obtain an income stream.


In relation to Senator Birmingham's second question, the government is not saying through this amendment that there can be no revegetation. In many areas revegetation will have no or limited impact on land for agricultural production, as he well knows.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I cannot allow the minister's suggestion that we oppose carbon abatement to stand. The minister well knows that the coalition has long talked about—longer than the government, in fact—the great potential for soil carbon and for abatement through advances in soil carbon farming technologies. The minister well knows that they are issues that are being highlighted and that have stood consistently in the coalition's policy since it was released at the beginning of last year. They were also highlighted prior to that not just by our current leader but also by our former leader. Our consistency in supporting this concept is strong. Our consistency is shown in a policy document that has stood from the beginning of last year.


During that time the government has moved all over the place in relation to how it wants to tackle climate change issues. At the time we released our policy document outlining our support for the concept of soil carbon—this is like a trip down memory lane—Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister of this country, the government was arguing for an emissions trading scheme and we outlined an alternative way forward. As the weeks turned into months, at some stage Ms Gillard managed to roll Mr Rudd on the emissions trading scheme and knock that out, and so you no longer had a policy supporting an emissions trading scheme.




Senator Milne:
  On a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman: again, I draw the chair's attention to standing order 144(5). There is a question before the chair. It is the government's amendment agreed by the coalition and the Greens. I would ask that the current contributor confine himself to the question before the chair.




Senator Colbeck:
  On the point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman: Senator Birmingham is clearly being relevant to this debate. He is actually responding to a point made by the minister and is contributing to what is generally accepted, during the committee stage, as a wide-ranging debate. Senator Birmingham has been quite specific in responding to some points made by the minister. So I submit that there is no point of order.





The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  I draw Senator Birmingham's remarks back to the amendment before the chair.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:


Thank you, Chair. I think the arguments around consistency of approach and how these matters are handled are reasonable ones to be explored during these debates. In the end, the minister stood there and made a statement that the coalition did not support abatement through soil sequestration of carbon. I have been attempting to refute that claim, as is perfectly relevant within this debate. I have been attempting to refute that claim by highlighting that we have a consistent position of support. That position has stood the test of time, unlike the government which has flip-flopped on policy and leaders on this issue over the last year and, of course, has lied outright to the electorate over the carbon tax. Those outright lies and the flaws in the policies that the government adopted before are entirely relevant to the issues we are considering.


Let us look at the policies which the government took to the election. They took policies not for a carbon tax and not for an ETS; instead, they took policies for a cash-for-clunkers scheme and a citizen's assembly on climate change. Remember those two beauties? They were ideas of this government. Whatever happened to them? We worked out that the only citizen's assembly Ms Gillard needs is her weekly meeting with Senator Milne's leader, Senator Bob Brown, and we worked out that cash-for-clunkers was likely to be as disastrous a public policy as the home insulation scheme or the green loans scheme, both of which were other flawed policies in this area of climate change policy. So why is it that we are spending a long period debating this issue?




Senator Ludwig:
  Because you won't sit down!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  We are spending a long period debating it because everything else you touch you get wrong, Minister. Everything this government has touched in this space has just gone wrong. We want to make sure, so far as we possibly can, that what you do here, first principle, does no harm. That is a key part of the amendment before us.


The minister in his response described this as a clarifying amendment—I am sure the minister will correct me if I am misinterpreting him—and said that this amendment does not necessitate in and of itself any change to the regulations which were presented in draft form to the chamber yesterday; that adding a fifth area of consideration for what adverse impacts there could be does not change what the regulations outlining those adverse impacts may be. I find it quite remarkable that each of the five areas of consideration—the availability of water, the conservation of biodiversity, employment, the local community and land access for agricultural production—should be considered equal factors, that each of them would have equal relevance under law, that each of them would have equal relevance in the drafting of these regulations. If we are adding in a fifth area but the minister now says it has no bearing, relevance or interact on these regulations, I find that quite astounding. 


It seems to me that the government is utterly ignoring what would be the will of this chamber and the will of this parliament in inserting an extra criterion for consideration here. This list of excluded offsets projects is important because it is critical to the do no harm principle of this legislation. It is critical to making sure that in pursuing projects that allow for carbon abatement they do not negatively impact on the availability of water—the flow of our rivers, our watercourses, our groundwater supplies and all of those critical areas—that they do not negatively impact on the conservation of biodiversity and on maintaining critical wildlife corridors within our communities; that they do not negatively impact on employment prospects by closing down industries; that they do not negatively impact on local communities by causing harm to those communities, be it economic harm or social harm of some kind; and lastly, for the amendment we are debating now, that they do not negatively impact on land access for agricultural production, because we genuinely think that food security issues and Australia's agricultural output are vital and critical for the nation's future. They are things which should be taken into consideration. 


We see a burgeoning world population, a burgeoning middle class in the growing superpowers of China and India. They are leading to dramatically increased world demand for food production and food capability, and quite reasonably so. We think Australia should continue to play a key role in that. We think that this country, which has such a proud history of agricultural production and which has done so much not just to feed Australians but to feed parts of the rest of the world, should continue to do that. Nothing should stand in the way of that absolute imperative. 


Few issues generate the kind of public emotion, support and response as does the issue of food security and food production—and quite understandably so, because in the end the core, basic principles of life are that we as a species need food, water and shelter. Everything else you can debate, but food, water and shelter are the key ingredients. This country has not just an opportunity but a responsibility to make sure that we are at the absolute forefront of the production of food into the future.


That is why this amendment is so critical and that is why this amendment should be more than tokenistic. It should be more than a clarification; it should mean something. Seeing that this clause of the bill is entirely about setting up a framework by which regulations for the creation of the negative list are drafted, it is perfectly reasonable to expect that, if you were inserting a fifth criterion—a serious fifth criterion, not a meaningless one—relating to agricultural production, it would have some bearing on what is in the regulations. It would be reasonable to expect that it would impact on the regulations and that there would be some level of protection in those regulations for land access for agricultural production. 


If the minister says that it is a clarification and that it does not create the need for any further amendment to these regulations, I would invite the minister to show the chamber and to demonstrate to the Australian people how it is—in these regulations or elsewhere in this bill—that there is protection for those key areas of agricultural production. How and where do we find that protection? Where, in black and white, do we find it in the regulations or in the bill? We are putting this statement in here and it is meant to provide that protection, but what areas of Australia's farm production base will actually be excluded? What areas will be protected? Show us, tell us and give some reassurance to those who come back and look at the Hansard records of these debates. Give some reassurance that this is not just a meaningless amendment, that it addresses the concerns of many people—many of my colleagues and many of the farmers groups who want to do the right thing wherever possible. Those farmers groups want to increase the carbon content of soils because they know that that will provide, potentially, not just global benefits but practical benefits for the farmers themselves through enhanced water retention in their soils and therefore enhanced production capabilities.


There is an opportunity there for them, but what is in this amendment to make sure that those farming areas, particularly those of high value, are clearly protected from being taken out of agricultural production? What is in this amendment to ensure that we do not see the loss of the potential to fulfil our responsibility, and to take our opportunity, to be and continue to be a part of feeding the growing demands of the world? 


How, Minister, are you going to effect this amendment in the regulations? How is the intent of this amendment effected in the existing regulations or elsewhere in the bill? If it is just a clarification, show us, demonstrate to us, that it is, in fact, just a clarification by showing us that the concerns which have led to this amendment being put forward have already been addressed elsewhere. Show us where that is the case.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:42):  I will start by addressing your first question, which was put some 15 minutes ago when you first started. As an aside, I know that you are struggling in your filibuster to remain focused on the amendment. Notwithstanding that, why I come to the conclusion that you oppose any action on climate change is clear. You have no department, no legislation and no rigour around the model you propose. Plus, if you look at your direct action policy, you do not have any rigour around that either, nor do you have protections for agricultural land.




Senator Milne:
  No regulatory body; no negative list.




Senator LUDWIG:
  You have nothing—thank you, Senator Milne. All of that is why I come to the conclusion that you oppose any action on climate change. It highlights that all you are now doing is filibustering the legislation.


I go now to the only question you have asked all morning, which I have answered three times now, just to make sure that it is plain to you. This is an amendment everyone agrees to. It provides in clause 56 those matters, those criteria, that can be taken into account. That is, clearly, the protection that is provided. That is why you proposed it, that is why you agreed to it and that is why we also concede that it is reasonable to include it. It provides the list of matters for the case where, as the bill reads:


In deciding whether to recommend to the Governor-General that regulations should be made for the purposes of subsection (1) specifying a particular kind of project, the Minister must have regard to whether there is a significant risk—


that will now read 'material risk'—


that that kind of project will have a significant adverse impact on one or more of the following: …


And that list will now include the item we are now debating.


In addition to all of that, what you fail to appreciate—or maybe you do—is that you are now focusing on excluded offset projects. If this bill eventually passes—I would hope today, although that seems to be skating away—it will mean that we will have positive lists. In other words, we can focus on the positives rather than the negatives. You have remained focused on the negatives not the positives. I understand why you continue to the focus on the negatives. You do not want this bill to pass. You do not agree that this bill will provide the types of benefits to landholders and the farming community that they can participate in. You want your direct action policy to win so that you can share the confetti that it might have, but it does nothing for the environment, it does nothing to reduce carbon pollution, it does nothing with any rigour, and with no department it cannot have much legislative support.


I will not take up the whole 15 minutes, as this is an important amendment. We agree to it and it should pass. It would be in the best interests of all of us that we do not filibuster. You have been filibustering all morning on this. We have ranged quite widely in this debate, which has been an opportunity for you to get it all off your chest, so now let's get on with it.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:45):  Minister, I would appreciate your advice on a question I have. You will be aware that the northern beef industry was a very important part of Australia's agricultural activities. It provided food for Australians but, perhaps more importantly, also for our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, a country of 200 million-plus people who live closer to me than I do to Canberra or Melbourne. Indonesia is a very important neighbour of ours and one which we have assisted over many, many years. Part of that assistance has been to provide Indonesians with the protein that red meat provides and that was through, of course, exporting live cattle from Australia to Indonesia and then having those cattle slaughtered in Indonesia, in many cases by smaller abattoirs because of the lack of refrigeration in Indonesia. I say this by way of preamble to my question.


The minister would be aware that his decision in, first of all, banning from export those abattoirs that had a proven cruel record was appropriate, and the northern beef industry would have coped with that. By way of background, I simply relate that the minister was then spooked by the left wing of his party, by the Greens, by GetUp! and by all those other fringe groups who have little interest in Australia but who have a lot of interest in maintaining the Labor-Greens alliance in the federal parliament. The minister, completely spooked by those people and by the left wing of his own party, changed his decision overnight and invoked a total ban.


The biggest impact on the beef industry, which of course was the main supplier to the Indonesian protein market, was in Northern Australia. Clearly they are people whom I have a lot of association with and I try to help them as much as I can in a wide range of areas. My office and the office of any other politician in Northern Australia, state or federal, has been overwhelmed by the response from family farmers in the north whose livelihoods and indeed, in some cases, lives have been shattered by yet another stupid decision of the Gillard government.


My question in relation to this bill before us is this, Minister: is the Carbon Farming Initiative and this amendment likely in some way to benefit the northern beef industry that is now struggling to maintain its presence? The minister will be aware—




Senator Milne:
  The answer is 'yes' because you are supporting the amendment. You are actually supporting it.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am asking—




Senator Milne:
  So, why are you asking the question?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you.




Senator Milne:
  You are supporting this amendment.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Senator. I have some particular interest in this issue. The minister is putting—



Senator Milne interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I know you are not interested, Senator Milne. You want to stop cattle—in fact, you want to stop people eating red meat in Australia, continuously.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Senator Macdonald, could you address the senator through the chair, and I ask you to draw your remarks back to the amendment before the chamber.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman, your protection against these outrageous interjections, these attacks on me, these unparliamentary interjections would be appreciated. In that way I will not be distracted in responding to those unparliamentary interjections by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens. Suffice it to say, I am well aware that the Greens would like to stop all red meat eating in Australia and shut down the beef cattle industry in its entirety.


Minister, back to the question I was asking you. Senator Milne rightly points out that we are supporting the amendment in principle but, Minister, could you explain to me how northern beef producers might be able to take advantage of this amendment and, indeed, this whole bill? The northern beef producers are absolutely decimated by your government's decision. The minister will be aware of course that many of the beef cattle producers in Northern Australia are indeed Indigenous cattle producers. They, like every other cattle producer, will be struggling to make ends meet. I am just hoping that the minister can assure me that there is something in this bill and in this amendment which will allow some small relief to the northern beef cattle industry that the minister almost single-handedly destroyed. Minister, I give you the opportunity, of course, to redeem your decision that has just about, as I say, destroyed the northern beef cattle industry. Perhaps your response could give some hope to the northern beef cattle industry that there is something in this bill and its amendments that will enable industry players in the north to get some assistance. The best assistance the minister could give would be to say that the whole carbon tax policy was off the table. You recall, Mr Chairman, that just a year ago the leader of the Labor Party—the current Prime Minister—promised hand on heart that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led and here we are one year later dealing with legislation surrounding the introduction of the tax she promised would never be introduced in a government she led. She was not on her own, of course. We all know that the Treasurer, Mr Swan, was equally vociferous in assuring Australians that if they voted for the Labor Party—




Senator Birmingham:
  They were hysterical allegations.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Absolutely. He accused Tony Abbott of making hysterical allegations when Tony Abbott said, 'As sure as night follows day, the Greens-Labor alliance will introduce a carbon tax.' Wayne Swan was out there assuring everybody that Mr Abbott was simply being hysterical, but we know one year later that the promises of Ms Gillard and Mr Swan mean nothing. One wonders about the promises that the minister, on behalf of Ms Gillard, is making in this bill and the promises he is making on regulations under this bill. Will they be kept or will they suffer the same fate as the promise of Ms Gillard that, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'?


What can you believe of anything the minister tells us? He is telling us what might be in the regulations; he is making certain commitments and promises. We have done that before. We as the Australian public actually believed Ms Gillard and Mr Swan a year ago when they said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We have now worked out to Australia's absolute detriment that you simply cannot believe anything a government led by Ms Gillard says. I guess all of these debates are a little academic. We have the history of the Labor-Greens alliance. We know the leader, Ms Gillard, will promise you something to get a personal and political advantage and, as soon as it suits her, she will completely renege on that solemn promise.


Minister, your decision on the live cattle trade was about as well thought through as the carbon tax proposal. Perhaps that is not right. Perhaps you did give a bit more thought to the carbon tax proposal because you desperately need money from any source and this is one way you can get it. I guess you did give a bit of thought to how you could get more money into the coffers to make up for Labor's profligate, wasteful spending on a range of projects. The decision you made on the live cattle exports was made obviously without thought. Once you gave it a bit of thought you realised the huge mistake you had made. You have tried to ameliorate that. 


I hear that the first shipment of live cattle is either on the way or being prepared for export to Indonesia now, but it is only a fraction of what was a very prominent industry that kept many beef producers, many Indigenous families and communities in productive, full-time work in the north, which you have almost destroyed with that ill-thought-through decision. In the context of this bill and this amendment, I am wondering whether there is some message of hope that you can give the northern beef cattle industry for something they might be able to gain from this to help them through the awful financial, business and personal situation many of them find themselves in at this time.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:57):  In answer to the direct question, if you go back to the second reading speech, this bill is committed to action on climate change and the need to reduce our carbon pollution. What it does is unlock the abatement opportunities in the land sector and provide farmers, foresters, growers and landholders access to carbon markets. In doing so, it will begin to unlock the abatement opportunities in the land sector which currently makes up about 23 per cent of Australia's emissions.


That means that the Carbon Farming Initiative will create incentives to do two crucial things: protect our natural environment and adopt more sustainable farming practices as well as the benefit of mitigating climate change. So it does provide an income stream. All of these important co-benefits mean that the sooner we pass this legislation the sooner we ensure that landholders can have access to it and participate in carbon markets and establish income streams and lock up carbon through soil sequestration, through biochar—through all of the types of opportunities that are provided on the positive list—and develop more opportunities on the positive list. They are all what this bill is about in giving landholders in the agricultural sector a mechanism that values their contribution.

 (Tasmania) (10:58):  I note that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry indicated that the issues I spoke of in my previous contribution were not relevant. I have to say I completely disagree with that. We are specifically talking about protection of agricultural land, yet the direct actions of the government—they are not indirect by any sense of the imagination—put at threat 100,000 hectares of Tasmania's agricultural land. So 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land is directly put at threat by the Prime Minister and the Tasmanian Premier agreeing to lock up to 572,000 hectares of Tasmania's native forests. It was something that was discussed during the statement of principles process, and it goes directly to the government's credibility in the discussion of this piece of legislation—the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011. The government says it is looking, through its amendment (1), to protect agricultural land, yet its direct action—what it really does on the ground—indicates that it is not. Under what circumstance can anyone have any real confidence in what the government says it intends to do when its direct action—its real activity—actually indicates the opposite?


Minister Ludwig is correct that we both have the same aspirations in what we are proposing here, but it would have been nice if the minister had been prepared to actually address the issue of the direct threat to 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land rather than just passing it off as completely irrelevant—because it is not. We know he has vacated the field completely to the environment minister in the forestry negotiations in Tasmania. He is no longer a part of it; he has been pushed aside. That is disappointing, because I think he might be prepared to stand up a bit more for the forestry industry than is the environment minister—who, amusingly, is a former forestry minister. It would be very nice if the minister were to address the reality of what is occurring in Tasmania and the direct impact on Tasmania's agricultural land.


I want to put a few more details on the record in relation to what has been proposed by the environmental groups and the discussion they are trying to pass off as a simple way to deal with this, saying: 'We're not really threatening agricultural land. You can use the existing plantation estate to take up the lockup of these forests'—the disgraceful lockup of these forests. As I said before, there are about 300,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania. About 216,000 hectares of the 300,000 are actually in private hands. So here we have the ENGOs out there happily talking about property that is not even in government hands; it is held by private individuals. As I have said, a lot of that is actually owned by the proponent of the proposed pulp mill in Tasmania, and it has been grown specifically for that purpose. You cannot just magically waltz off and say, 'We can put that into a first-class timber supply.' That is absolutely, patently absurd. Yet that is what the ENGOs are implying in their discussion.


It is no wonder that there was huge frustration even from Mr Kelty, in his negotiations with the activities of the ENGOs throughout this process. The ENGOs have been quite disingenuous, saying one thing inside the negotiations and another thing outside the negotiations. Mr Pullinger, in particular, got to the stage where his credibility in this whole process was quite suspect, quite frankly. In fact, I think he has even deceived some of his own people in what he was agreeing to in the negotiations versus what he was telling them outside.


I will just take this a little bit further. We have 216,000 hectares of Tasmania's 300,000 hectares of plantation in private ownership. They do not belong to the ENGOs. They are not public property to be negotiated as part of this agreement. As I said, they have been grown for something else. There are 32,700 hectares in private ownership, and they are there for a number of reasons. Some of it is pine plantation, and that obviously has a specific market, but you are not going to get magnificent native forest veneer out of a pine plantation—it is absurd to suggest that you can transition in three to five years out of native forest into, say, a pine plantation. You certainly cannot transition into a eucalypt plantation, which has a life cycle design of about 12 to 13 years. You certainly are not going to get a long-life veneer out of that.


The government's policy, through this amendment, is to protect agricultural land, yet the action resulting from the govern­ment's decision in Tasmania is to push forestry out onto agricultural land. In fact, we are seeing it more broadly than that. I was in Orbost last week talking to the forest sector down there, and they are being slowly squeezed out of the forests by the Greens and the environmental groups, in conjunction with the Labor Party. They are a bit more encouraged, with the change of government in Victoria, that that might slow down a little bit, but you see this squeezing out of native forests and into plantations, and there is only one place to plant that: it has to be on agricultural land. We do not like to see conversion of native forests to plantation anymore. I support that process. Let us regrow native forest as native forest and have a long-term rotation, which the forest scientists tell me is the best way to store carbon, the best way to look after water quality and the best way to look after biodiversity.


All the values that the ENGOs and the Greens claim they want to achieve are best achieved by a long-term rotation regime in a native forest. Yet here we have a government decision that is directly threatening that, pushing agriculture out of the way and pushing us into a plantation regime. There is only one place for that to go. Whether it is in Tasmania or in any other state, it has to be pushed out onto agricultural land. As I said, we do not like to see conversion of native forests to plantations. We have seen that in Tasmania, and I am happy to admit that from my perspective that was one of the mistakes we did make in Tasmania in relation to our forestry practices: the large-scale conversion of native forests to plantations. We actually have a plantation estate there now and, as I have said, two-thirds of it is in private hands. But, I have to say well-managed, sustainable long-term rotation of a native forest regime—properly utilising all the product streams that come out of that—is the best way to manage this, not pushing our forest sector out onto our agricultural land. We see the government consistently making decisions that do not support what it says it is doing in this particular circumstance. It did exactly the same thing with its prohibition on utilising biomass for renewable energy. It was a completely ridiculous decision that was driven by the Greens. There is no other explanation for that. It is driven by the Greens; it is Greens policy. Senator Milne asked one of the ministers at question time yesterday a question about the life cycle of coal seam gas versus coal. She asked for a life cycle comparison. I will give her the life cycle comparison of utilising biomass from native forest waste to coal. It is 4 per cent. So how do you reduce your carbon emissions in energy generation by 96 per cent? You utilise biomass. In Australia, we could generate 8,000 gigawatts of energy from native forest biomass waste without touching another twig or tree.


Think about the carbon emissions that will reduce. The government bangs on about wanting to have a comprehensive carbon reduction scheme and process. If we recognise biomass we can reduce the life cycle emissions over coal by 96 per cent, but because of ideology we cannot do that. The government is not prepared to stand up and say: here is a way that we can do that. You can do it cheaper than wind. It is a low-cost technology compared with, say, wind. It can be done at the regional level. It can be appropriately scaled. I am prepared to accept that in some places we have let the wrong drivers get into our forestry systems. Woodchips did that for a period of time in Tasmania, and that has now obviously changed with some changes in the markets. But a properly scaled biomass industry, set up on a regional basis and with access to the grid, could provide a well-costed, low-carbon-emission energy source which could be quite cost competitive. Yet, because of ideology, because the Greens tail is wagging the Labor dog, we cannot go down that track, so we miss out on the opportunity to produce up to 8,000 gigawatt hours of energy from wood waste that lies on the forest floor, which quite often gets burnt in regeneration burns, which of course the Greens then come out and complain about, saying that we are putting all this particulate matter into the atmosphere. We could actually put that into a biomass plant and generate renewable energy and reduce the emissions from coal in comparison by 96 per cent. Yet ideology drives us away from that.


So all these things we could have if the government were prepared to make sensible and consistent decisions. All we are asking for is a consistent decision-making regime. The government have an amendment on the table that says, 'Look after agricultural land,' yet their decision-making processes, with the forestry agreement in Tasmania and the exclusion of biomass, act in an opposing manner to the intent of this amendment.


We have stated that we have a similar amendment on the Notice Paper. We support the protection of agricultural land. Because of the government's actions in concert with those of the Greens, the Greens tail wagging happily away when they get their way, running the Labor dog, we cannot get sensible decisions out of the government. We would be more than happy to work with the government in relation to these things if the government were prepared to make sensible decisions, not say they are going to do one thing and do something else, which is what we see time and time again. We saw it with the forest agreement and with the biomass in Tasmania.


We see attempts to make claims about the plantation estate in Tasmania that just do not stack up. ENGOs are getting on the radio, telling the community that there are 300,000 hectares of plantation estate in Tasmania that will be available to transition into in three to five years. They are privately owned and they have not been planted and managed for that purpose, yet the government makes a decision at the behest of the Greens at the state level—Nick McKim, running for Premier in Tasmania. And in the federal parliament we have the Greens running the Labor agenda. They are not prepared to stick up for the industry and not prepared to take the actions that we support, which is to provide that level of protection for agricultural land.


I will be very interested to hear the minister's response to that. It is disappointing that he has been pushed aside as part of this process, as I said before. I would much prefer to have him driving this than the minister for the environment. He was a complete failure as agriculture and forestry minister in the previous government. I have much higher hopes for the current minister, and having spoken to him a couple of times I know that he has a sense of feeling towards the forestry sector. But it would be really nice if the government in its actions were prepared to demonstrate that.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:13):  Just to reiterate, we are dealing with an agreed amendment under the Carbon Farming Initiative. I know that, for those following this debate, we have certainly ranged quite widely. The reason for that is that the opposition do not agree with this legislation and they are using every opportunity to filibuster. Filibustering is the course that oppositions can occasionally take to delay the passage of legislation. It is unfortunate that they are doing it in such a poor way. Sometimes, though, they do it in a much more entertaining way, one which is perhaps even more relevant to the actual amendment that is currently before the chamber. Unfortunately, here they are not.


Can I say again that, broadly, in combina­tion with measures announced in the govern­ment's Clean Energy Future plan, the CFI is likely to improve the productivity and sustainability of Australian agriculture. The Carbon Farming Initiative projects will be most cost effective where they enhance agricultural productivity and deliver environ­mental co-benefits, such as reducing erosion and salinity or protecting biodiversity. The Carbon Farming Initiative is unlikely to promote what the opposition are now effectively trying to hold onto as their last, single thread of opposition to this bill, which is the conversion of agricultural land to other uses. In all but the most marginal of farming areas it will not be cost effective to undertake revegetation of productive agricultural land, unlike their own policy of direct action where—with no department, no rigour and no modelling—direct action could, in fact, have adverse impacts. It is are far better opportunity for the opposition to agree to the Carbon Farming Initiative, pass the legislation and ensure that farming communities can benefit from what is environmentally and sustain­ably productive while getting the co-benefits of reducing erosion and salinity and protect­ing biodiversity and getting the co-benefit of an income stream.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (11:15):  There are a couple of questions that I would like to ask in relation to the draft regulations tabled yesterday. They relate to issues around water and water interception. I am genuinely interested in knowing what the baselines for those calculations might be. There is a table on page 6 that talks about the level of interception, long-term average rainfall and the volume of water offsets that have been claimed as part of that. But in relation to what the interceptions might be, in respect of the baselines for calculation of those given the general character of the landscape that they are in, in many circumstances revegetating—and I use that term quite deliberately—the local landscape is actually taking that landscape back to what it might have been before it was cleared. I use a very personal example of the farm that my parents farmed on, which was all forested land. I think there were four or five sawmills in the valley in the early 1900s when that land was cleared. Obviously, that has a material impact on the water flows and the water tables in those areas, so when you take forest cover away the natural impact of the native forest there is changed. It is obviously considerably changed in the development of the agricultural land. If you actually regenerate that country—and a lot of that is now about growing trees, although not in a native forest format unfortunately—you are actually taking that back much more closely to what it was like before. So I am interested in the justification of saying that you have to have that high-security water title, that water right, to that land, because this is a very new concept and it is not something that we have seen in any format that I have come across before. So the concept of saying that we now need to have a water licence to put trees back into the landscape is a new concept and I am interested to see how that might perhaps bleed off into some other areas. I am very interested to know what the government's baselines for these are, whether they are as to what was the natural state or whether they are as to what is now the altered state, and how those calculations have been determined.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:18):  The table was based on CSIRO's research and has been developed in consultation with SEWPaC as to water. It is also out for consultation. There has been a significant use of water over the longer period but we need to start looking at what that provides proponents who hold water access entitlements. That, as it reads, 'provides high security for at least the volume of water likely to be intercepted by the forest annually, calculated in accordance with table 1' and averaged across the life of the project. It 'is only used to offset the water intercepted by the forest'. The table is based on the research that is available and developed in consultation. As I said earlier, after some two hours or more dealing with this one agreed amendment, we have got the regulations out for consultation and industry stakeholders can provide valuable input into all that.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (11:19):  I think the minister is genuinely trying to provide some advice in respect of that. I am genuinely interested in this and I am getting a good sense of the bases and the baselines for these. As I said, it is a new concept and it does have the capacity to be a precedent for other land uses. So in that context alone it is important that we make sure that this is put together properly. It actually does vindicate the opposition's concern at the time that this bill was first tabled when we said we wanted to see the final passing of this legislation deferred until after we had the capacity, as an opposition and as a parliament, to actively consider these regulations. There was some indicative work provided to us, I accept, but that was not until the day we reported on the legislation, which significantly inhibited our capacity to deal with it. Now here we are, with the government pushing to try to get the legislation finalised, receiving draft regulations and there are some very important concepts contained in these. This, as I have said, is something that I have not seen before in any legislation where someone wanting to have an agricultural land use is required, just to undertake that agricultural land use, to have a high-quality water entitlement. I think it is important to know what the baselines are for this. I understand that the water uptake by a forest plantation varies significantly over its life. It is very, very low in the early stages, obviously, when there is less density in the forest. It ramps up as the forest grows and then it evens off as the forest matures. I would like to know the basis for the calculation—whether it is an average across the life cycle of a forest. How are these figures calculated?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:22):  As I indicated earlier, while revegetation may be taking the landscape back to its natural state, high-security water licences are required because other land uses, such as agriculture, also need water. It will use more water than was the case before human settlement. It is one of those areas where the CSIRO has put together a table. It provides a range whereby you can see a long-term average annual rainfall. It is only used to provide the high security for at least the volume of water likely to be intercepted by the forest annually. It is calculated in accordance with table 1. It provides a calculation. The object is to get to a point where we can use table 1 in a meaningful way. In using it in a meaningful way, it is of course open for consultation. If stakeholders disagree with the long-term average annual rainfall volumes of water offset entitlements required per hectare over the life of a plantation forest then they are entitled to have input into that process.


While dealing with the baseline, we have also dealt with the overall table itself. I think I have sufficiently answered questions for this area. It is again outside the amendment which we are currently dealing with. I am happy to provide answers to it, but we are still dealing with filibustering from those opposite. I know they do not want to pass this legislation. I am happy to answer questions about it and to provide clarity in relation to it. I am sure the community at large, with its 59 submissions, has been able to provide input. The regulations are out for further comment. All of that means that this area will be beneficial to farmers and to the environment the sooner we pass it and put the framework in place.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:25):  Thank you, Madam Chair. It is a delight to see you in the chair. Congratulations on your ascendancy to that office. I do note that the minister has drawn to our attention that we have been debating this amendment for some time, and I acknowledge that—




Senator Ludwig:
  You haven't been debating the amendment. You've been talking about a whole range of things.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, I think you will find that my contributions have often come to the point of the amendment with great—




Senator Ludwig:
  Your nose is growing. 




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  You do not want to invite me to take that one, do you? You do not want me to take 'the nose is growing' interjection, because that will only lead to discussing one thing in this place at present. If you want to talk about great big liars in this place, we all know where that leads to. It leads of course to talking about the Prime Minister and yesterday's anniversary of her great big lie to the Australian people. 




Senator Ludwig:
  You should not use the Pinocchio defence.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Well, I am not sure what defence the Prime Minister has at her disposal in relation to the lies that she told in campaigning to the people at the last election, particularly on the carbon tax. This amendment is one that, as you have rightly highlighted, we all support. I am disappointed, Minister, that you have attempted in this debate to downplay the significance or the import of this amendment. You have essentially cast it aside to the extent that the amendment is little more than a point of clarification rather than an amendment that should be treated with a semblance of seriousness and that should be recognised as an important issue in how this legislation will ultimately operate. This does not change the opposition's support for the amendment.


Obviously, we will engage with stakeholders, as we trust the government will, about the regulations that pertain to section 56. We will make those engagements as constructive as possible. If stakeholders have concerns that the regulations do not fit or adhere to the amended section 56 and the inclusion of this criteria around the availability of land for agricultural product­ion, then I guess we will be back here at some stage debating the regulations in a disallowance motion. Hopefully, it will not come to that. Hopefully, the government can refine these regulations into something that adheres to not just parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 56 but also part (e), which is around land access for agricultural production.


Whilst the minister at the table, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, should have a particular vested interest in the amendment before us, the operation of this bill or act, if it is passed, will be with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I urge that minister to make sure that, as the regulations are finalised, serious consideration is given to whether they are adhered to and that if stakeholders, in particular the farming groups, have continuing concerns about the possible impact of this bill on land for agricultural production then those concerns are heeded so that we get a win-win outcome, so that we get the outcome where farmers actively participate in a market, in an environment, to sequester carbon in their soil and, in doing so, we have the potential benefits of increased water retention, of increased productivity on their land and of the potential for Australia to grow its food production but at the same time we get the other win of certainty that those farmlands will be protected, that we will have agricultural production on all of our potential prime farmlands and that there will not be any adverse outcomes or consequences to that under this bill.


That is what I hope will happen as these regulations are finalised. Notwithstanding what the minister at the table has had to say in downplaying the significance of this amendment, I hope most sincerely that the government will take this amendment with all seriousness and will ensure that it is complied with and reflected in the regulations, not just to the letter of the amendment but to its spirit. Should the stakeholder groups, and farm groups in particular, have concerns about the application of this clause in these regulations in constructing the negative list of activities, I hope that is reflected seriously and those concerns are picked up in these regulations.


Minister Ludwig, obviously you are not going to give any greater comfort at present that we can expect to see anything stronger in the regulations. Obviously, you are not going to give us any greater detail as to how this amendment may operate in the regulations. After some period of debate, I have come to accept that. I have heard your answers; I understand the points that you have made. I am disappointed, but I certainly hope that the minister who will have responsibility for the operation of this law, if passed, will have a different attitude about the significance of this amendment. The opposition certainly does. I hope that, in time, we will see it thoroughly reflected in the regulations that I wish had—and should have—been drafted long ago in tandem with the presentation of this bill, because they are so critical to how it works and because they can set aside so many of the concerns and misgivings that people have. That has not been the case. Nonetheless, as we now move forward on this, I hope that the government will show a different attitude to this important amendment than the minister has suggested to date. That does not, of course, change the opposition's support for this amendment.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (11:33):  I take issue with a point that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry made on these water access entitlements and ask him to clarify it. I think he was saying that these calculations are being made on the basis of the modified status of a particular piece of country. So it is based on what is there now versus what the original state was. I accept that in a lot of circumstances a fair bit of time has passed between them. I also want him to clarify his point about the amount of water that is actually taken up by a regenerated area versus what it might have been in its native state. I am genuinely interested in this. As I said before, this is a new concept. It is something that I am very concerned about being in the regulations in the first place because it has the capacity to do something that could then be applied to other agricultural pursuits. Quite frankly, the thin edge of a very dangerous wedge would be, rather than a farmer making the decision to plant a crop based on whether he understands he has the water, for some regulation to be imposed on him that he can or cannot plant a crop based on what his water right is.


I put on the record my concern that we are even going down this track in the first place. We will continue to pursue that through the process of scrutinising these regulations. I go back to the point I made earlier that we asked for these regulations back when the bill was being debated and scrutinised by the committee. All of these issues could have been much more easily dealt with, the progress of the legislation through this place could have been much more easily managed, had the government been prepared to do what the opposition asked at the time. In fact, we even moved a second reading amendment to the legislation asking the government to delay the passage of the legislation until the Senate had been able to properly consider the regulations. In my view, that was a very reasonable request. It has been vindicated now because there are legitimate questions and concerns that have been raised by this process.


As I say, this is the first time that I have seen any requirement for any agricultural pursuit to have a high security water licence before there is an entitlement to actually go ahead with that agricultural pursuit. Is this to become the norm? Are we going to see this occur in other circumstances when a farmer is told that he cannot plant his crop unless he has that water right? Are we going to see that be part of an ENGO campaign, for example? I would not be surprised. Here is the precedent. I have often had the discussion with some in the farming community, 'Be careful of what you ask for; you might just get it.' I am quite concerned that this is even in the regulations to start with, but I would like to get a decent sense of the method of its calculation. I would genuinely be interested in the minister putting something on the table in relation to this so that I can get an understanding of where these numbers come from. He says the numbers are from the CSIRO. I am happy to accept that that might be the source, but I would be genuinely interested in having a look at it so I can compare it with some other science that I have read. There is some very good research that I have looked at that talks about the water take-up of trees. The one thing that I do know is that you cannot put a blanket ban on it because it is extremely variable. It varies depending on where in the catchment it is. It varies based on the gradient of the land, whether it is higher or lower in the catchment and whether it is closer to a watercourse or further away.


All of those things vary, yet this table is effectively based on long-term rainfall and a volume of water that a planting might be expected to take up. How can we as a Senate understand the basis of this? That is why I am asking these questions. The uptake of water through tree plantings of any kind is not a new issue. It has been discussed over a number of years. Yes, the MIS circumstance has exacerbated that discussion and, yes, the MIS circumstance has probably prompted some people to say, 'Let's use this as a mechanism to stop people planting trees.' That is not something that I have not seen before: find a point of community concern and then campaign on that to try to stop people undertaking an activity—stock in trade for some ENGOs.


I genuinely would like to see the basis of this. I would really like to understand the basis of the science. How do we get to something that is based on a rainfall range of 100 millimetres one way or the other and then a water offset for an intended uptake? Surely these are the sorts of things that the proponent of a scheme should be required to consider as part of the process. Why be so specific in what you are defining as part of your regulation? Why not have it as part of a project plan that you have to consider this and then include that as part of the approval process? Perhaps that is a better way to do this rather than being specific and saying, 'If you receive average rainfall of 600 to 700 millimetres over the long term, you need a 0.9 megalitre high-security water licence to undertake a tree planting.' That just does not make sense. As I have said, it varies depending on whereabouts in a catchment you are and on the gradient, and it varies according to the species. Different species will have different uptakes. A saltbush will have a different uptake to that of a eucalypt.


We have before us something that has a very specific focus—and it is something that has never been seen before—and all I am asking for is to see the basis of the calculation. I am genuinely concerned that it is there in the first place, because it could be the nasty thin edge of the wedge, but I would genuinely like to look at the basis of this.

 (Queensland) (11:41):  I am conscious of the fact that Senator Birmingham, who is running this for us, is keen to have a vote on this particular amendment before a quarter to 12, so I will keep my question very short. The minister would be aware of the banana industry in North Queensland. He would be aware that the banana industry uses a hell of a lot of electricity in its cooling and ripening rooms and a hell of a lot of transport fuel to get the bananas from Tully in Far North Queensland down to the markets in Sydney and Melbourne. The minister would also be aware that just a year ago the Labor Party leader Julia Gillard promised she would never introduce a carbon tax in her government and here we are actually debating bills around the carbon tax. 


The banana industry in North Queensland will be hit with increased electricity costs once the carbon tax that Julia Gillard promised would never be introduced is introduced. The banana industry will also be hit with huge increases in freight costs to bring bananas from Far North Queensland down to Sydney and Melbourne. The banana industry will struggle just as the northern beef cattle industry will struggle. Can the minister assure me that the Carbon Farming Initiative will actually help banana farmers by giving them some assistance that will in a very small way ameliorate some of the additional costs they will have to pay when the Gillard government introduces its toxic carbon tax?

They do not believe in the Carbon Farming Initiative, which will provide benefits to the environment and reduce salinity, as well as provide specific benefits for the farming community. 


Pass the legislation. Stop filibustering. We will get an outcome that farmers can participate in. We know that the farming community is excluded from the carbon price. We have advocated for that and it has been agreed to. The farming community can certainly now use the CFI as an opportunity. This goes to the second question that was asked. You do not have to use the CFI if you do not want to. If you want to participate in it and if you want to develop a methodology that uses one of the available opportunities, you can do so. If you do not want to then you can continue. This is really responding to the Chicken Little arguments that were raised earlier about how the sky will fall down and everything else will happen. That is completely false. If you do not want to use the table do not use the CFI and do not use the opportunities that it presents to you. It is a perfectly logical answer for some who might not see an opportunity, but many will. So pass the legislation and let those farming communities benefit from sequestering carbon.


In response to Senator Macdonald, the banana industry, as you can appreciate, had an opportunity post Cyclone Yasi to receive significant support and assistance to get them through pretty difficult times. We provided a farm clean-up and a significant opportunity to get them through that difficult period. Because there were no bananas in the marketplace there were calls for alternative opportunities. What we have had though is a responsive banana industry able to deal with a particularly difficult event and get back up on its feet. In the foreseeable future bananas will re-enter the market, which will bring down the prices.


Not only the banana industry but all of the agricultural industries—I will not pick any out individually—can benefit from the CFI if they want to participate in it and develop the opportunities. They can use it as a way of reducing salinity in the soil, providing environmental benefits. I know that many in the farming community already do significant work on this. They can use that to their advantage by having their organisations join in this process of identifying the positive outcomes of sequestering carbon. This will ensure that they can reduce their carbon emissions, and that there are not only long-term benefits for their own environment but also income streams from it. All of that is available to them. It is not available while the coalition oppose the legislation and continue to filibuster.


We have been dealing with an amendment that everybody agrees with. No matter how many times the opposition have tried to characterise it otherwise, it is a sensible amendment. It provides what the opposition asked for and what the government sees as necessary. It does it by amending the criteria that are taken into account by the minister when making decisions around the legislation. We are now four or five hours in. We have had a couple of hours on one amendment that we all agree to. The coalition can argue that they are not filibustering, but they are. We really ought to get on with this legislation.


I think the coalition are now going from the ridiculous to the sublime. They are demonstrating just how opposed they are not only to the Carbon Farming Initiative but also to the opportunities that the Carbon Farming Initiative will present to farming communities. That disappoints me the most. I philosophically understand why the opposition oppose this. I do not agree with you. I completely think you have the wrong end of the stick. I see that it is your position and you are going to stick to it, but I do not understand why you want to deny farming communities the benefits of reducing salinity and soil erosion while also providing income streams. I do not understand that at all, quite frankly.


It is probably wedded to the fact that I mentioned earlier: in this debate, the coalition philosophically have a huge problem. They do not agree with the science. They do not agree with our position. They reflect that in many ways, such as saving money by not having a department. They have no legislation. They have no rigour. They have no model. They only have a direct action model, and I would not even call it that. It is just a tissue-paper-thin document which looks like a policy but is not. It is a clayton's policy, quite frankly. It will not work and it will not do what the CFI will do, which will provide all of those benefits and ensure, as we have done in this, that land use is a criterion that is taken into account. The opposition's direct action policy can have perverse outcomes. They do not want to talk about those perverse outcomes here, and I can understand why they would not want to, but if you look at the coalition's comments on those perverse outcomes the Liberals demonstrate that they are divided on this issue, as they are on the science of climate change.


The legislation we have will strike the right balance between rewarding environ­mental planning and protecting prime agricultural land; however, the Liberals do not want farmers to benefit from the carbon markets. They are spruiking the idea of tree planting as a panacea for climate change, but you could have the perverse outcomes that Senator Colbeck mentioned. It could create areas where you have insensible policy which encourages tree planting but without any rigour, model or safeguards and without any department or legislation. But they have provoked me into responding in a more broad way. I do this to highlight how the coalition are even opposed to benefiting farmers. That troubles me more each day as I sit in this chamber and listen to the Liberals spruik about the Carbon Farming Initiative. They ask questions but in truth they are filibustering; they are opposing the legisla­tion. Do that at the end—get on with it.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:52):  Most of the legislation the Labor Party has brought to this chamber has been so hopelessly drawn that it has had to be amended not long after its introduction. It has been brought in without proper scrutiny of all the elements. That is why we are spending time looking carefully into the bill before the committee at the moment. Senator Ludwig talked about filibusters but he just took 12 minutes to tell us practically nothing. If anyone is doing the filibustering, for some reason it is Senator Ludwig and the government. Senator Ludwig even raised issues that were not part of the debate, but as he has raised them it behoves me, in fairness and for an honest debate, to respond to them.


Senator Ludwig said that we want to abolish the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Yes, we do. We are looking for a lot of savings, and there is one very big saving. Which government was it that started the Greenhouse Challenge Plus Program? It was the Howard government. Which government put in place a number of initiatives that meant a reduction in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions? It was the Howard government. Did we need a new department of climate change to do that? No. We did it with the department of the environment. Clearly, that is where it can be done—without the huge expense that the Labor Party always wants to impose upon the Australian taxpayer by setting up another group of bureaucrats, another group of public servants, another group of people to push paper around. The department of the enviro­nment is perfectly able to handle this, and it can do that under an Abbott government just as it did under the Howard government.


Senator Ludwig also expanded the debate by talking about people not believing in climate change. I can only speak for myself, but I think most of my colleagues accept that of course the climate is changing. The climate has been changing for millions of years. Many scientists say that man is the cause of climate change but an equal number of highly qualified scientists, or more, do not agree. I am not a scientist, I am a mere politician, so I do not know. I take the view that when everybody else takes action, we will too. Certainly I accept that the climate is changing and I would be surprised if anyone did not understand that 20 million years ago the world was covered in ice. It is not covered in ice now, so of course the climate is changing. Millions of years ago the centre of Australia was covered by rainforest. It is not now; it is quite arid. So of course the climate is changing. Is it warming? That is a different question. The facts seem to suggest that in the last couple of decades the climate has either cooled or has not changed at all. They are matters beyond this debate, and I only mention them because Senator Ludwig raised them even although they are extraneous to the issue we are dealing with.


Senator Ludwig spent some time denigrating the coalition's direct action policy, a principal part of which is to put carbon into the soil. That was something the coalition was advocating and promoting long before the government ever thought of it. And you can reduce emissions, you can improve the quality of the soil, through the proposals that the coalition has put forward. You do not need a great big new tax on every Australian—a tax that will have no worldwide impact whatsoever on climate change—to get a reduction in emissions. The direct action proposal of Mr Abbott and the coalition will bring a reduction in green­house gas emissions. In fact Ms Gillard, the leader of the Labor Party and current Prime Minister, thought a year ago yesterday that no new tax would be needed when she said there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. The Labor Party leader made a solemn promise that, if her party was elected to government, there would not be a carbon tax. 


At about that time Tony Abbott told Australians that, as sure as night followed day, once you got a Labor Party-Greens alliance they would be after a carbon tax. Mr Swan, the deputy leader of the Labor Party and the current Treasurer, accused Mr Abbott of being hysterical for daring to suggest that the new Greens-Labor govern­ment would bring in a carbon tax. Mr Swan said that Tony Abbott's suggestion that the government was going to bring in a carbon tax was hysterical; it was not true. That was then followed up by Ms Gillard, the leader of the Labor Party, saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Indeed, she also said that if any action were to be taken on climate change initiatives it would only be done after there was a consensus of those in parliament. A year ago—just 12 months, 366 days ago—there was consensus. The Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party all agreed that there would be no carbon tax. 


So there was consensus just a short 12 months ago. There was unanimity in the Australian political scene. Everybody agreed there would be no carbon tax. People voted for Senator Feeney, Senator Ludwig and Senator Brown on the basis that, if the Labor Party were elected to government, there would be no carbon tax. Why did they think that? Because the leader of the Labor Party put her hand on her heart and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' 


It was not as though she did not know she would need to get into bed with the Greens. We all knew before the last election that the Senate was going to change. We could not maintain in the Senate the enormous success we had had in Queensland. Six years ago the Liberal Party had a magnificent success in Queensland when we got an unheard of four out of the six Senate positions. We knew that could not continue. Everybody knew it could not continue. Ms Gillard knew that if she formed government after the election it would have to be with the imprimatur of the left wing of the Labor Party—that is, the Greens. So she knew that was coming, yet in spite of that she promised us there would not be a carbon tax. Wayne Swan, the deputy leader of the Labor Party, reinforced that. Ms Gillard said, 'If we're going to do anything about climate change, it will be on consensus.' I repeat myself to make the point again: there was a consensus 366 days ago, one year ago, and that consensus was no carbon tax.


I raise those matters only because Senator Ludwig has broadened this debate, in what seemed to be a government-initiated filibuster, by bringing in these extraneous matters. I want to return to the question I asked Senator Ludwig about the banana industry. We know how very essential that industry is to all the banana eaters around Australia. As Senator Ludwig rightly said, Cyclone Larry first of all and Cyclone Yasi most recently devastated the banana industry. The banana industry has shown resilience and is back in play now. Coming from the area, I can assure Australian banana eaters that the supply is coming good, that prices will fall and everyone will be happy again—except that to get the banana product from Tully way up in Far North Queensland to Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra requires huge transport trucks. Those huge transport trucks, as Senator Sterle will tell us and as Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union will tell us, use a helluva lot of fuel—a helluva lot of diesel and petrol. 


Under the Gillard government's carbon tax those long-distance heavy transport vehicles are going to be slugged. You can imagine what that will do to the banana industry and to the price of bananas for the ordinary Australian public. There will be no compensation that I am aware of. That is why Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union is so violently opposed to this toxic carbon tax being introduced by the Labor Party and its leader, Ms Gillard. 


I hope the members of parliament who are in this place due to support from the Transport Workers Union will do the things they were elected to do and the things that their union sponsored them into this place to do—that is, to oppose this toxic tax which will mean such devastation for the heavy transport industry and, by extension, the industry I am talking about at present, which is the North Queensland banana industry. Banana growers are going to be slugged by the carbon tax on fuel introduced by this government, which promised that it would not introduce it.


The banana industry also uses a lot of electricity in their storerooms, coldrooms and ripening areas. It is not even argued about now. Even the government's own figures say it is 10 per cent, but we know what the government's modelling is like. More and more we are suspicious of modelling done by this government. The New South Wales government says that electricity prices will go up more like 15 to 20 per cent. That modelling is more believable because it is was done by independent economic analysts. That brings me back to the question I asked and the amendment we are dealing with: what impact will the Carbon Farming Initiative have—in a positive way, hopefully—on ameliorating the huge additional cost the banana industry is going to have to meet as a result of Gillard's carbon tax?


I have been distracted by Senator Ludwig's broadening of the debate, his filibuster. I did want to ask about the sugar industry as well, which is also very important in the north, but I have run out of time to do that. I would like to repeat my question: what tangible financial results will this particular carbon farming initiative give to the banana industry to help ameliorate some—a very small part, I would think—of the impact of the carbon tax on that industry?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:07):  I am not sure whether Senator Feeney spoke then or whether he just bounced in his seat.




Senator Feeney:
  I was succinct.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Marshall
):  I took it as a bounce.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  You took it as a bounce? A bounce in his seat? I was expecting and hoping for a response to Senator Macdonald's genuine concerns about an industry in his home state and an industry that is important to all Australians. The importance of that industry is being demonstrated—we have seen the impact flow through to inflation. That industry has gone through tough times following some natural disasters. 


Whilst Senator Feeney bounces in his seat, Senator Ludwig did at least provide some comments before he had to leave the chamber, but I was very disturbed by those comments. He claimed that the opposition does not want to give farmers the opportunity to sequester carbon in their soils and to enjoy some benefits from that. That is just a blatant misleading of the chamber. The opposition, as I have outlined before, has for a long time—far longer than this government—championed the concept that we can achieve significant carbon abatement in this country through enhancement of our soil carbon stocks; that we can make good inroads in reducing our share of global emissions by capturing carbon in our soils, by increasing the carbon content in our soils; and that, in doing so, we can enjoy a number of benefits such as those that Senator Ludwig has outlined. Those benefits include reduced risk of salinity, increased retention of water and increased soil capacity. Out of all that, we can enjoy the benefits of our soils being able to produce more and our farmers being able to produce more. We can actually boost Australia's overall productive capacity. So to come into this place and suggest, as the minister did, that we do not support the idea of farmers sequestering carbon is far from the truth.


The coalition has long supported the concept—has recognised the need and the opportunity—of putting greater carbon content into our soils. What we do not want to see, though—because it is what we have seen all too often from this government—is a bad scheme, a flawed scheme, a scheme that potentially has unintended consequences. That is what we do not want to see. That is what we on this side want to stop. That is why we have been diligent and determined in our approach to tackling all of the issues that we have seen with this legislation. That is why, as my colleague Senator Colbeck pointed out earlier, we were crystal clear from day one that we believed this bill deserved to be considered alongside all of the proposed regulations needed to make this bill work; that the Senate inquiry that looked at this should have been able to look at it in its entirety, with those regulations; and that it was important to make sure that, when the Senate committee engaged stakeholders who have an interest in this issue, those stakeholders were able to give us fully informed feedback about it.


But, no, the government resisted that. The government could not manage to get its act together and could not manage to present all of this information in one hit. Instead of the Senate inquiry looking at this legislation with all of the government's proposals before it, it only had some of the proposals. It was not until yesterday afternoon that this chamber was finally presented with a copy of the draft regulations. Long after the Senate committee has finished its deliberations on this bill, long after the House of Representatives has passed this bill and well into the debate on this bill, the government finally comes along and drops these regulations on the table. According to it, the final version of these regulations was pumped out at 11.43 am yesterday. 


These regulations are particularly important to the clause of the bill that we have been debating this morning—to proposed section 56 pertaining to excluded offset projects. That proposed section creates the so-called negative list in an attempt to ensure that there are no perverse outcomes or adverse consequences from the operation of the scheme. It attempts to ensure that, in striving to give farmers and others the opportunity to sequester carbon, we do not have adverse impacts in several areas, those areas being the proposed criteria for exclusion.


Four criteria were previously identified. Four is, I know, a number that is important to you at present, Senator Feeney. There are four criteria identified—water, biodiversity, employment and local community. The Senate is agreeing to add a fifth criterion—I do not think there are five spots on the Labor Party's Victorian Senate ticket, Senator Feeney, but, if they wanted a fifth, maybe you would be in the running. We want to add a fifth criterion of land access for agricultural production. The Senate has agreed to do that, but regrettably the minister stood in this place and brushed aside the significance of this. He has described it as little more than a clarification. We do not think preserving land access for agricultural production is a clarification. We think it is important. We think it is sound policy and we think it is vital that we preserve that in this country. That is why we think these regulations need to reflect the letter, the spirit and the intent of the amendment being proposed. I indicated before that I accept we were not going to get any greater clarification from Senator Ludwig. He had made his attitude clear on this. He did not think this was a meaningful amendment. I am not particularly hopeful that we are about to get any great response or contribution from the bouncing Senator Feeney in this regard.


What I do hope is that, when we pass this amendment shortly, the minister for climate change takes it seriously, and the government as a whole take it seriously. When they engage with stakeholders in analysing the regulations I hope they accept that this is a key principle, which is worth pursuing and worth us being genuine in our approach to. That is what I hope and that is what I urge the government to do. I hope that the government, in finalising this so-called negative list of projects that will not be permitted or accredited under the scheme, actually take into account the issues of land access for agricultural production and are mindful of ensuring that our best farming land remains available for farming purposes.


Farmers can grab hold of whatever opportunity they can to increase the carbon content of their soils, because that is a good thing, but we do not want any other negative outcomes that would see any of those farming lands taken out of agricultural production. That is what we think is at the core of this amendment. That is what we think is so vital in terms of the government honouring the letter, spirit and intent of this amendment. That is why we are so disappointed on initial analysis with the regulations, which have been drafted seemingly with no consideration of this amendment despite the fact that the government has known for a couple of months at least that it was going to accept and adopt this amendment.


If Senator Ludwig and Senator Feeney will not do it, I urge Mr Combet and those who will ultimately be responsible for the finalisation of the regulations that will be brought to this place to ensure that, when those regulations come here, we do not have to have this debate again; to ensure that you actually get it right, that you heed the concerns of the stakeholders and that, when we put the new subclause (e) into clause 56, it is a component that is considered with equal weighting to the other four components and that it is considered alongside them all. That is what we think would happen in a well-managed scheme, in a good scheme, rather than the type of shambolic approach that the government takes to the implementation of its environmental programs, which we have seen time and time again. I can but ask that Senator Feeney and the officials make sure that we honour this amendment fully. It is not as Senator Ludwig described it 'simply an add-on, simply a clarification' but something meaningful and gives meaningful security of land access for agricultural production into the future.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (12:19):  It is unfortunate that I had to leave the chamber and I was not privy to any comments that Senator Ludwig may have made in response to the questions I asked in my last contribution on the draft regulations provided to the chamber yesterday morning. I have to say that, for me, this is a really serious issue and I tried to stress that in my previous contribution. This actually introduces something into the legislative process that has not existed before. To demonstrate that we were serious about this we expressed our concerns in our report in response to the legislation. We said at that time that the lists are also a potential trojan horse in the introduction of measures that are not current common practice but are the subject of much community debate and would be best resolved outside this process.


Now we have them being inserted into the regulations. I accept that they were part of the draft negative list. It is much more defined in here now, but I am seriously concerned about the way it was defined. As I said before, I do not see how you can, in a blanket way, say that for a 100-millimetre or greater than 1,000 millimetres rainfall range you have to have a set high-value water entitlement. I just cannot fathom why, for a 600 to 700 millimetre long-term average rainfall, you have to have a 0.9 megalitre water offset licence per hectare per year for the life of the project. I just cannot work that out. It depends on where you are and what you are planting, and that will vary.


It is just like a number of other measures that are included in this bill. We talked about those in the dissenting report—for example, the risk of reversal buffer. The government has put a set five per cent risk of reversal buffer into this legislation and that would be best placed in the individual plan for each of the projects. We know that the risks of reversal vary according to the different forms of sequestration being proposed. Some are higher security than others. Some are much lower. Yet we have a fixed five per cent risk of reversal buffer proposed in the legislation. The same concept is being applied here. It is no different to what the government has done when the Prime Minister has said that no prices should go up by more than one per cent under the carbon tax. She has taken a piece of modelling and tried to apply that across the board. It just does not work. It is simplistic and you cannot apply it that way. 


I spoke to a small regional airline a few weeks ago. They said that 30 per cent of their overhead cost is aviation fuel. On the government's own modelling, that is going up by 10 per cent. What does that mean? In simple maths it means a three per cent increase in their prices. They have no option. That is before they apply any of the other costs that they might have—the electricity costs to run their hangars and their servicing business and all that sort of stuff. Their prices will go up by three per cent just from the cost of aviation fuel, which is not exempted under the proposed carbon tax, and so you have the government saying, 'We are going to give extra money to the ACCC and we are going to send the ACCC after anyone who says they are putting their prices up by more than one per cent.'


What do we tell all the small regional airlines around Australia whose overhead costs of operation are 30 per cent aviation fuel? It is not going to vary broadly. It is going to be pretty consistent across those small businesses and 30 per cent of their overhead cost is aviation fuel. It is going up by 10 per cent, a three per cent increase in cost to business. Do we say to them, 'The ACCC is going to come and see you; you cannot put your prices up by more than one per cent because the Prime Minister said so'? Her modelling reckons it should go up by less than one per cent. She told the people on King Island that it is 7c in $100. That is what she is applying, yet King Island gets the triple whammy. Their airfares are going up by at least three per cent. The only way to get on and off the island is by air. Shipping is not exempt. That is all going to go up, and we all know that it costs more to get things to those islands because you have to ship it all in by sea or by air. Of course, they already pay more for energy because that is the way it is in those places, unfortunately. There is no equalisation provided to them by the state, so their already higher power prices will go up by 10 per cent. We know that—the local power authority said so.


So here we have this process of taking an average and applying it across everything. It just does not work. It is not practical. So how can you say that, if you are in an area that has a 900 to 1,000 millimetre long-term average rainfall, you need a 1.8 megalitre water offset entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project? How does that work? Surely the best way to deal with that is to say, 'When you submit your plan for your project, we need you to consider what the water use might be and then, in that plan, tell us what you are saying it is and provide us with the information to back it up.' I cannot see me recommending support in my party room for these regulations the way that they are written at the moment. Why would you? As the coalition stated in its dissenting report, here we have Trojan horses. I have said a number of times this concept has not been seen in the legislative process in Australia before. It is probably there at the insistence of the Greens, prepared to give the Labor Party the benefit of the doubt on that. I notice the Greens have vacated the field.


I do not think those sorts of general­isations fairly apply. I acknowledge and accept that there are people concerned about the water use of tree plantings. As I said earlier, things like MIS have exacerbated those, but I also know, having read some of the science, that the water uptake varies considerably over the life cycle of the plantings and it varies considerably depend­ing on the type of planting—eucalypt to pine, saltbush, all those sorts of things. They all vary where they are in the catchment. You cannot make some blanket application across the board. If you want to deal with the issue, that is fine, but deal with it in a project based sequence, just in the same way that the coalition said we should do it in relation to the risk of reversal. 


We said at the outset that we support the concept of storage of carbon in the landscape. As we have been reminded a number of times during this debate, it is our policy to do that. But, as has been indicated right through the process and in evidence that we heard in the Senate inquiry, this legislation has a whole heap of barriers in it affecting what the government says it wants to do. 


I come back to the point that I made in my first contribution this morning. The government says that it wants to protect agricultural land through this amendment, yet what it has done in Tasmania threatens 100,000 hectares of agricultural land—10 per cent of it—because it is pushing the forest out and the only place to situate the plantations that the NGOs, the government and the Greens say that the industry is going to transition to is onto agricultural land. There is no other place to go. We do not want to convert any more native forest to plantation. The conversion of native forest to plantation is one of the issues that underlies the negotiations that are happening in Tasmania right now. Why do we continue to apply those mistakes when we should have learned from them? The Prime Minister should have learned that she cannot go round telling people that prices will not go up by more than one per cent and she will send the ACCC round to tap on somebody's shoulder if that occurs. She just cannot do that. I have given one example. I can give you another one. I went to a powder-coating factory not far from where I operate. They run with gas and they run with electricity. They have done their calculations based on the fact that electricity is going up by 10 per cent and gas by nine per cent. What did they say to me when I asked them how much their prices would have to go up by? They said three per cent; that is their calculation. Are they going to have the ACCC pay them a visit, tap them on the shoulder and go through their books, wasting the time of the business in an investigation because the Prime Minister wants to use the ACCC as a political tool to help her sell her carbon tax? I do not think that that is reasonable or fair. That should not be part of the process.


I repeat that the coalition supports the concept of storing carbon in our landscape. We put up a number of suggestions as part of our report. But the government, being wagged along by the Greens tail, does not want to do any of that. We have this absurd table about how you have to have a high-security water licence, based on rainfall, to plant trees. It does not stack up. As I indicated in our report, tabled earlier in the year, it is a new concept and something that still remains contentious in the community. And yet it has been inserted—slipped—into some regulations, with some very basic principles, just averages, being applied to it.


If you do a calculation or a bit of modelling, then for 600 millimetres to 700 millimetres of rainfall you need a water entitlement of 0.9 megalitres per hectare per year. For 700 millimetres to 800 millimetres, you need 1.2 megalitres of water offset entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project. And we know that that varies. For 800 millimetres to 900 millimetres of long-term average rainfall, you need 1.5 megalitres of water offset entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project. For greater than 1,000 millimetres, you need 2.1 megalitres of high-security water entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project. CSIRO might have come with those averages. They have just plonked them in, but the best way to deal with this is on the basis of saying that this is a measure that needs to be dealt with as part of any individual plan. People should put it in their plans and then have that assessed as part of the approval process for the plan. That makes sense—just like the risk-of-reversal buffer. Those things can be managed.


The government wonders why we do not support the legislation. There are two really good reasons: one, it is very difficult for us to support the regulations in the form that they are in and, two, you are not prepared to consider any of the sensible suggestions that we have made as part of this process. You are more than happy to take on what the Greens tell you you have to but you will not constructively engage with the opposition.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:32):  I will briefly respond. The casual observer of this debate would be forgiven for not being able to recognise the fact that we have now spent the best part of three hours considering a government amendment that is agreed to by the opposition. The reality is that we are witnessing here a manful attempt by those opposite to filibuster this debate. Let me tell you for free, Senator Colbeck, that on filibustering points you are the winner. Your speech gave the greatest impression that you were trying to talk about the subject. You were not, of course, but to the casual observer your speech would have given the most effective appearance of at least trying.


Senator Colbeck, on the 30 seconds of content that appeared in your remarks and your questions in terms of long-term rainfall and those tables—while not relevant to the debate at hand—this is a matter that was obviously part of the consultation paper, the feedback process and the draft regulations. You know all of that. You have asked those questions and got those answers previously. While not relevant to the debate at hand, I will also make the comment that it is an issue that you have already taken up with the government and I am sure that you will continue to do so.


In terms of King Island and your forensic remarks about it, I look forward to the day when you go to King Island and explain how your direct action policy imposes a direct cost of $1,300 per household upon each of them. I will also watch with great interest how you explain to them how your $70 billion worth of budget cuts will impact on them and their community.




Senator Birmingham:
  This is not helping your cause.




Senator FEENEY:
  Senator Birmingham, I always welcome your advice. Our policy is that carbon emissions will be cut by five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020, a total of 160 million tonnes of carbon. Senator Joyce, you will note that a weight is ascribed to carbon emission abatement. The fascinating thing about this debate is that your policy is exactly the same. You too seek to reduce carbon emissions by that much by 2020; you too seek to abate some 160 million tonnes of carbon. I am always fascinated to see the threads of climate change scepticism weave their way through your speeches because you are trying to hide your fundamental dishonesty in this debate. On paper, you too are committed to combating climate change. You too are committed to reaching a realistic target by 2020. But in reality you are not. For you, this entire debate is about appealing to the sceptics and the science deniers and hiding from public view your own policy. I hope that you fail in that endeavour. To the extent that any of the previous speeches offered any questions—and they barely did—I think that I have adequately responded.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:36):  It is important to talk about an issue that pertains to prime agricultural land. I recognise that there is support on this issue, but the National Party went in to bat for the particular issue of the protection of prime agricultural land. Prime agricultural land, as you well know, is vitally important for our capacity as a nation to feed ourselves. On the hierarchy of needs, it is at the very top. Prime agricultural land is more important than mining, because we as a nation have a duty to feed not only our people but others throughout the world, especially as the global food task—which my good friend and colleague Senator Heffernan is always talking about—increases as population increases. We have to make sure that we have the capacity to utilise our prime agricultural land. When talking about prime agricultural land, which this amendment discusses, I think it is important to state that some misconceptions have been put out there, none better than a statement by the minister in Queensland, Ms Nolan, who has stated that farmers never had any rights over their land. That is totally and utterly factually incorrect. Certainly, the Crown had the right of prospecting on your land and, right back to Magna Carta, had the rights to gold and silver on your land. But it did not have the rights to the coal, oil or petroleum on your land as far as mining went. Those rights were taken over in Queensland in the 1915 act for petroleum and gas, for security of those rights in World War I. It is almost 100 years ago, but certainly not hundreds of years ago, and it is certainly not something that was there in perpetuity. In Victoria, as I am sure Senator Feeney is aware, it was the threat of World War II that led to security for that asset—they started pilfering it off the farmers at that point in time. Then, going all the way through to 1981, it was at that point in time that the adroit Neville Wran managed to pilfer the rest of the farmers' rights. So it is factually incorrect to say that the farmers did not actually have a property right. They did, but it was taken from them.


It is because they lack property rights that we now see the immense discrepancies and the absurdity that farmers get less than 0.75c for every $1,000 the mining company earns. I do not think that is a reflection of a fair bargaining position. I am certain that Senator Feeney and others on the other side have a clear understanding of how bargaining positions go for workers—when you are getting a fair deal and when you are not—and I imagine that there may therefore be some sympathy from over there for the fact that the farmers are not getting a fair deal.


Also, regarding the carbon sink legislation, if we lose our prime agricultural land to forests rather than mining it, is not going to be much use to us unless we intend to evolve to a higher form of termite! The idea that we will all somehow live happily ever after in an economic upland with forests kept in perpetuity rather than ones you can cut down is wrong. It will send the towns and their economies into privation. At the same time we will have absconded from our moral duty to feed other people. That is a duty we have. One might recognise that the rice industry in Australia has the capacity to feed up to 60 million people. That is quite substantial. It seems peculiar that in some of our legislation we might want to shut it down. Do we think it is not morally correct to feed people? Do we think there is something that presupposes that having scrub is more morally right than feeding people who are hungry? I think that the highest duty you have is to feed your people. I am sure my colleague Senator Brandis will agree with me on that one. No doubt he has come in here because he thinks I am an extremely loquacious speaker—




Senator Brandis:
  I think you are an extremely eloquent speaker, Senator Joyce, and an adornment to the Senate.




Senator JOYCE:
  Thank you. I have always thought so myself!


So on this issue the National Party does have an extremely strong interest. It was one of those times where the National Party crossed the floor—the lot of us, on carbon sink legislation.


Now there is an interesting thing we should talk about. We have the carbon tax legislation coming up. One of the greatest rights you have in this place as a represent­ative of the people, first and foremost—there is no mention of a political party in the Constitution; it is your representation of the people—is that if you believe something to be truly right you can vote on that accordingly. You have the right to walk from one section to another in this chamber and in the other place. It is a fundamental right that you should have. I believe strongly that, behind the rhetoric, there are people in the Australian Labor Party and maybe the Greens—or maybe not—who fundamentally do not believe in a carbon tax. It is wrong that in the year of our Lord 2011 we still have this kind of medieval approach of bullying people so that on key issues they cannot exercise their vote in the way they see fit. And this is a key issue; it is a big one. No-one can arrest you or assault you because of it. But it is wrong. We talk about the modern position with the internet the way it is and we talk about all the other liberties that people want and their view on them. We are allowed to discuss same-sex marriage but we are not allowed to discuss the liberty of being able to vote the way you want to on an issue. But you should be able to do that.


It is absurd that some person you have never in your life met and who was never elected to office can instigate a process of extracting you from this parliament by disendorsement or basically bullying you out of the joint. That is wrong. It should not be happening these days, and I think the Australian people are more and more becoming a wake-up to this. They will watch the carbon tax debate evolve and they will be asking their local representative to represent them first and foremost above and beyond allegiances to any other body. That is their right; it is what they should be entitled to do. Every person will be answerable for the way they vote, because it takes only one vote in the other place to stop the carbon tax. So any one of the people in the lower house actually has the balance of power. They have the capacity to make a major change for our nation. All they have to do is move the 10 feet or 10 metres from one side to the other. The right to take that walk should be absolutely ingrained. It should be your fundamental right.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Joyce, I think I have been fairly tolerant, but I do remind you of the question before the chair, which is an amendment to the legislation.




Senator JOYCE:
  I think I should reflect on your tolerance. You have been a very tolerant person. I understand.




Senator Feeney:
  You need to spend more time with him!




Senator JOYCE:
  We need to get to know one another better! But it is very important that on prime agricultural land we reflect the intention of what that is about. It is not all the land in Australia; it is merely a footprint of maybe three to four per cent of our nation. That leaves you 96 per cent to knock yourself out with. That prime agricultural land should be protected and the rights of the farmer should be protected. The capacity of Australia to feed itself and feed others is a moral obligation we hold. If we destroy primary agricultural land you cannot get it back in the future. God has not been around for the last couple of weeks. Whatever is there is all you are going to get, forever. There is no more. That is as good as it is going to get. Anyway, I think we should be considering that.

  We are dealing with government amendment (1).

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:31):  I spoke to government amendment (1) yesterday and indicated the coalition's support for it. It is, as I indicated at that time, similar or almost identical to an amendment the coalition was also proposing. This is an amendment strongly advocated by the National Farmers Federation that we have championed and that we are very pleased that the government has agreed to pick up and include. Our support for this amendment is clear and strong.


I equally highlighted yesterday that the government tabled this amendment back when the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 and related bills were being debated in the first week of July sittings, so the government's intention to make this amendment has been known for some time. The government, of course, has known that this amendment would pass, because it is the same amendment as the one the opposition was proposing. The govern­ment has known that the numbers were always here for this amendment to pass and therefore has known for quite a few weeks that this addition to clause 56 of the additional part (e), 'land access for agricultural production', as a consideration for the so-called negative list would pass and would become part of this bill.


Given that, I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, noting the draft regulations for the so-called negative list that he tabled in this place yesterday—and he did not have a chance to respond at that time—what steps the government has taken to ensure that this new section for the development of these regulations has been taken into account and how and where such protection of farmland, as proposed by this new part (e), is reflected in the draft regulations the minister has tabled. I would appreciate it if he were able to inform the Senate accordingly.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:34):  Clearly the obvious answer is that once the bill passes it will be able to be used as part of the positive list. The simple answer is that as soon as we can pass the bill—as soon as we can get the Carbon Farming Initiative up and running, out there in the public domain—then people can access the positive list, people can bring forward their methodologies and provide opportunities for sequestered carbon, and an income stream can be given to farmers.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:34):  These regulations, which were tabled yesterday, do set out the terms for the eligible offsets projects, the additionality test and the types of projects. Within that, they provide for what has become known as the negative list. However, the amendment we are considering is to clause 56—to the excluded offsets projects—and will add another term of reference as such for how we might consider what the negative risks or negative impacts of certain kinds of projects would be. As I see it, these draft regulations have been developed looking at the terms of clause 56(2) as it exists in this bill to date, with part (a) being the availability of water, (b) being the conservation of biodiversity, (c) being employment factors and (d) being the impact on the local community. Those four things are, to varying degrees, considered and captured in the draft regulations as to how excluded offsets projects would be taken into account. This part (e), of course, is not in the printed bill, but the government has known for a long period of time now that it would become part of the bill and, should the bill pass into law, become part of the act. So, whilst I understand the minister saying that it becomes a factor, in a sense, for the reverse consideration of eligible projects on the positive list, this of course is a section detailing the excluded projects and the process by which the negative list is constructed. So I again ask the minister: for the purposes of these regulations—which, presumably, your departmental officers have been working on throughout the last five weeks of the recess period; we presume that because we only got to see them yesterday morning—what consideration has been given in their development to this proposed new section (e) around land access for agricultural production? And, if you can point me to it in these draft regulations, how is that reflected in the draft that is before us? Because, frankly, I cannot see that any consideration has been given to date.

I am sure you can have an input into it as well, and maybe use your opportunity here more constructively.


This is about ensuring that we can consult with the community and include their views in the process. It is always open to view it as an additional criterion which will impact on matters listed, so it is an opportunity. We have already had 59 submissions on the discussion paper that strongly supported this position. The provision will be there, if we pass this—and the sooner we can get it passed, the sooner we can provide the landholders out there with an opportunity, and of course they can consult on the draft regulations.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (09:38):  Aside from the backhanded swipe at me and the process, I think the minister's answer there was: no, it is not reflected in the draft regulations, it is not something we have given any consideration to over the five weeks since we have known that we would be making this amendment to the bill, and so it is just not in here. But that is of course quite typical of the whole process as to how this legislation has been developed. The minister even came in here yesterday and proudly produced his draft regulations and sort of said, 'Okay, there you go: you've being saying you want these, you've being saying that because so much of the operation of this bill hinges on the regulations, we're now going to give you the regulations.' But what we find is that the regulations have not fully considered all that is going to be in the bill, that the regulations are still, in that sense, very much a draft rather than something that has been developed in tandem with the bill, in a manner such that the entire operation of this legislation can be seen in a transparent way.


It is just so typical of the ad hoc manner in which this government chooses to develop all of its policies, frankly, in this area. We have seen the many different policy disasters in the ways in which this government has attempted to go about emissions reductions or carbon abatement activities—many different policy disasters, all of them because things are so poorly thought through, so poorly structured, that the process applied by this government is just so very terrible with regard to all of these areas. And yet here we go again.


The reason that the opposition are subjecting this to close scrutiny, the reason we have called from day one to have all the complementary regulations that sit alongside this legislation in place, is that we do not want to see the same mistakes happen again. We do not want to see these types of errors happen again, because the implications of that with regard to this legislation are very serious. They are very serious to Australia's farm base, our agricultural productive base, and all of these issues should be thoroughly sorted and determined before we get to the point of finalising this legislation.


The government seems to be all too happy to continue to take an ad hoc approach to all of the different bills, policies and pieces of legislation it applies with regard to emissions reduction and carbon abatement. We have seen an ad hoc approach from the govern­ment on its alleged big-picture policy, its on-again off-again support for carbon taxes or an ETS. We have seen the government, as we have extensively debated—and will continue to extensively debate—run away from its crystal clear election commitments on not pricing carbon, on not having a tax on carbon. We have seen the government, when it has attempted to apply other policies, be they in the home insulation sphere, be they in the renewable energy sphere, create all sorts of conse­quences along the way.


If we look at the renewable energy target as a classic example, another major piece of legislation—a piece of legislation that attempts to provide a pathway for Australia to develop a stronger renewable energy sector in this country—what do we have from that at present? We have had a roller-coaster ride for the price of renewable energy certificates. We have a clearing house that is just dysfunctional and not working, because of course the clearing-house price is set way above the price that is in operation in the market for renewable energy certificates at present. As a result, many people who expected that the clearing-house price would be a floor price, not a ceiling price, as it is basically operating, are finding that their investments in this space are under enormous pressure. All of this is, of course, because the government cannot manage to get its sums right to start with, cannot manage to approach these policy areas having done all of the necessary work in advance and made sure that it all stacks up.


So, with this legislation, and the complementary regulations, we have genuine concerns that, if we simply sit back and allow the legislation to pass through as the government intends it to pass through, what are we going to have at the end of that? The risk is that we are going to still have too much of a blank cheque, too much of an open slather that depends on how these regulations are finalised. In this regard we have an amendment, an amendment that enjoys bipartisan support, an amendment that everybody agrees is very serious and an amendment that the minister himself concedes had widespread stakeholder support during their consultation process. It is an amendment that they chose to adopt nearly a couple of months ago and that we have supported all along to ensure that when projects are put on the negative list, so when excluded offsets projects are considered, that one of the adverse impact factors that is considered is whether there is a risk of an adverse impact on land access for agri­cultural production. We all support that but, of course, they are just words in the bill. How that applies under the bill that the government is putting forward depends entirely on the regulations: how they are developed and how they operate. So it is not at all unreasonable to expect, if the govern­ment is going to wander in here and present us with some draft regulations, that surely there should be some consideration in these draft regulations of how this clause operates, otherwise these draft regulations are simply and only a temporary holding pattern measure that will have to be replaced by not a new final version but by a further draft version at some later stage that actually takes this into account. Or is the government proposing to simply put this in the legislation but ignore it in the regulations? Is that what we are looking at here? Is this simply a case of putting an extra five words into the legislation but ignoring it when it comes to the regulations? Do the government think this is actually a tokenistic, meaningless amendment and is that why they have not bothered to consider it in their draft regs?


What is the status of this amendment for the government if they have been supporting it for so long? It is their amendment. They are the ones who have brought it before us. They knew they would enjoy our support all along. If they are serious about having this as a serious amendment to reflect the concerns of the NFF and others, why is it not reflected in any way in the regulations? The minister cannot draw our attention to anywhere where it is reflected, so why can't we manage to see proper, thoroughly drafted regulations that actually take into account this aspect as well? Yesterday I posed some other questions about these regs which the minister took on notice until we return to some amendments that Senator Xenophon has deferred for the time being. But in regard to this one there is a very simple issue of how the government, in its regulations, is going to enact this new clause that would see adverse impact on land access for agricultural production be one of the factors that could see a particular kind of project put on the negative list. How is that going to be reflected in these regulations? Minister, can you tell us what we should expect to see, what the high-jump bar will be and what in fact this clause will actually mean when it is applied to the regs that are so fundamental to the actual operation of this legislation?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (09:48):  I can see that the minister was resisting getting up and answering the very legitimate questions that were put by Senator Birmingham.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I thought you'd jumped up.




Senator CORMANN:
  Well, we were sitting back waiting for you to jump up and you seemed very reluctant to get yourself out of your chair, Minister.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I thought you'd jumped.




Senator CORMANN:
  I rise to endorse Senator Birmingham's comments. Senator Birmingham hit the nail on the head. This is a government that does not think things through. This is a government that has to pursue policy on the run because it does not think things through and it chops and changes, breaks promises and does not know what it is doing. This is a sensible amend­ment, but why is it an amendment? Why did the government not include this provision in the bill right upfront? Senator Birmingham very eloquently made the point that this is not a new issue as this is an issue that was raised by stakeholders all the way through. This government is so blinded by ideology, is so incompetent and is so incapable of actually properly considering the issues that are raised with it legitimately by stake­holders that on occasions it has to mop up. To give the government credit, at least here it is trying to mop up its mistakes and it is trying to sort something out given that clearly there is a major deficiency in the legislation as introduced by the government.


Of course, land access for agricultural production should be one of the criteria that are considered and Senator Birmingham is quite right to be suspicious of this govern­ment given that it is pursuing this policy on the run and so there is no detail in the regulations that have been put forward by the minister. Clearly, it still does not quite know how to deal with this. And this is not an isolated incident. This is not an isolated case. Again and again this government does not think things through, is driven by ideology and is cutting corners and, ultimately, is forced to chop and change and pursue policy on the run when the error of its ways become too obvious. If only the government were prepared to see the error of its ways in relation to the carbon tax, which is part of the broader policy agenda that the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 is part of.


We are here looking at the excluded offsets projects and what criteria should be considered in deciding whether to recommend to the Governor-General that regulations should be made to specify a particular kind of project 'that the minister must have regard to', as I am reading in the bill, and whether there is a significant risk that kind of project will have a significant adverse impact 'on one or more of the following'. One of the criteria to be part of the excluded offsets projects, according to this amendment, will be land access for agricultural production. But there was another process that the government went through in the context of the carbon tax whereby they made decisions on the run to exclude certain things—or so we were told. You might remember that there was a thing called the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Before the last election we were promised that there would be a citizens assembly with 150 people—which we all thought was the House of Representatives! But, no, the Prime Minister had a different view. The Prime Minister thought there was going to be a citizens assembly which was going to build a consensus around the nation on climate change. The Prime Minister was not going to pursue a price on carbon until and unless there was a consensus across the Australian community to put a price on carbon. Chair, I put it to you that this country is more divided than it ever has been. This Prime Minister is a divisive Prime Minister. The way this Prime Minister has pursued this process through this so-called Multi-Party Climate Change Committee has divided our nation. We have got the broken promise, the promise given five days before the last election, that there will be 'no carbon tax under the government I lead'. There was a promise that she would do what she could as the leader of this nation to build a community consensus. Of course, none of this has happened. What we have had though—and I am looking at it now—is a press release put out by one of the members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee on, the federal member for New England, Tony Windsor. I will quote from the press release that he put out on 10 July 2011. He said that fuel would be 'excluded from the carbon tax'. So there is another exclusion. There are a couple of other quotes that I think are quite worthwhile sharing with the chamber, such as:


The decision to exclude fuel from the carbon tax has been welcomed by the Independent member for New England, Tony Windsor. 


Further:


Several months ago I stated publicly that I wouldn't support a carbon tax if it allied applied to transport fuels.


And then: 


A price of $23 per tonne of carbon, if applied to fuel, would equate to a price rise of around 6 cents a litre. 


That is right. It is actually 6.21c a litre. And this is the absolutely critical one:


That's why I decided I wouldn't support a carbon tax if it applied to fuel.


The news flash is: the carbon tax does apply to fuel. And it does not only apply to fuel from 1 July 2014, the carbon tax will also apply to fuel from 1 July 2012. Don't take my word for it. That is the evidence that the Secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency put to the Senate Select Committee on the Scrutiny of New Taxes last Wednesday.


Again, it is worthwhile going through some of the Hansard record in relation to that. I asked the secretary: 


I would like to refer you to the exposure draft of the Fuel Tax Legislation Amendment (Clean Energy) Bill 2011—


which is another one of these bills that relates to the broader action on climate change agenda put forward by this government, in a very bad way in our view—


and specifically clause 43(8). This is a clause to impose a carbon price on fuel through a reduction in the fuel tax credit, correct? 



Mr Comley:  This is on page 5? 



CHAIR:  That is right. 


Then he said he had the bill in front of him, which is good.



CHAIR:  I am looking at the exposure draft, page 5, 43(8), 'working out the amount of carbon reduction'. This clause effectively imposes a carbon price on fuel through a reduction in the fuel tax credit, does it not? 



Mr 
Comley
:  That is correct. 


So the government is actually imposing a price on carbon, what we would call a carbon tax, from 1 July 2012 on fuel. When Mr Windsor in his press release on 10 July said that he has decided he would not support a carbon tax if it applied to fuel, the coalition calls on him to be true to his word, because there will be carbon tax on fuel from 1 July 2012. Who knows? This might be another occasion, as with this amendment that we are discussing now, where the government might make policy on the run and might decide that, yes, it did make a commitment to the member for New England to exclude the carbon tax on fuel. If that is so, then that particular provision is no doubt going to disappear from that legislation as well—the same way the government is adding an amendment here to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011. No doubt there will be an amendment to the carbon tax. I certainly, along with Senator Williams, who is on the scrutiny of new taxes committee, am very keen to see Tony Windsor, the member for New England, call on the government to amend its carbon tax legislation to ensure that all fuel is excluded, because he said he would not vote for it unless all fuel was excluded. So we will see whether that is happening.


Just to conclude the evidence that was quite relevant from Mr Comley, the Secretary of the Department Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I asked him:


Doesn't this mean that recipients of the fuel tax rebate are paying a carbon price from the word go by the wording of your own legislation?



Mr 
Comley:  It certainly means that they are having a reduction in their credit linked to the carbon price, yes.



CHAIR:

 From day 1, as of 1 July 2012 under your exposure draft?



Mr 
Comley:  Yes, that is correct.


So there are no ifs, no buts, no question marks: the government is planning to impose a carbon tax on fuel from 1 July 2012 and on all transport fuels from 1 July 2014. However much anybody wants to wriggle around it and say, 'By then the government will have lost the election and a new Abbott coalition government won't allow that to happen anyway,' the current government has $510 million in their forward estimates, courtesy of revenue to be collected from truckies around Australia.


The government's whole approach to climate change is a farce. It is a complete fraud. They are wanting to make people believe that they can actually do something about reducing global greenhouse gas emissions when they are not even trying. Before the government's most recent modelling came out, I actually thought that they would be able to reduce emissions domestically but I thought they were reducing emissions domestically in a way that would then increase emissions by more in other parts of the world. What has turned out to be the case is that they are not even trying to reduce emissions domestically. This government is not even in a position through their carbon tax, which will push up the cost of everything, which will make Australia less competitive internationally, which will cost jobs, which will hurt small business, to reduce emissions domestically, with emissions, according to the government's own figures, expected to go up from about 578 million tonnes of CO2 in 2009-10 to about 621 million tonnes of CO2 in 2020.


The government then says: 'You can't look at it that way. Emissions are going to go up, sure, but you have got to compare them to the business-as-usual scenario. They're going to be lower than what they would have been.' Okay. So, even though they are going up, you are saying they are going down because they are going to be lower than what they would have been. What about jobs? Jobs are going up but, hang on, jobs are going to be lower than they would have been. So, according to your logic, jobs are going down. If you say emissions are going down because they are lower than they would have been, then, if jobs are going to be lower than they would have been, presumably jobs are going down. But no, jobs are going up. So why are jobs going up? Because if you compare where we are today to where we are going to be in 2020, there are going to be more jobs in 2020 than there are in 2011. Sure, the population will continue to grow so it will be very sad if we did not have more people in employment in 2020. But, here you are, you have a government that wants to have it both ways.


It wants us to look at what the situation would have been in relation to emissions, but it wants us to compare where we start now and where we will be in 2020 in the job situation. The truth of the matter is that the carbon tax will cost jobs and it will put downward pressure on wages. It will result in lower real wages.


I talked about China yesterday and I did not quite get to the end of what I was trying to get across. Just in the last three years, Treasury's expectations as to what would happen—




Senator Milne:
  Mr Chair, I rise on point of order and refer to standing order 144(5):


In committee senators may speak more than once to the same question, and, when a question has been proposed from the chair, shall confine themselves to that question.


The question before the chair is the government's amendment. Unless Senator Cormann is referring to the Chinese buying up land in Australia and wants to take action on that, I cannot see how it is relevant to the government's amendment.




The CHAIRMAN:
  Thank you, Senator Milne. Senator Cormann, I draw your attention to the question before the chair and ask you to continue.




Senator CORMANN:
  Thank you, Chair. It is very much related because all of these measures are completely about Australia's efforts to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. They are about what we do in Australia in deciding whether or not land access for agricultural production is part of the criteria to pursue carbon farming initiatives under this legislation and whether these will have an impact on our contribution as part of the global community to try to address global greenhouse gas emissions. We have to put our efforts under this legislation, and under the carbon tax, into the context of what our trade partners and competitors in other parts of the world do. I draw your attention, Chair, to the fact that in China emissions will go up from about 10.3 billion tonnes now to about 17.9 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2020 according to the government's own Clean Energy Future modelling. That is an increase of 7.6 billion tonnes, which is more than 10 times the amount of annual emissions that we put out here in Australia.


The figure that really struck me was that back in 2008, when the government did this really comprehensive modelling on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Treasury thought that China by 2020 would put out 16.1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions. Just in the last three years, the government's expectations of how much CO2 emissions will be put out by China have gone up by 1.8 billion tonnes. Just the variation is more than three times as much as Australia puts out in a year.


Amendments like this one that we are talking about now are quite important, but we always have to put in context what our efforts here in Australia can do and put those into the context of what is happening currently in China. The government often talks about emissions intensity. I make the point very quickly in the short time that I have remaining: emissions intensity in Australia is lower than it is in China. It was 0.8 kilograms of CO2 per year per US$ of production in 2005 when it was 1.38 in China. In 2010 it was 0.66 in Australia and it was 1.06 in China. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (10:04):  As has been indicated by previous speakers on this motion, the coalition is proposing a very similar amendment in relation to the protection of agricultural land. I have to say I am quite confused as to where the government really sits on this matter. We have seen a decision made by government in the last fortnight which places enormous pressure on the availability of agricultural land in Tasmania from forestry.


When the Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania signed the intergovernmental agreement on forests in Tasmania, based on the statement of principles processes that have been negotiated between the forest industry and environmental groups over the last 12 months or so, one of the elements of that process was effectively to move the industry out of native forests—out of our forest estate—and into a plantation regime. That plantation regime does not exist at the moment and the calculation that has been made, and widely accepted as part of that process, is that you will need an extra 100,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania to replace the lost forests that are proposed to be locked up, or claimed for lockup, by the environmental groups.


I am trying to get a sense of consistency of policy from a government perspective. It does one thing under this initiative, and the coalition agrees with that. As Senator Birmingham has said, we had an amendment to the bill to do exactly the same things with slightly different wording but the same effect. But here we have the government making an agreement with the Tasmanian government that, if it is put into effect, is effectively going to take up to 10 per cent of Tasmania's prime agricultural land for forestry.


Where is the consistency in the approach that the government is taking in these matters? It says it wants to protect agricultural land, yet its actual policy actions, the decisions that it makes, are completely contrary to that. As I said, these plantations do not exist. There are some in the environmental movement who claim that we can just magically change the manage­ment regime in our existing plantations and suddenly make them usable for solid timber. That is patently absurd. I do not know whether they are just being mischievous, whether they do not understand forestry or whether they are just trying to push a barrow. I do not know the answer to that. Let us be charitable and say, 'They just don't understand it.' But those who do understand it have said quite clearly, 'The lockup of these Tasmanian forests will require up to 100,000 hectares of Tasmanian agricultural land if the industry is to have some form of equivalence.' Of course, we know that there are some who want to go further; they want to lock up all of Tasmania's agricultural land. 


If we are going to do that, we need to transition to a sawlog product that comes from a plantation base. We all understand that that will be required, but the reality is that that estate does not exist. The foundation research work for that has not been done. The species in Tasmania have not been properly identified. The methodologies are still being worked on. Some research is occurring but not enough has occurred yet. Where is the consistency in the government's policy? On the one hand they say, 'Yes, we would like to look after agricultural land; we would like to support prime agricultural land,' as they are saying through this amendment. The reality of what they are doing is the inverse. 


Through the intergovernmental agreement that the Prime Minister signed a week and a half ago, the government are in effect condemning 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land to plantation use. I really struggle to understand where the consistency is in all that. The minister has completely vacated the ground on this. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has taken over the negotiations in Tasmania, with the Prime Minister. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is playing no part in this that I can see, not visibly anyway. All of the work that is occurring is being done through the minister for the environment. Even then, there is no consistency. I would like to see consistent policy developed here.


For all the reasons colleagues discussed this morning, we all know that there is a strong basis for a managed regime in our native forests. It will provide for the long-term storage of carbon. If it is scaled at the right scale, it will have an absolutely negligible impact on our carbon stocks over time. And you need to recognise the carbon that is stored in solid timber products. I have referred before in this place to our magnificent surroundings here. The desk at the centre of this chamber is in fact a carbon sink. The carbon locked up in that stays there for the life of that product. I spoke to Gerry Harvey a couple of weeks ago and he had bought the propaganda peddled by some in the environmental movement that when you cut down a tree all its carbon expires to the atmosphere. He did not know that every piece of timber furniture that he sells is in fact a carbon sink. He has been put under enormous pressure from people in the environmental movement who are running a direct campaign against our forest industries—a dishonest campaign, I have to say—to not use native forests and to not use any native forest timbers out of Tasmania. That very campaign provides a direct threat to this amendment, to this legislation. 


A number of forest scientists that I have spoken to have confirmed that the require­ment is 100,000 hectares. We are talking about a lonely tree concept in this circum­stance. We are not talking about a plantation that might have 1,400 or 1,500 stems to the hectare; we are talking about a plantation in Tasmania that will have about 100 stems to the hectare so that you can get the right size over time. Those sorts of things will take up to 35 years to develop. Some in the environ­mental movement think that we can magic­ally transform from a native forest regime in three to five years. I am not sure what sort of management regime they are talking about. 


This direct action of the government is directly opposed to the intent of this particular government amendment. I would really like the minister to explain to me how that works. The coalition put up an amendment to do a very similar thing: to provide protection for prime agricultural land. There is enormous scope for putting native vegetation back into the landscape. The coalition have said that all along. We have supported the concept of enabling farmers to put vegetation back onto their farms, and, to a reasonable extent, without having a negative impact on their product­ivity. There is enormous capacity to do that. 


Through this government's actions, it is placing 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultur­al land at risk—and it is highly productive land—because it wants to appease its Green partners. It wants to stay in government both at a state level and at a federal level. So much of the policy that we are now seeing is being dictated by that arrangement and there is complete inconsistency in the govern­ment's approach. I would sincerely like the minister to explain that to me and explain how we are magically going to change the management regimes in forestry in Tasmania. I heard Dr Pullinger say on the radio last week that there are 300,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania and that we need to change the management regime of those so that we can use them for timber. That is just complete garbage. That is patently wrong. We have done tests on the plantation estate in Tasmania. They have been grown for fibre. A species called Eucalyptusnitens was put in the ground and those trees have largely been managed for the production of fibre for woodchips. That is a specific purpose and we know that there is a market for that. There is a proposal, which I know both the government and the coalition support, for the development of a pulp mill in Tasmania to utilise that resource. So we both have the same objective in respect of that. Dr Pullinger completely forgets that a large proportion of those 300,000 hectares is owned by the proponent of the pulp mill to go into the pulp mill. He does not tell that to the community when he says that we should just magically change our regime of forest management into a sawn timber process. But what do we find when we have do the scientific work and test that product? Can we use it for a sawn product? We find that it has a 35 to 40 per cent internal checking rate. That means that it is not commercially viable as a sawn timber product. It has not been managed for that and it is not suitable for that. So you just cannot switch over in three to five years, as some have suggested, to a plantation estate through some magical change in management practices.


When you are going to grow trees in a plantation estate for the purposes of solid timber you plan that process from before the time you start. You plan your regime, you plant your trees to that regime, you manage them to that regime and then, over the cycle, you will get the results. There is a lot of work to be done on that at the moment and yet here we have a government that is acting in a completely and utterly contradictory manner. It says that it wants to protect agricultural land through this amendment to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill but its real actions on the ground are doing exactly the opposite. I think that the government should be prepared to reconcile why it is doing that—although in the funding arrangement that the government has put together with the Tasmanian government there is absolutely nothing to encourage that shift to plantation, so I am not sure whether the government is just accepting that it will let the forest industry fall over in Tasmania. I am not sure if the government is accepting that or not. Where is this plantation resource going to come from and how is it going to be developed? If it is going to be developed it is going to take up to 100,000 hectares of agricultural land in Tasmania.


We have heard the government say a number of times, 'We are talking about developing evidence based policy.' My contention is that they are not even doing that. They say 'this is what we are going to do' but when they act they do something completely contradictory. We have heard a lot of times that you should watch what people do and not what they say, and here we have a government that have acted in a completely contradictory manner. They have devastated people in Tasmania with the concept that their fine timbers will be lost and that our craftspeople will lose access to the timbers. If you go to Salamanca market in Hobart on a Saturday morning there are stalls everywhere that use our fine Tasmanian timbers that come from our native forests. It is a huge tourist attraction. We are told that the tourist industry is going to be a substitute for our native forest sector, but here we are taking away a huge chunk of that. So the attitude of the government on this really needs to be considered very carefully.


As I have said, the coalition support the concept of protecting agricultural land, but we remain extremely concerned that the government are acting in an absolutely opposite fashion by threatening 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land. In conjunc­tion with the Greens, they want to lock away up to 572,000 hectares of our native forests which can be sustainably harvested and should be managed through a sustainable and properly scaled regime to produce those fine products. It will be very interesting to hear what the minister's response to that is.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:19):  I note that Senator Colbeck concluded his remarks with an invitation for the minister to respond—




Senator Ludwig:
  It was not relevant to the bill.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  If the minister felt that, he could have stood up and said that rather than simply quietly ignoring what Senator Colbeck had to say.




Senator Ludwig:
  Senator Colbeck should know it for himself. It is not my place to educate him.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, if you want your bills to pass smoothly through the parliament it is your place to educate us, I am sorry to say. That is part of the process. You bring the proposal here to the chamber—




Senator Ludwig:
  It is a Greens amendment.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  It is your amendment; it is a government amendment.




Senator Ludwig:
  And you agreed to it. In fact, you put the same amendment up.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Yes, except that you are now trying to tell me that it is a Greens amendment. It is certainly not a Greens amendment. When Senator Cormann took the call earlier, you suggested that you were going to respond to some of the issues that I had raised. I again invite you to respond to those, Minister—that is, how do you functionally and practically see this amendment operating in the regulations that you have put forward? The explanatory memorandum to the bill talks about how the excluded projects or the negative list system will work. It highlights the four original adverse impact areas. We are now planning to include a fifth, and that has been planned to be done for some time. Part 1.27 of the explanatory memorandum says:


These impacts may be in, or in the vicinity of, the project area, or any of the project areas, for that kind of project … The intention is that vicinity may be interpreted broadly, including water resource availability in associated catchments.


So how are 'vicinity' and 'adverse impact on land access for agricultural production' going to be defined? In the regulations we have been presented with some definitions for 'adverse impact on the availability of water', and there is a threshold level of 600 millilitres of annual rainfall and a whole lot of terms about how that operates and waivers and so on. They are all there for good debate, good analysis and good consideration by interested stakeholders. The question is, how will this new paragraph (e) in clause 56 of the bill, about land access for agricultural production, work? What will the thresholds for that be? How will that be defined in the regulations? Yes we think it should be done, but we want to have confidence that it is done well, that it is done right, that it is done effectively. If it is worth doing, it is worth making sure it is an effective amendment to the bill. 


Minister, can you explain for the record how you expect these regulations to reflect this amendment? What will the threshold considerations for land access for agricultural production be for inclusion on the negative list of projects or kinds of projects? What will be taken into account? What will be the tipping point? How can Senator Williams for his constituency or Senator Nash, who has raised these issues before, for her constituency know with confidence that this new paragraph is going to protect prime agricultural land and ensure that it is not subject to projects that would see it taken out of agricultural production?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:24):  I have waited because I just wanted to make sure that Senator Birmingham's filibustering attempts were exhausted as far as they could be before I responded to the two questions that he asked some hour ago, as I understand it. Everyone in the chamber agrees with this amendment. Why? It is a clarifying amendment. It is as simple as that. It makes plain the matters to be taken into account. Clearly, it is supported, and we should pass it as soon as possible. 


I will cover this first question in a little more detail so that Senator Birmingham does not get up for another 15 minutes and filibuster on an agreed amendment that he also has a proposal for. Because it is a clarifying amendment in relation to the substantive legislation, the regulations will not change. That is plain—it is plain from your side, it is plain from our side and it is plain from the Greens' perspective. He has made much of that but I suspect it is just a case of filibustering. Senator Birmingham knows the answer; I have provided it to him. The reason he put up the amendment, the reason we put up the amendment, was to clarify it. It is as simple as that and he knows it. 


The regulations are out there for consultation and community engagement. If Senator Birmingham wants to add his voice to that he certainly can, but I ask him to save some of his breath for the legislation currently before us. Some of the other speakers seem to have ranged quite widely outside the amendment. As the person responsible for the passage of the legislation, Senator Birmingham may have enjoyed listening to them and I am sure he may even have agreed with some of their filibustering attempts. Notwithstanding that, let us focus on the legislation and the amendment before us. By filibustering he is now preventing his own farming communities, his own supporters, from accessing the Carbon Farming Initiative. Let us look at the bigger picture. This is about ensuring that we do sequester carbon. I know he is fundamentally opposed to that but, notwithstanding that, he might be able to consider that some of those on his side do actually want this to pass so that farmers can sequester carbon and obtain an income stream.


In relation to Senator Birmingham's second question, the government is not saying through this amendment that there can be no revegetation. In many areas revegetation will have no or limited impact on land for agricultural production, as he well knows.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I cannot allow the minister's suggestion that we oppose carbon abatement to stand. The minister well knows that the coalition has long talked about—longer than the government, in fact—the great potential for soil carbon and for abatement through advances in soil carbon farming technologies. The minister well knows that they are issues that are being highlighted and that have stood consistently in the coalition's policy since it was released at the beginning of last year. They were also highlighted prior to that not just by our current leader but also by our former leader. Our consistency in supporting this concept is strong. Our consistency is shown in a policy document that has stood from the beginning of last year.


During that time the government has moved all over the place in relation to how it wants to tackle climate change issues. At the time we released our policy document outlining our support for the concept of soil carbon—this is like a trip down memory lane—Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister of this country, the government was arguing for an emissions trading scheme and we outlined an alternative way forward. As the weeks turned into months, at some stage Ms Gillard managed to roll Mr Rudd on the emissions trading scheme and knock that out, and so you no longer had a policy supporting an emissions trading scheme.




Senator Milne:
  On a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman: again, I draw the chair's attention to standing order 144(5). There is a question before the chair. It is the government's amendment agreed by the coalition and the Greens. I would ask that the current contributor confine himself to the question before the chair.




Senator Colbeck:
  On the point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman: Senator Birmingham is clearly being relevant to this debate. He is actually responding to a point made by the minister and is contributing to what is generally accepted, during the committee stage, as a wide-ranging debate. Senator Birmingham has been quite specific in responding to some points made by the minister. So I submit that there is no point of order.





The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  I draw Senator Birmingham's remarks back to the amendment before the chair.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:


Thank you, Chair. I think the arguments around consistency of approach and how these matters are handled are reasonable ones to be explored during these debates. In the end, the minister stood there and made a statement that the coalition did not support abatement through soil sequestration of carbon. I have been attempting to refute that claim, as is perfectly relevant within this debate. I have been attempting to refute that claim by highlighting that we have a consistent position of support. That position has stood the test of time, unlike the government which has flip-flopped on policy and leaders on this issue over the last year and, of course, has lied outright to the electorate over the carbon tax. Those outright lies and the flaws in the policies that the government adopted before are entirely relevant to the issues we are considering.


Let us look at the policies which the government took to the election. They took policies not for a carbon tax and not for an ETS; instead, they took policies for a cash-for-clunkers scheme and a citizen's assembly on climate change. Remember those two beauties? They were ideas of this government. Whatever happened to them? We worked out that the only citizen's assembly Ms Gillard needs is her weekly meeting with Senator Milne's leader, Senator Bob Brown, and we worked out that cash-for-clunkers was likely to be as disastrous a public policy as the home insulation scheme or the green loans scheme, both of which were other flawed policies in this area of climate change policy. So why is it that we are spending a long period debating this issue?




Senator Ludwig:
  Because you won't sit down!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  We are spending a long period debating it because everything else you touch you get wrong, Minister. Everything this government has touched in this space has just gone wrong. We want to make sure, so far as we possibly can, that what you do here, first principle, does no harm. That is a key part of the amendment before us.


The minister in his response described this as a clarifying amendment—I am sure the minister will correct me if I am misinterpreting him—and said that this amendment does not necessitate in and of itself any change to the regulations which were presented in draft form to the chamber yesterday; that adding a fifth area of consideration for what adverse impacts there could be does not change what the regulations outlining those adverse impacts may be. I find it quite remarkable that each of the five areas of consideration—the availability of water, the conservation of biodiversity, employment, the local community and land access for agricultural production—should be considered equal factors, that each of them would have equal relevance under law, that each of them would have equal relevance in the drafting of these regulations. If we are adding in a fifth area but the minister now says it has no bearing, relevance or interact on these regulations, I find that quite astounding. 


It seems to me that the government is utterly ignoring what would be the will of this chamber and the will of this parliament in inserting an extra criterion for consideration here. This list of excluded offsets projects is important because it is critical to the do no harm principle of this legislation. It is critical to making sure that in pursuing projects that allow for carbon abatement they do not negatively impact on the availability of water—the flow of our rivers, our watercourses, our groundwater supplies and all of those critical areas—that they do not negatively impact on the conservation of biodiversity and on maintaining critical wildlife corridors within our communities; that they do not negatively impact on employment prospects by closing down industries; that they do not negatively impact on local communities by causing harm to those communities, be it economic harm or social harm of some kind; and lastly, for the amendment we are debating now, that they do not negatively impact on land access for agricultural production, because we genuinely think that food security issues and Australia's agricultural output are vital and critical for the nation's future. They are things which should be taken into consideration. 


We see a burgeoning world population, a burgeoning middle class in the growing superpowers of China and India. They are leading to dramatically increased world demand for food production and food capability, and quite reasonably so. We think Australia should continue to play a key role in that. We think that this country, which has such a proud history of agricultural production and which has done so much not just to feed Australians but to feed parts of the rest of the world, should continue to do that. Nothing should stand in the way of that absolute imperative. 


Few issues generate the kind of public emotion, support and response as does the issue of food security and food production—and quite understandably so, because in the end the core, basic principles of life are that we as a species need food, water and shelter. Everything else you can debate, but food, water and shelter are the key ingredients. This country has not just an opportunity but a responsibility to make sure that we are at the absolute forefront of the production of food into the future.


That is why this amendment is so critical and that is why this amendment should be more than tokenistic. It should be more than a clarification; it should mean something. Seeing that this clause of the bill is entirely about setting up a framework by which regulations for the creation of the negative list are drafted, it is perfectly reasonable to expect that, if you were inserting a fifth criterion—a serious fifth criterion, not a meaningless one—relating to agricultural production, it would have some bearing on what is in the regulations. It would be reasonable to expect that it would impact on the regulations and that there would be some level of protection in those regulations for land access for agricultural production. 


If the minister says that it is a clarification and that it does not create the need for any further amendment to these regulations, I would invite the minister to show the chamber and to demonstrate to the Australian people how it is—in these regulations or elsewhere in this bill—that there is protection for those key areas of agricultural production. How and where do we find that protection? Where, in black and white, do we find it in the regulations or in the bill? We are putting this statement in here and it is meant to provide that protection, but what areas of Australia's farm production base will actually be excluded? What areas will be protected? Show us, tell us and give some reassurance to those who come back and look at the Hansard records of these debates. Give some reassurance that this is not just a meaningless amendment, that it addresses the concerns of many people—many of my colleagues and many of the farmers groups who want to do the right thing wherever possible. Those farmers groups want to increase the carbon content of soils because they know that that will provide, potentially, not just global benefits but practical benefits for the farmers themselves through enhanced water retention in their soils and therefore enhanced production capabilities.


There is an opportunity there for them, but what is in this amendment to make sure that those farming areas, particularly those of high value, are clearly protected from being taken out of agricultural production? What is in this amendment to ensure that we do not see the loss of the potential to fulfil our responsibility, and to take our opportunity, to be and continue to be a part of feeding the growing demands of the world? 


How, Minister, are you going to effect this amendment in the regulations? How is the intent of this amendment effected in the existing regulations or elsewhere in the bill? If it is just a clarification, show us, demonstrate to us, that it is, in fact, just a clarification by showing us that the concerns which have led to this amendment being put forward have already been addressed elsewhere. Show us where that is the case.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:42):  I will start by addressing your first question, which was put some 15 minutes ago when you first started. As an aside, I know that you are struggling in your filibuster to remain focused on the amendment. Notwithstanding that, why I come to the conclusion that you oppose any action on climate change is clear. You have no department, no legislation and no rigour around the model you propose. Plus, if you look at your direct action policy, you do not have any rigour around that either, nor do you have protections for agricultural land.




Senator Milne:
  No regulatory body; no negative list.




Senator LUDWIG:
  You have nothing—thank you, Senator Milne. All of that is why I come to the conclusion that you oppose any action on climate change. It highlights that all you are now doing is filibustering the legislation.


I go now to the only question you have asked all morning, which I have answered three times now, just to make sure that it is plain to you. This is an amendment everyone agrees to. It provides in clause 56 those matters, those criteria, that can be taken into account. That is, clearly, the protection that is provided. That is why you proposed it, that is why you agreed to it and that is why we also concede that it is reasonable to include it. It provides the list of matters for the case where, as the bill reads:


In deciding whether to recommend to the Governor-General that regulations should be made for the purposes of subsection (1) specifying a particular kind of project, the Minister must have regard to whether there is a significant risk—


that will now read 'material risk'—


that that kind of project will have a significant adverse impact on one or more of the following: …


And that list will now include the item we are now debating.


In addition to all of that, what you fail to appreciate—or maybe you do—is that you are now focusing on excluded offset projects. If this bill eventually passes—I would hope today, although that seems to be skating away—it will mean that we will have positive lists. In other words, we can focus on the positives rather than the negatives. You have remained focused on the negatives not the positives. I understand why you continue to the focus on the negatives. You do not want this bill to pass. You do not agree that this bill will provide the types of benefits to landholders and the farming community that they can participate in. You want your direct action policy to win so that you can share the confetti that it might have, but it does nothing for the environment, it does nothing to reduce carbon pollution, it does nothing with any rigour, and with no department it cannot have much legislative support.


I will not take up the whole 15 minutes, as this is an important amendment. We agree to it and it should pass. It would be in the best interests of all of us that we do not filibuster. You have been filibustering all morning on this. We have ranged quite widely in this debate, which has been an opportunity for you to get it all off your chest, so now let's get on with it.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:45):  Minister, I would appreciate your advice on a question I have. You will be aware that the northern beef industry was a very important part of Australia's agricultural activities. It provided food for Australians but, perhaps more importantly, also for our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, a country of 200 million-plus people who live closer to me than I do to Canberra or Melbourne. Indonesia is a very important neighbour of ours and one which we have assisted over many, many years. Part of that assistance has been to provide Indonesians with the protein that red meat provides and that was through, of course, exporting live cattle from Australia to Indonesia and then having those cattle slaughtered in Indonesia, in many cases by smaller abattoirs because of the lack of refrigeration in Indonesia. I say this by way of preamble to my question.


The minister would be aware that his decision in, first of all, banning from export those abattoirs that had a proven cruel record was appropriate, and the northern beef industry would have coped with that. By way of background, I simply relate that the minister was then spooked by the left wing of his party, by the Greens, by GetUp! and by all those other fringe groups who have little interest in Australia but who have a lot of interest in maintaining the Labor-Greens alliance in the federal parliament. The minister, completely spooked by those people and by the left wing of his own party, changed his decision overnight and invoked a total ban.


The biggest impact on the beef industry, which of course was the main supplier to the Indonesian protein market, was in Northern Australia. Clearly they are people whom I have a lot of association with and I try to help them as much as I can in a wide range of areas. My office and the office of any other politician in Northern Australia, state or federal, has been overwhelmed by the response from family farmers in the north whose livelihoods and indeed, in some cases, lives have been shattered by yet another stupid decision of the Gillard government.


My question in relation to this bill before us is this, Minister: is the Carbon Farming Initiative and this amendment likely in some way to benefit the northern beef industry that is now struggling to maintain its presence? The minister will be aware—




Senator Milne:
  The answer is 'yes' because you are supporting the amendment. You are actually supporting it.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am asking—




Senator Milne:
  So, why are you asking the question?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you.




Senator Milne:
  You are supporting this amendment.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Senator. I have some particular interest in this issue. The minister is putting—



Senator Milne interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I know you are not interested, Senator Milne. You want to stop cattle—in fact, you want to stop people eating red meat in Australia, continuously.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Senator Macdonald, could you address the senator through the chair, and I ask you to draw your remarks back to the amendment before the chamber.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman, your protection against these outrageous interjections, these attacks on me, these unparliamentary interjections would be appreciated. In that way I will not be distracted in responding to those unparliamentary interjections by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens. Suffice it to say, I am well aware that the Greens would like to stop all red meat eating in Australia and shut down the beef cattle industry in its entirety.


Minister, back to the question I was asking you. Senator Milne rightly points out that we are supporting the amendment in principle but, Minister, could you explain to me how northern beef producers might be able to take advantage of this amendment and, indeed, this whole bill? The northern beef producers are absolutely decimated by your government's decision. The minister will be aware of course that many of the beef cattle producers in Northern Australia are indeed Indigenous cattle producers. They, like every other cattle producer, will be struggling to make ends meet. I am just hoping that the minister can assure me that there is something in this bill and in this amendment which will allow some small relief to the northern beef cattle industry that the minister almost single-handedly destroyed. Minister, I give you the opportunity, of course, to redeem your decision that has just about, as I say, destroyed the northern beef cattle industry. Perhaps your response could give some hope to the northern beef cattle industry that there is something in this bill and its amendments that will enable industry players in the north to get some assistance. The best assistance the minister could give would be to say that the whole carbon tax policy was off the table. You recall, Mr Chairman, that just a year ago the leader of the Labor Party—the current Prime Minister—promised hand on heart that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led and here we are one year later dealing with legislation surrounding the introduction of the tax she promised would never be introduced in a government she led. She was not on her own, of course. We all know that the Treasurer, Mr Swan, was equally vociferous in assuring Australians that if they voted for the Labor Party—




Senator Birmingham:
  They were hysterical allegations.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Absolutely. He accused Tony Abbott of making hysterical allegations when Tony Abbott said, 'As sure as night follows day, the Greens-Labor alliance will introduce a carbon tax.' Wayne Swan was out there assuring everybody that Mr Abbott was simply being hysterical, but we know one year later that the promises of Ms Gillard and Mr Swan mean nothing. One wonders about the promises that the minister, on behalf of Ms Gillard, is making in this bill and the promises he is making on regulations under this bill. Will they be kept or will they suffer the same fate as the promise of Ms Gillard that, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'?


What can you believe of anything the minister tells us? He is telling us what might be in the regulations; he is making certain commitments and promises. We have done that before. We as the Australian public actually believed Ms Gillard and Mr Swan a year ago when they said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We have now worked out to Australia's absolute detriment that you simply cannot believe anything a government led by Ms Gillard says. I guess all of these debates are a little academic. We have the history of the Labor-Greens alliance. We know the leader, Ms Gillard, will promise you something to get a personal and political advantage and, as soon as it suits her, she will completely renege on that solemn promise.


Minister, your decision on the live cattle trade was about as well thought through as the carbon tax proposal. Perhaps that is not right. Perhaps you did give a bit more thought to the carbon tax proposal because you desperately need money from any source and this is one way you can get it. I guess you did give a bit of thought to how you could get more money into the coffers to make up for Labor's profligate, wasteful spending on a range of projects. The decision you made on the live cattle exports was made obviously without thought. Once you gave it a bit of thought you realised the huge mistake you had made. You have tried to ameliorate that. 


I hear that the first shipment of live cattle is either on the way or being prepared for export to Indonesia now, but it is only a fraction of what was a very prominent industry that kept many beef producers, many Indigenous families and communities in productive, full-time work in the north, which you have almost destroyed with that ill-thought-through decision. In the context of this bill and this amendment, I am wondering whether there is some message of hope that you can give the northern beef cattle industry for something they might be able to gain from this to help them through the awful financial, business and personal situation many of them find themselves in at this time.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:57):  In answer to the direct question, if you go back to the second reading speech, this bill is committed to action on climate change and the need to reduce our carbon pollution. What it does is unlock the abatement opportunities in the land sector and provide farmers, foresters, growers and landholders access to carbon markets. In doing so, it will begin to unlock the abatement opportunities in the land sector which currently makes up about 23 per cent of Australia's emissions.


That means that the Carbon Farming Initiative will create incentives to do two crucial things: protect our natural environment and adopt more sustainable farming practices as well as the benefit of mitigating climate change. So it does provide an income stream. All of these important co-benefits mean that the sooner we pass this legislation the sooner we ensure that landholders can have access to it and participate in carbon markets and establish income streams and lock up carbon through soil sequestration, through biochar—through all of the types of opportunities that are provided on the positive list—and develop more opportunities on the positive list. They are all what this bill is about in giving landholders in the agricultural sector a mechanism that values their contribution.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (10:58):  I note that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry indicated that the issues I spoke of in my previous contribution were not relevant. I have to say I completely disagree with that. We are specifically talking about protection of agricultural land, yet the direct actions of the government—they are not indirect by any sense of the imagination—put at threat 100,000 hectares of Tasmania's agricultural land. So 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land is directly put at threat by the Prime Minister and the Tasmanian Premier agreeing to lock up to 572,000 hectares of Tasmania's native forests. It was something that was discussed during the statement of principles process, and it goes directly to the government's credibility in the discussion of this piece of legislation—the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011. The government says it is looking, through its amendment (1), to protect agricultural land, yet its direct action—what it really does on the ground—indicates that it is not. Under what circumstance can anyone have any real confidence in what the government says it intends to do when its direct action—its real activity—actually indicates the opposite?


Minister Ludwig is correct that we both have the same aspirations in what we are proposing here, but it would have been nice if the minister had been prepared to actually address the issue of the direct threat to 10 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land rather than just passing it off as completely irrelevant—because it is not. We know he has vacated the field completely to the environment minister in the forestry negotiations in Tasmania. He is no longer a part of it; he has been pushed aside. That is disappointing, because I think he might be prepared to stand up a bit more for the forestry industry than is the environment minister—who, amusingly, is a former forestry minister. It would be very nice if the minister were to address the reality of what is occurring in Tasmania and the direct impact on Tasmania's agricultural land.


I want to put a few more details on the record in relation to what has been proposed by the environmental groups and the discussion they are trying to pass off as a simple way to deal with this, saying: 'We're not really threatening agricultural land. You can use the existing plantation estate to take up the lockup of these forests'—the disgraceful lockup of these forests. As I said before, there are about 300,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania. About 216,000 hectares of the 300,000 are actually in private hands. So here we have the ENGOs out there happily talking about property that is not even in government hands; it is held by private individuals. As I have said, a lot of that is actually owned by the proponent of the proposed pulp mill in Tasmania, and it has been grown specifically for that purpose. You cannot just magically waltz off and say, 'We can put that into a first-class timber supply.' That is absolutely, patently absurd. Yet that is what the ENGOs are implying in their discussion.


It is no wonder that there was huge frustration even from Mr Kelty, in his negotiations with the activities of the ENGOs throughout this process. The ENGOs have been quite disingenuous, saying one thing inside the negotiations and another thing outside the negotiations. Mr Pullinger, in particular, got to the stage where his credibility in this whole process was quite suspect, quite frankly. In fact, I think he has even deceived some of his own people in what he was agreeing to in the negotiations versus what he was telling them outside.


I will just take this a little bit further. We have 216,000 hectares of Tasmania's 300,000 hectares of plantation in private ownership. They do not belong to the ENGOs. They are not public property to be negotiated as part of this agreement. As I said, they have been grown for something else. There are 32,700 hectares in private ownership, and they are there for a number of reasons. Some of it is pine plantation, and that obviously has a specific market, but you are not going to get magnificent native forest veneer out of a pine plantation—it is absurd to suggest that you can transition in three to five years out of native forest into, say, a pine plantation. You certainly cannot transition into a eucalypt plantation, which has a life cycle design of about 12 to 13 years. You certainly are not going to get a long-life veneer out of that.


The government's policy, through this amendment, is to protect agricultural land, yet the action resulting from the govern­ment's decision in Tasmania is to push forestry out onto agricultural land. In fact, we are seeing it more broadly than that. I was in Orbost last week talking to the forest sector down there, and they are being slowly squeezed out of the forests by the Greens and the environmental groups, in conjunction with the Labor Party. They are a bit more encouraged, with the change of government in Victoria, that that might slow down a little bit, but you see this squeezing out of native forests and into plantations, and there is only one place to plant that: it has to be on agricultural land. We do not like to see conversion of native forests to plantation anymore. I support that process. Let us regrow native forest as native forest and have a long-term rotation, which the forest scientists tell me is the best way to store carbon, the best way to look after water quality and the best way to look after biodiversity.


All the values that the ENGOs and the Greens claim they want to achieve are best achieved by a long-term rotation regime in a native forest. Yet here we have a government decision that is directly threatening that, pushing agriculture out of the way and pushing us into a plantation regime. There is only one place for that to go. Whether it is in Tasmania or in any other state, it has to be pushed out onto agricultural land. As I said, we do not like to see conversion of native forests to plantations. We have seen that in Tasmania, and I am happy to admit that from my perspective that was one of the mistakes we did make in Tasmania in relation to our forestry practices: the large-scale conversion of native forests to plantations. We actually have a plantation estate there now and, as I have said, two-thirds of it is in private hands. But, I have to say well-managed, sustainable long-term rotation of a native forest regime—properly utilising all the product streams that come out of that—is the best way to manage this, not pushing our forest sector out onto our agricultural land. We see the government consistently making decisions that do not support what it says it is doing in this particular circumstance. It did exactly the same thing with its prohibition on utilising biomass for renewable energy. It was a completely ridiculous decision that was driven by the Greens. There is no other explanation for that. It is driven by the Greens; it is Greens policy. Senator Milne asked one of the ministers at question time yesterday a question about the life cycle of coal seam gas versus coal. She asked for a life cycle comparison. I will give her the life cycle comparison of utilising biomass from native forest waste to coal. It is 4 per cent. So how do you reduce your carbon emissions in energy generation by 96 per cent? You utilise biomass. In Australia, we could generate 8,000 gigawatts of energy from native forest biomass waste without touching another twig or tree.


Think about the carbon emissions that will reduce. The government bangs on about wanting to have a comprehensive carbon reduction scheme and process. If we recognise biomass we can reduce the life cycle emissions over coal by 96 per cent, but because of ideology we cannot do that. The government is not prepared to stand up and say: here is a way that we can do that. You can do it cheaper than wind. It is a low-cost technology compared with, say, wind. It can be done at the regional level. It can be appropriately scaled. I am prepared to accept that in some places we have let the wrong drivers get into our forestry systems. Woodchips did that for a period of time in Tasmania, and that has now obviously changed with some changes in the markets. But a properly scaled biomass industry, set up on a regional basis and with access to the grid, could provide a well-costed, low-carbon-emission energy source which could be quite cost competitive. Yet, because of ideology, because the Greens tail is wagging the Labor dog, we cannot go down that track, so we miss out on the opportunity to produce up to 8,000 gigawatt hours of energy from wood waste that lies on the forest floor, which quite often gets burnt in regeneration burns, which of course the Greens then come out and complain about, saying that we are putting all this particulate matter into the atmosphere. We could actually put that into a biomass plant and generate renewable energy and reduce the emissions from coal in comparison by 96 per cent. Yet ideology drives us away from that.


So all these things we could have if the government were prepared to make sensible and consistent decisions. All we are asking for is a consistent decision-making regime. The government have an amendment on the table that says, 'Look after agricultural land,' yet their decision-making processes, with the forestry agreement in Tasmania and the exclusion of biomass, act in an opposing manner to the intent of this amendment.


We have stated that we have a similar amendment on the Notice Paper. We support the protection of agricultural land. Because of the government's actions in concert with those of the Greens, the Greens tail wagging happily away when they get their way, running the Labor dog, we cannot get sensible decisions out of the government. We would be more than happy to work with the government in relation to these things if the government were prepared to make sensible decisions, not say they are going to do one thing and do something else, which is what we see time and time again. We saw it with the forest agreement and with the biomass in Tasmania.


We see attempts to make claims about the plantation estate in Tasmania that just do not stack up. ENGOs are getting on the radio, telling the community that there are 300,000 hectares of plantation estate in Tasmania that will be available to transition into in three to five years. They are privately owned and they have not been planted and managed for that purpose, yet the government makes a decision at the behest of the Greens at the state level—Nick McKim, running for Premier in Tasmania. And in the federal parliament we have the Greens running the Labor agenda. They are not prepared to stick up for the industry and not prepared to take the actions that we support, which is to provide that level of protection for agricultural land.


I will be very interested to hear the minister's response to that. It is disappointing that he has been pushed aside as part of this process, as I said before. I would much prefer to have him driving this than the minister for the environment. He was a complete failure as agriculture and forestry minister in the previous government. I have much higher hopes for the current minister, and having spoken to him a couple of times I know that he has a sense of feeling towards the forestry sector. But it would be really nice if the government in its actions were prepared to demonstrate that.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:13):  Just to reiterate, we are dealing with an agreed amendment under the Carbon Farming Initiative. I know that, for those following this debate, we have certainly ranged quite widely. The reason for that is that the opposition do not agree with this legislation and they are using every opportunity to filibuster. Filibustering is the course that oppositions can occasionally take to delay the passage of legislation. It is unfortunate that they are doing it in such a poor way. Sometimes, though, they do it in a much more entertaining way, one which is perhaps even more relevant to the actual amendment that is currently before the chamber. Unfortunately, here they are not.


Can I say again that, broadly, in combina­tion with measures announced in the govern­ment's Clean Energy Future plan, the CFI is likely to improve the productivity and sustainability of Australian agriculture. The Carbon Farming Initiative projects will be most cost effective where they enhance agricultural productivity and deliver environ­mental co-benefits, such as reducing erosion and salinity or protecting biodiversity. The Carbon Farming Initiative is unlikely to promote what the opposition are now effectively trying to hold onto as their last, single thread of opposition to this bill, which is the conversion of agricultural land to other uses. In all but the most marginal of farming areas it will not be cost effective to undertake revegetation of productive agricultural land, unlike their own policy of direct action where—with no department, no rigour and no modelling—direct action could, in fact, have adverse impacts. It is are far better opportunity for the opposition to agree to the Carbon Farming Initiative, pass the legislation and ensure that farming communities can benefit from what is environmentally and sustain­ably productive while getting the co-benefits of reducing erosion and salinity and protect­ing biodiversity and getting the co-benefit of an income stream.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (11:15):  There are a couple of questions that I would like to ask in relation to the draft regulations tabled yesterday. They relate to issues around water and water interception. I am genuinely interested in knowing what the baselines for those calculations might be. There is a table on page 6 that talks about the level of interception, long-term average rainfall and the volume of water offsets that have been claimed as part of that. But in relation to what the interceptions might be, in respect of the baselines for calculation of those given the general character of the landscape that they are in, in many circumstances revegetating—and I use that term quite deliberately—the local landscape is actually taking that landscape back to what it might have been before it was cleared. I use a very personal example of the farm that my parents farmed on, which was all forested land. I think there were four or five sawmills in the valley in the early 1900s when that land was cleared. Obviously, that has a material impact on the water flows and the water tables in those areas, so when you take forest cover away the natural impact of the native forest there is changed. It is obviously considerably changed in the development of the agricultural land. If you actually regenerate that country—and a lot of that is now about growing trees, although not in a native forest format unfortunately—you are actually taking that back much more closely to what it was like before. So I am interested in the justification of saying that you have to have that high-security water title, that water right, to that land, because this is a very new concept and it is not something that we have seen in any format that I have come across before. So the concept of saying that we now need to have a water licence to put trees back into the landscape is a new concept and I am interested to see how that might perhaps bleed off into some other areas. I am very interested to know what the government's baselines for these are, whether they are as to what was the natural state or whether they are as to what is now the altered state, and how those calculations have been determined.

It is also out for consultation. There has been a significant use of water over the longer period but we need to start looking at what that provides proponents who hold water access entitlements. That, as it reads, 'provides high security for at least the volume of water likely to be intercepted by the forest annually, calculated in accordance with table 1' and averaged across the life of the project. It 'is only used to offset the water intercepted by the forest'. The table is based on the research that is available and developed in consultation. As I said earlier, after some two hours or more dealing with this one agreed amendment, we have got the regulations out for consultation and industry stakeholders can provide valuable input into all that.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (11:19):  I think the minister is genuinely trying to provide some advice in respect of that. I am genuinely interested in this and I am getting a good sense of the bases and the baselines for these. As I said, it is a new concept and it does have the capacity to be a precedent for other land uses. So in that context alone it is important that we make sure that this is put together properly. It actually does vindicate the opposition's concern at the time that this bill was first tabled when we said we wanted to see the final passing of this legislation deferred until after we had the capacity, as an opposition and as a parliament, to actively consider these regulations. There was some indicative work provided to us, I accept, but that was not until the day we reported on the legislation, which significantly inhibited our capacity to deal with it. Now here we are, with the government pushing to try to get the legislation finalised, receiving draft regulations and there are some very important concepts contained in these. This, as I have said, is something that I have not seen before in any legislation where someone wanting to have an agricultural land use is required, just to undertake that agricultural land use, to have a high-quality water entitlement. I think it is important to know what the baselines are for this. I understand that the water uptake by a forest plantation varies significantly over its life. It is very, very low in the early stages, obviously, when there is less density in the forest. It ramps up as the forest grows and then it evens off as the forest matures. I would like to know the basis for the calculation—whether it is an average across the life cycle of a forest. How are these figures calculated?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:22):  As I indicated earlier, while revegetation may be taking the landscape back to its natural state, high-security water licences are required because other land uses, such as agriculture, also need water. It will use more water than was the case before human settlement. It is one of those areas where the CSIRO has put together a table. It provides a range whereby you can see a long-term average annual rainfall. It is only used to provide the high security for at least the volume of water likely to be intercepted by the forest annually. It is calculated in accordance with table 1. It provides a calculation. The object is to get to a point where we can use table 1 in a meaningful way. In using it in a meaningful way, it is of course open for consultation. If stakeholders disagree with the long-term average annual rainfall volumes of water offset entitlements required per hectare over the life of a plantation forest then they are entitled to have input into that process.


While dealing with the baseline, we have also dealt with the overall table itself. I think I have sufficiently answered questions for this area. It is again outside the amendment which we are currently dealing with. I am happy to provide answers to it, but we are still dealing with filibustering from those opposite. I know they do not want to pass this legislation. I am happy to answer questions about it and to provide clarity in relation to it. I am sure the community at large, with its 59 submissions, has been able to provide input. The regulations are out for further comment. All of that means that this area will be beneficial to farmers and to the environment the sooner we pass it and put the framework in place.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:25):  Thank you, Madam Chair. It is a delight to see you in the chair. Congratulations on your ascendancy to that office. I do note that the minister has drawn to our attention that we have been debating this amendment for some time, and I acknowledge that—




Senator Ludwig:
  You haven't been debating the amendment. You've been talking about a whole range of things.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Minister, I think you will find that my contributions have often come to the point of the amendment with great—




Senator Ludwig:
  Your nose is growing. 




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  You do not want to invite me to take that one, do you? You do not want me to take 'the nose is growing' interjection, because that will only lead to discussing one thing in this place at present. If you want to talk about great big liars in this place, we all know where that leads to. It leads of course to talking about the Prime Minister and yesterday's anniversary of her great big lie to the Australian people. 




Senator Ludwig:
  You should not use the Pinocchio defence.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Well, I am not sure what defence the Prime Minister has at her disposal in relation to the lies that she told in campaigning to the people at the last election, particularly on the carbon tax. This amendment is one that, as you have rightly highlighted, we all support. I am disappointed, Minister, that you have attempted in this debate to downplay the significance or the import of this amendment. You have essentially cast it aside to the extent that the amendment is little more than a point of clarification rather than an amendment that should be treated with a semblance of seriousness and that should be recognised as an important issue in how this legislation will ultimately operate. This does not change the opposition's support for the amendment.


Obviously, we will engage with stakeholders, as we trust the government will, about the regulations that pertain to section 56. We will make those engagements as constructive as possible. If stakeholders have concerns that the regulations do not fit or adhere to the amended section 56 and the inclusion of this criteria around the availability of land for agricultural product­ion, then I guess we will be back here at some stage debating the regulations in a disallowance motion. Hopefully, it will not come to that. Hopefully, the government can refine these regulations into something that adheres to not just parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 56 but also part (e), which is around land access for agricultural production.


Whilst the minister at the table, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, should have a particular vested interest in the amendment before us, the operation of this bill or act, if it is passed, will be with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I urge that minister to make sure that, as the regulations are finalised, serious consideration is given to whether they are adhered to and that if stakeholders, in particular the farming groups, have continuing concerns about the possible impact of this bill on land for agricultural production then those concerns are heeded so that we get a win-win outcome, so that we get the outcome where farmers actively participate in a market, in an environment, to sequester carbon in their soil and, in doing so, we have the potential benefits of increased water retention, of increased productivity on their land and of the potential for Australia to grow its food production but at the same time we get the other win of certainty that those farmlands will be protected, that we will have agricultural production on all of our potential prime farmlands and that there will not be any adverse outcomes or consequences to that under this bill.


That is what I hope will happen as these regulations are finalised. Notwithstanding what the minister at the table has had to say in downplaying the significance of this amendment, I hope most sincerely that the government will take this amendment with all seriousness and will ensure that it is complied with and reflected in the regulations, not just to the letter of the amendment but to its spirit. Should the stakeholder groups, and farm groups in particular, have concerns about the application of this clause in these regulations in constructing the negative list of activities, I hope that is reflected seriously and those concerns are picked up in these regulations.


Minister Ludwig, obviously you are not going to give any greater comfort at present that we can expect to see anything stronger in the regulations. Obviously, you are not going to give us any greater detail as to how this amendment may operate in the regulations. After some period of debate, I have come to accept that. I have heard your answers; I understand the points that you have made. I am disappointed, but I certainly hope that the minister who will have responsibility for the operation of this law, if passed, will have a different attitude about the significance of this amendment. The opposition certainly does. I hope that, in time, we will see it thoroughly reflected in the regulations that I wish had—and should have—been drafted long ago in tandem with the presentation of this bill, because they are so critical to how it works and because they can set aside so many of the concerns and misgivings that people have. That has not been the case. Nonetheless, as we now move forward on this, I hope that the government will show a different attitude to this important amendment than the minister has suggested to date. That does not, of course, change the opposition's support for this amendment.

 (Tasmania) (11:33):  I take issue with a point that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry made on these water access entitlements and ask him to clarify it. I think he was saying that these calculations are being made on the basis of the modified status of a particular piece of country. So it is based on what is there now versus what the original state was. I accept that in a lot of circumstances a fair bit of time has passed between them. I also want him to clarify his point about the amount of water that is actually taken up by a regenerated area versus what it might have been in its native state. I am genuinely interested in this. As I said before, this is a new concept. It is something that I am very concerned about being in the regulations in the first place because it has the capacity to do something that could then be applied to other agricultural pursuits. Quite frankly, the thin edge of a very dangerous wedge would be, rather than a farmer making the decision to plant a crop based on whether he understands he has the water, for some regulation to be imposed on him that he can or cannot plant a crop based on what his water right is.


I put on the record my concern that we are even going down this track in the first place. We will continue to pursue that through the process of scrutinising these regulations. I go back to the point I made earlier that we asked for these regulations back when the bill was being debated and scrutinised by the committee. All of these issues could have been much more easily dealt with, the progress of the legislation through this place could have been much more easily managed, had the government been prepared to do what the opposition asked at the time. In fact, we even moved a second reading amendment to the legislation asking the government to delay the passage of the legislation until the Senate had been able to properly consider the regulations. In my view, that was a very reasonable request. It has been vindicated now because there are legitimate questions and concerns that have been raised by this process.


As I say, this is the first time that I have seen any requirement for any agricultural pursuit to have a high security water licence before there is an entitlement to actually go ahead with that agricultural pursuit. Is this to become the norm? Are we going to see this occur in other circumstances when a farmer is told that he cannot plant his crop unless he has that water right? Are we going to see that be part of an ENGO campaign, for example? I would not be surprised. Here is the precedent. I have often had the discussion with some in the farming community, 'Be careful of what you ask for; you might just get it.' I am quite concerned that this is even in the regulations to start with, but I would like to get a decent sense of the method of its calculation. I would genuinely be interested in the minister putting something on the table in relation to this so that I can get an understanding of where these numbers come from. He says the numbers are from the CSIRO. I am happy to accept that that might be the source, but I would be genuinely interested in having a look at it so I can compare it with some other science that I have read. There is some very good research that I have looked at that talks about the water take-up of trees. The one thing that I do know is that you cannot put a blanket ban on it because it is extremely variable. It varies depending on where in the catchment it is. It varies based on the gradient of the land, whether it is higher or lower in the catchment and whether it is closer to a watercourse or further away.


All of those things vary, yet this table is effectively based on long-term rainfall and a volume of water that a planting might be expected to take up. How can we as a Senate understand the basis of this? That is why I am asking these questions. The uptake of water through tree plantings of any kind is not a new issue. It has been discussed over a number of years. Yes, the MIS circumstance has exacerbated that discussion and, yes, the MIS circumstance has probably prompted some people to say, 'Let's use this as a mechanism to stop people planting trees.' That is not something that I have not seen before: find a point of community concern and then campaign on that to try to stop people undertaking an activity—stock in trade for some ENGOs.


I genuinely would like to see the basis of this. I would really like to understand the basis of the science. How do we get to something that is based on a rainfall range of 100 millimetres one way or the other and then a water offset for an intended uptake? Surely these are the sorts of things that the proponent of a scheme should be required to consider as part of the process. Why be so specific in what you are defining as part of your regulation? Why not have it as part of a project plan that you have to consider this and then include that as part of the approval process? Perhaps that is a better way to do this rather than being specific and saying, 'If you receive average rainfall of 600 to 700 millimetres over the long term, you need a 0.9 megalitre high-security water licence to undertake a tree planting.' That just does not make sense. As I have said, it varies depending on whereabouts in a catchment you are and on the gradient, and it varies according to the species. Different species will have different uptakes. A saltbush will have a different uptake to that of a eucalypt.


We have before us something that has a very specific focus—and it is something that has never been seen before—and all I am asking for is to see the basis of the calculation. I am genuinely concerned that it is there in the first place, because it could be the nasty thin edge of the wedge, but I would genuinely like to look at the basis of this.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:41):  I am conscious of the fact that Senator Birmingham, who is running this for us, is keen to have a vote on this particular amendment before a quarter to 12, so I will keep my question very short. The minister would be aware of the banana industry in North Queensland. He would be aware that the banana industry uses a hell of a lot of electricity in its cooling and ripening rooms and a hell of a lot of transport fuel to get the bananas from Tully in Far North Queensland down to the markets in Sydney and Melbourne. The minister would also be aware that just a year ago the Labor Party leader Julia Gillard promised she would never introduce a carbon tax in her government and here we are actually debating bills around the carbon tax. 


The banana industry in North Queensland will be hit with increased electricity costs once the carbon tax that Julia Gillard promised would never be introduced is introduced. The banana industry will also be hit with huge increases in freight costs to bring bananas from Far North Queensland down to Sydney and Melbourne. The banana industry will struggle just as the northern beef cattle industry will struggle. Can the minister assure me that the Carbon Farming Initiative will actually help banana farmers by giving them some assistance that will in a very small way ameliorate some of the additional costs they will have to pay when the Gillard government introduces its toxic carbon tax?

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (11:43):  On the earlier questions, the CSIRO research has been relied upon to provide the information. These regulations are out for comment. Quite frankly, I know those opposite do not believe in the science. I am sure they would not believe in the science even if we could table the CSIRO's science report today. They are opposed to this legislation and they continue to oppose it. They do not believe in the Carbon Farming Initiative, which will provide benefits to the environment and reduce salinity, as well as provide specific benefits for the farming community. 


Pass the legislation. Stop filibustering. We will get an outcome that farmers can participate in. We know that the farming community is excluded from the carbon price. We have advocated for that and it has been agreed to. The farming community can certainly now use the CFI as an opportunity. This goes to the second question that was asked. You do not have to use the CFI if you do not want to. If you want to participate in it and if you want to develop a methodology that uses one of the available opportunities, you can do so. If you do not want to then you can continue. This is really responding to the Chicken Little arguments that were raised earlier about how the sky will fall down and everything else will happen. That is completely false. If you do not want to use the table do not use the CFI and do not use the opportunities that it presents to you. It is a perfectly logical answer for some who might not see an opportunity, but many will. So pass the legislation and let those farming communities benefit from sequestering carbon.


In response to Senator Macdonald, the banana industry, as you can appreciate, had an opportunity post Cyclone Yasi to receive significant support and assistance to get them through pretty difficult times. We provided a farm clean-up and a significant opportunity to get them through that difficult period. Because there were no bananas in the marketplace there were calls for alternative opportunities. What we have had though is a responsive banana industry able to deal with a particularly difficult event and get back up on its feet. In the foreseeable future bananas will re-enter the market, which will bring down the prices.


Not only the banana industry but all of the agricultural industries—I will not pick any out individually—can benefit from the CFI if they want to participate in it and develop the opportunities. They can use it as a way of reducing salinity in the soil, providing environmental benefits. I know that many in the farming community already do significant work on this. They can use that to their advantage by having their organisations join in this process of identifying the positive outcomes of sequestering carbon. This will ensure that they can reduce their carbon emissions, and that there are not only long-term benefits for their own environment but also income streams from it. All of that is available to them. It is not available while the coalition oppose the legislation and continue to filibuster.


We have been dealing with an amendment that everybody agrees with. No matter how many times the opposition have tried to characterise it otherwise, it is a sensible amendment. It provides what the opposition asked for and what the government sees as necessary. It does it by amending the criteria that are taken into account by the minister when making decisions around the legislation. We are now four or five hours in. We have had a couple of hours on one amendment that we all agree to. The coalition can argue that they are not filibustering, but they are. We really ought to get on with this legislation.


I think the coalition are now going from the ridiculous to the sublime. They are demonstrating just how opposed they are not only to the Carbon Farming Initiative but also to the opportunities that the Carbon Farming Initiative will present to farming communities. That disappoints me the most. I philosophically understand why the opposition oppose this. I do not agree with you. I completely think you have the wrong end of the stick. I see that it is your position and you are going to stick to it, but I do not understand why you want to deny farming communities the benefits of reducing salinity and soil erosion while also providing income streams. I do not understand that at all, quite frankly.


It is probably wedded to the fact that I mentioned earlier: in this debate, the coalition philosophically have a huge problem. They do not agree with the science. They do not agree with our position. They reflect that in many ways, such as saving money by not having a department. They have no legislation. They have no rigour. They have no model. They only have a direct action model, and I would not even call it that. It is just a tissue-paper-thin document which looks like a policy but is not. It is a clayton's policy, quite frankly. It will not work and it will not do what the CFI will do, which will provide all of those benefits and ensure, as we have done in this, that land use is a criterion that is taken into account. The opposition's direct action policy can have perverse outcomes. They do not want to talk about those perverse outcomes here, and I can understand why they would not want to, but if you look at the coalition's comments on those perverse outcomes the Liberals demonstrate that they are divided on this issue, as they are on the science of climate change.


The legislation we have will strike the right balance between rewarding environ­mental planning and protecting prime agricultural land; however, the Liberals do not want farmers to benefit from the carbon markets. They are spruiking the idea of tree planting as a panacea for climate change, but you could have the perverse outcomes that Senator Colbeck mentioned. It could create areas where you have insensible policy which encourages tree planting but without any rigour, model or safeguards and without any department or legislation. But they have provoked me into responding in a more broad way. I do this to highlight how the coalition are even opposed to benefiting farmers. That troubles me more each day as I sit in this chamber and listen to the Liberals spruik about the Carbon Farming Initiative. They ask questions but in truth they are filibustering; they are opposing the legisla­tion. Do that at the end—get on with it.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:52):  Most of the legislation the Labor Party has brought to this chamber has been so hopelessly drawn that it has had to be amended not long after its introduction. It has been brought in without proper scrutiny of all the elements. That is why we are spending time looking carefully into the bill before the committee at the moment. Senator Ludwig talked about filibusters but he just took 12 minutes to tell us practically nothing. If anyone is doing the filibustering, for some reason it is Senator Ludwig and the government. Senator Ludwig even raised issues that were not part of the debate, but as he has raised them it behoves me, in fairness and for an honest debate, to respond to them.


Senator Ludwig said that we want to abolish the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Yes, we do. We are looking for a lot of savings, and there is one very big saving. Which government was it that started the Greenhouse Challenge Plus Program? It was the Howard government. Which government put in place a number of initiatives that meant a reduction in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions? It was the Howard government. Did we need a new department of climate change to do that? No. We did it with the department of the environment. Clearly, that is where it can be done—without the huge expense that the Labor Party always wants to impose upon the Australian taxpayer by setting up another group of bureaucrats, another group of public servants, another group of people to push paper around. The department of the enviro­nment is perfectly able to handle this, and it can do that under an Abbott government just as it did under the Howard government.


Senator Ludwig also expanded the debate by talking about people not believing in climate change. I can only speak for myself, but I think most of my colleagues accept that of course the climate is changing. The climate has been changing for millions of years. Many scientists say that man is the cause of climate change but an equal number of highly qualified scientists, or more, do not agree. I am not a scientist, I am a mere politician, so I do not know. I take the view that when everybody else takes action, we will too. Certainly I accept that the climate is changing and I would be surprised if anyone did not understand that 20 million years ago the world was covered in ice. It is not covered in ice now, so of course the climate is changing. Millions of years ago the centre of Australia was covered by rainforest. It is not now; it is quite arid. So of course the climate is changing. Is it warming? That is a different question. The facts seem to suggest that in the last couple of decades the climate has either cooled or has not changed at all. They are matters beyond this debate, and I only mention them because Senator Ludwig raised them even although they are extraneous to the issue we are dealing with.


Senator Ludwig spent some time denigrating the coalition's direct action policy, a principal part of which is to put carbon into the soil. That was something the coalition was advocating and promoting long before the government ever thought of it. And you can reduce emissions, you can improve the quality of the soil, through the proposals that the coalition has put forward. You do not need a great big new tax on every Australian—a tax that will have no worldwide impact whatsoever on climate change—to get a reduction in emissions. The direct action proposal of Mr Abbott and the coalition will bring a reduction in green­house gas emissions. In fact Ms Gillard, the leader of the Labor Party and current Prime Minister, thought a year ago yesterday that no new tax would be needed when she said there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. The Labor Party leader made a solemn promise that, if her party was elected to government, there would not be a carbon tax. 


At about that time Tony Abbott told Australians that, as sure as night followed day, once you got a Labor Party-Greens alliance they would be after a carbon tax. Mr Swan, the deputy leader of the Labor Party and the current Treasurer, accused Mr Abbott of being hysterical for daring to suggest that the new Greens-Labor govern­ment would bring in a carbon tax. Mr Swan said that Tony Abbott's suggestion that the government was going to bring in a carbon tax was hysterical; it was not true. That was then followed up by Ms Gillard, the leader of the Labor Party, saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Indeed, she also said that if any action were to be taken on climate change initiatives it would only be done after there was a consensus of those in parliament. A year ago—just 12 months, 366 days ago—there was consensus. The Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party all agreed that there would be no carbon tax. 


So there was consensus just a short 12 months ago. There was unanimity in the Australian political scene. Everybody agreed there would be no carbon tax. People voted for Senator Feeney, Senator Ludwig and Senator Brown on the basis that, if the Labor Party were elected to government, there would be no carbon tax. Why did they think that? Because the leader of the Labor Party put her hand on her heart and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' 


It was not as though she did not know she would need to get into bed with the Greens. We all knew before the last election that the Senate was going to change. We could not maintain in the Senate the enormous success we had had in Queensland. Six years ago the Liberal Party had a magnificent success in Queensland when we got an unheard of four out of the six Senate positions. We knew that could not continue. Everybody knew it could not continue. Ms Gillard knew that if she formed government after the election it would have to be with the imprimatur of the left wing of the Labor Party—that is, the Greens. So she knew that was coming, yet in spite of that she promised us there would not be a carbon tax. Wayne Swan, the deputy leader of the Labor Party, reinforced that. Ms Gillard said, 'If we're going to do anything about climate change, it will be on consensus.' I repeat myself to make the point again: there was a consensus 366 days ago, one year ago, and that consensus was no carbon tax.


I raise those matters only because Senator Ludwig has broadened this debate, in what seemed to be a government-initiated filibuster, by bringing in these extraneous matters. I want to return to the question I asked Senator Ludwig about the banana industry. We know how very essential that industry is to all the banana eaters around Australia. As Senator Ludwig rightly said, Cyclone Larry first of all and Cyclone Yasi most recently devastated the banana industry. The banana industry has shown resilience and is back in play now. Coming from the area, I can assure Australian banana eaters that the supply is coming good, that prices will fall and everyone will be happy again—except that to get the banana product from Tully way up in Far North Queensland to Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra requires huge transport trucks. Those huge transport trucks, as Senator Sterle will tell us and as Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union will tell us, use a helluva lot of fuel—a helluva lot of diesel and petrol. 


Under the Gillard government's carbon tax those long-distance heavy transport vehicles are going to be slugged. You can imagine what that will do to the banana industry and to the price of bananas for the ordinary Australian public. There will be no compensation that I am aware of. That is why Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union is so violently opposed to this toxic carbon tax being introduced by the Labor Party and its leader, Ms Gillard. 


I hope the members of parliament who are in this place due to support from the Transport Workers Union will do the things they were elected to do and the things that their union sponsored them into this place to do—that is, to oppose this toxic tax which will mean such devastation for the heavy transport industry and, by extension, the industry I am talking about at present, which is the North Queensland banana industry. Banana growers are going to be slugged by the carbon tax on fuel introduced by this government, which promised that it would not introduce it.


The banana industry also uses a lot of electricity in their storerooms, coldrooms and ripening areas. It is not even argued about now. Even the government's own figures say it is 10 per cent, but we know what the government's modelling is like. More and more we are suspicious of modelling done by this government. The New South Wales government says that electricity prices will go up more like 15 to 20 per cent. That modelling is more believable because it is was done by independent economic analysts. That brings me back to the question I asked and the amendment we are dealing with: what impact will the Carbon Farming Initiative have—in a positive way, hopefully—on ameliorating the huge additional cost the banana industry is going to have to meet as a result of Gillard's carbon tax?


I have been distracted by Senator Ludwig's broadening of the debate, his filibuster. I did want to ask about the sugar industry as well, which is also very important in the north, but I have run out of time to do that. I would like to repeat my question: what tangible financial results will this particular carbon farming initiative give to the banana industry to help ameliorate some—a very small part, I would think—of the impact of the carbon tax on that industry?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:07):  I am not sure whether Senator Feeney spoke then or whether he just bounced in his seat.




Senator Feeney:
  I was succinct.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Marshall
):  I took it as a bounce.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  You took it as a bounce? A bounce in his seat? I was expecting and hoping for a response to Senator Macdonald's genuine concerns about an industry in his home state and an industry that is important to all Australians. The importance of that industry is being demonstrated—we have seen the impact flow through to inflation. That industry has gone through tough times following some natural disasters. 


Whilst Senator Feeney bounces in his seat, Senator Ludwig did at least provide some comments before he had to leave the chamber, but I was very disturbed by those comments. He claimed that the opposition does not want to give farmers the opportunity to sequester carbon in their soils and to enjoy some benefits from that. That is just a blatant misleading of the chamber. The opposition, as I have outlined before, has for a long time—far longer than this government—championed the concept that we can achieve significant carbon abatement in this country through enhancement of our soil carbon stocks; that we can make good inroads in reducing our share of global emissions by capturing carbon in our soils, by increasing the carbon content in our soils; and that, in doing so, we can enjoy a number of benefits such as those that Senator Ludwig has outlined. Those benefits include reduced risk of salinity, increased retention of water and increased soil capacity. Out of all that, we can enjoy the benefits of our soils being able to produce more and our farmers being able to produce more. We can actually boost Australia's overall productive capacity. So to come into this place and suggest, as the minister did, that we do not support the idea of farmers sequestering carbon is far from the truth.


The coalition has long supported the concept—has recognised the need and the opportunity—of putting greater carbon content into our soils. What we do not want to see, though—because it is what we have seen all too often from this government—is a bad scheme, a flawed scheme, a scheme that potentially has unintended consequences. That is what we do not want to see. That is what we on this side want to stop. That is why we have been diligent and determined in our approach to tackling all of the issues that we have seen with this legislation. That is why, as my colleague Senator Colbeck pointed out earlier, we were crystal clear from day one that we believed this bill deserved to be considered alongside all of the proposed regulations needed to make this bill work; that the Senate inquiry that looked at this should have been able to look at it in its entirety, with those regulations; and that it was important to make sure that, when the Senate committee engaged stakeholders who have an interest in this issue, those stakeholders were able to give us fully informed feedback about it.


But, no, the government resisted that. The government could not manage to get its act together and could not manage to present all of this information in one hit. Instead of the Senate inquiry looking at this legislation with all of the government's proposals before it, it only had some of the proposals. It was not until yesterday afternoon that this chamber was finally presented with a copy of the draft regulations. Long after the Senate committee has finished its deliberations on this bill, long after the House of Representatives has passed this bill and well into the debate on this bill, the government finally comes along and drops these regulations on the table. According to it, the final version of these regulations was pumped out at 11.43 am yesterday. 


These regulations are particularly important to the clause of the bill that we have been debating this morning—to proposed section 56 pertaining to excluded offset projects. That proposed section creates the so-called negative list in an attempt to ensure that there are no perverse outcomes or adverse consequences from the operation of the scheme. It attempts to ensure that, in striving to give farmers and others the opportunity to sequester carbon, we do not have adverse impacts in several areas, those areas being the proposed criteria for exclusion.


Four criteria were previously identified. Four is, I know, a number that is important to you at present, Senator Feeney. There are four criteria identified—water, biodiversity, employment and local community. The Senate is agreeing to add a fifth criterion—I do not think there are five spots on the Labor Party's Victorian Senate ticket, Senator Feeney, but, if they wanted a fifth, maybe you would be in the running. We want to add a fifth criterion of land access for agricultural production. The Senate has agreed to do that, but regrettably the minister stood in this place and brushed aside the significance of this. He has described it as little more than a clarification. We do not think preserving land access for agricultural production is a clarification. We think it is important. We think it is sound policy and we think it is vital that we preserve that in this country. That is why we think these regulations need to reflect the letter, the spirit and the intent of the amendment being proposed. I indicated before that I accept we were not going to get any greater clarification from Senator Ludwig. He had made his attitude clear on this. He did not think this was a meaningful amendment. I am not particularly hopeful that we are about to get any great response or contribution from the bouncing Senator Feeney in this regard.


What I do hope is that, when we pass this amendment shortly, the minister for climate change takes it seriously, and the government as a whole take it seriously. When they engage with stakeholders in analysing the regulations I hope they accept that this is a key principle, which is worth pursuing and worth us being genuine in our approach to. That is what I hope and that is what I urge the government to do. I hope that the government, in finalising this so-called negative list of projects that will not be permitted or accredited under the scheme, actually take into account the issues of land access for agricultural production and are mindful of ensuring that our best farming land remains available for farming purposes.


Farmers can grab hold of whatever opportunity they can to increase the carbon content of their soils, because that is a good thing, but we do not want any other negative outcomes that would see any of those farming lands taken out of agricultural production. That is what we think is at the core of this amendment. That is what we think is so vital in terms of the government honouring the letter, spirit and intent of this amendment. That is why we are so disappointed on initial analysis with the regulations, which have been drafted seemingly with no consideration of this amendment despite the fact that the government has known for a couple of months at least that it was going to accept and adopt this amendment.


If Senator Ludwig and Senator Feeney will not do it, I urge Mr Combet and those who will ultimately be responsible for the finalisation of the regulations that will be brought to this place to ensure that, when those regulations come here, we do not have to have this debate again; to ensure that you actually get it right, that you heed the concerns of the stakeholders and that, when we put the new subclause (e) into clause 56, it is a component that is considered with equal weighting to the other four components and that it is considered alongside them all. That is what we think would happen in a well-managed scheme, in a good scheme, rather than the type of shambolic approach that the government takes to the implementation of its environmental programs, which we have seen time and time again. I can but ask that Senator Feeney and the officials make sure that we honour this amendment fully. It is not as Senator Ludwig described it 'simply an add-on, simply a clarification' but something meaningful and gives meaningful security of land access for agricultural production into the future.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (12:19):  It is unfortunate that I had to leave the chamber and I was not privy to any comments that Senator Ludwig may have made in response to the questions I asked in my last contribution on the draft regulations provided to the chamber yesterday morning. I have to say that, for me, this is a really serious issue and I tried to stress that in my previous contribution. This actually introduces something into the legislative process that has not existed before. To demonstrate that we were serious about this we expressed our concerns in our report in response to the legislation. We said at that time that the lists are also a potential trojan horse in the introduction of measures that are not current common practice but are the subject of much community debate and would be best resolved outside this process.


Now we have them being inserted into the regulations. I accept that they were part of the draft negative list. It is much more defined in here now, but I am seriously concerned about the way it was defined. As I said before, I do not see how you can, in a blanket way, say that for a 100-millimetre or greater than 1,000 millimetres rainfall range you have to have a set high-value water entitlement. I just cannot fathom why, for a 600 to 700 millimetre long-term average rainfall, you have to have a 0.9 megalitre water offset licence per hectare per year for the life of the project. I just cannot work that out. It depends on where you are and what you are planting, and that will vary.


It is just like a number of other measures that are included in this bill. We talked about those in the dissenting report—for example, the risk of reversal buffer. The government has put a set five per cent risk of reversal buffer into this legislation and that would be best placed in the individual plan for each of the projects. We know that the risks of reversal vary according to the different forms of sequestration being proposed. Some are higher security than others. Some are much lower. Yet we have a fixed five per cent risk of reversal buffer proposed in the legislation. The same concept is being applied here. It is no different to what the government has done when the Prime Minister has said that no prices should go up by more than one per cent under the carbon tax. She has taken a piece of modelling and tried to apply that across the board. It just does not work. It is simplistic and you cannot apply it that way. 


I spoke to a small regional airline a few weeks ago. They said that 30 per cent of their overhead cost is aviation fuel. On the government's own modelling, that is going up by 10 per cent. What does that mean? In simple maths it means a three per cent increase in their prices. They have no option. That is before they apply any of the other costs that they might have—the electricity costs to run their hangars and their servicing business and all that sort of stuff. Their prices will go up by three per cent just from the cost of aviation fuel, which is not exempted under the proposed carbon tax, and so you have the government saying, 'We are going to give extra money to the ACCC and we are going to send the ACCC after anyone who says they are putting their prices up by more than one per cent.'


What do we tell all the small regional airlines around Australia whose overhead costs of operation are 30 per cent aviation fuel? It is not going to vary broadly. It is going to be pretty consistent across those small businesses and 30 per cent of their overhead cost is aviation fuel. It is going up by 10 per cent, a three per cent increase in cost to business. Do we say to them, 'The ACCC is going to come and see you; you cannot put your prices up by more than one per cent because the Prime Minister said so'? Her modelling reckons it should go up by less than one per cent. She told the people on King Island that it is 7c in $100. That is what she is applying, yet King Island gets the triple whammy. Their airfares are going up by at least three per cent. The only way to get on and off the island is by air. Shipping is not exempt. That is all going to go up, and we all know that it costs more to get things to those islands because you have to ship it all in by sea or by air. Of course, they already pay more for energy because that is the way it is in those places, unfortunately. There is no equalisation provided to them by the state, so their already higher power prices will go up by 10 per cent. We know that—the local power authority said so.


So here we have this process of taking an average and applying it across everything. It just does not work. It is not practical. So how can you say that, if you are in an area that has a 900 to 1,000 millimetre long-term average rainfall, you need a 1.8 megalitre water offset entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project? How does that work? Surely the best way to deal with that is to say, 'When you submit your plan for your project, we need you to consider what the water use might be and then, in that plan, tell us what you are saying it is and provide us with the information to back it up.' I cannot see me recommending support in my party room for these regulations the way that they are written at the moment. Why would you? As the coalition stated in its dissenting report, here we have Trojan horses. I have said a number of times this concept has not been seen in the legislative process in Australia before. It is probably there at the insistence of the Greens, prepared to give the Labor Party the benefit of the doubt on that. I notice the Greens have vacated the field.


I do not think those sorts of general­isations fairly apply. I acknowledge and accept that there are people concerned about the water use of tree plantings. As I said earlier, things like MIS have exacerbated those, but I also know, having read some of the science, that the water uptake varies considerably over the life cycle of the plantings and it varies considerably depend­ing on the type of planting—eucalypt to pine, saltbush, all those sorts of things. They all vary where they are in the catchment. You cannot make some blanket application across the board. If you want to deal with the issue, that is fine, but deal with it in a project based sequence, just in the same way that the coalition said we should do it in relation to the risk of reversal. 


We said at the outset that we support the concept of storage of carbon in the landscape. As we have been reminded a number of times during this debate, it is our policy to do that. But, as has been indicated right through the process and in evidence that we heard in the Senate inquiry, this legislation has a whole heap of barriers in it affecting what the government says it wants to do. 


I come back to the point that I made in my first contribution this morning. The government says that it wants to protect agricultural land through this amendment, yet what it has done in Tasmania threatens 100,000 hectares of agricultural land—10 per cent of it—because it is pushing the forest out and the only place to situate the plantations that the NGOs, the government and the Greens say that the industry is going to transition to is onto agricultural land. There is no other place to go. We do not want to convert any more native forest to plantation. The conversion of native forest to plantation is one of the issues that underlies the negotiations that are happening in Tasmania right now. Why do we continue to apply those mistakes when we should have learned from them? The Prime Minister should have learned that she cannot go round telling people that prices will not go up by more than one per cent and she will send the ACCC round to tap on somebody's shoulder if that occurs. She just cannot do that. I have given one example. I can give you another one. I went to a powder-coating factory not far from where I operate. They run with gas and they run with electricity. They have done their calculations based on the fact that electricity is going up by 10 per cent and gas by nine per cent. What did they say to me when I asked them how much their prices would have to go up by? They said three per cent; that is their calculation. Are they going to have the ACCC pay them a visit, tap them on the shoulder and go through their books, wasting the time of the business in an investigation because the Prime Minister wants to use the ACCC as a political tool to help her sell her carbon tax? I do not think that that is reasonable or fair. That should not be part of the process.


I repeat that the coalition supports the concept of storing carbon in our landscape. We put up a number of suggestions as part of our report. But the government, being wagged along by the Greens tail, does not want to do any of that. We have this absurd table about how you have to have a high-security water licence, based on rainfall, to plant trees. It does not stack up. As I indicated in our report, tabled earlier in the year, it is a new concept and something that still remains contentious in the community. And yet it has been inserted—slipped—into some regulations, with some very basic principles, just averages, being applied to it.


If you do a calculation or a bit of modelling, then for 600 millimetres to 700 millimetres of rainfall you need a water entitlement of 0.9 megalitres per hectare per year. For 700 millimetres to 800 millimetres, you need 1.2 megalitres of water offset entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project. And we know that that varies. For 800 millimetres to 900 millimetres of long-term average rainfall, you need 1.5 megalitres of water offset entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project. For greater than 1,000 millimetres, you need 2.1 megalitres of high-security water entitlement per hectare per year for the life of the project. CSIRO might have come with those averages. They have just plonked them in, but the best way to deal with this is on the basis of saying that this is a measure that needs to be dealt with as part of any individual plan. People should put it in their plans and then have that assessed as part of the approval process for the plan. That makes sense—just like the risk-of-reversal buffer. Those things can be managed.


The government wonders why we do not support the legislation. There are two really good reasons: one, it is very difficult for us to support the regulations in the form that they are in and, two, you are not prepared to consider any of the sensible suggestions that we have made as part of this process. You are more than happy to take on what the Greens tell you you have to but you will not constructively engage with the opposition.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (12:32):  I will briefly respond. The casual observer of this debate would be forgiven for not being able to recognise the fact that we have now spent the best part of three hours considering a government amendment that is agreed to by the opposition. The reality is that we are witnessing here a manful attempt by those opposite to filibuster this debate. Let me tell you for free, Senator Colbeck, that on filibustering points you are the winner. Your speech gave the greatest impression that you were trying to talk about the subject. You were not, of course, but to the casual observer your speech would have given the most effective appearance of at least trying.


Senator Colbeck, on the 30 seconds of content that appeared in your remarks and your questions in terms of long-term rainfall and those tables—while not relevant to the debate at hand—this is a matter that was obviously part of the consultation paper, the feedback process and the draft regulations. You know all of that. You have asked those questions and got those answers previously. While not relevant to the debate at hand, I will also make the comment that it is an issue that you have already taken up with the government and I am sure that you will continue to do so.


In terms of King Island and your forensic remarks about it, I look forward to the day when you go to King Island and explain how your direct action policy imposes a direct cost of $1,300 per household upon each of them. I will also watch with great interest how you explain to them how your $70 billion worth of budget cuts will impact on them and their community.




Senator Birmingham:
  This is not helping your cause.




Senator FEENEY:
  Senator Birmingham, I always welcome your advice. Our policy is that carbon emissions will be cut by five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020, a total of 160 million tonnes of carbon. Senator Joyce, you will note that a weight is ascribed to carbon emission abatement. The fascinating thing about this debate is that your policy is exactly the same. You too seek to reduce carbon emissions by that much by 2020; you too seek to abate some 160 million tonnes of carbon. I am always fascinated to see the threads of climate change scepticism weave their way through your speeches because you are trying to hide your fundamental dishonesty in this debate. On paper, you too are committed to combating climate change. You too are committed to reaching a realistic target by 2020. But in reality you are not. For you, this entire debate is about appealing to the sceptics and the science deniers and hiding from public view your own policy. I hope that you fail in that endeavour. To the extent that any of the previous speeches offered any questions—and they barely did—I think that I have adequately responded.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-08-17,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:36):  It is important to talk about an issue that pertains to prime agricultural land. I recognise that there is support on this issue, but the National Party went in to bat for the particular issue of the protection of prime agricultural land. Prime agricultural land, as you well know, is vitally important for our capacity as a nation to feed ourselves. On the hierarchy of needs, it is at the very top. Prime agricultural land is more important than mining, because we as a nation have a duty to feed not only our people but others throughout the world, especially as the global food task—which my good friend and colleague Senator Heffernan is always talking about—increases as population increases. We have to make sure that we have the capacity to utilise our prime agricultural land. When talking about prime agricultural land, which this amendment discusses, I think it is important to state that some misconceptions have been put out there, none better than a statement by the minister in Queensland, Ms Nolan, who has stated that farmers never had any rights over their land. That is totally and utterly factually incorrect. Certainly, the Crown had the right of prospecting on your land and, right back to Magna Carta, had the rights to gold and silver on your land. But it did not have the rights to the coal, oil or petroleum on your land as far as mining went. Those rights were taken over in Queensland in the 1915 act for petroleum and gas, for security of those rights in World War I. It is almost 100 years ago, but certainly not hundreds of years ago, and it is certainly not something that was there in perpetuity. In Victoria, as I am sure Senator Feeney is aware, it was the threat of World War II that led to security for that asset—they started pilfering it off the farmers at that point in time. Then, going all the way through to 1981, it was at that point in time that the adroit Neville Wran managed to pilfer the rest of the farmers' rights. So it is factually incorrect to say that the farmers did not actually have a property right. They did, but it was taken from them.


It is because they lack property rights that we now see the immense discrepancies and the absurdity that farmers get less than 0.75c for every $1,000 the mining company earns. I do not think that is a reflection of a fair bargaining position. I am certain that Senator Feeney and others on the other side have a clear understanding of how bargaining positions go for workers—when you are getting a fair deal and when you are not—and I imagine that there may therefore be some sympathy from over there for the fact that the farmers are not getting a fair deal.


Also, regarding the carbon sink legislation, if we lose our prime agricultural land to forests rather than mining it, is not going to be much use to us unless we intend to evolve to a higher form of termite! The idea that we will all somehow live happily ever after in an economic upland with forests kept in perpetuity rather than ones you can cut down is wrong. It will send the towns and their economies into privation. At the same time we will have absconded from our moral duty to feed other people. That is a duty we have. One might recognise that the rice industry in Australia has the capacity to feed up to 60 million people. That is quite substantial. It seems peculiar that in some of our legislation we might want to shut it down. Do we think it is not morally correct to feed people? Do we think there is something that presupposes that having scrub is more morally right than feeding people who are hungry? I think that the highest duty you have is to feed your people. I am sure my colleague Senator Brandis will agree with me on that one. No doubt he has come in here because he thinks I am an extremely loquacious speaker—




Senator Brandis:
  I think you are an extremely eloquent speaker, Senator Joyce, and an adornment to the Senate.




Senator JOYCE:
  Thank you. I have always thought so myself!


So on this issue the National Party does have an extremely strong interest. It was one of those times where the National Party crossed the floor—the lot of us, on carbon sink legislation.


Now there is an interesting thing we should talk about. We have the carbon tax legislation coming up. One of the greatest rights you have in this place as a represent­ative of the people, first and foremost—there is no mention of a political party in the Constitution; it is your representation of the people—is that if you believe something to be truly right you can vote on that accordingly. You have the right to walk from one section to another in this chamber and in the other place. It is a fundamental right that you should have. I believe strongly that, behind the rhetoric, there are people in the Australian Labor Party and maybe the Greens—or maybe not—who fundamentally do not believe in a carbon tax. It is wrong that in the year of our Lord 2011 we still have this kind of medieval approach of bullying people so that on key issues they cannot exercise their vote in the way they see fit. And this is a key issue; it is a big one. No-one can arrest you or assault you because of it. But it is wrong. We talk about the modern position with the internet the way it is and we talk about all the other liberties that people want and their view on them. We are allowed to discuss same-sex marriage but we are not allowed to discuss the liberty of being able to vote the way you want to on an issue. But you should be able to do that.


It is absurd that some person you have never in your life met and who was never elected to office can instigate a process of extracting you from this parliament by disendorsement or basically bullying you out of the joint. That is wrong. It should not be happening these days, and I think the Australian people are more and more becoming a wake-up to this. They will watch the carbon tax debate evolve and they will be asking their local representative to represent them first and foremost above and beyond allegiances to any other body. That is their right; it is what they should be entitled to do. Every person will be answerable for the way they vote, because it takes only one vote in the other place to stop the carbon tax. So any one of the people in the lower house actually has the balance of power. They have the capacity to make a major change for our nation. All they have to do is move the 10 feet or 10 metres from one side to the other. The right to take that walk should be absolutely ingrained. It should be your fundamental right.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Joyce, I think I have been fairly tolerant, but I do remind you of the question before the chair, which is an amendment to the legislation.




Senator JOYCE:
  I think I should reflect on your tolerance. You have been a very tolerant person. I understand.




Senator Feeney:
  You need to spend more time with him!




Senator JOYCE:
  We need to get to know one another better! But it is very important that on prime agricultural land we reflect the intention of what that is about. It is not all the land in Australia; it is merely a footprint of maybe three to four per cent of our nation. That leaves you 96 per cent to knock yourself out with. That prime agricultural land should be protected and the rights of the farmer should be protected. The capacity of Australia to feed itself and feed others is a moral obligation we hold. If we destroy primary agricultural land you cannot get it back in the future. God has not been around for the last couple of weeks. Whatever is there is all you are going to get, forever. There is no more. That is as good as it is going to get. Anyway, I think we should be considering that.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and thank you, Senator Brandis. I appreciate your giving me the call; I have to be somewhere else. I want to take this opportunity to report to the Senate on a recent visit to the United States of America that I took to examine the challenges facing the North American road transport industry. As many of you in this chamber and in this building would know, I am a very passionate and proud supporter of our transport industry, having spent many years as an owner-driver hauling furniture throughout this great country.


In the USA the basic wage is just $7.50 per hour, and we know the parity between the Australian dollar and the American dollar is quite frightening. In California it is slightly better, I believe about $8.50 an hour. There is a marked distinction in the USA between union and non-union workers' wages and conditions. I had the absolute pleasure of attending the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Western Organizers Conference in Los Angeles. It might come as a shock to those opposite but I am a very passionate supporter of the Teamsters. I was honoured to meet some of the leading lights of the American International Brotherhood of Teamsters. I will just name a few. There was Mr Jimmy Hoffa, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a fantastic person. I wish that President Hoffa does come Down Under very soon.




Senator Feeney:
  Hear, hear!




Senator STERLE:
  I acknowledge Senator Feeney's response. I would like to mention a few more very worthwhile people that looked after me in the United States: Tim Beaty, Director of Global Strategies; and Jeff Farmer, Director of Organising, who I have had the pleasure of meeting on a number of occasions. Jeff has been a visitor to Australia. Others were Dan Sullivan from Washington, an organiser with the Teamsters; Jason Gately, an international organiser out there in Las Vegas; Mike Magnani, secretary/treasurer of Local 995; Larry Griffith, secretary/treasurer of Local 14;    Bob Morales, secretary/treasurer of Local 350 in Daly City, California; and a very good friend of mine, Rudy Gonzalez, from Local 856 in San Francisco.


While at the conference I was given the opportunity to attend a Teamster organised rally in the streets of Los Angeles.




Senator Brandis:
  I can just see you there, Glenn.




Senator STERLE:
  Senator Brandis, I proudly had my Teamsters shirt on saying, 'Our job, our community: let the fight begin.' I did join the rally of 30,000 people, teamsters and people from all walks, all professions, and proudly supported by other unions and other workers. The reason for the rally in Los Angeles is that, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, financially and economically America has its challenges but unfortunately, as is normal with most reactions to these situations, there is a Republican governor in Wisconsin named Scott Walker. To cut a very long story short, as we have seen here before, if the economy is lagging, if things are looking bad, where are the first cuts targeted? Where else but workers. Anyway, I believe that when the announcement came to strip Wisconsin public sector workers of their right to collectively bargain and also be covered by a union negotiated agreement, 130,000 people attended a rally in Wisconsin. The fight is going on. Unfortunately for the good folk of Wisconsin in the public sector, the Republican senators voted in favour of stripping their rights and conditions in the workplace. Hence the Teamsters have sent a very loud message to the city of Los Angeles that if any of those shenanigans were to happen there would be a warning fired across the bow to show that Californians would not take it lying down.


The disturbing reality is that in the United States, if it is your job to safely command the wheel of a 40-tonne truck with a container full of hazardous materials or imported consumer goods from the wharf to the warehouse, you only can expect to earn $US28,000 a year, which equates to $26,500 here. I know that sounds hard to believe but the harsh reality is that it is a fact: 40-tonne semi drivers on $A26,500 a year. It is frightening. I ask senators and those listening to imagine that hauling everything from mattresses, MP3 players, televisions and tennis shoes to fuel and other vital services was a minimum wage job without a union or a contract in Australia. Unthinkable, but sadly in America it happens. In America, the thought that you would have access to health care and a pension for working in such a dangerous job but in an important industry in the global economy is a joke. It is not a very funny joke but I could not think of another word. There are over 110,000 port drivers in the US who, sadly, are devalued this way.


I raise this now, with so much economic injustice in the world, because one of the culprits behind this American exploitation of truck drivers is an Australian company, Toll Group, which operates at US ports in Los Angeles, New York and Miami. Literally, the working conditions it imposes on workers are nothing short of disgraceful. Toll Group truck drivers do not even have access to clean and safe rest room facilities. Their options for relieving themselves include going on the side of the road—and we are not talking out in the middle of nowhere, somewhere between Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing; we are talking suburban Los Angeles—or using a plastic bottle in the cab of their truck. This is incredible but this is what is happening. This is because their company, Toll subsidiary FMI, merely provides them a filthy toilet and actually bars them from using the clean indoor facilities that its non-truck-driver employees are freely allowed to enjoy. So we have a responsibility to raise our voices, as the workers in America raise theirs, and demand justice on the job. There may be some cynicism in this chamber about how I know. I will tell you how I know. I had the privilege of meeting about 15 port truck drivers employed by the Toll Group subsidiary FMI in Los Angeles. I will call one of them I met 'John'. I do not want to use his real name, because Toll has hired a union buster and has started intimidating drivers because they want to address their poor conditions by joining a labour union.


John is one of over 12,000 port truck drivers responsible for moving extremely heavy cargo containers every day, filled with billions of dollars worth of goods, through America's most enormous port complex in Los Angeles. It is very disappointing to me that John, a father of two, one of which is still in nappies, has hauled containers off the port for the last 13 years but is not rewarded for his work to keep the global economy moving. For the last few years he has been responsible for moving fashion products, brands such as Macy's, Guess and Under Armour, from US shores to American stores. His hard work and that of his compatriots earn Toll a very healthy profit. But, sadly, John is not allowed access to company toilets. In this day and age, that is incomprehensible. He is not even allowed to use the employee break room to make a cup of coffee before a long shift, nor is he allowed to access that facility to heat or refrigerate his food before he starts work. Only truck drivers are denied the dignity to sit and eat their meals during their rest breaks. John often loses loads and hours to other employees because the company dispatches work based on favouritism rather than on equitable policy that drivers can rely on for full-time work that guarantees that they can feed their families. That is just disgraceful.


John and his co-workers are very skilled port truck drivers, committed to providing quality service and the highest degree of professionalism, just like our Aussie drivers. Despite their hard work to help the company grow and succeed, the Toll Group denies its truck drivers in the US the rights and freedoms its employees in Australia enjoy. It is our responsibility to ensure that Toll, that great Australian company, upholds Australian values, no matter where it operates. We must help John and his co-workers achieve the labour standards that Toll Group workers receive here in Australia. We cannot protect model standards in the global economy if we do not do our part to put an end to the abuse and injustice that these workers face elsewhere.


But, instead of addressing these concerns as they expand to America, Toll show what they truly think of their workers. Toll want to prevent their drivers from joining the Teamsters Union. The Teamsters Union has been engaged in a remarkable campaign for several years to bring dignity and respect to drivers across America. Toll are able to deny these drivers their right to join the Teamsters because of the legislation that is in place that restricts the good work that unions do in America. In Australia, through hard-fought negotiations with the Transport Workers Union and other labour unions, Toll provide their workers with fair wages and conditions. That is a testament to the legislation put in place by Labor governments to ensure the rights of workers to bargain collectively, as well as the long fight of the labour movement to ensure that workers rights are and always will be protected under a Labor government in their workplace. Madam Acting Deputy President, it is not a throwaway line, but the fight continues.


We have already seen the spectre of the return to Work Choices by the Leader of the Opposition, who, as we clearly know, does not think there was anything wrong with Work Choices—those were his words—only that it was not properly sold to the electorate. He is now joined by the member for Bennelong, a former tennis player, who, I am sure, is not short of a quid—and, if he is not, good luck to him—and in order to secure his standing in the Liberal Party has called for the stripping of penalty rates because they are getting in the way of company profits.


If the extremist policies of those opposite are allowed to be enacted into law, then it will only be a matter of time before the industry will take advantage and safe wages and conditions will become the exception, rather than the standards that Australian workers enjoy today. This is why I will work with the Transport Workers Union to help these American workers, as part of my commitment to uphold the standards for Australia's transport workers, to protect and improve their livelihoods.



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  I stand with our national secretary, Tony Sheldon, and with our national assistant secretary, Michael Cain, and with all TWU members in this fight. May I—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—also encourage Senator Williams over there, from the Nationals, who, as soon as I started talking about 'safe rates' has not stopped gobbing off, to make a contribution, through you, in this chamber on what he may think of transport workers, their wages and their conditions. I would be very keen to hear that, because he was not cheering and supporting the TWU's fine work through their negotiating skills to look after Australia's truck drivers and keep them safe on Australian roads. You defend your statements, Senator Williams. Stand up here and grab something to give you some machismo to defend why Australian truckies should not be paid a decent, safe wage. I wear this yellow wristband in solidarity with America's truck drivers employed by Toll. It is a symbol of their fight for freedom to unite and speak together as one voice at work so they have the chance to build a better life for themselves and their children. Before I wrap up, there are a few fantastic people I wish to acknowledge: Mr Fred Potter, Vice President At-Large of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; Mr Manny Valenzuela, western region organising coordinator in California—Manny, thank you, mate, for taking me around and introducing me to a fantastic cohort of truck drivers and Teamsters members in California; and Mr Nick Weiner, National Campaigns Coordinator of Change to Win. I challenge everyone in this chamber to show some strength, show some dignity and stand up for truck drivers. Let us support our brothers in the United States of America—that great fighter for freedom floating out there with disgusting conditions, where Australian companies as well can exploit the hardworking men and women in the American transport industry.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-08-17,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:04):  I thank the minister. I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


That is a very brief explanation for two questions on very similar issues that I gave notice of last December. The briefing with Dr Floyd, the new director-general of ASNO, was only offered about a fortnight ago. That officer has only just recently taken up that position. I recognise that Minister Conroy is outside his portfolio but I find that explanation to be wholly inadequate given that these questions were put on the Notice Paperin December. They are about an issue, one which I will go into some detail on in a moment, that has direct relevance to Australia's security interests and yet these questions have languished, one for 253 days and one for 242 days. That is how long it has taken. I took the opportunity to go back through the Notice Paperand take a look at what else has lapsed, and this is an issue that I think Senator Cormann took up yesterday, and saw that we have questions overdue by a matter of months. The convention in this place is 30 days and for most portfolios you actually get that kind of response; you get an answer approximately 30 days after you put a question on notice. The oldest one, the one that has been lingering the longest, is in the name of Senator Bob Brown, who gave notice on 28 September 2010 of asking about an issue relating to the Australian Political Parties for Democracy Program. That has been lying around for nearly a year. There are questions to Minister Conroy—and it is a bit of a shame that he has left the room—including a question that Senator Brown put on notice on 8 December 2010 relating to the Indonesian unit known as Detachment 88, which has been implicated in horrific human rights abuses in Indonesia. So that has been lying around since 8 December 2010. There are questions of mine to Minister Conroy relating to the Digital Switchover Taskforce, quite detailed questions—about information that it would have been handy for me to know about—that I gave notice of on 13 December 2010. There is a question by Senator Siewert, relating to staffing in the disability services portfolio, that she put on notice in April 2011. There are dozens of questions lying around and no apparent procedure for getting them answered within the right time frame. I did the Minister for Foreign Affairs the courtesy this morning of letting him know that we would be chasing these up, months and months after they were lodged, and he has seen fit to do nothing more than send Minister Conroy along to say, 'Oh, you'll be briefed on those, among other things, in a week's time.' That is really different from the process for questions on notice whereby detailed information is sought and expected to be received. I wonder whether any spokesperson from the govern­ment would care to inform the chamber about what process actually operates behind the scenes for deciding which questions you will just let lapse until they get taken up in the Senate and which will be given a proper answer.


The reason that I have taken this time this afternoon—and I will only speak briefly, because I realise that progress did not get very far this morning on the bill that is before the chamber—relates to Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program. This is an issue in which Australia has a very direct interest. My questions on this subject first arose from some alarming reports that were issued in 2009 by Professor Des Ball from ANU and Phil Thornton, a journalist living on the Thai-Burma border. I had the opportunity to meet with both these two individuals who put the reports together. The cross-party group, known as Australian Parliamentarians for Democracy in Burma, sought a briefing from Professor Ball in 2009, which he provided and for which we are very grateful. He also briefed ASNO, the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office here, in Canberra, and other depart­ments to discuss their findings and their research. I had the good fortune to meet Mr Thornton when I took a trip to the Thai-Burma border very early last year.


What MPs learned at the briefing was that the two authors had interviewed two inform­ants who had come out of Burma. They were not aware of the existence of each other. The defectors described Russian and North Korean collaboration with the Burmese military in an illicit reactor for producing plutonium. The people who follow these issues will be aware that these kinds of reactors are effectively for military use only. There is very, very little point if you do not even have a civil nuclear program in building a plutonium producing reactor. This techno­logy is complex; it is very elaborate; it would take a long time to put together. If there is an illicit nuclear weapons program taking shape in Burma, with the covert or overt support of either the Russian government or the North Korean government, I think it would be in our interests to find out about that and do our part to stop that thing in its tracks before it got too far advanced.


The two informers told virtually identical stories about a clandestine facility that has been under construction for a period of time and that North Korea is assisting the Burmese regime to create a plutonium production facility in a very large underground complex in the regional part of the country. Their descriptions include the location of the facility, its scale, the timetable of construction and the sort of equipment that they are bringing in. The two stories matched perfectly. These were two defectors who had come out of the country and did not know of each other's existence. It would be of huge concern if Burma were embarking on clandestine nuclear activities in contravention of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I hope I do not have to spell out the reasons why. US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, raised the suspected collaboration at the ASEAN summit in July of last year. Jane's Intelli­gence Review has written it up. The Institute for Science and International Security, which is a Washington DC based think tank, is writing it up. And a report commissioned by the Democratic Voice of Burma said that, while the military may not be successful in their efforts—and of course we wish them every failure—the intent is clear. It said analysis leads to only one conclusion: the technology is for nuclear weapons and not civilian use or nuclear power.


There are doubts. There is ambiguity operating in this kind of environment, obviously. Because the rumours have been going for some time, it was interesting to see quite a reasonable amount of material disclosed as a result of the WikiLeaks document drop of state department archives last year in which this subject is canvassed at length. A 2004 cable provided as part of that large store of material noted that there was no direct evidence of the alleged nuclear cooperation between North Korea and Burma; however, 'rumours of ongoing construction of a nuclear reactor are surprisingly consistent and observations of activity appear to be increasing as are alleged sightings of North Korean technicians inside Burma'. Another classified cable reports: 'North Korean workers are reportedly assembling surface-to-air missiles and constructing an underground facility at a Burmese military site about 315 miles north, north-west of Rangoon. Some 300 North Koreans are working on the secret construction site.' This is what the US State Department is telling itself.


Another cable in 2007 reveals concerns that Burma is exporting uranium to China. The cable describes the suspicious behaviour of authorities when handling a shipment of mixed ore from Burma to China via Singapore in January of that year. They quote: 'Embassy contacts noticed that authorities treated the shipment as highly sensitive and suspect it may have included uranium.' There are a large number of other cables, including one that refers to Australia's former ambassador in Burma, Michelle Chan, whom I had the good fortune to meet and discuss this issue with, trying to verify the accuracy of a report that she received that the regimes of Kim Jong-il and Than Shwe, the Burmese dictator, were engaged in peaceful nuclear cooperation.


The US cables detailed the construction of suspicious underground military facilities alongside the construction of a very large airstrip, as well as suspected shipments of uranium from Burma to China. That is why I have been following the issue and reminding the department and the minister through estimates and the various avenues that we have available to us in here that there is a very serious concern about nuclear weapons proliferation in the region—particularly if you allow yourself to imagine for a moment the idea of nuclear weapons in the hands of a regime such as Burma's, which is already a regional security threat and treats its own population with such an appalling contempt for human rights.


When I asked about this matter at Senate estimates—and I will follow this up with Mr Floyd next week—representatives from ASNO stated that Australia was monitoring developments in Burma—whatever that means. We have a very small diplomatic staff based in Rangoon, so I am not sure what they mean by 'monitoring develop­ments'. The questions on notice that I put to Minister Rudd, for which Minister Conroy has just provided this breathtakingly inadequate explanation, were seeking to clarify what efforts are being undertaken to monitor developments relating to these alleged facilities in Burma. What is it that we are doing? What does monitoring mean in this capacity? What have we done through the various avenues that are available to us? For example, I sought to understand what could be done by the IAEA and by our government in the light of the statement made by the Burmese regime in September of last year at the International Atomic Energy Agency assembly in Vienna. The Burmese junta's statement included a refutation of allegations of a nuclear weapons program. Burma has two obsolete IAEA agreements and has failed to execute the additional protocol. We have nothing more to go on than what they told the IAEA in that forum. The 2010 IAEA report declared that Burma's nuclear material remained in peaceful use, but they stated that they are now investigating allegations that Burma is pursuing a nuclear weapons program. In December 2010, they wrote to the regime and formally requested access for inspectors to visit Burmese nuclear sites and facilities. This is one of the reasons why it is important that we have the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty framework and why it is so dangerous for Australia to potentially circumvent that framework by, for example, trading with India. The IAEA, under the terms of that treaty, has those access rights; it can seek to inspect facilities.


Burma is a signatory to the treaty, such that they are therefore not allowed and not permitted to develop nuclear weapons. That is one of the cornerstones and one of the most obvious points as to why that treaty is in existence. Burma is supposed to provide the IAEA with initial reports of all relevant nuclear material and to allow the agency to verify the reports via inspections. According to a Washington Times report in January, Burma has ignored those letters. They have ignored the request for inspections, so we have nothing more to go on than statements from the regime. They will not need to rely on international nuclear fuel supplies, or the fuel market that Australia services, because they have confirmed deposits of uranium at a number of sites within Burma, and reactor grade uranium was being mined near Lashio in northern Shan state.


Professor Ball and Phil Thornton have stated that cooperation with North Korea and Iran is being pursued under a fuel-for-technology program. The uranium mining occurs in Burma. Many of the shipments will be clandestine and in exchange they are receiving training from Moscow and technical advice and assistance from Iran and North Korea. Why on earth are we walking into a situation like that blindfolded? This is occurring in our region. We are one of the largest suppliers of uranium to civil fuel markets in the world and yet we are just letting this go on behind our backs. I would have thought, given 250 days to consider the context of the questions that I put to the minister, we would have got more than the throwaway line that Senator Conroy just delivered: 'Oh, you'll get a briefing next week.' That is wonderful; I look forward to that briefing. It would have been nice if Minister Rudd had seen fit—and we did tip his office off this morning that we would be bringing this question to the chamber—to give us a certain amount of information.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  He's on leave!




Senator LUDLAM:
  I presume the entire department has not gone on leave.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You named him. You said his office.




Senator Cormann:
  He has been on leave for 255 days.




Senator LUDLAM:
  His office or the minister. Has he been on leave since last December, Senator Collins? I do not believe he has been on leave since December. I am not being critical. The foreign minister has done great work on behalf of Australia on nuclear proliferation. This is an issue he knows and cares about. This is not an accusation of not caring about the overall agenda of disarmament of nuclear weapons and ridding the planet of these foul devices. But in this instance we have the potential of a very real security threat unfolding in our region and it is impossible to find out if our government, through any of the avenues that we have available to us, is doing anything about it. So the questions that I will put to Mr Floyd—and if the government would like to shed some light in the interim, that would be wonderful—are: is the Australian govern­ment aware of any of the results of the IAEA's investigations, either through ins­pection or by consideration of other mat­erial? And, how have we used our posit­ion on the board of governors of the IAEA? Our position on the global fuel market is presumably one of the reasons we often hear about remaining with the uranium suppliers is that it gives us leverage in these fora. How are we using it? What are we doing on the board of governors and our mission in Vienna to address the very serious prolifer­ation risks implicit in this potential program?


The implications are so serious because there is no such thing as 'safe hands' for nuclear weapons. It is not that the Burmese regime would put nuclear weapons in unsafe hands but thank goodness they are being maintained by the governments of Russia and the United States. No state whatsoever should have nuclear weapons, but certainly not this brutal and irrational regime who likely seek this capability to hold the international community in complete contempt, as it has done to its own people for 60 years.


The world's leading expert on Burma's economy, Associate Professor Sean Turnell from Macquarie University, has said that revenues earned from the sale of oil and gas have provided the Burmese regime with the financial resources needed to purchase nuclear technology from North Korea. Here is another place where Australia comes in. We have no trade embargo, we have no investment embargo, so Australian investors in the oil and gas industry are currently providing the regime with a revenue stream, in the sense of oil and gas exploration, which they hope to prove up to large scale and viable commercial projects. That lucrative business would have to stop because if Burma was found out to be developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program there would have to be international sanctions, as there are around the regime of North Korea. That would obviously do no good for countries profiteering and, basically, participating in the looting of the country's natural resources. That business would have to stop because sanctions would be imposed. That would bite into Australia's $50-odd million worth of two-way trade with Burma.


Australia has the Safeguards and Nonpro­liferation Office. We have some expertise. We have an embassy in Burma; we have a seat at the UN General Assembly; we have a seat in Geneva at the conference on disarm­ament; we are in Vienna at the IAEA. What have we done? That is all we were seeking and that is all that we were after in the questions that we put to the minister. We need to be taking proactive steps with regard to Burma just as we have done with Iran. There are no right hands for these weapons to be in. The government needs to be seized with the matter and actively engaged to verify and support the inspection efforts of the IAEA and we certainly expect that. The government should answer questions within the specific time that was allotted—that is, 30 days, not 250. I am looking forward, still, to a written response to questions 338 and 364. I thank the chamber.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:19):  It is not often I get up to support the Greens on anything, but Senator Ludlam's criticism of the Labor Party in failing to answer a question that was put on notice before Christmas last year just shows how incompetent this Labor govern­ment is. Senator Ludlam, can I ask you a question? If you are so concerned about the inadequacies of this government, why do you support it? Remember, this was the new paradigm? Remember when the Greens got into bed with the Labor Party? They said they had arranged this new paradigm of openness and accountability and answering of questions, and what has happened?


Senator Ludlam, if you would like to move over this side and get your colleague in the lower house to also do that, we will ensure that your questions are answered rather than have a seven-month delay. Even though sometimes in government we did take a few weeks to answer questions, we were not as bad as this government. While I agree with you, Senator Ludlam, on your criticism of the government in failing to answer—and some of the material you men­tioned on the substantive subject certainly is concerning and deserves more than the cavalier attention that this government is giving it—it is pointless crying about the lack of transparency and accountability by this government when you and your collea­gues in the Greens political party are the ones that are keeping this government in power. If it were not for the Greens political party, you would have decent government in Australia now and certainly a government that did not take more than seven months to answer what is clearly a relatively simple question to answer.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  I will be brief. I note that this is a very secretive Labor government that we have in Canberra now. We were promised by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in August last year that this would be a new era of openness and transparency, and how she was going to let the sun shine in. Well, this government is more secretive than anything that we have seen before. Of course, it is not only having to wait up to 250 days and still not receiving an answer; it is also the refusal to comply with orders of the Senate ordering the government to provide information and documents and not going through the proper process of claiming public interest immunity. Given that Senator Ludlum raised this, I might quickly focus on the deal that was done about 12 months ago where the Greens and the Labor Party agreed that any refusals by the government to provide information in response to an order of the Senate would be sent to the Information Commissioner to arbitrate. Twelve months down the track and there is still no such process. The Infor­mation Commissioner refuses to comply and I can only assume that nothing has been done by the government and the Greens to make it happen because there are lots of orders of the Senate sitting there being completely ignored by the govern­ment.


Yesterday, I rose on a question that had been on the Notice Paper for more than 150 days. The Minister for Finance and Deregu­lation, Senator Wong, misled the chamber by saying that the answer had been tabled that day, but it was only tabled in the Senate after I finished my contribution on that particular matter. There was no correction from the minister and she did not even have the court­esy to apologise for misleading the Senate and for putting me in the position of having to talk about it without the infor­mation in front of me. Once I saw the answer that was provided, I found there was no answer to the question; it was a referral to an answer that had been provided to a question in estimates and did not cover the same ground.


This government treat the Senate with a cavalier attitude—and I am not sure what their treatment is of the House of Represent­atives. With three orders of the Senate all on different matters concerning the Treasury, they merged them all into one and clumsily put all the answers together. There were questions 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), and they refused to provide answers to the specific parts. Today, belatedly, they come into the chamber and say: 'Oops, we forgot a bit. We've got to add something.' And I have another one here which just takes the cake. To Minister Wong, in her capacity as Minister representing the Special Minister of State, I asked:


(1) How many act of grace payments have been approved by the Minister since 24 November 2007 where the department recommended against approval.


(2) What was the reason for, the date of approval of and value of each of the above act of grace payments.


Do you know what the answer was? It was a formal refusal to provide an answer which means that the clerks and the administration can now tick it off as having been answered, supposedly. The answer we got is that it is not normal practice to disclose the depart­ment's advice to the minister.


This issue arose in Senate estimates in the context of investigations into allegations of irregularities against the then finance minis­ter in France, Christine Lagarde—who now happens to be the head of the IMF. The allegations concerned irregularities around decisions about act of grace payments. In the discussion at Senate estimates there was a lack of clarity as to the process if the minis­ter decided to approve an act of grace payment even though the department might have recommended against it. As it turns out, we are not allowed to know that information. During estimates the government was not prepared to go into it. The question was put on notice. Having taken it on notice, the government now says that it is not normal practice to disclose the department's advice to the minister.


Whenever the government refuse to provide information to the Senate—and we can legitimately seek it—they have to prop­erly claim a public interest immunity. They have to point to the actual ground on which they propose to refuse to provide that infor­mation and they have to provide a statement of reasons. Yet again that has not been done. This government treat the Senate with absolute contempt. That is not in the interests of good government. Secretive government makes for bad government and we have seen a lot of bad government over the last four years. Open and transparent government makes for better government. If only the Prime Minister had taken her own advice back in August and fulfilled her promise for open and transparent government, maybe we would not have had all the stuff ups, all the waste and mismanagement, all the reckless spending, all the incompetence and all the things that now require multibillion-dollar ad hoc taxes one after the other that have to be pushed through this parliament. It is high time for a bit of openness and transparency in this place.


Hopefully the Greens will be true to their word and assist the coalition in forcing this government to be more open and transparent. Quite frankly, if the government do not comply with our wishes around access to information, we should refuse to even con­sider relevant legislation until the advice and the information is provided. We have to show that we are serious when we want to get access to information. If the Greens want to support us in forcing the government to provide information that the Senate wants access to then hopefully they will stick right with us when it comes to the crunch on things like the carbon tax and mining tax.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (15:28):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.


I noticed the question about the brothel business and Craig Thomson. He needs to get some negotiating skills. It sounds like the BER. I think he was overcharged.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  That was just a throwaway. It is as bad as the BER. The carbon tax issue was raised in question time. Rorting will take place under this carbon tax due to a lack of knowledge and the shifting of profit centres. We have already seen what has happened in Europe with the ETS—and this tax is a progression towards an ETS—where they had to shut it down because of the rorting. What we are expecting to do in Australia is give countries like Columbia a pass-the-parcel commission process for companies anywhere around the planet to acquire a carbon credit for the carbon tax. I would not have any idea of how you would supervise that, given that we cannot even supervise our own tax because of places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. God knows it will be a feast for lawyers and accountants, but I bet a lot of that money will not find its way to the coffers that the government supposes it is going to find its way to.


The government has the hide, as part of the bargaining and politics of saying 'we must have a carbon tax', to put a proposition to the people of Australia that there will be no additions to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme until we are back in the black. What sort of a tax is that? What sort of blackmail is that? It is outrageous that people who need new medicines and new cures to come onto the PBS are going to be denied them. Unless you have enough money, the PBS is going to be closed up until we get back into surplus.


I also note that a direct effect of the carbon tax is that any abattoir that is killing 24,999 cattle is excluded, but if it kills one more it will be included. What sort of an arrangement is that? The absolute thoughtlessness of the carbon tax and the impracticality of the implementation of the carbon tax is typical of the failures of this government, whether it was pink batts or the BER. No-one is worried about the good school buildings. That is all good. It is just that they cost double what they should have cost.


I suggest that the lawyers and accountants are going to be the winners in this just like in the coal seam mining episode, where the lawyers are getting $2,500 for every $1,500 that the cocky gets. As Senator Joyce noted, the lawyers get $2,500 for negotiating an arrangement for one well but the cocky gets $1,500. Where is all this going to finish up? With great respect, forget the tax.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (15:32):  It seems that Senator Heffernan was taking note of all coalition questions during question time today. There is one particular aspect that I would like to focus on. Whilst the PBS was not a subject canvassed in any sense during question time today—and I doubt the accuracy of the way that Senator Heffernan has characterised the situation—and I could possibly spend all my time talking about the strength of the Australian economy, I think it is worthwhile to note that four of the coalition's five questions focused on matters related to protecting our environment, and I commend the opposition for that. The tone of that approach was something that I would probably question, but four of their questions related to protect­ing the environment and I think that that is a worthwhile focus for our question time today.


I will spend a moment on just one of those. Senator Fifield raised questions about community organisations and how they might manage the transition. Indeed, he did not raise the issue of transition; he mentioned increases in running costs. But as he and many of his colleagues who supported a carbon tax in the past know well, it is not about increasing running costs but about promoting more environmentally sensitive behaviour, including by organisations such as the Scouts and other community organ­isations. Householders will be compensated for any increased costs that might arise, but community organisations are also going to be supported in making transitions to more environmentally sensitive behaviour.


On the general point, I am pleased that this has been a subject for question time today because the government is committed to introducing a carbon price. It is the right thing to do for our economy and our environ­ment, and we will keep explaining our policy to the public. A carbon price will put a price tag on the pollution of around 500 big polluters, and more than half of the revenue raised will be used to assist households through tax cuts, increases in family pay­ments, and higher pensions and benefits. Senator Arbib added further information about the other support for community organisations to make the transition to more environmentally sensitive behaviour.


What Senator Fifield highlighted was that the alternative policy, the Tony Abbott policy—which will subsidise polluters, cost households $1,300 a year and generate a $70 billion black hole—is in denial. What Senator Fifield highlighted is that direct action is not about real action. It is not about assisting community organisations to make a transition to more environmentally sensitive behaviour. It is not about using a price signal to drive change in behaviour. In the nature of his question he highlights very well that direct action is not about real action but is of course, as was also highlighted today, about a very expensive plan to subsidise the big polluters. This is why, as Senator Wong pointed out, no credible economist supports the coalition's policy.


This week we have heard the discussions around how this $70 billion black hole might be filled. The discussions have been around the coalition refusing to indicate what they may do for future services or pensions. It includes, as I mentioned before, a significant increase in costs for households. This is a weeping sore for the coalition. For Tony Abbott and the coalition, this big black hole and their failure to show any plan that will demonstrate real action on the environment is a weeping sore. As we pay more attention to this issue, courtesy of question time today and other opportunities the coalition willingly give us, Australian households and the Australian public will eventually under­stand the Gillard government's policies on environmental issues—and on this occasion, the carbon tax—and the lack of any real, genuine alternative.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2011-08-17,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (15:37):  It is always a pleasure to participate in the take note debate and particularly to follow Senator Collins, who has the temerity to refer to matters of tone in respect of those on this side of the chamber. She could take a NIDA graduate degree in tone; she is patronising those opposite by taking some sort of inferior position that she seems to have adopted in her own mind.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Get over it!




Senator PAYNE:
  Unfortunately for you, you will never get over it.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Reow!




Senator PAYNE:
  What was that, Senator Collins? Mr Deputy President, I do believe I heard from Senator Collins, while she was leaving the chamber, a sound that might bear withdrawing.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I withdraw.




Senator Fifield:
  You cannot do it from there.




Senator PAYNE:
  It is not far enough. 




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Payne, you have the call.




Senator PAYNE:


It is interesting that so many people in such a small space can be in such an absolute state of denial as the entire government is—a state of denial about the impacts that its policy will have on business and small business in this country and in particular the impacts it will have on the sorts of organisations that Senator Fifield spoke about in his question today—volunteer organisations and the not-for-profit sector. They will receive no support, no compen­sation and not even any acknowledgement from those on the other side about the impact of the government's policy on their oper­ations. How are small businesses meant to deal with the sorts of imposts that the carbon tax will place on them? 


Yesterday we heard from Senator Wong that people building new houses apparently do not need to bother about a possible $5,000 increase in the costs of building a new home. Apparently that is something we can blithely wipe away with the sweep of a hand. It is not important. But if you ask people who are budgeting to the last dollar in building a new home, they might say that it is important. They might think that the impact of this government's carbon tax on the future of their home and their family is important even if all the government is capable of is being dismissive of it. What will actually happen to homeowners, to renters, to builders, to manufacturers across Australia who are already struggling under the cost-of-living rises that Labor's financial mismanagement has caused and who are looking at a worsen­ing housing shortage? That continues to be completely ignored by the government. We are still waiting for a housing status supply report, which has been overdue since April, and the reappointment of the National Housing Supply Council was not even made until this year when it was meant to be made in 2010. That just shows the level of interest that this government professes in these issues. 


If you are a homeowner already facing higher electricity costs and gas bills and water bills, if you have rents rising above inflation if you happen to be a renter, then extra imposts from the carbon tax can only hurt you. They cannot be dismissed out of hand. How are small business people trying to maintain their own home and run their own business while receiving no compen­sation going to cope? There is no answer to that or to many other questions. Most amus­ingly, when the government does end up under a tiny weeny bit of pressure, what does it do? Minister Plibersek, in the other place, implies that the homes of pensioners on the Central Coast are facing inundation. How is it appropriate management of government policy to make people think that their homes are under immediate threat and scare them? It is pretty simple—it is a scare tactic, and it does not work. The member for Lindsay, Mr Bradbury, when asked to advise a local hospital on how it might deal with an increase in its electricity bill of about $300,000, responded by saying in reference to the imposition of the carbon tax—and let us bear in mind that nobody is arguing that no action be taken; the opposition is arguing in favour of direct action on climate change—



Government senators interjecting—




Senator PAYNE:
  You should listen to this—it is fascinating and some might say hilarious. Mr Bradbury said:


Without taking action, Australia is expected to experience higher rates of infectious and vector-borne diseases as well as food and waterborne diseases.


That is from David Bradbury, the member for Lindsay. How can we take this seriously? How can the Australian people take this seriously? Someone tell Nepean Hospital how to pay $300,000 more in electricity bills. There are no answers coming from the government—there are no answers coming to small business; there are no answers coming to struggling homeowners; there are no answers coming to subbies in the building industry who want to know how they are going to cope. Frankly, there is no hope for them if this is the sort of display that the government continues to put on.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:42):  I concur with Senator Payne that it is always a pleasure to participate in this debate, but it does seem to have lost its momentum in the last few days. It is very hard to see where the opposition were trying to go with their questions in question time today. In part I think that is attributable to the fact that they simply do not listen to the answers that they receive; nor do they even begin to contemplate the facts behind our carbon policy or indeed the carbon debate from beginning to end. For example, Senator Fifield asked about the impact on community groups—how would the Scouts or the Girl Guides or any other community group deal with the prospective impact of the carbon price? The government has a very clear answer to that. Communities need to be assisted when adjusting to a low-carbon future. They need assistance with modifying community infrastructure so that their electricity bills are lower. This is exactly why the Gillard government is expanding the Low Carbon Communities program. It is a program for both low-income households and communities so that community facilities—things like stadiums, education facilities, Scout halls, town halls and even nursing homes—can update their facilities and help reduce their electricity costs. We know that this is something the whole nation needs to do and it is exactly how our carbon approach is framed. We are also helping low-income households with an offset of any cost-of-living increase. We know that, on average, households will have a rebate of about $10 a week and we know that the average cost to households will be about $9 a week. We take our compensation to house­holds very seriously. 


On top of this we have a low-income energy efficiency program. We know these programs work. I have worked very closely with people in Western Australia who deliver these programs. They go to people's houses and assist them in working through what they need to do to adjust their electricity costs. That is a lot more than I can say for what Colin Barnett is doing. In Western Australia over the last three years we have seen electricity costs rise by 50 per cent—that is, a 50 per cent increase with no compensation.


On the other hand, the Gillard government very clearly understands the cost-of-living pressures faced by Australians, particularly pensioners and low-income households. That is why under our Clean Energy Futures program we are compensating households. The questions from the opposition simply make no sense.


I will move on to some other answers. As the opposition has invited me to comment on the answers given by Senator Evans, I would like to pass comment on Senator Evans's answer to my own question. He highlighted that the Liberal Party have again failed to rule out cutting penalty rates for millions of Australian workers. Where does that leave us on the cost-of-living question? It leaves millions of Australian families vulnerable. Millions of Australian families rely on penalty rates. We know that Andrew Robb had the opportunity to give families certainty on these questions but he did not. In fact, he said on 16 August:


... we are waiting to see what industry says the failings are of the Fair Work Act. 


If industry say that they do not like penalty rates, won't that mean Australian workers are going to have their penalty rates slashed? That sounds like something the Liberal Party are seriously considering. They refuse to rule it out. They simply say, 'We're reviewing the act, so we will wait.' (Time expired)

I do not know how many times we have heard this repeated, but the Prime Minister has since said that she will be awaiting community consensus. I wonder if she was informed and really understood the message of the 4,000-plus crowd who attended the rally on the Parliament House lawns yester­day. I had a carbon tax petition at a recent local show and within a day I had 1,000 signatures on that petition—it was absolutely amazing. Normally when you are at a show with a petition everyone runs and hides but this time people were asking whether they could sign the carbon tax petition. 




The community is very agitated about the carbon tax and some strange things are happening, especially for the so-called 500 polluting businesses. First we started with 1,000 businesses which were going to have to pay the carbon tax.  Then we went to 500. Then we went to 400. Now we are back to 500. It is outrageous that the Labor govern
­
ment, which is championing the import
­
ance of a carbon tax, has told the supposed 500 big polluting businesses that the businesses will have to work out what to pay. 





To understand this, the shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage, Greg Hunt, wrote to Minister Combet requesting the list of the 500 companies, but Minister Combet has responded by creating more uncertainty, saying that ultimately it will be the responsibility of business to determine whether they are liable under the carbon-pricing mechanism, using commer
­
cial information specific to the operations of their business.





That is very confusing. How can the Labor government implement such a major policy without a defined list of which companies have to pay? How can they be sure of their revenue projections? We know there are some carbon cops out there—or there will be. Who are they going to go after?




The Labor government


is creating enormous uncertainty for business. The exposure draft of the legislation has only just 
been made available for public comment, and I am told it closes next Monday with some of the bills still to be released. Yet businesses are expected to have analysed and assessed whether


they are one of the supposed 500 on Labor's carbon tax hit list, and that


does not include the extra 60,000 businesses


which


will be impacted under the diesel fuel rebate changes.

I really think we could not be more confused and the supposed 500 businesses that have to pay must be very confused. 


With the current global economic uncertainty, the high Australian dollar and the slump in retail trade, this is the worst possible time for a new tax to be imposed on Australian families and businesses. We should be doing all we can to ensure the financial security of Australians is being protected, yet Labor are blindly pushing ahead with a carbon tax. They do so with complete disregard of the negative inter­national economic situation and the local indicators which clearly show Australian businesses are already doing it tough. For the sake of Australian families, to ensure their job security and keep business doors open, I would demand— (Time expired)

He wants information from Professor West, who has obviously and publicly been appointed to do a job, which should be based on data available from the public repository of data owned by Forestry Tasmania, but the gates on that databank are slammed shut and there is a manipulated effort by Forestry Tasmania and its leader Mr Gordon to prevent the public debate from being based on information which is within those lockers. It is not good enough for him to say that the modelling coming out of that data is available in the public arena. We are astute enough to know that the modelling is only as good as the selection of data and it is the databank itself which has to be opened here.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (17:51): I seek leave to move a motion relating to the statement by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in relation to the import conditions for apples from New Zealand.


Leave granted. 




Senator COLBECK:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


Needless to say, there is significant concern in agricultural sectors, particularly the apple and pear growing sectors, about the import of apples—especially given that, even though this process included the opportunity for industry to comment on the revised draft import risk assessment released by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry some time ago, the sum effect of that was that nothing the industry said had any impact on the decision. While there is a perception that industry has had the opportunity to have some input into and a say in this process, the net impact is that the government has effectively gone with the draft import risk assessment that was released by the government two or three months ago. Effectively the government has gone with the decision of the Prime Minister when she made a statement to the New Zealand parliament while she was there, I think in April, that we would of course accept the WTO decision. Certainly she gave the impression that it did not really matter what industry here in Australia was going to say; we were just going to let New Zealand apples in.


There is sincere and significant concern here in Australia that we will end up with fire blight. The New Zealanders say they do not worry about fire blight anymore; they have learned to live with it. Of course they have—they have had it since the 1920s or so, so of course they have learned to manage it. We are one of the few places that does not have fire blight, and we do not have the expense of dealing with it. Industry is understandably more than concerned about this decision, and particularly the pear growing sector. One of the reasons New Zealand does not have a pear industry is that they have fire blight, and fire blight is completely and utterly devastating for the pear industry. If anyone has seen a photograph of the impact of fire blight on a pear tree, they will know that growers effectively forget about growing pears. That is what has happened in New Zealand. I have had correspondence from someone in New Zealand saying: 'Why worry about our apples? I am enjoying one of your pears.' Of course he was enjoying one of Australia's pears—because of fire blight you cannot get a pear commercially in New Zealand.


All through this process there has been a withholding of information. Industry tried and tried to get access to New Zealand's integrated fruit management plan. They were told that it was commercial-in-confidence and it was not until the opposition demanded in this chamber that those documents be released that they were finally released. When they were released, we discovered that they were largely as prepared in the import risk assessment. All the government had to do was tell the industry that this was a reproduction of what was in the integrated fruit management plan and the industry would have understood that. But, no, the government would not put that on the table. They said sorry, you cannot have it, it is commercial-in-confidence. So of course this huge level of distrust has developed between industry and the government over this process. How could the industry not be furious about this decision and be complaining bitterly about the result it has had? 


The industry through the consultation process actually put some very sensible propositions to the government. They asked that no apples be imported into Australia from orchards affected by fire blight. The New Zealand integrated fruit management system identifies those orchards, because the orchards are treated; they are sprayed. It is very easy to identify orchards with fire blight. My understanding is that only about 10 per cent of New Zealand orchards have an incidence of fire blight on an annual basis, so let us just rule them out. That lowers the risk and mitigates some of the issues. We are going to have just a simple quality assurance program. What we are being asked to accept here in Australia for the defence of our disease-free status is a quality assurance system. 


One of the other questions the industry has is where is the verification system? Where is there a strong process of verification? My understanding is that the shadow minister put to the minister last week a request that we have a completed QA process, a full verification process, before the fruit is shipped. I would have thought that was a simple process that did not step outside the bounds of what is reasonable. Let us have verification that all the things that are supposed to be done are done before the fruit is shipped. Then we can have a level of confidence that there is proper verification down the supply chain, and particularly through the packing process and the inspection process. Even that has been ignored.


Given the science we have had put in front of us that fire blight loses its viability over time, it would have been quite reasonable to impose a short withholding period. My understanding is that fire blight does not seem to be an issue anymore for New Zealand apples going to Japan because there is a two-month withholding period for other pests and diseases and over that time the fire blight bacterium decays and becomes no longer viable. Why not put something simple like that in place to mitigate the issues that might impact on the industry here? But, no, the government has not accepted anything the industry has said and the industry is justifiably concerned. Apple and Pear Australia Ltd said today:


The measures adopted in the final policy and determination for the importation of New Zealand apples are horrendously weak and we are extremely concerned that the three pests recognised as major risks to our biosecurity won't be controlled to the degree the industry requires.


Industry remain concerned about the possibility of fire blight coming to this country and I think it is reasonable that they continue to be concerned. The industry goes on to say:


It is critically important that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service maintains a high level of diligence in New Zealand and that there is no leniency in applying the phytosanitary measures. 


One concerning thing which came through in this process was a statement by one of the representatives of the New Zealand industry who talked about the efficacy of the New Zealand system. There was an outbreak of one of the diseases in Taiwan that the biosecurity system was supposed to cover. This goes back to the issue of the withholding period. There was a breakdown in the New Zealand system which allowed a disease to get into Taiwan. The response from the CEO of Pipfruit New Zealand, Mr Peter Bevan, was:


No system is perfect and systems break down.


That is what we are supposed to accept—that no system is perfect, systems do not work all the time, systems break down and an admission from Pipfruit New Zealand that this does not work 100 per cent of the time. I do not think that is acceptable.


It is really disappointing that the minister has not chosen to accept any of the sensible recommendations made by the industry here in Australia. I believe we are therefore in a situation where our industry has been exposed to the potential for fire blight. We know what it will do to the pear industry and we know that it will have an impact on our apple industry. It is extremely disappointing that we have gone down that track today where the minister has effectively refused to listen to anything industry has said.

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,"<title>Economy, New Zealand Imports</title>",MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,18,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-08-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:02):  I rise to take note of the ministerial statement tabled in relation to the import of New Zealand apples, in particular the risk of fire blight. This parliament has considered this issue for many years. It has been before rural and regional committees many times and we have spoken to people in the department very often on this subject. The fact of the matter is that several years ago officials before our committee accepted that fire blight would come to Australia. That was accepted—it will come here. Let us not pretend that we are having any discussion other than an acceptance of the fact that, whatever quality assurance processes are put in place, the reality is that one way or another fire blight will come to Australia. 


The question then becomes: will it spread? That is the point over which there was considerable contention and discussion. My view is, if you import a disease of this kind, it is inevitable that it will spread. The officials, however, have argued that that will not be the case. Frankly, I cannot and do not accept that. We know this is a devastating disease to the apple and pear industry and we know that when you have it, it fundamentally changes things. It is not just the occasional tree that you might be able to excise; it means wipe out, gone, finish. You can lose virtually the entire orchard or the entire district that might have been dedicated to apple and pear growing. So we know what the consequences will be.


Australians must be asking themselves today: how is it that a nation with disease-free status, with an industry which trades on its disease-free status, would allow these products into Australia and risk that disease-free status? Why would Australia do it? Why would we go down this track? The answer is because of the World Trade Organisation rules. It is as simple as that. I am just so tired of the dedication in the Australian parliament to the extremes of the World Trade Organisation rules of free trade.


The Europeans must laugh at us every step of the way because, while they say they are committed to the WTO rules, never did a group of people subsidise and protect their agricultural product at every turn more than the Europeans. They say very clearly that their aim is to make sure that the European Union is self-sufficient across seasonal and latitudinal zones so that they can always be self-sufficient in food, that it is fundamental to their culture that they be able to grow their own food across their regions and they are sticking to the maintenance of small farms with massive subsidies. Australia can bleat its way around the Doha Round at every session of the world trade talks but the reality is that protectionism is there.


What has changed fundamentally is that with climate change and extreme weather events we are now seeing massive disruption to global food supply. The result has been that several countries have abandoned the world trade system. They have recognised that it does not matter how much money you have; if you have money but countries decide to withhold food, not to sell it, then you cannot buy it on the global market. That is why countries like China, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Qatar have now said: 'Right, that's it. We will trade when it suits us but more particularly we are going to outsource our food production so that when there is a global food crisis we can just grow for ourselves at our outsourced land and water and bring that food back to the domestic market and completely ignore the trade rules.' That is why China has gone out, why the Saudis have gone out and why Qatar has gone out. They are buying up hundreds of thousands of hectares across the planet and the water rights to go with them. In the case of the Pakistanis, not only have they sold the land and water but they have sold a security force which goes with it because they recognise that at the time these food shortages really start to bite there will be hungry people outside the fences who want that food. So those countries will want to make sure that they can get that food out and back to their own countries, where they need it to be. 


The whole set of World Trade Organ­isation rules pertaining to trade around food are now under serious question in the context of global food security. How do you main­tain secure supplies of food in a global market and in an age of climate change in which outsourcing of food production is now becoming a fairly common thing for some of those countries? 


People who are trying to protect Australia's disease-free status are auto­matically accused of trying to bring in protectionism. Minister Emerson is out there arguing, in every second speech he gives, that anyone who stands up and says that we need to protect our disease-free status and go strictly with science to get that disease-free status right is a protectionist and is using quarantine for protection—trying to protect Australian growers against competition. The reality here is that we have disease-free status and that is incredibly valuable. As a Tasmanian, I am more than aware of the significance of our environment in ensuring there is a significant premium, because we are disease free, for Tasmanian product going into all sorts of markets.


Australia is disease free. There are many countries who would, quite frankly, be very pleased if Australia got fire blight, because that would level up the playing field. Everyone would be very happy with that outcome, except the growers in Australia. You would say, 'This makes no sense; we do not want these apples from New Zealand.' The point is that Australia did say that we did not want the apples, but New Zealand took us to the WTO. We lost in the WTO. The appeal has been through, but we lost that as well. The situation is that, because of our commitment to WTO rules, Australia would, if it persisted in keeping the New Zealand apples out, run the risk of New Zealand taking retaliatory action against us big time. They could take retaliatory action against any other products—and Australia trades massively with New Zealand. 


I am very aware that the coalition solution is to introduce a disallowable instrument which would enable the parliament to disallow any part of any free trade agreement in the future. That is a very interesting turn of events. It would make global news because it would mean that the coalition had abandoned the notion of the free trade system and was giving the parliament the ability to dismantle free trade agreements and any parts thereof. That is an interesting thing that shadow minister Cobb is talking about doing. It would certainly shake up the whole WTO process and where Australia sits in it.


From the Greens' point of view, it is essential that we not only maintain our disease-free status and use the best science we have to defend our disease-free status but also recognise that, as long as we have a slavish adherence to the WTO rules, we are always going to be in this situation and we are always going to be fighting. The reason is that the basis on which we export is 'negligible risk'. It is not 'no risk'; it is 'negligible risk'. We say we send our product overseas on the basis it is negligible risk and, as a result, the New Zealanders say, 'You have these apples—since it is negligible risk, it comes into the same category.' 


The discussion we should be having in this parliament is about how we are going to respond to the changed global trade environment in an age of food security and insecurity. How are we going to produce enough food for our own people and meet our moral obligation to supply as much food as we possibly can into a global scenario where people are going to be desperate for food? That is the reality of where we are going on this planet and that is the conver­sation we need to be having. It needs to be a much bigger conversation than just this.


I recognise the stress we are under in relation to fire blight and I particularly recognise the stress that those apple growers and pear growers are under because of this decision. I ask the government: what are you going to do when, inevitably, fire blight gets to Australia? And who is going to be liable? Who is going to pay and compensate the farmers concerned when fire blight devastat­es orchards? I cannot believe we will be in a scenario where that is not going to happen.

Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (18:11):  I rise to speak on the ministerial statement on import conditions for apples. For 10 years I have been chairman of the committee that has kept the apples out and kept bananas out and looked at why we got citrus canker and kept BSE meat out and kept foot-and-mouth meat from Brazil out. This is an insult to the apple industry. What this is really all about is the government saying, 'Let's find a political way to get these apples in,' instead of, as we used to say, a scientific way to keep them out. This is a complete forfeiture of the rights of Australian apple growers. As everyone has pointed out, the import risk analysis, or IRA, on this said, 'We will bring in fire blight.' It is there in black and white. But, magically, it is not going to get out into the orchards. 


The reason New Zealand enjoys our pears and we have not enjoyed their apples is because they have fire blight and so they have no pears. The whole thing is just a political exercise in determination to satisfy the people who sit around and drink wine in Geneva at the World Trade Organisation. It is a lowering-of-the-bar exercise which is going across all trade around the world to make it simpler to bring back to the pack people who, like us, have a trading advantage through being clean, green and free. It is exactly the same as the BSE argument and we had to do a lot of work to stop that. This is the same principle. With the BSE and the beef, the Canadian government eventually came back and we said, 'What about an IRA?' and they said, 'We do not have the resources to comply with that.' The US came back and said, 'Stick it—the American cattlemen's association does not want to have full traceability, they do not want to close the border with Mexico and they do not want to close the border with Canada and there is no such thing as a BSE-free herd.' This is the same thing.


Fire blight in New Zealand is not a reportable disease because it is endemic. What they do is go around saying, 'Oh, God, blimey, it is too high; I won't prune that one.' The evidence is that we are going to have apples coming into Australia from trees which have fire blight. They have accepted that because, they say, it is not going to get out into our orchards. The original IRA said we would have to have buffer zones and so on. Under the science, there is an acceptance that we are going to bring fire blight in but that it is not going to do us any harm—it is going to be under a code of farm manage­ment practices. I note that there is no-one here from the Labor Party to respond, probably because they are all ashamed that a political imperative has taken over the right to keep our industry clean, green and free. They are saying, 'Oh, well, our farm manage­ment practices will sort this out.' They would not show us their farm management pract­ices. They would not let us go to an apple orchard. I know as a farmer that every farmer has a different farm management practice, so that is just jiggery-pokery political garbage.


What are we doing? We are going to go along with it. For God's sake, New Zealand are in court now locked up with the pork growers because the WTO—you cannot have your bloody cake and eat it too—has said to New Zealand that they have to take pork from countries that have porcine reproduct­ive and respiratory syndrome, and they have said, 'No, we don't want to take it because we haven't got it.' It is the AIDS equivalent in pigs. At the same time as they are at the WTO telling us that we have to take their apples, they are in court saying, 'We don't want to take the pigs.'


If they actually lose that case in their court, because it is a lowering-the-bar exercise, the people who want to take this pork into New Zealand will go to the WTO and say, 'New Zealand has taken it therefore Australia should take it,' which was what the BSE thing was all about. The Yanks and the Canadians did not want to bring beef into Australia particularly. They wanted us to lose the advantage that we have in Korea and Japan every time they get a BSE reactor. Bear in mind there is no live test for BSE and there is no sterilisation for the prion of the CJD human variant. Yet, under the trade arrangements with the trade minister in this government, he was suggesting, as were the dead-head cattlemen's council, that we should take this beef into Australia just to satisfy the people that drink wine at the WTO in Geneva.


How much of this crap have we got to put up with? What is wrong with this govern­ment? Who is going to get the sack or a smack in the ear if we do what the import risk analysis says and import fire blight? How can it be and what game is being played that an official can fly into Australia one night and fly out the next night after having had a walk through the Botanic Gardens in Melbourne—which I walked through the other day just to get the feel of the place—found an obscure plant in a whole heap of other plants and said that it had fire blight? What sort of game are we being played here? They are trying to play us on a break. It is a disgrace.


We have only another four minutes all up so I had better sit down and be quiet, but this is not the finish of it. The government must understand that the one trade advantage we have in Australia is our clean, green and free status. As for the free trade agreements, which we enacted with the United States when the dollar was 67c, we now have a 40 per cent tariff against us through the currency, having got rid of the tariffs. Thank you very much.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:17):  I endorse the remarks of Senators Colbeck, Milne and Heffernan. This is without doubt one of the worst decisions that this government has made, and that is a big call. I say it with despair because the implication of this decision is to put the entire apple and pear industry in this nation at risk. It is a case where the decision has been made on very poor premises, where the goalposts have been shifted, and where Biosecurity Australia has failed Australian farmers and Australian consumers as a result.


I agree with Apple and Pear Australia and their statement today, which said:


... Biosecurity Australia (BA) has abandoned apple and pear growers across Australia and the whole industry is now fearful of fire blight, leaf curling midge or European canker entering this country.


Why on earth are we risking our clean, green, disease-free status? This is an extraordinary decision. Is this the thin end of the wedge? What next for our potato industry? What next for our horticulture industry? We know what happened with myrtle rust, which has devastated and damaged the nursery industry across the country. Once fire blight is in this country, that is it; you cannot eradicate it. We have a situation in the Goulburn Valley where they are 10 times more prone to fire blight than in New Zealand, and we can see how quickly fire blight has spread in New Zealand. This is free trade gone mad. This is about opening the door to the destruction of our horticulture industry in this country.


I recently obtained some information from my contacts within the apple and pear industry. My understanding is—and I call on the government to confirm or deny that this is the case—that several weeks ago at a meeting between industry representatives and the parliamentary secretary, Catherine King, the whole issue of how to contain fire blight was raised. It seems that the only way you can contain fire blight is to use streptomycin, an antibiotic, the use of which is banned in this country. It is an antibiotic that Professor Peter Collignon, Professor of Medicine at the Australian National University, has very serious concerns about because once it gets into our food chain it reduces the antibiotic resistance of the population. There are huge public health implications in relation to that. My understanding is that the government's response is that there will be, as a result of this decision, contingency plans to allow the use of streptomycin here in Australia. If that is the case, that is very disturbing.


Basically the government is saying that this will happen. It is conceding defeat. We will put up the white flag of surrender. We are abandoning our farmers. I would urge the government that it is not too late to reconsider this. The so-called safeguards in place will not provide the bulwark that we need to prevent the introduction of fire blight. It is not a case of if; it is a case of when we get fire blight in this country. When we do, the only way to contain it is through the use of streptomycin, an antibiotic, a chemical that is banned for use in this country today. But that will have to change as a result of this decision.


I would like confirmation from the government as to whether the use of streptomycin was considered and whether lifting the ban has been considered in this country. If it has done so it has huge public health implications. I would urge the government to reconsider its position. This is a disaster that is just waiting to happen.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:33):  by leave—I wish to speak briefly to correct a statement I made in relation to my contribution on the decision of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in relation to the apple and pear industry. In my contribution in relation to the decision made by the minister with respect to the import­ation of New Zealand apples, I asserted that streptomycin is banned for use in Australia. I have been advised by the minister—and I accept his advice—that that is not the case. I understand that in relation to the use of streptomycin on crops in Australia, approval can be sought from the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. How­ever, it is currently not being used on apples in Australia, because there is no need to use it on apples in Australia. So I wish to correct that, but I maintain my comments about the use of streptomycin in our food chain and the comments and concerns of Professor Peter Collignon in relation to the use of streptomycin.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:34):  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the response by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that has just been tabled.


Leave granted.




Senator ABETZ:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I wish to briefly note the Minister for Foreign Affairs' response to the motion passed by the Senate on 5 July relating to the ugly boycott, divestment and sanctions, or BDS, campaign against Israel. Mr Rudd needs to be unequivocal in his condemnation of this campaign, as does the government. Unfortunately, Mr Rudd wilted when it came to opposing those in his own party and the unions who are also supporting this vile campaign. The Senate motion which was carried noted with concern the resolution carried at the 2010 regional conference of the Queensland branch of the ALP to support the BDS campaign; initial support for the BDS campaign against Israel by four Labor councillors on Marrickville Council; the decision by the New South Wales ALP to preference Greens candidate and Marrick­ville mayor Fiona Byrne in the seat of Marrickville at the New South Wales state election; and reports that David Forde, convenor of Labor 4A Just Palestine, who supports the BDS campaign, is a frontrunner for ALP preselection for the Queensland state seat of Stretton.


The motion also denounced support linked to the BDS campaign against Israel by numerous unions and called upon the ACTU to oppose the BDS campaign. In an unpublished comment given to the Age, a spokesperson for Mr Rudd explained the government's position thus:


The government has a longstanding practice of  not dealing with complex foreign policy matters through Senate resolutions and therefore did not support the motion as it was moved by Senator Abetz. The government proposed simpler lang­uage and was disappointed that Senator Abetz chose political point scoring rather than making a strong bipartisan statement in support of Israel.


For the record, Mr Rudd's office never proposed simpler language. The evening before, Mr Rudd's office implored the coalition to take the references to Labor's support for BDS out of the motion. The next morning, Mr Rudd's office said Labor would support the full motion. However, just prior to the debate, Mr Rudd's office said they would not support it and would say that it was a complex foreign policy matter. In the House of Representatives Labor also voted to move sections of a similar motion condemning Greens and Labor Marrickville councillors who supported the BDS campaign. The truth is that Mr Rudd wilts when it comes to opposing those in his own party and in the union movement who support this vile BDS campaign. We see a similar double standard from the Foreign Minister in his reply to the resolution to support the BDS campaign that was carried at the 2010 regional conference of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party, his own home division. In his reply he played up the government's support for the Palestinian Authority and failed—and I stress this: failed—to dissociate himself from this motion's support for the BDS campaign.


We now see Mr Rudd recommending to the Prime Minister that Australia abstain from the UN vote to recognise a Palestinian state. It is time Mr Rudd put principle ahead of politics. In his, if I might say, quite disrespectful letter to the Senate in response to the motion, he fails to refer to the detail of the Senate's resolution and to the fact that all Labor senators shamefully voted against the motion. Labor and the minister stand con­demned for their vote in this place and for the minister's response, which does not take the strong principled stance that I think the Australian people would want—that is, a strong stance against the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel, which has now shown itself with a demonstration outside a coffee shop because it is owned by Jewish interests. That this has come to pass in this country is unfortunately a result of the failure to strongly oppose the BDS camp­aign. People now think that they can demon­strate outside Jewish businesses in Australia to try to stop customers from going into the shop and doing business. I must say that it has hallmarks of events in the last century that I thought had been well and truly left behind.


The Labor Party does have to come to grips with this. There are many within the Labor Party who take very principled stands in this area. I simply refer to Mr Paul Howes of the Australian Workers Union—and I do not often quote him as an appropriate person. He has taken a strong stance on this and if he can one wonders why Mr Rudd and the rest of the Labor Party cannot.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (18:40):  I seek leave to move a motion for the Senate to take note of the letter from the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, relating to an order for the production of documents concerning superannuation funds, that has just been tabled.


Leave granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This letter, which was tabled in the Senate today, is just another example of a govern­ment that steadfastly refuses to be account­able to the parliament and to the Senate in particular. It is a further demonstration of a government that is going to new lows when it comes to being accountable to the Senate, even though Prime Minister Julia Gillard promised after the last election that this would be a new era of openness and transparency in government.


Under government's of both persuasions, whether it was the Hawke government, the Keating government or the Howard govern­ment, statutory agencies like the ACCC, the Australian National Audit Office or a range of others, would regularly comply with orders for the production of documents, including orders for the production of documents that were not yet in existence but had to be created. These documents covered a whole range of issues, whether it was in relation to tobacco policy matters or to any other of a whole range of diverse issues. Incidentally, many of those motions for production of documents were initiated by crossbench senators, whether it was the Democrats, or Senator Fielding, or Senator Xenophon and, indeed, some of them were even initiated by people in the then opposition, such as Senator Conroy. In those days government's of both persuasions would ensure that statutory agencies were in a position to comply with the orders of the Senate.


In November 2010 the Senate agreed to an order that there be laid on the table no later than 31 May 2011 a report by the Product­ivity Commission on the design of a process for the selection and ongoing review of the superannuation funds that were to be included in modern awards or enterprise agreements as default funds, with the requirement that—and I am just summarising here—the process be based on objective criteria and evidence, subject to systematic review and, essentially, that the process be transparent and competitive. And of course the current process is not objective, it is not transparent and it is not competitive. Don't take my word for it. That was the conclusion of the Labor government just over a year ago.


Just over a year ago the Labor government released a policy on superannuation in which they promised to refer to the Productivity Commission the task of designing a process that is open, transparent and competitive when it comes to the selection of default superannuation funds. However, after the election Prime Minister Julia Gillard appointed Bill Shorten as the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and he is very unenthusiastic about doing anything that would remove the current closed shop, anti-competitive arrangements that are in place when it comes to the selection of default superannuation funds under modern awards. This process is quite disgraceful both in substance and process. We passed an order here in November asking for this report to be provided by the end of May 2011. Initially we got some sort of informal advice that 'we don't really think that we can do this; we don't really think that we can comply with this order unless we have got a direction from the minister to do so.' Of course, the minister wants to be able to hold on to this anticompetitive advantage for union dominated industry super funds for as long as possible, and so the minister was not going to say to the Productivity Commission, 'We want you to do this.' But the Senate said to the Productivity Commiss­ion, 'We want you to do this,' and there is a long history of orders of this nature being complied with in the past by agencies like the Productivity Commission.


So the Senate passed earlier this year, in February, another order and we asserted that the Senate has the authority, consistent with past practice and under the Constitution, to require that this information be provided and we confirmed the requirement for this information to be provided by 31 May. What did we hear after that? Nothing. This letter is the first formal advice that we are getting from the government about their response to this order of the Senate, and it is a response saying, 'We're not going to do it and we don't care about what you, the Senate, have ordered us to do. We don't care about the motion that was passed by the Senate ordering us to provide this information. Don't worry about a deadline of 31 May as 10 August is early enough to get back and say that, by the way, we're not going to do this sort of thing.' This is a constant pattern. We had a conversation earlier today and yesterday and Senator Ludlam raised the fact that questions on notice had not been answered for 250 days. I had some questions that had not been answered for more than 150 days. And here we have this refusal to comply with the deadline that is set by the Senate. It was a deadline set in November for the end of May. You would think that was a pretty reasonable deadline, yet this govern­ment cannot comply with a deadline set in November for the end of May. This is the pattern of a government that refuses to be accountable to the Senate. They completely do not take us seriously.


This is a pretty serious issue and related to this is this impasse now in relation to a whole series of orders. There is a whole series of orders, for example, whereby we sought information about the commodity price and production volume assumptions that were at the basis of the mining tax revenue estimates and the government refused outright to provide that information. Supposedly, as part of the agreement between the government and the Greens and as part of the agreement between the govern­ment and some of the key Independents in the other place, there was going to be this process where, whenever there was a dispute between the Senate and the government about matters of public interest disclosure and a Senate order had votes on the floor against the decision of a minister, the Information Commissioner would arbitrate on the release of relevant documents and report to both houses. That was a year ago. The government entered into this agreement and we have now got a whole plethora of orders on the books whereby the Senate has sought to refer matters to the Information Commissioner for him to arbitrate as to whether it is going to be in the public interest or not for certain information to be released. 'No,' the Information Commissioner says, 'I can't do it. I can't do the job'—refuses to do the job. Clearly, this agreement between the government and the Greens is not worth the paper it is written on.


In the meantime working people across Australia continue to be channelled into default superannuation funds that are identified through a process that is not competitive, that is not objective, that is not transparent and that has the risk of people being channelled into underperforming funds. The best way to maximise value for consumers across Australia is by having a proper competitive framework in place. Look at the recent example of the MTAA arrangements where the MTAA was identified as a default fund on a particular award and where some union trustees on the MTAA fund went to Fair Work Australia and asked for the MTAA to be selected as a default fund without declaring the fact that they were actually trustees on that fund. They were going to Fair Work Australia in their capacity as union delegates to ask for a particular fund to be included as a default fund without declaring the fact that they were also trustees of the fund. This is completely inappropriate. The thing is that I have spoken to some very good people, senior leading people across industry super funds, in relation to these issues and some of them have said 'the reason we are selected as default funds is because we perform better'. That is great. And do you know what: if they were to perform better no doubt they would be selected as default superannuation funds in an open, competitive and transparent arrangement. I think that the minister's refusal to act on this clear pre-election commitment by the Labor Party before the last election is actually not doing industry super funds any favours because those that are good are being seen to be favoured and advantaged by a closed shop anticompetitive arrangement when, quite frankly, they would probably thrive in a proper open, competitive and transparent arrangement. If the government still agrees that the current arrangement is anticompetitive and a closed shop arrangement, why would you wait any longer now before you took any action? The reason the minister is not taking any action is that, quite frankly, he is conflicted when it comes to this. He supposedly wants to remove conflicts from financial service advice provision more generally but he does not seem to realise that he himself is conflicted when it comes to policy matters in this area.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2011-08-17,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (18:50): This year, 2011, marks the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The convention we know today was initially developed to deal with the massive number of people displaced by the Second World War in Europe. We should be proud of Australia's connection with the convention, and we should also be proud of our connection to the negotiation of the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.


We should not forget the roles of Doc Evatt and Jessie Street and their ground­breaking work at the United Nations Confer­ence on International Organisation—better known as the San Francisco Confer­ence—in 1945. The Australian delegation, led by Doc Evatt with his unique intellect, drive and organisational ability, endeavoured to ensure that social justice and Labor values were injected into the constitutional architecture of the United Nations. While Evatt's contribut­ion is well known, I think it is important that we also recognise that of Jessie Street, an internationalist who campaigned tirelessly for the rights of women. She was the only woman on the Australian delegation to the San Francisco Conference. She was a strong advocate for the removal of restrictions on Jewish migration and for an increased intake of Jewish refugees to Australia. She was an inspiring figure.


As I noted at the launch of Ashley Hogan's book, Moving in the open daylight: an Australian at the United Nations, while Evatt's ubiquity and energy at the San Francisco Conference led to the joke that there were 'ten Evatts', a casual survey of what has been written about him would certainly lead to the impression that there were 'two Evatts'. Of course, there was only one Evatt. He was certainly not as skilled in the art of caucus or party management as Curtin or Chifley, but few leaders, before or since, have been. And it was Evatt's misfor­tune to be leader at a time when the internal pressures and conflicts of the party would have tested the diplomatic skills of the most conciliatory negotiator. However, Doc Evatt has been acknowledged around the world as a most significant international figure.


The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees originated in the League of Nations before Evatt was a figure on the international stage. The first steps—the 1933 League of Nations Convention Relating to the International Status of Refugees and the 1938 Convention Concern­ing the Status of Refugees—were significant milestones, but they provided only limited protections for displaced persons. The 1933 convention, for example, had just eight member state signatories, as well as substantial self-imposed limitations on the obligations of those signatories.


At its first meeting in 1946, the newly formed United Nations General Assembly recognised the urgency of the humanitarian crisis in Europe and resolved to find new homes for the millions of displaced people roaming aimlessly across the European continent or languishing in makeshift camps. In 1950 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was formed. The following year, on 28 July 1951, after tough negotiations and legal wrangling by signatories over the sovereignty of states and their responsibilities and obligations in the international system, the convention that underpins the work of the UNHCR was adopted. Australia acceded to the convention on 22 January 1954. That was during the life of the Menzies government.


As an international treaty instrument, it was borne out of the bloodshed and tragedy of the Second World War, but it remains a crucial international treaty in the modern world. While Europe is no longer devastated by a horrendous world war, the convention and its relevance as a refugee classification tool lives on. Throughout the debilitating civil wars in the Balkans, the tumult caused by the break-up of the Soviet Union and ongoing conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, we have been reliant on the terms of the convention to provide vulnerable and displaced people with necessary protections enshrined in law.


In Africa, recent hope provided by the newly independent nation of South Sudan is tempered by events in other parts of the continent—the civil strife in Ivory Coast earlier this year, the recruitment of child soldiers en masse in the Central African Republic and the use of rape as a weapon in the Democratic Republic of Congo.


Mr President, 144,000 people registered as refugees in South Africa last year. They are the victims of war and sexual violence who have traversed an entire continent to seek refuge. In 2008, scores of people were killed after a botched armed robbery started fighting that quickly spread through all of Port Elizabeth. This was a massive and violent demonstration against the presence of Somalis in South Africa. And the reason they left Somalia? Ethnic and religious violence.


Closer to home, the human rights needs of the Burmese people, so often highlighted over the last decade, is widely and rightly reported as Asia's refugee focal point. But so much concern still exists over the plight of human rights in Tibet and for Tamil Sri Lankans in their desire for equal rights in their own country. According to the most recent Global Trends figures published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as at January 2010, there were 2,121,630 refugees in Africa, and 4,524,200 refugees in Asia and the Middle East. That is 6,645,830 men, women and children in only two of the six UNHCR designated world regions. We must remember that no-one becomes a refugee by choice. It is a step demanded by circumstances, so often life threatening for individuals and families. It is a step borne out of the sheer determination of the human spirit to survive and protect those close to them.
