"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-06-16,"—In my speech last evening on the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 I was highlighting the key intentions of this Rudd government scheme which are to enhance the circumstances for women who have a workforce connection and to facilitate that by continuing employment choices into the future. This scheme does not take away from women who choose to stay at home but seeks to enhance conditions for those who seek to continue working. This is an area where Australia’s performance has lagged well behind most other economies.
I would like to highlight the issues around the alternative policy proposal put forward by Mr Abbott where women at home may feel there is a differential in circumstances and payments—and much of this varies depending upon tax circumstances, how many children are in the family and such matters. If you look at the coalition’s scheme, you will see a very stark difference between families who might seek to maintain an employment connection and those where the mother chooses to stay at home. Under Mr Abbott’s proposal, taxpayers, average mums and dads whether they are working or not working, will fund the scheme that will pay very large amounts to some women on very high incomes. Some fortunate members of the community with a workforce connection will receive payments of up to $75,000. This coalition scheme will be a burden on the taxpayer.
I highlight that the government has listened to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry and will be looking at dealing with these objects as part of this bill. The other objective of this scheme is to improve the work and family balance and pay equity issues. The government’s scheme is not the only element of the total picture. There are new provisions in the Fair Work Act that seek to enhance what is available to maternity leave and to facilitate better connections to the workforce for mothers taking additional leave or more flexible work arrangements when returning from leave. These are some of the measures introduced by the Rudd government which complement paid leave. Because they are within the Fair Work Act is not a reason to say these measures cannot be complementary or cannot work together.
I think it is a furphy to suggest that the payment for leave should be within the Fair Work Act and indeed, as was suggested by Senator Hanson-Young and by the opposition, that the entitlement aspect of both schemes should match or be equivalent to each other. I was somewhat astounded to hear, particularly from the opposition spokesperson, Sharman Stone, that the coalition thought the eligibility criteria should match. It is unclear whether this is a new policy or a new policy flank, because once again the coalition have failed to consult. Any suggestion that the longstanding provisions for access to unpaid leave should be changed and that any woman who is eligible for paid parental leave should also be eligible to return to their employment is an interesting concept, and one that has not been flagged with the employers. I will be very interested to see how they respond to that notion.
Why Mr Rudd has suggested that the Senate should get out of the way of this proposal is that, through the Productivity Commission and countless years of consultation and debate, we have a scheme that was built on consensus that finally introduced in Australia prudent, funded and sensible proposals. Instead, now, particularly from the opposition, ideas are being thrown in without consultation. The suggestion is that that they are simply seeking to destroy the consensus.
The final comments I would like to conclude with focus on the issues between the two schemes. As I said, the Rudd government’s scheme is prudent, affordable and fair both for families and for business. Mr Abbott’s scheme is economically irresponsible and will cost $2.7 billion a year. It has been universally opposed by business groups who say it will hit jobs at a time when business is recovering from the impact of the global financial crisis. Those businesses can be expected to pass on this additional cost of the great big new tax on employers which will cost working families more through higher taxes at the supermarket and at the petrol pumps as well as gas and electricity charges. According to the Business Council of Australia, big business is already doing the heavy lifting on paid parental leave as most of their members already have fully paid parental leave arrangements in place averaging six to seven weeks. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Chief Executive, Peter Anderson ,says the proposal is an ‘unfair impost which will not be well received by Australian employers.’
This is where the opposition has been in absolute denial. Last week, at the debate I was referring to last night, the opposition spokesperson, Sharman Stone, suggested she had heard of only one employer who was complaining about the coalition’s scheme—only one employer. Yet here we have, from the quotes I have just referred to from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia, instances essentially saying ‘Please don’t destroy this consensus that has been developed to finally introduce sensible, prudent and fair arrangements.’
Under Mr Abbott’s proposal, offsets will be provided for businesses already paying parental leave, so there is no net gain, so to speak, because some businesses will simply be able to offset or absorb the payments that will be essentially taxpayer funded. This will result in employers having their current parental leave entitlements absorbed into Mr Abbott’s proposal instead. Working families will be looking at Mr Abbott’s sudden conversion, however, to the cause of paid parental leave and comparing it to his inability to declare Work Choices dead. He keeps coming back to it, supporting a return to elements of it. So on the one side we have Mr Abbott refusing to declare Work Choices dead and on the other side we have Sharman Stone suggesting that we are going to improve workers’ access to leave entitlements in a way where they have not even consulted business.
Before I conclude on this point, I should say the other area is another recent plank in the coalition’s policy area here is access to childcare support. Last week again, Sharman Stone—plucking ideas out of her head—suggested that if you were receiving parental leave then you would not have access to childcare support. Once again, she has not thought through this idea. Countless working families have more than one child in the period before school who, if they lose access to their childcare support, are going to be seriously financially affected. Again, I think the opposition has just plucked another idea out of the head and said that if you are getting paid leave to be at home you should be a full-time mother—this is Sharman Stone’s language—and you would not have access to childcare support. I think many working families rightly would query whether that means for one child, for two children, for three children—what are we talking about here? The potential loss of support for families receiving childcare support for their second or third child could be enormous. Once again, this plucking of ideas out of the head by the opposition has not been seriously managed and has not been competently demonstrated.
This is why people look at the opposition’s proposals and say they are just not real. Yesterday, Sharman Stone suggested that if Mr Abbott became Prime Minister their scheme would be in place within 12 months. This is simply just not real. They have not got the details of what they would propose. Senator Hanson-Young suggested last night that what the government was dealing with might not be gospel. I am sorry, but that is more of a reflection on what Mr Abbott says and whether it would be gospel truth or whether, once again, we are dealing with phoney Tony.
Families—let me conclude—need certainty from 1 January next year. They will be able to access paid parental leave because the Rudd government has introduced the Paid Parental Leave Bill and it will become an act. The government’s paid parental leave scheme is fair, balanced, economically responsible and, unlike the Liberals’, does not involve a big new tax on employers. For 12 years in government Tony Abbott refused to deliver a paid parental leave scheme. Now he wants to hit business with a big tax that will hurt Australia’s economy. Families have been waiting too long for paid parental leave and only the Rudd government has delivered it. The Senate should get on with the consensus that has been built around this issue and make this bill an act.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-16,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

There’s no doubt that the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 are a landmark for all Australians. Until now, Australia and the US were the only two OECD countries without a legislated paid parental leave scheme. So we should be very proud that we have finally, albeit belatedly, reached this point.
Sweden was the first country to introduce paid parental leave in 1974. Since then, countries across Europe, the Americas and Africa have introduced varying forms of paid parental leave schemes, the majority providing for between three and six months leave. In his submission to the Productivity Commission’s 2009 inquiry into Paid Maternity, Paternity and Parental Leave, Dr Andrew Scott, Senior Lecturer at RMIT University, stated that Sweden, along with Norway, Denmark and Finland, is regarded as one of the most economically efficient nations in the world by the World Economic Forum. What is interesting, as Dr Scott points out, is that all four of these Nordic countries have the world’s highest labour force participation rates for women, and all four of these countries have substantive paid parental leave schemes in place, and have done so for years. So there is no question that the benefits of statutory paid parental leave extends beyond direct positives for families; it also helps the wider economy in the long term.
Today, women make up around 45.7 percent of Australia’s workforce, around half of those on a full-time basis, and this scheme will improve retention and long-term attachment of women to the workforce. Ultimately, paid parental leave must be about encouraging women to return to work after they have had a child; giving a woman the comfort of knowing she will be able to take 18 weeks off to nurture her newborn, during which time she will supported by the government on the minimum wage. Furthermore, the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme will work in addition to schemes already in place within some businesses.
The Paid Parental Leave scheme will be extended from 12 weeks to 13 weeks. Combined with the 18 weeks to be paid by the government, this will mean that parents who have worked for Westpac for at least 12 months will be able to access 31 weeks of paid parental leave from January 2011. Retail giant, Myer, provides 6 weeks parental leave at full pay for employees who have been with the company for at least 18 months, which will mean a total of 24 weeks leave once the government scheme comes into effect. And car manufacturer, Holden, gives women who have worked with the company for at least two years, 14 weeks maternity leave. Add that to the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme and there are eight months for a new mum to spend at home with her newborn.
The government’s scheme will benefit those who are already able to receive paid leave, and will benefit those who may not otherwise have this option available to them. Research by the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that women are inclined to return to work faster if provided with scheduled time off work in the first few weeks and months after the birth of their child. Experts agree that the first few months of a newborn’s life are crucial. It is a time for parent and child to bond; to nurture and be nurtured.
I know there are those who say this bill is still not enough—that the scheme should be for 26 weeks, not 18 weeks; that it should include superannuation; that it should be a percentage of salary, not set at the minimum wage; that it should include all women, not just working women. But, regardless, we can all agree that it is a start. It is a significant step for Australian parents. And it is something women—and men—around the country have been waiting for.
Let us not pretend this is just a woman’s issue. This affects men as much as women, because if a mother is restricted it also restricts the options of the father. We should be very proud that, for every baby born after midnight on 1 January 2011, his or her parents will be supported in their decision to take time off work. A 2008 report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that about five per cent of women return to work within weeks or days of leaving hospital. If you ask me, a woman returning to work within days of giving birth cannot be a good idea, not for her baby’s wellbeing and not for her own health.
The longitudinal study also showed, specifically that of those mothers who returned to work within three months of giving birth, 44 per cent was due to a lack of paid maternity leave, while over 45 per cent said it was because of lack of money. In these instances, thank goodness this scheme will assist these women with support for 18 weeks on the minimum wage. Indeed, although paid maternity leave schemes in the private sector have certainly been on the rise in recent years, over half of employed mothers still do not have access to paid maternity leave in any form. According to the Productivity Commission, these employees often resign when they have a baby, or if they remain employed, take a shorter time off work to care for their babies than other employees.
An estimated 290,000 babies are born every year, to around 280,000 mothers. Of those, Treasury expects 148,000 mothers—and some fathers—will take up the Paid Parental Leave scheme. Others will opt for, or will receive, the Baby Bonus and Family Tax Benefit instead. Under the Paid Parental Leave scheme, parents will receive just under $10,000 while they take care of their newborn in his or her first 18 weeks of life.
Juggling a family with work is not easy—and going from two incomes to one is harder still. But this scheme gives parents the freedom to choose what is best for them and their baby, and the space and time to bond with their child, while being supported on a base wage. It is important to remember that while this scheme will mainly benefit women—mothers—it will also help fathers in some instances who choose to be the primary caregiver. And there is flexibility in this scheme to allow for parents to decide between themselves what works for their family and their child.
There is no question stay-at-home mums have it tough as well. No one questions the dedication and commitment of women who choose to be full-time mums, and the challenges these women face on a daily basis—some might even say it is even harder than working in an office. For these women, the Baby Bonus and the Family Tax Benefit are applicable, while paid parental leave will encourage working women to return to the workforce.
While I believe this bill is significant and something we should all be proud is finally here, I do believe there is one key feature missing—superannuation. On average, women, once they reach retirement age, have less in their superannuation than their male counterparts. This is because women, on average, earn less income during their careers and of course, they take more time out of the workforce than men. It is estimated that a typical woman will have 35 per cent less in her superannuation fund at retirement than a typical man. So it is crucial that we do what we can to help women save for their retirement while they are taking small periods of time out of the workforce to become mothers.
However, I acknowledge the position of the government and the Productivity Commission as to why superannuation has not been included within the scheme at this stage, and I look forward to the review of this legislation in two years’ time when the global financial crisis is no longer applicable as a reason not to include super under the scheme.
At this time, I note the amendment that will be moved by the Australian Greens for the review to begin in 18 months, rather than after 24 months, and to be completed within three months, rather than 12 months. May I indicate at this stage that I will support this amendment —and I believe that the review will also be an opportune time to assess whether the scheme should be extended beyond the 18 weeks. It will provide us with the information required to adequately review the legislation in 18 months time so we can continue to improve it for Australian parents.
This bill does not present a perfect scheme. But it is a start, a good start. This bill puts Australia alongside almost every other country in the world when it comes to having a mandated paid paternity leave scheme in force. I applaud the government for making this significant step for Australian families. I look forward to this scheme being introduced and I expect there will be improvements made to it in the years to come.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-06-16,"—This is a convenient point in time to take up Senator Collins’s forecast that Australian families will, with the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010, get certainty as from 1 January. Australian families will not get certainty about much at all under this bill because the government is promising Australian families paid parental leave. They will not get paid parental leave under this bill. The government is promising that the provisions of this bill will result in topping up employers’ existing schemes, yet this bill fails to guarantee that that will occur. There is hardly certainty delivered for Australian families in this bill—indeed, far from it. Whilst we clearly support the spirit and the intent of paid parental leave, what is evident in this bill is yet another example, sadly, of the Rudd Labor government breaking promises and botching their delivery.
What about employers’ potential liability for payroll tax? Senator Collins suggests that the government’s regime will be ready to roll out from 1 January. Well, this Labor government has not started in some cases and certainly has not concluded discussions that it needs to have with state governments to sort out potential liability for employers in respect of payroll tax when employers become the government’s paymaster, as is intended by this bill in its current form. The Rudd Labor government and the various state governments have not sorted out the extent to which those additional payments would add to an employer’s threshold for payroll tax or to the amount on which an employer’s payroll tax liability is assessed. So this is potentially another botched delivery of one of the government’s promises.
What of the government’s promises? This bill breaks two key aspects of the government’s promise to Australian families—firstly, that it would legislate paid parental leave and, secondly, that it would legislate it additional to schemes currently offered by employers. Let us go first to the prospect that the government’s parenting payment, which is what this bill is about, will always be additional to existing schemes. The government promised this, but the bill does not compel this outcome. Worse than that, the government’s bill fails to clarify how the parenting payment under this bill will interact with existing schemes. There is no certainty in that for Australian families and there is certainly no certainty for Australia’s employers.
Senator Collins, as the government’s Special Adviser for Work and Family Balance, was quoted in the Australian Financial Review on 9 June—after, I understand, she addressed a conference to this end—as saying the government scheme’s 18 weeks at the minimum wage was intended to be on top of existing corporate schemes. Marsha Jacobs reported:
She told a Diversity Council of Australia event that this intention was not in the legislation but that employees would not view favourably employers that used the payment to reduce the benefits they paid.
Well that may be so, but, Senator Collins, if the Rudd government has the courage of its policy convictions why is this promise not in any of the Rudd government’s legislation?
The article goes on to quote Gilbert and Tobin’s senior lawyer, James Pomeroy, as saying:
 … there was a “reasonable argument” that companies that provided paid parental leave by policy, rather than in a contract or enterprise agreement, could withdraw the policy or change it.
It is very clear from evidence given by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry that, once an employer is in receipt of a payment from the government intended for a worker entitled to receive the parenting payment, there are provisions in the bill to compel the employer to pass the payment on. But it is equally very clear that there is nothing in this bill or in any of the Rudd government’s other legislation that prohibits or prevents an employer from using that payment in full or part satisfaction of their obligation to an employee in respect of parental leave. Indeed, why would an employer not contemplate doing so? Why would a small business not contemplate setting one off against the other when, after all, the Rudd Labor government scheme is funded by taxpayers, and small businesses are taxpayers? Particularly, why would they not contemplate it when there is nothing in the bill to prohibit it happening? If the government means what it says, if it has the courage of the policy conviction that its parenting payment will be additional to existing schemes offered by employers, then why hasn’t it tried to legislate it?
The second aspect of the government’s broken promise that I want to focus on in the few minutes remaining is that this is supposedly a paid parental leave scheme. It is not. The government promised that the scheme meant what it said: paid parental leave, not a government handout. But that is what this bill is about, and it is all that this bill is about. It is about money, money, money; it ain’t about any sort of leave. Professor Andrew Stewart, who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry into the bill, said that the bill would better be called the ‘parental payment bill’ than the Paid Parental Leave Bill. I could not agree more, given that the bill creates a right to payment but not to leave from work. It does not create, preserve or guarantee a right to any sort of leave to accompany the 18-week payment yet the government continues to hold out that paid leave is being delivered under this bill. An 18-week payment is delivered under this bill but not an 18-week period of leave.
Why does that matter? It matters in respect of workers who are eligible to receive the parenting payment—let us call it that because that is what it is—under the Paid Parental Leave Bill but are not guaranteed commensurate parental leave as of right by their employer. Workers in that invidious position have to decide if they want to receive the government’s parenting payment, because if they want to get the payment they cannot be at work. They have to decide if they want to receive the government’s parenting payment and be prepared to quit their job for the duration of that payment so that, after all, they can achieve what should be the object of paid parental leave: help with work and family time and bonding between dad, mum and bub. It should be about family, mum and bub, but the legislation is more about money. This bill places some workers in the invidious position of choosing, potentially, to quit their job in order to access the government’s parenting payment. In the words of Professor Andrew Stewart:
The title of the Bill is a misnomer, since the proposed scheme does not confer any entitlement to paid leave … There will be workers who can receive payments, but cannot take leave from their existing jobs … This means that an employee—(could face)—
I inserted the words ‘could face’ without affecting the meaning—
the prospect of having to quit her job without any guarantee of a return to work … It is hardly unreasonable for employees (or indeed employers) to believe that a right to ‘paid parental leave’ means what it says!
I could not agree more. If the government really means its promise that this legislation delivers paid parental leave, then why has it not tried to legislate as such? Particularly, why does it not legislate as such when Senator Collins opposite criticises the coalition in respect of stay-at-home mums?
What this legislation does in failing to ensure leave for every worker eligible for the parenting payment conferred under the legislation is potentially add to the queue of stay-at-home mums. It adds to the queue of stay-at-home mums those workers who are in the invidious position of not being guaranteed leave to accompany their entitlement to the parenting payment. It places those workers in the invidious position, as I said before, of choosing to quit their job or forget about the parenting payment. And, if they quit their job, where are they? They are essentially in the queue of stay-at-home mums, courtesy of the Rudd Labor government. That is what this legislation does and it is about time that the government faced up to that and admitted that this is a paid parenting bill rather than a parental leave bill.
We have got botched delivery in terms of the uncompleted negotiations with states in respect of payroll tax. We have got two broken promises because this legislation is all about money and little about leave, and breaks the promise that the 18-week parenting payment will top up existing employer schemes. If the government means these promises, why hasn’t the government tried to legislate them? The government knows that it cannot comprehensively and universally legislate either of those two things in this legislation. And why not? Because each of those two things goes to the heart of workplace relations matters: guaranteed leave from work and preventing an employer from satisfying, in whole or in part, a workplace relations obligation through some other means. Both of those things are properly the province of workplace relations laws. And guess what? The federal government gloated about its successful referral of powers deal with the various states to the Commonwealth at the end of last year, and indeed this parliament passed laws to that end. But part of the deal over which the government gloats compels the government to have detailed consultations with the states prior to amending its workplace relations law and, in this case, its Fair Work legislation.
The government has bound itself up in red tape as part of the deal it did to get the states to refer their workplace relations powers. That red tape is around the amount of consultation needed, the amount of time it will take and the ability for states to potentially veto workplace relations amendments by the federal government. Once again the federal government did not really think about it until the eleventh hour. It did not realise until too late, I would suggest, that it could not comprehensively keep these promises by putting provisions in this legislation. The government could not comprehensively and universally ensure both those things in this legislation but it woke up to that too late. It is another botch. It has now woken up to it. It has realised that it would be behind the eight ball were it ever to contemplate keeping those two promises by adding them to amendments which it has said it is in the process of attempting to make to the Fair Work legislation and in respect of which it has kick-started consultation with the states.
The government has realised too late that it cannot keep its promises by amending the paid parenting bill in those respects, and it has also realised that it has left it too late to do so through the Fair Work legislation in time for the paid parenting bill to kick off on 1 January next year. With that not particularly favourable prediction about how the legislation will hit the deck in practice as of 1 January, if it be passed by this parliament, I express my regret that, while I support paid parental leave, this legislation is not about that. I express my regret that this is going to be yet another example of the Rudd Labor government’s broken promises and botched delivery.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-06-16,"—I would firstly like to congratulate and thank my colleague Senator Mary Jo Fisher for her contribution as a participating member of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee in the inquiry that was held into the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. I do take her point about this being a bill on parenting payments, but I am going to use the term ‘paid parental leave’ because that is the one I am used to using.
I think almost everyone in this chamber and in the other house would be delighted that we finally have before us legislation that somehow relates to the idea of paying families to stay out of the workforce to care for their children for a short length of time and to try to bring together in a more seamless way the idea of having a family and being a worker. I certainly support and reiterate the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, about regarding paid parental leave as an industrial relations issue, not a social welfare issue. When we think about where we were perhaps just five years ago, we realise we have come a long way in developing, understanding and accepting the need for paid parental leave in Australia. I think we can be particularly pleased about the Productivity Commission’s work here, the work of Ms Elizabeth Broderick from the Human Rights Commission and the work of many people who developed this. I pay tribute especially to probably a pioneer in this field, Ms Pru Goward, who is a member of the state legislature in New South Wales and who was the first ever Sex Discrimination Commissioner. She was appointed by the Howard government. I think there was a little shock when her report first came out well over 10 years ago on the topic of paying mothers to stay home. We have moved a long way since then. We no longer talk about maternity leave; we talk about paid parental leave. We are, I hope, getting more along the road to actually accepting that this is about parents and children. Whilst mothers still tend to be the ones who do the majority of caring, it is about supporting families and not only about supporting women.
As I said, I was delighted to have Senator Fisher involved in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this. The coalition, whilst accepting this as a first step along the way, have suggested a number of amendments, many of which Senator Fisher has outlined to us. We are not the only ones suggesting amendments. If you look at the little list here, you see there are government amendments, Family First amendments, Greens amendments and coalition  amendments suggested to this legislation. Many of them are extremely sensible and the fact of their existence makes the little performance of the Prime Minister yesterday even more bemusing when he rushed out and tried to take over someone else’s press conference, which in itself made you wonder why a petition with 25,000 signatures needed to be presented yesterday asking that this legislation be passed. It was very obvious that this legislation, with amendments, was going to be accepted by all sides of the house. We had a stunt by the ACTU then turn into a superstunt by the Prime Minister. We had the pusillanimous person standing there and saying: ‘It’s now down to crunch time. We have a very simple message for the Senate: get out of the road, guys, just get on with it. We can’t delay any longer.’ How incredibly bizarre and how incredibly pathetic, given that the work has been done by many others—some of whom I have named—over a very long period of time, that the Prime Minister thinks that he can run in just as the game has finished and say, ‘Hey, it’s my game and if you don’t finish it straightaway I’ll be really upset and get angry and everything.’ It was the most pathetic and sad little effort I think I have seen in a very long time from anyone claiming to have the ability to lead or to be a leader.
I will now just go through a few of the other areas in this legislation that I think need immediate consideration. Firstly, where is superannuation in this scheme? It is not there. There is no requirement for superannuation to continue to be paid. Senator Collins was earlier talking about gender pay equity—a very real issue and one which is about to be addressed in the courts but which is only the first step along the way to fixing that. Nevertheless, one of the biggest reasons for the lack of pay equity is the fact that women do have broken careers: they work part time and they work in lower paid jobs. Because of that lack of super and lack of savings, they end up as the poorest group comparatively in our community. Women over 65 are the poorest group in our community. This bill begins to assist women to continue to save and grow their assets while out of the workforce and having children, but only in a very small way. One of the key measures is superannuation. That was not in the legislation that was brought to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry.
I think the most bizarre aspect of this legislation for business, and one that certainly would not be maintained under a coalition government, is the fact that employers have to be the paymasters of this scheme. There were a lot of questions asked at estimates about this, many of which I asked. For the first six months of this scheme the Family Assistance Office will pay everyone. So the Family Assistance Office will set up their systems, they will get the computer programs, they will organise the resources and they will get the staff so that for six months they can pay everyone. Then they will stop paying everyone and just pay about one-third of them. The other two-thirds will be paid by employers. Why? Why is this scheme like this? Why are they insisting that small business and others become the paymasters for staff who are away? It is a lovely theory but it involves new computer programs and in many cases it involves a lot of expenditure—for a few staff to replace something that the government is already going to do. It just does not make sense. It never has made sense. It never will make sense. Why would you do it this way?
The other problem is that it sets up all these liabilities for employers and uncertainties around workers compensation and superannuation—and payroll tax, for heaven’s sake. I remember the last time someone said: ‘Oh, it’s all right; the government is going to talk to the states and sort it out.’ Yes, and in time for 1 January what’s more! I do have concerns about this. Under a coalition scheme the FAO would administer 100 per cent of the paid parental leave scheme. They would be the permanent paymasters. This is not a job that would be duckshoved off to small business and others who, in many cases, do not have the resources to do it and are waiting, trustingly, for the government’s money to arrive so that they can make these payments.
The amount of red tape and the cost in this system is bizarre. It adds to those many little problems—the subtle discriminations that might make an employer think: ‘It’s all too hard. If I have a choice between a man and a woman for that job, I’ll take the man because I don’t have to worry about it then.’ So, instead of making it as easy as they can, they have come up with other bizarre little ways to make it complicated and complex. Certainly we would be making many changes to this legislation to improve it and turn it into a scheme that acknowledges and respects families, parents and the way they fit within the industrial relations framework.
I am pleased that, despite the Prime Minister’s ‘concerns’ about ‘crunch time’, this legislation is to be supported, with amendment, in the House. I think we have come a long, long way that this can be done with the support of both sides of the House.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I think it is really positive that we can actually agree on something. I am pleased to be able to pick up on Senator Boyce’s comment that we can move forward with support from both sides of the House for this legislation, the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. One of the most pleasing aspects of the debate we are having is that we have people from around the chamber agreeing that there needs to be a paid parental leave scheme in Australia.
Over 25 years ago, I was involved with a group of women in Queensland who were talking about workplace issues. At the meeting—I was a public servant—a number of women came forward and talked about their own workplaces and the situations they faced. One of the strongest issues that came up in that discussion was the lack of any form of respect from their workplace when they chose to have children. They explained that there was no protection for them, there was no paid leave arranged for them and they felt that there was no support from their employers for the very necessary decisions that had to be made about what we know is so important for all families: work-life balance—although the term was not then known.
The really disappointing fact is that, after 25 years of ongoing discussion and consideration and processes being put in place recognising that this is an important issue, during the Productivity Commission inquiry, which went on for an extensive time last year—and many of us followed that very closely—and during the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearings on this bill, women were still coming forward telling us exactly the same stories as before. In fact, one of the most confronting aspects of consideration of this bill was (1) the fact that it must happen and (2) the fact that the kinds of stories that women and their partners were telling us at the community affairs committee and the Productivity Commission showed the same pain, the same lack of respect and the same need that was expressed so many years ago.
At one of the committee hearings there was a young woman who told us her story very openly. I want to put on record my respect for Mrs Puriri-Giblin, who spoke to us about her experiences as a new mum with a child that had care needs and her inability to have any support in her workplace as she was working through the very difficult aspects of having a new child and a partner who had lost his employment—and her sense of desolation. She told us her story in great detail. She took us through the fact that there was a need for her to return very quickly to the workplace because there was no paid leave entitlement in her employment. She told us about the struggles she had when she came back to the workplace, including the lack of respect for her need to breastfeed, and the trauma that this caused her relationship.
All of this shows the absolute need we have today as a parliament to say, ‘Yes, we are going to support the introduction of a paid parental leave scheme.’ People want to talk about whether it is a ‘paid parenting scheme’ or a ‘payment scheme’. What it is is a piece of legislation which finally, after so long, respects the rights of mothers and their children, allows them to balance their linkage with their workplace and gives them that time—that period of 18 weeks. There has been lots of discussion about whether that is the right period. During the discussions of the Productivity Commission the period of 18 weeks came up as one that we could introduce in the legislation, and it is being put in place to kick the scheme off. We now have legislation which we can agree to and which will in some way put in place true respect for women who are workers as well as parents, and that is the core aspect.
In the process of discussion many issues came up, and those will come out through the debate we are going to have about proposed amendments, but I just want to touch on a few of them. Certainly one of the key aspects that were raised many times was the aspect of the employer taking on the role of ‘paymaster’. It is a term I do not use very often but it came up consistently during the discussion. I was surprised by that because I thought employers were the people who paid their employees. I did not think it was any different; I thought that employers made payments to employees. No-one seemed to debate that during the inquiry; there was just an overwhelming concern that, when you have an employee who is receiving a paid parental leave entitlement for a maximum period of 18 weeks, there would be some adjustment in the payroll systems of employers so that they would maintain that link with their employees, keep that respectful relationship and continue to engage with the employee who is taking her—mainly her—entitlement to paid parental leave.
I went through with a couple of the witnesses step by step how complex the process would be. Whilst it is another work impost, it is strictly a relationship agreement between the employer and the employee. Certainly we did discuss the fact that there may need to be some adjustment to computer systems and those types of arrangements, but in the overall scheme of a relationship between an employer and an employee it is my firm belief that that is part of the job. As an employer working with an employee, you make payment. You stay in contact. You have that linkage. And that is a relationship which is earned by the employee who is eligible for paid parental leave having an established work relationship. Entitlement to this leave is dependent upon having employment with the workplace over a period of time leading up to making the claim. It is not someone who has just arrived in the job; it is someone who already is part of that employment relationship. So on the issue of whether the employer should retain the job of making the payments, I strongly support that.
How it will operate will, of course, be one of the issues that the implementation team that is being put together by the government to oversight the implementation of this payment will take into consideration. Over the two-year period there will be an implementation team which includes representatives of employers and employees. They will work with the participants to ensure that they will be able to see exactly how it is working. The scheme will take time to be introduced and to settle, as indeed any scheme will, but I think that the issue about the employment relationship should be, most rightly, between the employer and the employee. The government will provide the funding, but the relationship must continue for those workers with the immediate employer. For those workers who have left employment but who have still gained entitlement to the payment, that will be done through the Family Assistance Office, an organisation which has great experience in working in this way and which will be able to provide advice and support for employers along the way.
Another issue was some kind of competition between those people who would be eligible for the paid parental leave and those parents who make the choice to stay at home. It was an issue very strongly felt by people who gave evidence to our committee, but my personal view, and that which the committee put forward, was that what we have here are two separate payments. They are not competing. There is no value judgment about the choices that mothers make in terms of their payment. What we are doing as a government is introducing a Paid Parental Leave scheme for workers who are in the workforce and who, when they choose to have their child, leave the workforce. They are entitled to take up the Paid Parental Leave scheme. For mothers who are making their choice to stay at home, there always will be the baby bonus in place and also the family tax benefit.
It was quite disappointing in many ways that there seemed to be some competition being established—a division between parents, between mothers and between families. That is not the intent of the legislation. There are two separate payments. Indeed, one of the things we will need to do—again, as the scheme is cemented and put in place—is to work out exactly how it operates and to see the different responses that we have when we are talking to women about how it is affecting their choices.
No-one pretends that this scheme by itself will be the solution for all the issues that face families when they are raising children, particularly when they are starting a family, with all the expenses. Many other things have to be put in place as well. We had considerable evidence about the need for family-friendly workplaces and effective breastfeeding processes in workplaces. That needs to be worked on, absolutely. We also have to look at the issues of child care. But this is an important step towards ensuring that women and their families are able to effectively work and continue their linkage with their employment.
It has taken a long time. Many, many people have been involved, and I know we have mentioned, across the chamber, people who have played a role in this area. I particularly want to mention the role of Sharan Burrow. I know that has been mentioned before, but I have worked with her on this issue for many, many years. Ms Burrow in her evidence to the committee talked about the link between employer and employee in this case. She said:
They know that it generates the kind of loyalty and appreciation that you get when somebody feels that they have the backing and the trust that comes with the income security and the job security of paid and unpaid parental leave.
This scheme hopes to ensure that employers and employees will continue to talk and will continue to have a relationship, and, during the process of making the choice to return to work or not, this payment will be some help in making that job a little easier. I also want to put on record my appreciation of Marie Coleman, from the National Foundation for Australian Women, who worked with me consistently through the Productivity Commission process, making sure that I knew what was going on, and my appreciation of all those women and their families over the past very many years, for only 25 of which I have been involved.
This is an important step forward. It is but one step, and we will have to look very carefully at how the review process will operate. But in this legislation there will be an effective review process within two years of the bill being introduced to look at, amongst other things, the exceptionally important issue of superannuation and other issues that may come, to make sure that this bill is a very valuable consideration for all workers and all employers in this country.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-06-16,"—It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and the Paid Parental Leave (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010, and to follow some distinguished and admirable comments from many of my colleagues in this place from all sides of the chamber on this very important issue. I do not intend to take long in my remarks today; however, I do want to associate myself with this debate and particularly with the remarks of my colleagues on this side of the chamber—especially those of Senator Fifield, who introduced our concerns about this proposal whilst acknowledging that it is a step, at least, in the right direction.
Senator Fifield rightly highlighted concerns around the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of this proposal—the ‘trust us’ approach of the Rudd government that has been shown to be so flawed so many times before. He highlighted concerns about the impact on business and especially the impact on small business: the administrative impact, the cost impact, and the potential for double the payroll tax impost. Those are real concerns, and they are concerns that need to be addressed and considered in a debate such as this one.
Of course, at the heart of this are the measures relating to the assistance for families. The fact is that we have contrasting policies now on this issue from the two sides of the chamber, and it is a delight and a pleasure to know that we have reached the stage that we have of contrasting policies, both of which are a step forward. But they are in contrast, and they provide real and marked differences: the difference between the 18 weeks of support that the government is offering and the 26 weeks that is the international standard, which the coalition believes is reasonable and should be pursued; and the difference between a minimum wage payment and a real wage payment providing an actual, real, genuine income stream for families at the time when they most need it. These are fundamental differences and they are differences that obviously we will take through to the next election.
I join with others in challenging the government to improve their scheme, to make it better, to make it more reflective of the model outlined by Tony Abbott and this side of the chamber. But, if they reject that, we will take any step forward—rather than take no step at all—and that at least is what they are offering.
I do want to reflect on some of those who have brought this debate to this stage, because it has, as many have reflected, been a long debate—one spanning many years, many ministers, many senators, and many public policy advocates outside of this place. They have all done an outstanding job in raising awareness of the need to provide this type of practical assistance for Australian families, for working families—to coin a phrase; it is a phrase that has been used so often in this place—and, in particular, to provide a better form of choice for many Australian women and to make sure that they are supported in the family and workplace choices they make in their lives.
I look back to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s 1999 pregnancy and discrimination report, Pregnant and productive, which investigated some of the discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and the management of pregnancy in the workplace. It started a process that has led us ultimately to this debate today, and I am sure will lead to subsequent debates to improve the proposal that is on the table. That report recommended the inclusion of a review, by HREOC and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, of funding options for a paid parental leave scheme.
That work was continued under the Howard government by HREOC, the department and, in particular, the government’s Sex Discrimination Commissioner at the time, Pru Goward—who, I note, is now the member for Goulburn in the New South Wales parliament and the shadow minister for community services and for women. Then Sex Discrimination Commissioner Goward presented several options for extending paid maternity leave in the report Valuing parenthood in April 2002. That was followed by a final report, Time to value, later that year. Those were the types of policy development processes that have laid the foundations for the broad acceptance of the policy that is being undertaken today, and I want to pay particular tribute to Pru Goward for her work in all that she did in getting us to that point.
I also want to acknowledge some before us in this place who have championed the issue, and one in particular: our former colleague, a former senator from South Australia, Senator Stott Despoja. Natasha Stott Despoja was an early advocate for, and she long advocated, paid parental leave options. Indeed, she, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, developed a proposal, for the 2001 election, relating to paid parental leave, and tabled the first legislation specifically seeking a paid parental leave scheme in May 2002. At the time of tabling that bill, then Senator Stott Despoja said:
Action on this issue simply requires a commitment to get things right for Australia’s working women and their families. We do not need more deferral strategies—more costings, options and talk. It is time to act.
From talking to Natasha when she was in town just the other week, I know that she is delighted that—although eight years have passed since she made those remarks in this place—it is, finally, indeed time to act, and that action has ensued on this very important issue. She wishes that the scheme were more than is proposed—many of us wish that—but she acknowledges the steps that have been taken. I know she would have been delighted, had she still been in this chamber, to make a thorough contribution to this debate—to argue, I am sure, for improvements that she would have been passionate about. But she would at least certainly have welcomed this step forward.
So I want to pay tribute to the many people—on all sides of the chamber and, especially, outside of parliament—who have carried this public policy debate forward. This will be a positive step forward. It will help many of Australia’s families. It will help in terms of our economic productivity in the future. It should not be seen just as a welfare measure or a social policy measure; it should be embraced equally as an economic and productivity measure that will allow Australian families to maximise their productive place in the workforce.
In closing, I again urge the government to consider the very significant improvements that the coalition advocates—improvements which would make a good step forward a great step forward and which would ensure that we get the best of benefits for Australian families and for the Australian economy into the future.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-06-16,"—I believe we should be increasing the assistance we give to families with children, because having children is expensive and families need all the help they can get. But the Rudd government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme goes about doing this in the wrong way. The scheme is a long, long way from perfect. Instead of having a policy that benefits all families, such as the baby bonus, the government has come up with a scheme that discriminates against parents, depending on how they choose to raise their children. It is a scheme that places higher value on mothers who leave their children in child care, to quickly return to the workforce within a few months after having a baby, and devalues mothers who want to spend more time at home looking after their children. It is a policy that gives money to prisoners and prostitutes but ignores stay-at-home mums and the important unpaid work that they do. Mums who stay at home and look after their kids will be about $2,000 worse off because of the decision than those mums who rush back to the workforce.
Clearly put in this context, this policy hardly seems a fair policy at all, especially to stay-at-home mums. Under the Rudd government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme, mothers will be required to have worked 10 of the last 13 months before giving birth in order to be eligible for the payments. Because of this work test, thousands of stay-at-home mothers will miss out on these payments. This work test is unlikely to affect too many mothers having children for the first time, but what about those mothers who are having their second or third child or, like my mother did, who have 16 children? The Productivity Commission has noted that only 51 per cent of all mothers are engaged in paid work 18 months after giving birth. Many parents like to have their children close together, often two or three years apart. The government’s strict eligibility criteria will now force many parents to delay or decide against having more kids. How can anyone consider this to be sensible policy?
Under the proposed Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and related bill, mothers will now be faced with the following scenario after the birth of their first child: (1) rush back to work after only a few months so that they can get 10 months of work time under their belts and still qualify for paid parental leave for their next child or (2) stay at home and look after their newborn and miss out on thousands of dollars in assistance as a consequence. How fair is this choice? What about stay-at-home mums? The government’s policy is designed to discourage women from staying at home and looking after their children during their important formative years and intent on getting women into the paid workforce to help stimulate the economy and increase the tax revenues available for the government. I have no problem with businesses offering a paid parental leave scheme, because it makes economic sense for them to offer attractive incentives to their staff to encourage them to return to work, and ultimately business is about increasing the bottom line. However, profit-making should never be the one and only consideration of the government. If that were the case, no government would ever pay pensions to the elderly or disabled and rural communities would be even more underfunded than they already are. A government’s responsibility is to govern in the best interests of all Australians, not just a select few. A government must also consider the social cost of every policy, not just the economic cost.
Numerous studies show that there are enormous benefits to children who are cared for by their parents and given personal attention rather than being put in the care of strangers with 50 other children in long day care centres, and it would seem that the Rudd government has failed to properly consider this benefit. I am not suggesting for a moment that women should not want to have careers. I also understand that there are many women who would like to spend more time at home looking after their children but their financial situation makes this next to impossible. Similarly, I am in no way advocating cutting the amount of money that we give to families, rather quite the opposite. I believe we should be increasing the assistance that we give to families with children, because having children is expensive and families need all the help they can get. However, this help should be across the board, not just for those families with mothers in the workforce. Instead, we have the government scheme which enshrines into law a policy which ignores the value of the work performed by mothers who stay at home and look after their children. It makes a judgment call on what is real work and what is not. I do not think any parent who has ever spent a day at home looking after a one-year-old will claim that it was a relaxing day off.
The government’s scheme treats underpaid childcare work as the lowest form of work. In fact, it does not even classify it as work. Most incredibly, even prisoners and prostitutes are valued more highly than stay-at-home mums. It is a disgrace, and this is part of Labor policy. That is right. Under the proposed scheme, a criminal who does paid work in prison or a woman who works as a prostitute can each meet the work test requirement to qualify for government payments, but an exhausted mother looking after three small children at home cannot. It is outrageous. What kinds of values is the Rudd government sending the community when prisoners and prostitutes are more highly valued than stay-at-home mums? It is a disgrace. The truth is that the government scheme does have holes in it, probably more than swiss cheese. Also, unlike the baby bonus which stay-at-home mothers can apply for and which is means-tested based on whether the total family income exceeds $150,000, the Paid Parental Leave scheme looks only at how much money the mother earns. Again, this is further discrimination against stay-at-home mothers by having one set of rules for them and another set of more generous rules for women in the workforce.
The government’s scheme also imposes a huge financial cost on businesses and forces small businesses to wade through even more red tape. It makes employers the paymaster instead of the Family Assistance Office, costing businesses $197 million in the first year alone. It makes no sense to set up the Family Assistance Office to be able to administer these payments and then force businesses to take the responsibility for some of these payments at a huge cost to their bottom line. Family First believes that all payments should come through the Family Assistance Office, leaving businesses without the headache of more red tape and allowing them to get on with running their business.
Another huge flaw in the bill is the fact that people who have late-term abortions would still be eligible to receive paid parental leave payments. That is right. Under this bill drug addicts and welfare cheats can rort the system and get paid parental leave money for nothing. Drug addicts and welfare cheats can get pregnant, then after 20 weeks have an abortion and still pocket the government’s cash. It is absolutely ridiculous and it makes you wonder whether the government is making policy on the run again. This was a loophole which was discovered in the baby bonus legislation, and I cannot understand why the government has been so careless as to make the mistake again and is then too stubborn to fix it up.
A recent Galaxy poll showed that 68 per cent of people thought there should be equal funding for all mothers. I will say that again. A recent Galaxy poll showed that 68 per cent of people thought there should be equal funding for all mothers irrespective of whether they engage in paid work in the workforce or do unpaid work as stay-at-home mothers. This is something the Rudd government clearly has not understood. What is more, hundreds of people signed up to my petition calling for equal help for all mums just a couple of hours after it was put up on my website. These figures are compelling and prove that the Rudd government’s scheme as it currently stands is out of touch with the views of the general population.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate. The Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010 and related bill are important pieces of legislation because the package of bills will introduce Australia’s first national government funded Paid Parental Leave scheme from 1 January next year. This is a significant economic and social reform for Australia’s families and for Australian employers.
The Rudd government has produced a Paid Parental Leave scheme that will provide financial support and certainty to families at a time when they need it most. Importantly, we will also be helping business to retain their skilled staff and to reap the benefits of family-friendly policies. This government has committed $1.042 billion over five years to establish a national Paid Parental Leave scheme that will encourage women to stay connected with the workforce and with their careers while helping them to balance their work and family lives. The primary objective of the Paid Parental Leave scheme is to enhance child and maternal health and development by enabling mothers to spend longer caring full time for their newborn child. Again, we want to facilitate women’s workforce participation because this, of course, will improve Australia’s productivity.
The scheme promotes gender equity and encourages work and family life balance. This is particularly so for Australian women who have long been juggling family responsibilities with the responsibilities and aspirations of their careers and their working lives. Taking time off to look after a newborn baby is a normal part of a woman’s working life not an abandonment of her working life. This scheme is a culmination of much consideration and consultation with a range of groups over a two-year period and before that it has been a conversation that has been had for more than a decade. Many of the speakers in today’s debate have contributed some perspectives around that long period of consultation, and we believe that the scheme balances the needs of all parties, businesses and families. The opposition, while having affirmed paid parental leave as a valid workplace entitlement rather than a social security measure, has also asserted that this bill:
… places a totally unnecessary impost on Australian businesses by requiring employers to act as paymasters for eligible employees …
It is precisely because this government sees our Paid Parental Leave scheme as an entitlement for women participating in the workforce that we are asking employers to provide parental leave pay to their eligible long-term employees just as they currently pay these employees their other workplace entitlements, their annual leave, their sick leave and other forms of leave.
Paid parental leave should be considered a normal part of employers supporting women to take leave from work to care for their new child. Employers will only have to pay parental leave payments to their long-term employees not to people who will be returning to work for them. The Family Assistance Office will make payments to other women. These arrangements balance the interests of women and employers, and employers will reap the benefits from their participation through their retention of skilled staff.
Despite complaints from some, women on low salaries are the big winners from this new scheme. Precisely because these women usually have no paid parental leave under their employment arrangements, the government is funding 18 weeks at the national minimum wage for all eligible women who meet the paid parental leave work test. In relation to superannuation and paid parental leave the government has said that we will review the scheme in two years time and the introduction of superannuation will be one of the matters considered then.
The Productivity Commission has estimated that women will take an extra 10 weeks off on average further to the 37 weeks they take now. This means that many mothers will be taking most of a year off to care for their babies, which is well above the minimum six-month period recommended by the World Health Organisation to give mothers the opportunity to breastfeed their infants. This again is real support for mothers and their families.
Some have commented that the new legislation is an impost on business. Well, employers will have six months to understand and adjust to the scheme before they are required to pay paid parental leave pay from 1 July 2011. They can, though, choose to participate earlier if they want to. To give business this adjustment time, the Family Assistance Office will provide parental leave pay during the first six months to claimants who are not paid by their employers. This scheme has been designed so that employers will not have to work out if their employee is eligible; the Family Assistance Office will do all of this work and then inform employers of their role. Employers will not be out of pocket through making the parental leave payments. The Family Assistance Office will send sufficient funds to the employer before the payment date, and their cash flow will not be affected. Businesses will not need to change their payroll systems, because full funding will be provided before the payment date so that payments can be made in line with their existing pay cycle.
The system will soon become familiar to businesses once they start to make payments. Many small and medium-sized businesses that currently offer no or minimal parental leave pay will find this scheme most beneficial. This is what businesses have actually told us. This scheme will allow business to benefit from employee loyalty and retention of skilled labour without having to pay for it and without a new tax or levy.
There is no scope for employers to absorb parental leave pay into existing employer funded schemes and withhold parental leave pay owed to an employee. Employers cannot use this parental leave pay to offset an existing employer funded scheme. The legislation requires employers to provide parental leave pay to their employees if they have been funded to do so.
In summing up this landmark legislation, I remind the Senate that this scheme is based on sound evidence, on rigorous analysis of that evidence by the Productivity Commission and on consultation with all stakeholders over more than two years. We have released an exposure draft and we have had a Senate inquiry into the main bill, and this is considered open and transparent policy development undertaken over a very reasonable period of time. The scheme meets the needs of a broad range of women and their employers and balances many interests, and we believe that that balance is right. Women get 18 weeks of parental leave pay to take time off work, and this is in addition to their current workplace entitlements. Their employers are funded to make the new payments and are not subjected to any new taxes or levies. Costs involved in paying employees will be tax deductible for businesses, and the Australian people get an affordable scheme which will help to increase women’s workplace participation and alleviate the impacts of an ageing population on the workforce. This is a scheme that Australia’s working women want us to deliver, and I urge all senators to support the bill.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I rise on a matter of public interest concerning the brutal murder of trade unionists and the continued violation of trade unionists’ rights in developing countries around the world. There have been attacks on workers’ rights in this country, but those attacks on workers’ rights were not of the type that are mounted against workers in developing countries.
In November 2007 in this country a message was sent by the Australian community to the coalition that rights at work were important for working people, and the community rejected Work Choices and all of the baggage that Work Choices brought to bear on ordinary Australians, such as 3½ million workers denied any unfair dismissal rights under Work Choices and no effective independent umpire to provide any fairness and equity in the workplace. Millions of Australians had real pay cuts of $97.75 a week when the minimum wage was cut. Hundreds of thousands of workers were pushed onto individual contracts where 70 per cent lost shift loadings, 68 per cent lost their annual leave loadings, 65 per cent lost their penalty rates, 49 per cent lost their overtime loadings and 25 per cent no longer had public holidays. We know that the coalition want to go back to Work Choices. They want to go back to a situation where workers’ rights are stripped away once again in this country.
But the challenges that trade unions and workers in this country faced under the coalition government pale into insignificance against the challenges that some workers and trade unionists face around the world. On 24 June 2009 I spoke in this chamber about the murder of trade unionists and the violation of the human rights of trade unionists in Colombia. The basis of my remarks on that occasion was the 2009 International Trade Union Confederation report on violations of trade union rights around the world. The ITUC’s 2010 report has just been released. This shows that at least 101 trade unionists were killed in 2009, compared to 76 the previous year. So it is getting tougher for trade unionists around the world—and it would get tougher for trade unionists in this country if Tony Abbott were ever to get back into power. Forty-eight unionists were killed in Colombia, 16 in Guatemala, 12 in Honduras, six in Mexico, six in Bangladesh, four in Brazil, three in the Dominican Republic and three in the Philippines. These are real people with real lives and real families who were murdered because they stood up for trade unionism.
Unfortunately, Colombia remains the most dangerous place in the world to be an active trade unionist. The historical and structural violence against the Colombian trade union movement remains firmly in place, manifesting itself in the form of systematic human and trade union rights violations. On average over the past 23 years, men and women trade unionists in Colombia have been killed at a rate of one every three days. In 2009, 48 trade unionists, including five women and 22 trade union leaders, were killed. Heading the list of those who perpetrate these murders are the paramilitary and guerrilla groups operating in Colombia. In addition to these murders in Colombia, there were at least 500 attacks on Colombian trade unionists, including 11 attempted murders and three disappearances. Measures by the Colombian state have proved ineffective and insufficient, and the murders, disappearances and threats are continuing. The efforts to investigate these crimes are incomplete and the cases reported by trade union organisations are not always taken into account. The law continues to place a range of limitations on trade union rights, despite the recent improvements in labour legislation.
Colombia is not the only country where violation of workers and trade union rights occur. In Mozambique, trade unions are rarely accepted at the workplace. Activists are harassed and collective agreements are constantly violated. Public servants still do not have the right to organise, and the right to strike is restricted. Employers have continued to show their hostility towards workers’ representatives. Anti-union discrimination remains a problem, as the 2007 labour code does not sufficiently protect workers. Legal constraints on private gatherings and workers meetings at the workplace are very strict.
In Cameroon, trade union activism is repressed, notably at Cameroon railways and the port of Douala, with several cases of unfair dismissals and transfers taking place. Organisations considered too demanding or too independent are discriminated against. There are too few collective agreements and those that exist are not fully applied. Workers face prison sentences if they disregard the procedures for union registration. In Ghana, workers were recently arrested and several were wounded by rubber bullets when they were forcibly removed from their steel plant for starting a strike. The labour legislation does not sufficiently secure trade union rights and the authorities retain discretionary powers over unions.
In Guinea, trade union activities were banned by the ruling junta until 28 February this year. After the massacre of up to 200 civilians by the army on 28 September during protests against the junta, the trade unions, like the rest of the population, witnessed a further cycle of violence. On 28 February, the National Council for Democracy and Development lifted the ban that had prevented all trade union and political activity since the coup d’etat on 23 December 2008. Three days later, troops under the command of the Secretary of State for the Fight against Drugs raided the home of the general secretary of the National Workers Confederation of Guinea. This trade union leader, who has often been harassed and threatened with death, described it as another act of intimidation.
In Tanzania, there was good news and bad news. Teachers were caned for asking for a pay rise, while at the docks and on the railways employers tried to ignore unions. In the catering industry, however, the government urged employers to allow union representation, while a court upheld the unfair dismissal claim of the mineworkers union made on behalf of 700 members. Overall, the legal environment is not conducive to trade unions, especially in Zanzibar, where all strikes are prohibited. Remember: these are areas where our mining companies operate and never raise a voice against these issues.
In Brazil, trade union activists and leaders met with extreme and repeated violence in 2009. Precarious contracts continue to be the norm and are used as a means of flouting trade union and labour rights. Trade union pluralism is restricted and the authorities have the right to reject collective agreements. Rural trade union leader Raimundo Nonato was murdered, fishing union leader Paulo Santos Souza was murdered, trade union leader Josenaldo Alves da Silva was murdered, rural workers rights activist Elton Brum da Silva was murdered and there was a murder attempt on agrarian sector trade union leader Elio Neves.
In the Dominican Republic, restrictive labour laws coupled with poor enforcement make organising difficult. Even though the law prohibits dismissals of trade union members and their leaders for trade union activities, it is generally not applied and the penalties are not sufficiently dissuasive to prevent employers from violating workers’ rights. Dismissals of the founding members of a union that is denied registration by the administrative authorities are not unheard of. Due to the requirement that a union must represent an absolute majority of workers in a company in order to bargain collectively, only a minority of companies have a collective bargaining agreement.
In the EPZs, only a handful of companies have negotiated collective agreements. Most of the workers on the republic’s sugar plantations are undocumented Haitians. They do not have the right to form unions or to bargain collectively. Employers prefer to hire them as a means of evading the law and paying lower wages. Workers at Gildan, a clothing company headquartered in Canada, attempted to form a union but were met with reprisals by the company. After formally presenting all the paperwork required to register the union to the Dominican Republic Ministry of Labour, the company responded by laying off workers and coercing them not to join the union.
Against a backdrop of a high-level ILO mission to the Philippines to investigate allegations of the murder and abduction of trade unionists, the killing, kidnapping and disappearances continued. Three trade union officials were shot and killed by unknown assassins and one died after being interrogated by state security forces. Three other members were abducted and one former trade union leader was arrested and charged with murder. Army personnel also harass and intimidate striking workers.
Apart from the egregious violations of workers’ human and trade union rights that occur in these countries, they have something else in common: they are host to the operations of some of the biggest mining companies in the world that here in Australia are claiming in hysterical terms that reform of the way in which the extraction of our finite resources is taxed makes Australia the biggest source of sovereign risk they face anywhere in the world.
BHP Billiton mines coal and nickel in Colombia as well as bauxite in Mozambique, Suriname and Brazil. Rio Tinto mines bauxite in Brazil, Cameroon, Ghana and Guinea. Xstrata mines coal in Colombia, copper in the Philippines and nickel in Tanzania and the Dominican Republic. While these mining companies are able to raise a cacophony of confected outrage at the government’s proposal for a decent and fair resource rent tax, their silence over outrageous violations of human rights in other countries in which they operate is deafening.
In fact, statements such as those by the American boss of Rio Tinto, Tom Albanese, about Australia representing the biggest sovereign risk faced by his company are wrong. Rio Tinto’s assertions on sovereign risk pale into insignificance when compared to the risks that unionists face in countries where he does business on a daily basis. Where are Rio Tinto’s, BHP’s and Xtrata’s voices on the risks facing workers who exercise their international rights to collectively bargain and form a union in Colombia, Mozambique, Brazil, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic?
What Mr Albanese, Clive Palmer and BHP Billiton executives reveal is that these companies are too accustomed to behaving like the sovereign power in the countries in which they operate. They are far too well accustomed to operating like the Dutch East India Company of centuries past. While they may be able to bully and cajole the governments of developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas into dancing to their tune, they will not succeed here in Australia. We will not capitulate to their unfair demand to get superprofits in their back pockets and not in the pockets of the people who deserve them—that is, the Australian public. We will not go back to Work Choices in this country because the coalition will do whatever these big mining companies want. We will not go back to a position where we give up on decent rights in this country. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I thank Senator Abetz for the question. I note that, similar to material put out by senators and lower house members from Western Australia, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate chooses his dates very carefully. He chooses the date of the last five years of the Howard government, not the full 12 years. He is selective. He does not want to talk about the 86 boats that arrived in 1999. He does not want to talk about that. Selective memory!
—Mr President, I know it is early in the answer to be taking this point of order, but the minister has already declared by what he has said that he is not answering the question asked of him. He was asked about the last five years of the Howard government, not 12 years or any other period. He should address the question he was asked.
—Order! There is no point of order. Minister, you have one minute 33 to address the question.
—I think that Senator Brandis confirms the sensitivity. There is a selective nature to their criticism here. They do not want to talk about the 86 boats that arrived under them in 1999—that Senator Scullion was ushering into Darwin Harbour. They were not landing at Christmas Island; they were coming into Darwin Harbour. Senator Scullion was earning a nice little earner bringing them in, and good luck to him! I understand he did a very good job.
We have had in this country three or four periods of increased boat arrivals over the years. In 26 out of the last 33 years we have had arrivals, but we have had peaks and troughs. Senator, you may want to forget about 1999 to 2001—86 boats in 1999 and 43 boats and 5,516 people in 2001, during the last peak in activity. We have dealt with this problem for 26 out of last 33 years. We will continue to have to deal with it. It presents a challenge in public policy terms. But the difference is we are not going to lock children up behind barbed wire. We are not going to send them off to a Pacific island and lock them up for years as you did. Kids were in detention centres behind barbed wire for more than two years. There is a difference between us and I am proud to say there is a difference, but we both have had to deal with peaks in arrivals and we will continue to have to do so.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I have noticed in the last few weeks the Liberal Party are getting sensitive about their position on this issue. Suddenly they want to describe their position as compassionate. Last week it was turning back the boats, even though you did not do that after 2003. Now the opposition spokesman is out there talking about how compassionate they are.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—That is not factually correct, Senator. You are morally bankrupt! Your spokesman, Mr Morrison—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Clearly that assertion by the Leader of the Government in the Senate needs to be withdrawn. To accuse somebody of being morally bankrupt must be a reflection, in any interpretation of the terminology, and should be withdrawn unreservedly.
—Senator Evans, you should withdraw that.
—If that is your ruling, Mr President, I withdraw. The Liberal Party now want to pretend that their policies are compassionate. They are clearly not. The reintroduction of TPVs and the reintroduction of the Pacific solution can in no way be described as compassionate. But they are clearly sensitive to these things, so they want to pretend that their policy of detaining children behind barbed wire was more compassionate than this government’s changes.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-06-16,"—I move:

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Birmingham, Bernardi and Cormann today relating to the proposed new tax on mining.

Clearly the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator Wong, had no idea what she was talking about when she was answering questions from coalition senators about the government’s supertax on mining today. This is just one further example of absolute failure and incompetence by the Rudd Labor government. The minister is not across the brief that she represents in this chamber. Why is that? Very clearly, this is yet another policy decision that was made by a very small circle of two without the proper cabinet processes, without proper procedure and without making sure that everyone that should be involved was involved.
We have a Prime Minister in Australia who has completely lost the plot. Whatever he has touched he has stuffed up. He inherited a healthy balance sheet and he stuffed that up with reckless spending, giving us record deficits and record levels of debt. He was going to bring down the price of fuel and groceries and he stuffed that up—remember GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch. He was going to protect our borders, presenting himself as a mini-me John Howard and he stuffed that up, 137 boatloads of illegal immigrants having arrived on our shores since Kevin Rudd softened the strong border protection policies he inherited from the Howard government. He was going to bring in an emissions trading scheme and he stuffed that up too because he was too frightened to engage in a proper debate about the massive flaws in his scheme. So wherever you look there are failures, incompetence and broken promises. What is the reason for that? We have a government that does not go through proper process. Ministers of the government are not aware of what is being done and why it is being done. That is the reason Minister Wong was not able to answer some very basic questions today.
This supertax on mining is a bad tax. It is bad for Australia and it is even worse for my home state of Western Australia. It is going to cost jobs and it is going to reduce investment, yet this government was waving around the KPMG Econtech modelling report to suggest that, no, things are not going to be so bad, investment is going to go up and jobs are going to go up, all of which is of course completely counterintuitive. The argument on which the government based that assertion is to say that marginal projects are going to be better off; a profit based system instead of the system of state and territory royalties will make sure that marginal projects will be able to survive and thrive where royalties might choke them. Part of that is the big assertion made by the Rudd government again and again that they would like royalties to be abolished altogether, but because the states have not agreed with this—because they have not consulted the states about any of this—they will just refund them. But in the fine print is that the only mining ventures and companies that are going to get their royalties refunded are those that are subject to the so-called superprofits tax.
If you make a profit of zero to six per cent, you will continue to pay state royalties as before and you will not be eligible for a refund of those state royalties. That means that for those marginal projects nothing is going to change. They are not going to be any better off, there is not going to be any additional investment and there are not going to be additional jobs. We are going to have the impact at the top where the government is going for this lazy tax grab from those projects which have a regular and reliable profit, those projects which have taken on all the risk, which have made all the hard decisions, which have gone through the challenging times and which have a regular and reliable cash flow. From those projects the government is coming in and saying, ‘We want to take 40 per cent off the top of that, thank you very much.’
The reason the government is imposing this tax retrospectively is that there is no money for the government in new projects. We have a Prime Minister who wants to fix up his massive deficit and his record levels of debt, so he goes for this lazy tax grab from the mining sector because he thinks, ‘We can sell that to the Australian people—that’s not going to be too hard.’ But he has not explained the fine print. This is a bad tax. This is a tax which is going to be particularly bad for Western Australia. WA Labor members and senators have been missing in action on this. If they had any courage, they would stand up and call on the Prime Minister to axe this tax now. If they cared about Western Australia, they would call on the Prime Minister to dump this terrible tax which is going to be bad for Western Australia. But, of course, the only way to axe this tax is to axe Kevin Rudd. So we call on the Australian people to axe this government. This is the way to change this tax.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,4,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-16,"—Senator Cormann runs some criticisms of the government, but the government’s position on the mining superprofits tax has been absolutely clear and unequivocal since it was first announced many weeks ago. There has not been one iota of change. There has not been one iota of deviation. Why is that? It is because the policy, as announced by the Prime Minister and other relevant ministers at the time, was an efficient policy, it was a well-thought-out policy and it was a policy that was good for the mining industry, good for the mining states, good for investment and good for the future of this country. It was an excellent job that was done at that time.
Why do I say those things? I say them for this reason. What have the mining industry and major corporates been asking for year in, year out? They have been asking for two particular things: (1) a profits based taxation regime and (2) for taxation and other measures to be levied on a project or subindustry basis. They have been asking, firstly, for a profits based tax so that more profits are paid to government as the enterprise or project becomes more successful and, secondly, for taxation to be levied on an industry or subindustry basis. How do we know they have been asking for that? We know that because it was in their submissions to the Henry review. That has been in their submissions to numerous Senate committee inquiries. There was nothing shy or backward about it. Publicly and openly that has been their position—and the position of the Minerals Council for many years.
What did Minister Ferguson repeat yesterday when he discussed the government’s current position, which is the same as it was six weeks ago, with respect to taxation in the mining industry? He said, ‘We’re going to give to the mining industry what it wants, a profits based tax. We’re going to have a different regime for different sectors,’ and he outlined three sectors by way of example: firstly, the coal gas development up in Central and Northern Queensland; secondly, low-value industries where you turn big rocks into small rocks and use them for aggregate and the like on roads; and, thirdly, mineral and metal type industries, which have been around for donkey’s years in this country.
Over the last 30 or 40 years Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory have gone ahead in leaps and bounds as more and more projects have come online, more and more sites have been developed, more and more investment has been made, more and more projects have gone ahead and more and more employment has been created. Minister Ferguson said in an interview yesterday that we were happy to accede to the wishes of the mining industry as they have expressed them publicly: a profits based taxation regime and a regime based on individual subunits within the overall mining industry.
What also did we offer? We offered, by way of negotiation, generous transitional arrangements. Of course, every company, Australian or foreign, that wants to invest in this country seeks to have negotiations with the appropriate level of government, and they always discuss the appropriate regulatory regime, the appropriate taxation measures and the timing of taxation measures. So we said, ‘Yes, that’s legit, that’s upfront and we will accommodate your desires.’
In terms of the existing regimes, everyone in this chamber and out there in the industry knows that there has been a boom in the mining industry in the last 10 or 15 years, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland and latterly in South Australia. The state governments have been less than efficient in garnishing the appropriate amount of resources from their state based royalty regimes. They are now belatedly, latterly, seeking to increase it by 1½ or 2½ per cent, but still the lion’s share goes missing. And who should have that lion’s share? The lion’s share, an appropriate share, should go to the Australian people. Those resources are in the ground, and of course they are invested in the Crown in respect of each state
What are the states doing now? They are turning themselves into mere convenient administrative subunits. One only has to look at what happened in the health and hospitals negotiations, where they gave away the one thing they have been seeking since Federation, an independent taxation regime.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-06-16,"—I am tempted to ask for extra time for Senator Bishop, because I think he was about to destroy and tear apart the great claims the government make about health reform and how important health reform is. He seemed to be saying it was a disgrace that the states had given away their GST income. There were many remarkable things about what Senator Bishop just said. I note firstly that Senator Bishop did not mention Kevin Rudd’s name once in his contribution. I wonder why that is. He did not have the courage to mention Kevin Rudd’s name.
—Order! Senator Birmingham, you must refer to the Prime Minister by his proper title.
—Sorry, he did not mention Prime Minister Rudd’s name once. He mentioned Minister Martin Ferguson several times. He mentioned the minister who was not consulted in the development of this tax, who is playing catch-up to try to restore his credibility with the mining industry and to try to restore the government’s prospects. Minister Ferguson is left playing catch-up on this.
As Senator Bishop, this whole chamber and the Australian public know, only two people made this decision, a gang of two: the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They were the two, they are the ones who did it and the rest of the government are left defending something that none of them really believe is a good thing. They know it is not a good thing because, of course, everybody can see that this is going to have consequences into the future. Those consequences go to the very heart of employment, jobs and investment in Australia.
Frankly, this is a government that has taken the most cavalier attitude to jobs and investment seen in recent Australian history, and we saw that on display from Minister Wong today. Minister Wong, of course, is the only South Australian in the federal cabinet. Yet, when asked about the damage to jobs in South Australia of this tax, she demonstrated not just a cavalier attitude but that she really did not care and had not looked into it.
Today we had leading investment analyst Morgan Stanley come out and talk about the Olympic Dam project. They are not a mining company. They are not spokespeople for a mining company. They are independent investment analysts. What did they say of the impact of the Rudd Labor government’s mining tax? They are reported as saying:
… under the RSPT as proposed the project has no economic value in our view.
                …            …            …
Including the RSPT at 40 per cent, the Olympic Dam project would fail to achieve an adequate return on invested capital in our view.
We think under these fiscal conditions, the project would be unlikely to be developed.
Minister Wong had clearly not even heard of the Morgan Stanley report when she was asked about it. She tried to brush it off as one of numerous reports, tried to pretend it was a mining industry report—tried to do everything she could to avoid talking about it and the threat to investments and jobs in South Australia. This is a $20 billion investment, creating thousands and thousands of jobs—6,000-plus jobs during the construction phase.
OneSteel are a major employer in Whyalla and a value-adder to our resources industry. They are one of the few value-adders, in many ways. They do not just mine the iron ore; they value-add and continue in steel production. What did OneSteel’s chairman have to say about this? He said that the new tax:
… fundamentally changes the economics of the Whyalla steelworks and threatens the viability and, hence longevity, of our steel businesses.
                …            …            …
Unless the Government makes substantial changes to the tax there is likely to be serious implications for our shareholders, employees and the local communities in which we operate.
Those serious implications are that their jobs and the future of their communities are on the line. That is what is at stake here—future investment, because mining capital is incredibly fluid. We saw from Senator Bernardi’s questions to Senator Wong that the Chileans, the Canadians and all those other countries with significant mineral resources are celebrating what the Rudd Labor government is proposing because they know that the fluid capital of mining investors will go to their countries—to Chile, to Canada, to Russia, to anywhere but Australia—because they will offer a better return on investment. The jobs will go to those countries and Australia will be poorer as a result. That is what this tax will do. It will crush the mining industry, it will crush value-adding in the mining industry, it will crush jobs and investment in Australia and it will hurt all Australians as a result.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,4,1,speech
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-06-16,"—In Senator Cormann’s speech on his motion to take note of answers given by Senator Wong today in question time he spoke about payments of royalties. I find that very interesting because it is the one argument that often gets left out of this debate. That is because the proposed resource super profits tax replaces mining royalties. This makes the RSPT more efficient than existing arrangements. This means that some projects will actually pay less tax, particularly the marginal and less profitable projects that the coalition says are at risk.
Those opposite are so intent on running a scare campaign in relation to the RSPT that the first thing Senator Birmingham stood up to debate was how many times Senator Bishop had mentioned the Prime Minister by name. So let me get that out of the way to start with. I am happy to mention the Prime Minister, Mr Kevin Rudd. The Rudd Labor government has announced this super profits tax to ensure that all Australians get a fair share from our non-renewable national resources. That is what those on the other side just will not spell out to everybody. They are running a scare campaign in the media, and both sessions of question time so far this week have been taken up with it, as I am sure the rest of the week and next week will be. It is very similar to what happened in the last sitting weeks: just about every question turned out to be about asylum seekers because they were getting a bit of a media run and they wanted to keep that up. We are happy to take up the challenge. We are happy to point out to people the importance of this tax to everyday Australians, to working Australians, to those people that are not the big mining companies that you are supporting and that in return are supporting you with their billion-dollar campaign. They will be out there, as we heard today from Senator Sherry, being able to claim the tax on their big campaign. We know that you are supporting them because they are your mates.
Earlier you feigned support for working people. Let’s not ever forget that you were the government that brought in Work Choices. We know that Work Choices II—perhaps it will get a different name—will certainly be on Mr Abbott’s agenda should you ever be elected into government with him as leader. I hope that never happens for the people of Australia.
Let us remember that before the last mining boom Australians received $1 in every $3 of mining profits through royalties and charges, but during the last mining boom, as mining profits increased, we saw a decreasing share of profits returned to the Australian people. What has happened? The return has shrunk to $1 in every $7. Although profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than in 1999-2000, governments only collected an additional $9 billion in revenue. Australia needs to deliver a fair share of these resource profits to the Australian people because a fair share will mean, amongst other things, higher retirement savings; less company tax, especially for those thousands of small businesses; and more infrastructure like rail, ports and roads.
Between the mining industry and those opposite we have seen plenty of bizarre claims during this sketchy scare campaign. If they were so worried about it, why did one of the shadow ministers dash out and buy some shares in BHP? I think it was the member for Dickson, but I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong in that respect. The only reason they oppose this so vociferously is that it suits them politically. They will run their massive scare campaign because they can guarantee that it will be backed up, as I said, by those big mining companies. They will keep receiving campaign contributions from their billionaire mates like Clive Palmer. When Australians go to the poll at the next federal election they will have a clear choice, and I hope they remember it. They will have the clear choice of whether they want a 12 per cent superannuation guarantee or whether they want their super stuck at nine per cent. On this side of the chamber we stand for reducing the tax burden on small business and we stand for boosting the retirement savings of ordinary working Australians. We stand for infrastructure investment in the mining regions of Australia. (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-06-16,"—I stand today in strong opposition to this proposed mining tax and to respond to Minister Wong’s statements and answers in the Senate today and to respond to Senator Bilyk, who seems to have similar knowledge and understanding of this mining tax to the current federal member for Franklin. Senator Bilyk has indicated today that she thinks some mining companies are actually going to be paying less tax. I would like to know which mining companies want to embrace this great big new mining tax. Can she name them? Can she identify the mining companies in Tasmania or elsewhere that are going to embrace this great big new tax on mining? In fact, we will be the highest taxing country in the world on our mining resources, so how on earth has she come up with that proposition? It seems to be that her understanding and comprehension is similar to that of the federal member for Franklin, Julie Collins, who today at a doorstop was quite embarrassing. Is that right?
—Very embarrassing.
—Yes. I have heard part of that. I have not heard all of it. It has been reported to me that she said again and again that she is still consulting, but she could not explain how the tax works and what level it is. She indicated that consultations were continuing. The fact is that Labor are in complete disarray with respect to this tax, whether it be the Prime Minister, his gang of four, the ministers or the backbench. What we do know is that uncertainty now prevails. Frankly, this tax is wicked. It is an iniquitous tax. The government’s assumption that the increase in tax on smoking is going to decrease smoking but the increased tax on mining is going to increase investment in mining is simply dumb, illogical, irrational and does not make sense.
I want to refer in particular to the KPMG report that has been released recently. Yes, it was funded by the Minerals Council. I say to them: congratulations—well done. It is a very thoughtful report. It says new projects relating to copper, gold and nickel will be economically unviable compared to and relative to the current tax regime. The fact is that it is going to hurt Tasmania big time. Gold, copper and nickel are particularly prevalent in Tasmania. Mining companies on the north-west coast are particularly concerned as a result of that. That report confirms that they will be unviable. This is a tax that is particularly bad for Tasmania. It is bad for the other states, of course, such as Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia et cetera—the mainland states—but for Tasmania this is particularly serious and the consequences need to be fully investigated.
I am very proud of the fact that Grange Resources have come today and represented their views to both the government and the opposition. They have pressed their case and I say congratulations. Well done on doing that. Last week we heard that they had put on hold $75 million of investment in their magnetite operation on the north-west coast. They employ over 600 people in Tasmania. They are the biggest mining company in Tasmania and they are pressing their case in Canberra today. I am not hopeful for a positive outcome but they are pressing their case and the fact is that jobs are on the line. Wayne Bould and Russell Clark have been doing a good job. I see Wayne Bould is in the gallery today, representing his company and those 600-plus workers. What I do know is that they spend $52.3 million in wages every year. I know that they put nearly $200 million directly into the Tasmanian economy every year. The fact is that this company is threatened by this tax. They oppose this tax and on behalf of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team and on behalf of Gary Carpenter, the federal Liberal candidate for Braddon, Eric Hutchinson, Steve Titmus and Jane Howlett, I say we are as one in opposition to this tax. We will fight tooth and nail. We will go up hill and down dale. We will leave no stone unturned to ensure that this tax is axed. It is a wicked, iniquitous tax.

They have been there for 42 years already. They are a great company doing good things. I rest my case.

—I move:
That—
On Thursday, 17 June 2010:
the hours of meeting shall be 9.30 am to 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm to adjournment;
the routine of business from 7.30 pm shall be government business only;
divisions may take place after 4.30 pm; and
if the Senate is sitting at 10 pm, the sitting of the Senate be suspended till 9 am on Friday, 18 June 2010.
On Friday, 18 June 2010, the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be put at 1.30 pm.
I will not take long. It is important for the Senate to get on with the business of the Senate and the legislative agenda that we are seeking to progress. It is with regret that I recognise that a number in the chamber do not support additional hours for the government business this week. I will recap what happens when we get to the end of the winter session. It is not unusual, and it was usual during that time when we were in opposition, for the government of the day to ask for additional hours for late Thursday or late Tuesday of the first week and usually but not always Friday as well of the first week. But it was always usual for the government of the day, when I was in opposition and Manager of Opposition Business, to ask for additional hours in the second week on the Tuesday, additional hours on the Thursday night and Friday and effectively what I would call a ‘job and finish’, a list of bills that were outstanding and needed to be progressed through the Senate prior to the Senate adjourning for the winter break. The opposition would scrutinise those bills, ensure that they were necessary for the end of the session and consent to the additional hours to allow everyone to participate in the debates, to allow senators to argue their cases about the particular legislation. That is really a Senate agreement, because of course the minor parties and Independents would agree that we needed to finalise the legislative agenda.
What we have seen in the last year and perhaps a little bit longer is an opposition and minor parties and Independents not willing to agree to additional hours in the last two weeks to allow the legislative agenda of the government of the day to proceed. There are a range of reasons that have been put forward. They hang their hat specifically on one main issue: they complain that the government did not add enough weeks to the sitting period. They bring out statistics and a range of information to demonstrate that fact. If we put that to the side for a moment, even with additional weeks it is still not unusual for the government of the day to ask for additional hours to allow the legislative program to be finalised in the last fortnight. Why? Because even over the last 10 years there have been uneven numbers of weeks and they have been interrupted on occasion by elections, which also means fewer weeks than in other years. So the opposition and the minor parties—if I am wrong about the minor parties I am sure they will correct me—complain that there are not additional weeks and argue for additional weeks. The point I am making is that, to finalise the bills prior to the winter session, it is not unusual for us to agree on a rough list of those bills which the government claims and argues are urgent and it is usually settled, sometimes with a little less than we might sometimes claim.
Despite the opposition rejection of additional sittings, and I will come to that, it is useful to acknowledge that the Senate has traditionally, as I have said, sat extended hours and on Fridays. And the opposition is not prepared, as far as I can see, to allow for additional hours this week in similar circumstances. It is disappointing for a government that has an important legislative agenda to progress. The opposition is using government business time. It seems when you analyse the figures that they are using government business time for their own business—in other words, for those matters which concern them. They want to discuss bills that go nowhere. They want to take up government business time discussing issues that do not progress the government’s legislative agenda. It is government business time and should be utilised for that purpose.
No doubt the opposition will say that they are refusing additional hours on the basis that, as I have indicated, the government has not allowed sufficient Senate sitting days. I disagree with this. This government allocated sitting days on the expectation that the Senate would allocate the standard amount of time for government business, but this is not occurring either. In the autumn sittings we have had a record low proportion of Senate time on government business—just 38 per cent of Senate time was given to government business as against a standard of around 50 per cent. So, even with the available time, those opposite and those on the crossbenches are ensuring that the available government business time has been reduced from 50 to 38 per cent. So my complaint is not only founded on the available time for government business but that you are chewing that down to ensure that we do not even get the available time to progress government legislation.
The complaint about the additional week then falls on a hollow vessel when you look at that statistic, because even with an additional week or weeks, if you continue to depress the number of hours that we have available for government business, you still do not progress government business. You are still caught with not being able to progress the government’s legislative agenda. You will still get a request for additional hours to ensure that we have available time to debate government bills. I took the opportunity of providing a graph for the Senate. I know it is unparliamentary, but it does highlight the problem.
—It’s very Kevin-like.
—I think Mr Hockey has also used charts, so I would be very careful about that. The blue on the chart shows government business time. What we have is significantly less government business time available. I table the chart and circulate it to other members so they can see the issues that I raise. I know the opposition will, of course, cobble together a range of figures to support their case, but it is usual practice to ensure that the government’s legislative agenda is finalised. They have been successful, in part, in delaying and blocking the legislative agenda of this government—notably the CPRS legislation. They have also blocked the preventative health agency and the transformation of the NBN. Both were not supported by those opposite. All of that takes up legislative time. Granted, you do not have to support it—
—There should be extra time now because you’ve abandoned the ETS.
—So you are still supporting it? It is good to hear the opposition is still supporting it. It would come as a shock to us on this side if you were saying that you support it.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Enough banter, thank you.
—I simply ask for what is usual practice in this place to be continued with to ensure that the government’s legislative agenda gets dealt with in the remaining fortnight before the winter break. It is not an unreasonable request, and it is a request that this government, when in opposition, sat down and reasonably accepted from the government of the day to ensure that their legislative program was dealt with—not voted for or against but allowed to be dealt with so that votes could be taken and positions put. What the opposition are now doing is ensuring legislation remains on the Notice Paper and is not voted for or against. What they are doing is frustrating the Senate in the tactics that they are using to ensure bills are not debated, their positions remain unknown and the Senate does not have the opportunity to express views in relation to bills.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-06-16,"—How dare the government say that the Senate is not helping them get on with their business. How dare the government say that the Senate is the problem. Clearly the Rudd government is the problem. They cannot even manage to get the number of sitting days this year right. I have here a chart. It shows a 37 per cent drop in the number of sitting days compared to 1999 levels. No wonder the government cannot get their stuff through; they have not set the right number of sitting days and weeks for this year. They are running this place as if it is policy on the run. The fact remains that there has been a 37 per cent drop in the number of sitting days since 1999, so before Mr Albanese in the other place gets on his high horse to whinge about the Senate he needs to get his facts right about making sure that business is managed according to the number of days set.
I made this point last year when you set the number of sitting days. You knew you were going to be short. It is just wrong the way that you come in here at the last minute and try to manage this place on the run. There is no way we can allow you to continue to do this. It is wrong and we will not be supporting it. I seek leave to incorporate a chart in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The chart read as follows—
 
",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-06-16,"—The coalition will be opposing the motion moved by Senator Ludwig. I will put some real facts on the table—in contrast to the assertions made by Senator Ludwig. Firstly, we have the lowest number of sitting weeks of any government since World War II, which is a disgrace in itself. The crossbenchers have criticised the government on each occasion that the parliamentary schedule for sitting days has been put forward. Hansard will bear out the fact that all of us have said we trust the government to run the Senate chamber in a proper and fit way with the right number of sitting days. They did not do that in 2008 for the 2009 sitting schedule when we requested it be done. They again did not do it in 2009 for this sitting schedule. We have criticised the low number of weeks. The government do not like the scrutiny of the chamber, so they thought that they would be able to sneak through the provision of extending hours when they got bogged down with legislation. We have said that we are not going to do that. We are not going to support that; otherwise, we would continually see a decline in sitting weeks and legislation by exhaustion, not legislation by thorough analysis.
Let me come to a thorough analysis. Mr Albanese was on Lateline last night, and he has criticised the Senate for scrutinising legislation too much. I would like Mr Albanese to go back to some sort of politics 101 and understand the value of the Senate in scrutinising legislation. That is our role; that is what we do. The House of Representatives does not have that role as much as we do. We scrutinise legislation and we do it for a great purpose. I also dispel the myth that Senator Ludwig and the government have created that it is the coalition that actually controls the Senate. That is not true. All we need to do is to analyse the numbers to realise that we do not have a majority; we do not even equal the votes. We have one less than a majority so, if we want to move anything, we require the support—as do the crossbenchers—of each other. The majority of the chamber, not just the coalition, has decided that we are not going to play the games that the government wish to play—that is, reducing the number of productive weeks in this place and reducing the scrutiny of the government by allowing, at some point in time, additional hours and, as I said, legislation by exhaustion.
I also go to Senator Ludwig’s comment that 38 per cent of the Senate’s time has been taken up with government business. That is correct. But what Senator Ludwig conveniently left out in that 38 per cent is that that is purely for legislation. The other matters that take up the Senate’s time, to which the government members contribute—and in fact on many occasions have contributed more than any other group in this chamber—are things like ministerial statements, which are purely for ministers; taking note of answers, where the Labor Party and the crossbenchers contribute to half that time; the general conduct of business on a Thursday afternoon for anywhere between two and three hours, where the opposition of the day actually has the opportunity to raise matters—it is our exclusive time; committee reports, where Labor primarily introduce the committee reports and there is a response—again, from Labor senators as well as senators from around the chamber; matters of public interest, where Labor senators get more of the share of the chamber than any other group; and government responses to documents and reports. Again, the Labor Party generally speak on those as well. Standing orders provide for the format of the running of the chamber. We do not dictate when government business will be dealt with. We just follow the provisions of the standing orders that have been in place for many, many years prior to this government being in office.
I suggest to the government that one of the reasons why they are not getting some of their business through—in particular, legislation—is that they have a range of speakers. I can point to many examples where, on several occasions, government speakers outnumbered the coalition and the crossbenchers, taking up their own legislation time. There have been many occasions on which matters have been taken up in the chamber concerning hours or other procedural matters where we have spoken for less time than the government speakers, and some of the issues have been on the amount of time that they appear not to have in the chamber.
I also indicate that, on the legislative front, the opposition has not yet been given proof—which we have asked for—of what the matter is that is urgent and needs to be considered, requiring additional powers of the Senate. Mr Albanese has indicated that we are frustrating his program. That is not correct. This week alone, we are about to pass 17 pieces of legislation. That is not counting the pieces of legislation that have already gone through this week. Tomorrow we will be passing 17 pieces of legislation in what is called non-controversial time. Not only will we be doing that tomorrow but, for the first time that I can ever recall, the Senate will be commencing government business tomorrow with non-controversial legislation. It will not be dealing with other legislation because there is nothing else that is urgent. We are commencing on the non-controversial legislation. Those 17 bills are deemed to be important enough to be the ones that we commence the process with, and we will complete those on the basis that we are cooperating with the government in relation to legislation—in particular some budget measures that the government wishes to process through this place before what may possibly be the last two sitting weeks of this parliament.
I also indicate that the government have deferred five pieces of legislation that were on the list for this week. There are also two additional pieces of legislation that the government might have in the non-controversial selection. We are still determining whether or not they are non-controversial. But it goes to the point: the heart of the matter is that there is no other legislation that is deemed urgent enough for us to sit longer hours or to sit beyond these two sitting weeks. Senator Ludwig has just had 10 minutes to clearly demonstrate that there is any urgent legislation other than what is in the non-controversial legislation tomorrow, which we have agreed to pass through the Senate by the end of this week, but he did not do that. I think Senator Ludwig is crying tears and he is probably just pursuing the facade that the lower house is trying to—
—They could be crocodile tears.
—Crocodile tears, yes; thank you for that interjection. Senator Ludwig is simply just adopting the rhetoric of the lower house that we have no other excuse for failed policy other than, ‘Let’s blame the Senate,’ because the Senate seems to have this dark art of dealing with legislation that gets convoluted at times and it is very easy, from the House of Representatives perspective, to spin, ‘It’s not our fault; it’s the Senate’s fault.’ We are not going to wear that anymore at all.
I conclude my remarks by placing clearly on the record once again how cooperative this opposition has been with this government. I do not know why because we always get criticised about cooperation. In 2008 we gave up an extra 83 hours and, to be precise, 54 minutes to government business from our time and in 2009 we gave up 108 hours and 45 minutes of our time. We voluntarily gave this time to the government of the day. Senator Ludwig is indicating that there are fewer sitting weeks, so he believes that we should be giving more time. We have given more time than any opposition in the history of this Commonwealth to a government of the day, and the government of the day has responded by having fewer sitting weeks. I do not understand why the government is not standing up and saying: ‘We should be so thankful to have an opposition that is so considerate of government business time that they’ve given up their own time when they could have been debating issues of their own desire.’
I indicate, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to the government, to Senator Ludwig and to the Prime Minister that we are not going to do this any longer. We have allowed you to abuse the process, to abuse our generosity and we cannot do this anymore. We have given the government the equivalent of 4.6 sitting weeks for business in those hours that I indicated. They have squandered their time. They have not run the program effectively.
Now they get to the dying stages of this parliament and indicate that they want more sitting hours simply as a show of brinkmanship or as a show to the public. ‘Gosh, we’ve failed on some of our legislative policies. Our legislative agenda is in disarray. Let’s blame the Senate; let’s blame the opposition in the Senate.’ We will not have it. The record is now corrected. This government will not get additional hours; this government need to legislate properly through additional sitting weeks and also to manage their legislation program and not constantly withdraw or change their agenda because they do not have support or because they do not know how to manage the place. They certainly cannot organise their legislative agenda.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-06-16,"—Perhaps I should start by reminding this place that the Greens moved a motion some time ago to extend the sitting of the Senate by four weeks. The government did not support it but, strangely enough, the opposition also did not support it. So while they are talking about lack of time, quite rightly, and criticising the government’s management of the legislative agenda, we Greens did provide the opposition with an opportunity to support an extension of sitting hours so that we could deal appropriately with the legislation.
I find it amazing that criticisms are being made of the Senate blocking legislation when, firstly, the government had an opportunity to extend sitting weeks but, secondly, there has been no attempt to have a leaders and whips meeting this fortnight. We always have a leaders and whips meeting at the beginning of the sitting fortnight before we break for the long winter break and for the summer break because we all know that there is going to be an extensive program of bills.
It happened under the previous government; it has happened under this government. We get a backlog of bills and there is a push to get them through the Senate chamber before we rise. Why hasn’t there been a leaders and whips meeting where all the parties’ leaders and the whips, as the name of the meeting suggests, talk about the legislative agenda, what the government priorities are, how long we expect the debate to last and what bills the government wants to get through urgently et cetera? We have not had that meeting, so we come into this place, we are told the government has a whole list of priorities, yet there is no discussion, as we usually have at the beginning of such sittings, to work out how we could make this place work a little better.
Having said that, I actually question how any senator who comes to Canberra for these two sitting weeks and does not expect to be sitting Fridays looks at the Senate agenda. We always sit on Fridays in the last two sitting weeks before the winter break and before the summer break because we know that there are a stack of bills that we need to deal with. That happened under the previous government as well. I will get on to the government not managing their legislative agenda in a minute but we always do sit at least those two days and long hours and we definitely did it under the previous government.
So what is different this time? What is different is that we have an even bigger stack of bills than we usually have because we have had so few sitting weeks to enable us to discuss the bills. It is disingenuous, as Senator Parry has pointed out, to say there is only a certain percentage of Senate time that has been spent on government business—that is, on legislation. We do spend other time on government business, but this place also deals with a range of other issues that are important to this country and we have quite rightly been dealing with those issues as well.
The Greens, as I said, proposed that we should sit for more weeks. We came here expecting that we would be sitting Fridays. I do not pack my bags to come here all the way from Western Australia knowing we have a full week without thinking that we are going to be sitting on the Fridays of these two sitting weeks. However, the government should have timetabled more sitting weeks for the Senate. They knew very well what bills they had. If they did not, they should have and that implies mismanagement of the legislative agenda. They knew what bills were coming. They knew what we would be dealing with.
They want to treat this place as a sausage factory when they used to rail for hours against the now opposition when they were in government about treating this place as a sausage factory. Now they are doing the same thing. They are trying to treat this place like a sausage factory by banking up the bills. There is a list a mile long of bills and we are supposed to be just ticking them off and pushing them through. Do they think that with things like welfare quarantining we may just close our eyes and it will go through without our full attention? There are a range of bills on the legislative agenda this week that we demand that we have time to talk about. We are not going to just tick and flick.
We need an appropriate time in this place to deal properly with the legislative agenda. As I said, the Greens came to this place expecting that we would be sitting longer this week. We prefer to sit on Fridays but we have not seen a reflection of our goodwill from the government because the government did not even see fit to come and talk to us about extended hours. We kept expecting them to, but there was no phone call to say, ‘What do you think about sitting longer hours?’ We heard the opposition got a phone call. We heard Senator Fielding got a phone call. Senator Joyce did not get a phone call apparently—maybe it is this end of the chamber.
—Have you got the Greens number?
—Apparently not, Senator McGauran. It goes back to management of this place.

Senator Ludwig interjecting—

—I did check with Emma and we did not.
—Who’s Emma?
—Our whip’s clerk. When I heard the rumour yesterday about extended hours, I checked whether we had had a phone call and we have not. Subsequently, apparently, we got a phone call. However, given that we came expecting that we would need to sit some extra hours—the preference is for sitting Friday so that we are not brain dead from sitting here into the late evenings, as has happened in the past—the Greens are willing to support this motion. We do, this time, concede that we do need to spend some extra hours on the legislative agenda, and we are willing in this instance to agree to sit this Friday. So we will be supporting the motion, because we are trying to show some goodwill to try to move the legislative agenda along, but it would be handy for us to be consulted through a leaders and whips process so that we can talk about the legislative agenda, set some priorities, do some estimates of how long it will take to discuss the legislation and have a more orderly approach. So, as I said, the Greens indicate that we will in this instance be supporting this particular motion.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-06-16,"—The Prime Minister’s latest incarnation of the nationalisation of the mining industry has to be seen to be believed. Australia is going down a path and who knows where it is going to finish. But just on one issue, the issue of quarrying and the impacts that this tax will have on it, it seems that Mr Rudd, Mr Swan, Mr Tanner and Ms Gillard are oblivious to the effect that this is going to have on that sector of the economy.
There are approximately 2,200 quarries operating across the country. They are excavating about 130 million tonnes of stone, limestone, gypsum, gravel and sand. These are used in such things as construction, and 18,000 people work in this industry. We have about half a million people working in the mining industry itself, and the Labor government seems to be oblivious to the fate of working families, to the prosperity of this nation and to where this tax goes.
The economics of Australia are so heavily reliant on our export of minerals that the reality is that if we do not have those boats parked off our west coast collecting the red rocks and the boats parked off our east coast collecting the black rocks then our nation would be in such dire financial circumstances that it would be beyond belief. We fool ourselves if we think that we are the sort of manufacturing powerhouse that Japan or the United States are; or the sort of financial centre that London is. We are a nation that has as the cornerstone of its prosperity our mining resources, and we are lucky that we are blessed that it is in situ—in the ground in Australia. The capacity to live, to act and to have all of the luxuries that so many other nations in the world crave would not be there if we did not have the mining industry. It is absolutely negligent to start putting pressure on an industry where if it topples over the ramifications will come home to everybody. You do not have to love miners or hate them; you just have to understand the basic premise of the economics and how our nation works.
If we drill down to a microform of what the effect of this tax will be, from where I am standing I can look around me and see steel purlins that are holding up this building. Underneath me would be concrete and running those lights is a coal-fired power station somewhere. All these are going to be affected by this tax. Through the process of this debate we have also seen almost the debauchery and prostitution of the Treasury. The sorts of things that the Treasury have been wheeled out to say just do not pass muster; they just do not make sense.
The latest one is where Dr Henry, who has said in the past that I have an oversimplistic view of things, stated that from high school he knows that if you have a tax on profits—even if it is at 40 per cent—it does not affect the motivations and the aggregate size of the economy. Then, when pushed, he said that it would not affect it if it were 60, 70 or 80 per cent. In fact, the only that time he conceded that there might be an effect is if you taxed all the profits. This is very peculiar indeed. Lately, we also had the pie charts. Remember the pie charts that they brought out? They looked awfully like a complete and utter botch.
We asked a question on notice of the Treasury—who are putting their credentials on the line to stand behind this—about where on earth the figures came from that said that in 2008-09 royalties and resources were at 14 per cent and in 2008-09 royalties, resources, taxes and company taxes were at 27 per cent. It is just so blatantly absurd: the figures are bunkum; they just do not pass muster. The answer to the question on notice has come back, and I must say that I am more confused now than when we first asked the question. The answer is just completely absurd. They have constructed and misconstrued the numbers. As poor old Mrs Mrakovcic from the Treasury said, they are not their numbers; they are Wayne Swan’s numbers and the Treasury are putting their imprimatur on them. Why would they do that? Why would they take themselves down this path?
Going into the numbers that they have supplied, we find that the resource rents from 2007-08 to 2008-09 went from $40.7 billion up to $91.2 billion. That was a remarkable year: it went up by 124 per cent. And do you know what is amazing about it going up by 124 per cent? It did this in the global financial crisis—the greatest crisis that we have had! Remember that they said we had to spend all this money to save us from the crisis? If these figures are correct, why bother? It was a boom year; the place was going ballistic. And if we go back through the figures before that we see a more regimented line of proportions of 47 per cent—that seems like a fair take on their profits; 45.8 per cent—that seems like a fair take on their profits; and 37.5 per cent from resources and company taxes as a portion of their profits. Then we have one year—surprise, surprise—the miraculous year 2008-09 where it just drops down 27 per cent.
So it just neatly fits into this graph—the problem being that they have had to jack up their resource rents by 124 per cent. Where were these mines? Where did they open up? What happened? Did we double the Hunter Valley that year in the middle of this crisis where there was $90 billion worth of discretionary spending by the Labor Party to try and keep us away from the crisis? Everything about the economic management of the Labor Party is implausible and they have sucked the Department of Treasury into the vortex of implausibility. To be honest, it is starting to look like the Treasury department and key figures in there have been sullied and in some instances may have been fatally damaged trying to prop up the insanity of the Labor Party.
We have a big football game on tonight: the Maroons are playing the Blues, and the Maroons are going to win. There are some very interesting blues that we should be concentrating on, but they will not be playing tonight. The very interesting blue that we should be concentrating on is the Gray versus Tanner blue—Gary Gray versus Lindsay Tanner—as they start seeing their seats peel off and disappear. Another interesting blue to have a close look at would be the Hutchins versus Kevin Rudd blue—I reckon that blue would be a ripper. Then we have the Kevin versus ‘every sane man, woman and child’ blue, another blue that would be an interesting one to watch. Then we have the Labor versus ‘any person who looks like they are gaining a profit’ blue, another one we would want to look at. One of the best ones is going to be ‘marginal seats and the probability of survival after the Kevin Rudd epic’ blue—that is going to be the best one.
For some unknown reason you have in your first term managed to completely and utterly debunk the mechanism, the reason and the critique you gave for attaining office—that you were apparently economic conservatives, that you would be a safe set of hands and that we had nothing to worry about. Now we find that one of the key groups that is most concerned about your tax is women. Why? It is because they can see what this is going to do to the economy and the overwhelming sense of uncertainty because you are manipulating and meddling with the financial prosperity that is going to pay for their houses, their children and the welfare of this nation into the future. This has been a disaster under the Labor Party, a disaster that has cost us up to $2 billion a week in extra borrowing.
But this resource tax just takes the cake. How we have come to live in a nation where the government has decided to nationalise the mining industry is beyond comprehension. This will come home—of course it will with a new Labor Party tax—as any person who can pass the cost on will pass the cost on to the housewife and to the working family. In this case it might be passed on by putting them out of work. With this tax they have gone to the good people of Western Australia and basically relieved them of their wealth. They have basically picked up the wealth of Western Australia and wandered back to Canberra with it. In Queensland they are doing the same thing. They cannot even keep the left wing of their own party onside in Queensland because they see this as a ticket for Kevin’s insanity. This has to stop and it is our duty to stop it.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2010-06-16,"—As Senator Joyce noted, he has found himself many times at odds with Treasury advice and it seems not to have occurred to him that he might be wrong. I would back the expertise of the economists in Treasury over Senator Joyce any time and it appears that Mr Tony Abbott would too because he has stripped Senator Joyce of any responsibility for finance. But I have come prepared to talk about the resource super profits tax. Senator Joyce apparently did not because he spent most of the time addressing a political take on it—his own political take on it—and not the tax at all. I think that illustrates how little the opposition choose to understand this tax. Whether it is a deliberate omission or simply ignorance I do not know, but let us talk about the resource super profits tax and let us talk about how it will affect smaller miners and quarries. Let us take a look at some facts rather than standing on our soapbox and talking generally about things.
I turn to the profitability of mining companies in the first place and I refer to an excellent couple of articles on the pollytics.com website about an analysis of the profitability of mining companies. The conclusion was that:
Only 51.2% of all mining firms were actually profitable in 2008/9—the lowest of all industry classifications—even though the industry wide aggregate profit margin for mining was the highest for any industry classification in Australia, coming in at a whopping 37.1%, and where the aggregate profit margin for large mining firms was an even larger 46.1%
It goes on to say:
It would be accurate to say here that a majority of firms—and probably a very large majority of firms at that—would actually be better off under the proposed RSPT than the existing regime.
They are facts and the facts are that some mining companies are making a very handy profit indeed, in the order of 46.1 per cent. That is because the price of some ores and commodities has gone up to exceptionally high levels. This is at a time when Australia needs to address the infrastructure deficiencies that were left to us as the legacy of the Howard government, and the government is proposing to do something about that.
We look at the scare campaign which is being conducted by businesses and we find that in Australia there are a large number of commodities in which we hold a substantial share of the world’s resources: over 20 per cent, for example, of silver, cobalt, brown coal and zinc, and over 30 per cent of lead, uranium, zircon, rutile, nickel and tantalum. And we have mining companies saying that they will get up and leave, that they will not invest in Australian resources anymore! As the Pollytics blog says:
When mining companies … say that their investment … will cease … as a result of the RSPT, they are effectively stating that their firm will not exploit these immobile, finite resources which make up to nearly 40% of the total global supply of these minerals.
That of course is a nonsense. So the question becomes: how do we, for the future, best take advantage of these scarce resources which belong to Australians? What the tax has been carefully designed to do is not disadvantage those smaller companies, the small mines and small quarries, which are not making these superprofits. Where quarries or other mines do make the superprofits, why shouldn’t they be taxed at that rate? Why shouldn’t they contribute more to the future of Australian society?
It has been bandied around quite often that the Henry review said that we should not tax quarries, which is not accurate, as so many of the arguments are not from the opposition and other mining interests. What the Henry review said was:
The resource rent tax should be applied to non-renewable resources other than those expected to generate low rent where the administration and compliance costs are likely to outweigh any gains from a rent-based tax …
That is, the recommendation is that where the administrative costs outweigh the benefits of the tax then it might not be a sensible thing to do. There was no recommendation at all that these resources should not be taxed in line with other resources. This is all part of the negotiation which the government is conducting at the moment and which the government has always said that it would conduct.
Finally, I would like to address the ‘disaster’ that Senator Joyce talked about, this idea that if the bosses of the big mining companies like Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest do not continue to receive their income then Australia will be in huge economic trouble. I would like to quote from an article written by Vanessa Cicchini in the Australian late last month. She said:
Lately, barber shop talk has revolved heavily around the tax and my anecdotal surveys have all reaped similar results. People in the western suburbs—
that is, the western suburbs of Perth—
staunchly oppose it. Those with the wrong opinions are infidels.
Here lies my gripe. This small but wealthy section of Perth with its vitriolic hatred of this proposed tax are also the most vocal and are viewed almost unquestionably as the authority on what’s best for the west.
But did they ever get out of their social-business circles to consult with people from other areas, let alone those more socioeconomically challenged? Hell no!
The mining boom has not rocked everyone’s world. Here in WA it has made day-to-day living hideously expensive, with most transactions tantamount to extortion. The social aspect is just as grim. Putting aside the muted phenomena of the “cashed-up bogan”, there really is a huge gap between haves and have-nots.
This is what the Labor government intends to address. The opposition, of course, listen to big business all the time. They listen to those people who have vested interests in making sure that the mountains of cash keep rolling in. But the Labor government wants to make sure that some of that cash reaches other people in the community in the form of improved superannuation payments and also lower company tax to stimulate further productivity improvement in our economy. That is what the Rudd Labor government is all about.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-06-16,"—The Senate is debating a matter of public importance. This is a time reserved for serious debate on the issues of the day, and this surely is the issue of the day. But anyone listening in to the previous speaker would have heard her very lacklustre performance. There was certainly no true belief or heart to put into it—and I have looked at the other speakers to follow her, and it is not going to get much better at all.
—How do you feel about that, Michaelia?
—From the government side, I should add, of course. Falling short of an argument five minutes into her 10 minutes, the previous speaker broke into what Labor have been breaking into for the last month or so when defending this tax: a class war, talking about mountains of cash rolling in and how we are defending the big boys. But you in no way addressed the matter of public importance before the Senate today about small mining industries and small quarries. You conveniently avoided that.
I think you started to quote some figures you got off the internet. From what I could gather, you glanced over, saying that the smaller quarries were getting returns of something like 40 per cent. That is absurd. You say that this tax is not designed to capture those smaller quarries. There happen to be 42 around the Bendigo area alone in Victoria. Are you telling me that this tax is not designed to capture those small quarries and those small companies—in Ballarat and Bendigo alone? That is what you said. What an absurdity. Your idea of supertax—the cash rolling in, as you say—is anything above the risk-free rate, the bond rate, of six per cent. That is your idea of supertax. That is why, after five minutes, you lapsed into the old class war. That is the sum of the defence for introducing this tax.
What an unhappy time the three senators opposite have had in government. What a wasted experience you have had in government. You have spent months defending this tax. Prior to that you spent months defending the pink batts scheme, months defending the emissions trading scheme, another supertax—if you fail in one supertax try and try again—and months defending your budget. You need not worry. It will all be over soon. What an unhappy, miserable time you have had in office while the kitchen cabinet runs this government, and you have no say in it at all.
Whatever trust the Australian people put in electing the Rudd government has been crushed in just one term alone. Nothing cements the disappointment more than the introduction of this tax. It epitomises and brings to its very point that disappointment and the incompetence and deceit that surround the government. The government brought in this tax without consulting with their own party let alone with the industry. It has no detail and no design at all. There is no understanding of the cascading effects of the tax. What is more, it is a policy cooked up just to cover over a short-term problem that they have in their budget. In no way did the previous government speaker—I expect no more from government speakers that will follow—address the core issue.
It is worth reading out the core issue of this matter of public importance submitted to the Senate for discussion:
The impact of the Government’s ill-considered Super Tax on small quarries, and on the cost of living.
The previous speaker avoided it meticulously. She was unable to address how this tax is going to affect small and medium operations. It is because the Treasurer and the Prime Minister—and the Treasury, as our lead speaker rightly pointed out—had no concept of how this tax was going to affect businesses, from large to small, from auxiliary to household. For example, Selkirk bricks in Ballarat, where I have an office, are a family company some hundred years old. They do not know whether they are caught up in this tax or not, but if they are they will close. They are greatly affected. There is a cloud over them. They do not know what the effect is but it is not good at all. What about the cement works in Geelong or all the quarries that surround the township of Bendigo?
This is nothing short of a tax grab. This is not tax reform. This was laid out to be a tax grab on BHP and Rio Tinto. Not even a thought was put into this; there was not even any knowledge of these smaller operations. That is what we are debating today. Yes, it is going to hurt Rio Tinto and BHP, but what of the hundreds and hundreds of smaller operations? Those opposite have reverted to a class war and that is a very brittle strategy that is not working out with the public. It is not even working with your own supporters. The pawns walk in here and repeat that argument. It is outdated, divisive and false.
The truth is that this tax will cut a swathe through family businesses like Selkirk, through medium-sized businesses. We already know that there has been a downgrading of many investments, a cut in many investments—Xstrata, for example. In Stawell, a small township outside Melbourne, a mining company is now reviewing its operations, which means job losses. Gekko in Ballarat, which supplies mining equipment, has already laid off six workers directly because of this tax. The uncertainty is now cascading through the share market, affecting the value of these companies and future investment. We heard today at question time that our main competitors, like Canada and Chile, are salivating at the chance to grab some of our markets.
There are three falsehoods spun by the Labor Party. One is that this is in fact tax reform. It is a tax grab to prop up an ailing budget. When you had to abolish your emissions trading scheme—that other supertax—you had the audacity to introduce this tax and you further have the audacity to have Senator Wong stand up in question time to defend it. Her previous failure was the emissions trading scheme tax.
The second falsehood is that this is a tax on superprofits. It is in fact a supertax on profits, as it kicks in at the six per cent bond rate. No mining company is going to sit there and expect returns of six per cent. They outlay hundreds of millions of dollars. It is the most risky business of any industry or sector.  It is a supertax on profits—on the most minimal, risk-free profits, in fact. Because of this tax, the extension of the Olympic Dam project in South Australia is also now under a cloud.
The third falsehood is that the mining industry should pay a fair share. There is the class warfare again. There is the beat-up again. They are paying a fair share. Senator Sherry ran that through question time over and over again. Company tax is progressive. When their profits go up, so does the tax. They are the greatest contributors to the Treasury coffers. They got us through the global financial crisis. It is acknowledged. You don’t think the pink batts scheme got us through, do you? You don’t think the building revolution got us through—that sort of wasted money! It was the mining industry that got us through.
Time does not permit me to source my references, but it is well known that the tax rate of the companies averages out at 41 per cent. That is royalties and company tax. That is before you even get to payroll tax or any local government taxes that are placed on this industry. They pay more tax than any other industry. They contribute more to the Treasury than any other group.
You ought to start listening, not just watching the polls and getting nervous about it all—which you should be and which Gary Gray is as he jumps up and down in his seat in aeroplanes back to Perth. You ought to start listening to people who have some experience and wisdom, not the boys that run the Prime Minister’s office. Start listening to the likes of Rod Eddington—who has your interests at heart, believe it or not, seeing as you gave him a job—and David Murray, the chairman of the Future Fund. Today we heard from the chief of the Wesfarmers, Mr Every. I know what the next person will get up and say— (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I will begin my contribution to this debate by quoting head of Treasury Ken Henry, who during estimates gave senators opposite a lesson in high school economics. He said:
I learnt in high school in the study of economics that profits based taxes cannot affect prices.
So that immediately dismisses the premise of the motion before us. Secondly, he said:
I also learnt in high school if you shift the supply curve down into the right, which is what a cut in company tax rates would do, you get a reduction in prices; I remember that. But when you impose a tax on the pure profit, you do not actually shift the demand and supply curves—I remember learning that—so the price should not be affected.
So there you have it—basic economics 101. Firstly, the RSPT will not affect prices because it is a profits based tax. Furthermore, Australian consumers stand to benefit from downward pressure on the cost of living from a cut in the company tax rate. All companies are subject to company tax, and company tax will go down under our tax reform package. This will benefit companies big and small across Western Australia and across the nation. It will benefit consumers. Many mining companies already pay less company tax than many other industries in Australia, and that is because of generous deductions and concessions that our system offers them. So, when it comes to the mining industry, this debate is not really about a company tax.
The heart of this debate is about what charge, if any, this nation should levy on mining companies for the use of Australia’s non-renewable resources—resources that belong to the Australian people and not to mining companies. Our argument is this: we should charge a levy that reflects the level of profits mining companies make out of the use of those resources. That way when projects are highly profitable the Australian people will get their fair share of the value generated from their resources and when projects are less profitable the charge will be reduced or eliminated so that less profitable projects can still go ahead. This is a win-win situation for the Australian people. They get their fair share of value generated from their non-renewable resources when that is possible and when it is not they still get to benefit from the production and employment generated by less profitable projects.
The problem with the current royalties system is that it operates in the opposite manner. That is why it is an inefficient tax. It penalises less profitable projects by subjecting them to charges that they are not always able to bear, making some projects unviable. Worse still, when projects become more profitable, the charge levied for the use of Australia’s commodities does not keep pace with rising profits. So when profits rise rapidly, as they did during the last resources boom, the share of those profits going to the Australian people for the use of those resources goes down. In the last mining boom it went down from one-third of the profits being made to one-seventh of the profits being made. If one-third of the profits was a fair and reasonable charge prior to the last boom then why is it not fair and reasonable now? Why was it not fair and reasonable during the last boom? What possible justification could there be for mining companies to be charged less relative to profits just because higher prices are making those companies more profitable? Why should the share of profits going to the Australian people for the use of their resources go down simply because higher prices are driving mining companies’ profits up? Why?
This is not only unjust; it in fact defies logic and common sense. The RSPT will take the charge levied by the Australian people for the use of their resources back up to the same level in relation to profits as it was prior to the last boom. Just as this level of charge did not destroy the mining industry prior to the last boom, it will not destroy the industry now. The major challenge for Australia as it seeks to seize the opportunities presented by a rise in demand for commodities from Asia is not the RSPT. No, the major challenge for Australia as it seeks to seize these opportunities is capacity constraints on the mining industry. The major challenge is ensuring that we have human capital and infrastructure to support a growing resources sector. It is these capacity constraints that this tax will help address—in particular, through the $6 billion infrastructure fund this tax will generate. It is a fund that will help ensure that resource-rich states like Western Australia have the roads, rail and ports necessary to support our growing resources sector.
The RSPT is specifically designed to enhance investment, production and employment, because unlike royalties, which tax production regardless of profitability, the RSPT only taxes superprofits. It is by definition set at a level that enables companies to remain reasonably profitable. This is why the RSPT will in fact encourage, rather than discourage, investment, production and employment. Unlike royalties, the RSPT will fall most heavily on those companies and projects that can most afford to pay. That is why all those billionaires are screaming so loudly. It does not fall on those who cannot bear the burden. This applies to small quarries just as it does to other projects. To the extent that small quarries are not making superprofits they should not pay any extra tax. Twenty-two of this nation’s most reputable economists have concluded that there is no reason to expect a net contraction in mining as a result of the RSPT—their words, not mine. David Buckingham, the former head of the Minerals Council, has commended the very deliberate design of the RSPT to lighten the tax burden on less profitable projects, encouraging investment in the projects that might otherwise have stayed on the drawing board. I repeat: the RSPT will encourage investment in projects that might otherwise have stayed on the drawing board—again, Mr Buckingham’s words, not mine.
Investment in projects that would have stayed on the drawing board means more production and more employment. It also means an increased supply of these commodities, and increased supply generally means lower prices. This is about returning Australia’s share of our resources to where it was prior to the last boom. It is about ensuring that Australians get a fair share of the profits generated from the last boom and investing in Australia’s future the extra revenue generated. It is about investing it in resource-rich states like my own so that we can maximise growth in the mining industry. It is about investing it in superannuation, especially for women and the low paid. It is about giving more working Australians access to a secure retirement. It is about less tax, especially for small business. It is about boosting employment and reducing cost-of-living pressures throughout the economy. Just as during the last global recession we refused to sit idly by when decisive action was required, we are taking this action in Australia’s interests, despite the scare campaigns of those opposite. Again, we will take decisive action to protect Australia’s interests during the coming resources boom. Just as we did not bury our heads in the sand when danger loomed on the world stage in the form of a global recession, we will not squander the boom times like those opposite. We will act to seize the opportunities presented for and on behalf of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2010-06-16,"—To coin a very well-known phrase: ‘Tell ’em they’re dreaming.’ If those on the other side actually believe that this tax is in any way going to increase production in this country they are living in la-la land, quite literally. Their pattern of failure—their failure to think things through, their failure of judgment, their failure to consult and their failure to follow any sort of process whatsoever—is now creating real damage to Australians and to the Australian economy. This is more apparent than ever after listening to the speeches of those on the other side on this very important issue in this matter of public importance debate. This tax is nothing more and nothing less than a triple whammy on the Australian people. It is a tax on the half a million Australians whose jobs depend either directly or indirectly on the mining industry. Yes, that is right, the mining industry is actually a huge employer in this country. Industry creates jobs. Governments, and in particular Labor governments, do not create jobs; they destroy jobs. This is a tax on the millions of Australian retirees whose incomes are drawn from the shares and dividends that the mining companies pay. It is a triple whammy because it is a tax that will hit the back pockets of Australian families. It is going to impact on their budgets. You cannot raise the price of oil and gas, building materials and fertiliser, which is exactly what this tax is going to do, without having a flow-on effect on the price that Australian families are going to pay for essential items.
You will recall that the Henry tax review, a review that we all waited with bated breath for, had 138 recommendations. But Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister of this country is a weak and insipid leader and did not have the guts to undertake full-bodied tax reform in this country. So what did he do? He woke up one morning and said: ‘That is it, I’m going to go for the blatant tax grab. What will I impose? I will impose a resource super profits tax.’ He chose this over genuine taxation reform. That would hardly be surprising to the Australian people because it is so typical of a Labor government. Rudd Labor have no other way than to rob the mining industry blind to pay off the debt that they are incurring in this country.
The problem with Mr Rudd is this: he is at great pains to tell Australians that what the big mining companies are saying about the impact of this tax should be taken with a grain of salt, but he fails to understand that it is not just the big mining companies that are telling us they have real problems with this tax. What Mr Rudd fails to understand is that, while he talks tough about targeting Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, the small businesses, the family quarry operators—and we all know them; we have all got them in our home states—are the ones that are really going to feel the impact of this tax. These businesses operate across Australia. They produce sand, gravel, road base, lime and phosphate. And guess what? All of those materials are crucial inputs to housing and construction and agriculture in Australia. So guess what? If you tax those products, those companies will have to pass the tax on to the consumer, and mums and dads in Australia will actually end up paying more and there will be an increase in the cost of living.
I would like to put to bed a myth the Labor Party consistently raises, which is that Treasury secretary Ken Henry, in his recommendations, said these small companies should be taxed. Well, he did not. Mr Henry did not recommend the taxing of low-value commodities. There is actually a table in his report, table C1.1, that lists resources that may merit exemption from the resource tax. It was not Mr Henry’s recommendation that the Labor Party go down this path. If this tax does go through, when it hits the local quarries—and it will—it will ultimately hit the hip pockets of mums and dads in Australia. Why? Because local quarries produce clay, gravel, monumental stone, gypsum, limestone, cement and plaster, and all of those products are used to build the great Australian dream—that is, your own home. Local quarries have made it very clear that they will have a choice if this tax goes through. They can either pass the additional cost on to the consumer or, alternatively, they can close down their businesses. The choice is a very simple one. They are not going to close down their businesses, so these costs will be passed through to the mums and dads of Australia.
Merrill Lynch, one of the world’s leading financial management and advisory companies, came out with a report today. They have done some numbers. And guess what? They say the supertax will quite literally ‘hit home’. Merrill Lynch estimate that it will add no less than $800 to the price of the concrete used in an average home costing approximately $500,000. And there have been other estimates that the tax will add no less than $20,000 to the price of a new home. That is a consequence of imposing this tax on small quarries. It will reach into every Australian household through higher power bills, higher gas bills and higher prices for bricks and mortar and gravel. These very basic commodities will all be affected by this tax.
What if the tax were to hit phosphate mining? The logical effect is that the price of fertiliser would go up. What does that mean for Mr Rudd’s working families, whom he keeps telling us he strives so hard to defend? It is bad news, Mr Rudd. Guess what? Your tax will mean that the price of food will go up. That is right—under Rudd Labor’s tax the mums and dads of Australia will be paying more for food. Ultimately this tax, if placed on mining quarries, will flow through to the people of Australia. The bottom line is this: if you are a young person or a mum or dad and you are thinking about going out and purchasing a new home, if you want to fulfil the great Australian dream, if this government is re-elected and this tax goes through forget about the Australian dream because it is quite possible that you will not be able to afford it. That is the end result of an ill-thought-out concept.
The bottom line is this: what we have in Australia today is a big-spending government and this mining tax is designed to do nothing more and nothing less than satiate their out-of-control spending. To implement what is nothing more than a blatant tax grab which will have devastating effects on our economy—in particular, our quarries—is economic lunacy. This tax is economic vandalism and economic lunacy from a Labor government that does not have a clue about economic management in Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I rise as a senator for Queensland and I am proud to defend the Rudd Labor government’s resource super profits tax, from which Queenslanders will benefit with more than $2 billion for infrastructure funding for roads, rail and ports. As a senator from a state which has 40 per cent of this country’s mining production, I am proud to defend the $6 billion infrastructure fund that will be established by the government to reinvest the proceeds from the RSPT. The RSPT is about building a stronger economy and delivering a fairer share of profits from our resource industry to Australian families. And why shouldn’t they benefit from it? Australians own 100 per cent of this nation’s natural resources, yet their share of the profits has fallen while the mining companies’ profits have risen. Before the industry was booming, Australians received $1 in every $3 of profits through royalties and charges, but at the end of the boom they only received $1 in every $7 of profit. The government collected only an additional $9 billion in revenue, yet profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than they were at the beginning of the decade.
By replacing mining royalties with an RSPT, a fairer share of the mining boom will enable superannuation for working Australians to be increased from nine per cent to 12 per cent, which will assist 8.4 million working people. It will provide a tax break for 2.4 million small businesses and will reduce the company tax rate from 31.7 per cent to 28 per cent. And let us not forget the $6 billion infrastructure fund, which will benefit our mining states for roads, rail, ports and economic infrastructure. This tax reform will strengthen our economy.
But we understand it will not be an easy task. The opposition, along with their pinup boy, Clive Palmer, have started a massive scare campaign telling Australians that share prices have dropped because of the proposed RSPT. Opposition leader Tony Abbott said on 25 May that ‘our share market is under pressure, at least in part because the government has totally mismanaged its proposal for a great big new tax on mining’. However, conversely, Richard Grace, the chief currency strategist of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said on 25 May on The 7.30 Report:
We’ve seen a 10 per cent fall in the global MSCI stock market, 11 per cent fall in the S&P 500. We’ve seen oil prices fall over 20 per cent. We have seen base metal commodity prices fall over 20 per cent, and this is all since the start of May or late April. These are the sort of factors that have been going on which are not at all related to the mining tax. And just to further push that point home, some of the shares of the big offshore mining companies such as Vale have fallen by similar magnitude.
In fact, Australian shares have not fallen as much as they have in other countries. The London stock market has fallen by 10.4 per cent, the US Standard and Poor’s index dropped by 11.5 per cent and the Japanese stock market fell by 12.8 per cent, while Australian shares have only fallen by 10 per cent. Australian mining shares have fallen even less at 8.9 per cent and the bank shares have fallen by 12.3 per cent. Clearly the opposition is not listening to its own scare campaign when the member for Dickson raced out recently and purchased $2,000 worth of shares in BHP. If he thought the shares were going to drop, why did he rush out to make such an investment?
The opposition also claims that the cost of living would increase with the introduction of the RSPT, and we have heard some of that here in this chamber this afternoon. Tony Abbott said on 21 May that it is ‘an assault on our standard of living’. Then on 27 May the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, said that mining companies are going to pass it on to everyone.
They’re going to pass it on to their clients … and it will flow through to every home. Everything—you think for a moment about everything in your life that comes from mining. Your car … Everything in your house comes from mining and energy.
It is just another blatant lie.
According to the Federation Fellow in Economics, someone who is a lot more knowledgeable about the economy, Professor John Quiggin, the scare campaign is hurting the debate. He said on 26 May:
A number of the arguments we’ve seen raised against the tax simply have no credibility at all … I think that’s about the least defensible. The reason that there are super profits to be taxed is because of high world prices for these minerals that are set on world markets. So there’s no reason at all to think that the tax is going to affect the world price of these minerals, and therefore that that’s going to feed in any way into Australian consumer prices. On the other hand, there’s potentially some benefit for consumers in the offsetting reductions in the general rate of company tax. So it certainly is depressing to see this kind of scare tactic put up, it really is just distorting the debate.
In fact, according to Econtech modelling, the tax reform will reduce the price of food and housing over time, making our economy more effective. According to the Econtech report, food is set to decrease in the long term by 0.9 per cent; tobacco and alcohol by 1.1 per cent; clothing and footwear by 1.3 per cent; housing, household contents and services by 1.1 per cent; health costs by 0.6 per cent; transportation by 1.7 per cent; communication by 1.4 per cent; recreation by 1.3 per cent; and education by 0.3 per cent. Financial and insurance services will drop by 0.8 per cent.
Commodities which are traded on the world market will have their prices set by that market. The myth about electricity prices going up because of the RSPT is exactly that: a myth. Because the RSPT is aimed at superprofits, coal-fired electricity stations are unlikely to be affected as they use low value coal therefore unlikely to make superprofits.
I am proud to stand here today and say that the Rudd Labor government has been nothing but upfront with Australians about the RSPT. We have established the Resource Tax Consultation Panel and have been open at every step—a practice which demonstrates our government’s willingness to discuss this very important tax reform and a practice which is completely different to the previous government’s. In 1995 John Howard promised ‘never ever’ to introduce a goods and services tax. In fact, he said, ‘There’s no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy—never ever—it’s dead,’ and five years later everyone knew what the letters GST stood for as a result of that broken promise.
We understand that tax reform is not easy, but it has been done before successfully. The Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, the Hon. Craig Emerson, recently said the petroleum resource rent tax was just as controversial. He said:
It was just as difficult; it was an important tax reform and we implemented a profits-based tax that’s been in place for 25 years and has been consistent with the go-ahead of major projects like the Gorgon gas project and the Pluto project, and the extension of the life of Bass Strait for 30 years.
Even John Howard’s right-hand man, former Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Max Moore-Wilton, and Tony Abbott’s finance spokesman, Andrew Robb, support reforming the current system. In fact, Tony Abbott seems to be the only one who doesn’t support this tax reform.
On 12 June Andrew Robb said:
Well we will look at any reform that is offered and if we think it will, um, you know improve incentives, improve fairness, you know, reduce the tax avoidance, all of those, be more efficient, less paperwork, there’s enormous scope in the tax system to do work.
On 11 June Max Moore-Wilton said, ‘Everyone likes the idea of a profits tax; it makes sense.’ In terms of the impact on small quarries, the RSPT will only be taxing superprofits. If the quarry is not making superprofits, it will not pay net tax. Depending on profits, some companies will pay more tax than others, but the mining industry is still expected to have 5.5 per cent growth in production. The Rudd Labor government is committed to building a stronger economy and providing a fairer share to Australians. The RSPT will benefit this economy by investing in our much needed infrastructure and assisting our small businesses and companies.
The opposition’s lack of support for this important tax reform shows that Mr Abbott is against a superannuation increase for working Australians. He denies small businesses a well-deserved tax break and instant tax write-off of up to $5,000 and denies a tax cut to companies to improve their competitiveness. Mr Abbott cannot be trusted to run this country, let alone a proposed budget— (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2010-06-16,"—At the request of Senator Coonan, I present a report and Alert Digest of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 6 of 2010 and its Sixth Report of 2010 I draw the Senate’s attention to the Committee’s comments on:
the importance of explanatory memoranda; and
the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010.
In scrutinising the bills for Alert Digest No. 6 the Committee had occasion to comment on the quality of several of the explanatory memoranda accompanying the bills.
The Committee is concerned when there are items in bills which are not addressed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill.
An explanatory memorandum is important in a number of different ways:
to assist with the scrutiny of legislative proposals before they become law;
more generally to assist those whose rights may be affected by a bill to understand the legislative proposal; and
an explanatory memorandum can be needed by a court to interpret the legislation under section 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act.
The Committee is itself directly aware that an explanatory memorandum is an essential aid to effective Parliamentary scrutiny (including by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee).
An explanatory memorandum is particularly useful when it contains important context and relevant policy information and outlines the intended operation of each provision.
In relation to the scrutiny process, a well‑written explanatory memorandum can provide the foundation for avoiding adverse comment because whether or not a provision is of concern often depends on the context in each case. An explanatory memorandum can be used to demonstrate that a policy approach reflects an informed choice and is fully justified.
I am pleased to tell you that in Alert Digest No. 6 there are a number of examples of this. To note one instance, the Electoral Pre-Poll Voting Bill at Schedule 2, items 3 and 188 contains a wide delegation of power that could be of concern to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee if it constituted an inappropriate delegation of legislative power. In this case the use of the delegation was comprehensively explained in the explanatory memorandum and this alleviated any concerns the Committee might have otherwise had about the provision.
Unfortunately the opposite is also true. The Committee regularly encounters provisions that, from a scrutiny perspective, turn out to be appropriate, but the absence of an adequate explanation in the explanatory memorandum attracts the Committee’s attention. The Committee usually seeks further advice about each provision until the rationale for the provision is understood.
In Alert Digest No.6 the Scrutiny Committee notes that it is seeking advice on 2 bills in relation to deficiencies in the quality of the accompanying explanatory memoranda.
I also draw to the Senate’s attention the Committee’s comments in Alert Digest No. 6 on the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010. From a scrutiny perspective this bill has attracted a number of adverse comments relating to various issues of concern, including:
the determination of important matters by regulation;
apparently severe penalties for some offences;
the exclusion of merits review without justification; and
possible undue trespass on personal rights and liberties.
More details about the Committee’s scrutiny of this bill, and others, is contained in Alert Digest No. 6 of 2010 and I commend the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 6 of 2010 and Sixth Report of 2010 to the Senate.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-06-16,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I will keep my remarks brief. This ministerial statement is simply a statement of the failure of the Rudd government on the issues of whaling. It is a government that has been all talk, all spin and yet there has been so little effective action on so many issues, perhaps none so emphatically as the whaling issue. The government, when in opposition, promised it would deliver an end to whaling, promised it would bring to a stop the whaling culture, and yet every year, as the Japanese fleet has sailed out and the whaling hunt has started, what we have seen is yet again the government expressing its shock and horror, desperately scrambling for strategies or tactics and not actually delivering on any of its promises in any effective way. They promised to undertake some surveillance. They did a little bit of that in the first year but have done none in any of the subsequent years. They set up a whaling envoy position—somebody who has travelled the world at great expense, who has met with international leaders and talked about issues of whaling endlessly but who has delivered no significant change to whaling practices around the world.
They promised legal action, and finally what we saw towards the end of the last whaling season—just a short while ago—was the government saying there would be legal action. Just a short while ago they finally acknowledged they would take some legal action. I note they made that acknowledgement only after the last lot of Senate estimates. They were still ducking, dodging and weaving during the last Senate estimates questions about whether the legal action would be undertaken. They did not want to face scrutiny from this parliament and from the Senate on the issues of their legal action. Indeed, it strikes me, looking at this ministerial statement, that the legal action they announced was nothing more than a distraction on the day of the announcement, because in Minister Garrett’s ministerial statement, which goes on for five pages, the legal action gets just two lines. It gets the most fleeting of mentions. That is how significant the government see their promised legal action to be. They took three years even to announce that they would do it, let alone proceed in any meaningful way with it. That is how significant they see their response to the issue of commercial whaling to be.
What they have done in announcing the legal action, in taking the stand that they have taken—which looks, from the way they have done it, to be little more than a media stunt designed for the Australian market—is put themselves in the worst of all positions leading into this meeting of the International Whaling Commission. In many ways they have now checked themselves out of the debate. We have this statement from the minister, trying to position the government and say what they might do come the International Whaling Commission meeting, but the reality is that they have now said, ‘No, we’re giving up on the International Whaling Commission; we’re going to take Japan to court instead.’ They could have done that two or three years ago, and we might know whether that was a meaningful strategy. Instead, right on the cusp of the most significant meeting of the International Whaling Commission in years—when reform and compromise proposals are on the table, when Australia should be at the forefront and trying to ensure that it has as much clout as possible on this issue that Australians hold dear and important—the Rudd Labor government decided that getting a day or two’s worth of cheap headlines at home was more important.
Having failed to honour their promise of court action for the first, second and much of the third years of office, for some strange reason, less than a couple of months ahead of the International Whaling Commission meeting, they decided that was the critical time to announce that they would undertake legal action on whaling. Why did they choose this time? It certainly was not strategically beneficial to their position at the IWC meeting—far from it. It certainly was not because they will be able to get an outcome on this before the next election. They will not get an outcome on this issue before the next whaling season let alone the next election. It was not because they had methodically been building up a case of evidence that they had gathered through surveillance of whaling operations. Over the last couple of seasons there has been no gathering of evidence. It was because there is an election coming up and they wanted to put out an announcement, to tick the box and say, ‘Yes, we are taking legal action.’ But we have no details of that. They have subjected themselves to no scrutiny. They dodged the estimates process by announcing this legal action just a week after estimates.
This is just another cynical gesture by the Rudd Labor government. This ministerial statement made by Mr Garrett today only ads to the cynicism and demonstrates the failings. It is five pages of excuses—five pages of why the Rudd government have failed to deliver on the promises and the overblown rhetoric that they took to the last election that they could end commercial whaling. It is also a signal of defeat in advance. If you read the language of it, it seems to be conceding that they do not hold out a whole lot of hope for the outcomes of the IWC meeting. They fear the compromise proposal developed by the chair and deputy chair of the International Whaling Commission—a proposal that will allow the slaughter of whales to continue over the next 10 years. They fear it will be sanctioned by the International Whaling Commission.
They do not hold out much hope of defeating that proposal at the IWC. Little wonder they do not hold out much hope, because Australia has checked itself out of the debate. It is stranded in no-man’s-land. It is taking legal action that none of the other strong antiwhaling nations like New Zealand have agreed to back. Australia has been left out on a limb. It will now be up to other countries to wage the fight in the IWC while Mr Garrett is there looking as impotent as he has been in every other aspect of his portfolio. This meeting will show him making another failure.
The risk is that we will get the worst of all outcomes, that we will see a sanctioning of commercial whaling. But we will then proceed on our way with our court challenge, possibly having that court challenge undermined by the IWC decision that we failed to help shape for ourselves. It is a fail, fail, fail from this government on the issue. Yet again, it is a demonstration that all their talk, all their promises and all the millions of dollars they have spent on envoys, diplomacy and research—and potentially in years to come on legal action—have been a waste. It will be wasted money that will not deliver a result. It has all been about public spin rather than actually delivering anything on the issue of whaling.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>International Whaling Commission</title>,Ministerial Statements,17,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-06-16,"—It is interesting to read the minister’s statement that I understand he tabled yesterday in the House of Representatives. He is essentially trying to reassure Australia that the government and the minister are not asleep at the wheel on whaling and, ‘It’s okay; we’ve now made up our minds about what we are going to be doing.’ They have set a course, after making very clear promises in the run-up to the last election that they were going to take decisive action to end whaling. The only whales that have been saved from being killed in the Southern Ocean on the government’s watch have been saved by the Sea Shepherd and the work of the volunteers in trying to protect those whales. The government have not yet saved one whale.
The government have left it to the last minute to take legal action. They are part of the IWC. They have been at the negotiations and at the small group meetings. They knew what direction the IWC was taking. They knew that diplomatic action was not succeeding. They have left it to the last minute to initiate legal action against whaling, knowing full well that if the proposals before the IWC succeed their legal action will probably be invalid and unsuccessful. They have one hand tied behind their back already going into this legal action because they knew the proposals coming up at the IWC had the potential to make their legal action invalid.
At the same time the government were toing and froing about whether to take legal action, two people in Japan, the Tokyo Two, took action to try and expose the embezzlement of whale meat. I had the good fortune of meeting one of them, Toru Suzuki. He is a delightful, brave young man who made a decision to try and expose the embezzlement of whale meat and expose what is going on in the whaling industry. The Tokyo Two are currently on trial in Tokyo. Foreign Correspondent had an excellent show on this last week. That program highlighted just how brave these two young men were and the risks they took that could see them sent to jail. They face 10 years jail for trying to expose this embezzlement. It is something that I think every Australian would be proud that they tried to do.
Rather than an investigation into the embezzlement of whale meat, those two young men who were seeking to protect whales have been charged and are currently facing trial. What have our government done? As far as I am aware, they did not even send an observer to the trial—something that was requested by many people. Those two young men are currently facing a 10-year jail sentence for doing what I think most Australians would have done to expose this trade. Yet this government have taken so long to take legal action, and now they are trying to defend their position a minute before midnight before they go into the IWC.
A similar situation where the government has not been active enough can be applied to the sinking of the Ady Gil. We are very concerned that that ship was sunk by the deliberate action of Japanese whalers. A report was released by the Maritime Safety Authority which is inconclusive. Our Federal Police facilitate Japanese investigation of the Sea Shepherd and yet do not take any action when a boat is sunk, we believe, in our territorial waters. The Ady Gil was sunk, putting at risk six lives—those people trying to take action to save whales—but again our government has refused to act. In the ministerial statement the minister talks about the crucial role of science and says:
It is Australia’s view that the role of science is paramount to the IWC.
I think what is paramount to the IWC is protecting and conserving whales. Australians are very clear: they want our government to ensure that the killing of whales is stopped. We Australians totally oppose the commercialisation of whaling and we want our government to take action to ensure that does not occur.
I am concerned that the focus on the paramount role of science takes attention away from the fact that we expect the IWC to be conserving whales. That is the role that Australians want from the IWC, and we want our government to be taking clear action not only to ensure that the killing of whales ends but also to work very constructively and proactively to ensure that happens—and not make meaningless promises and commitments and not take action after the horse has bolted, which I am deeply afraid is what is happening with the legal action that the government has now said it will take.
If it had initiated that action straight after the Oceanic Viking had been to the Southern Ocean and had the video footage and the documentation of that process at the end of the 2007-08 season, we might have now been in a position where that court case had been argued and where we might have had a judgment. Now we may never have a judgment because the government has prevaricated on this issue for so long. The previous government tried diplomatic action and it failed. So this government continued it, but it does not use other levers—for example, saying we do not want to negotiate a free trade agreement. It is an example of a mechanism that the government could have used to remind the Japanese just how important we find the whaling issue.
I agree with the minister’s comments in his ministerial statement that commercial whaling is dying out and that the countries that are whaling are subsidising it. In Japan it is clear that it is being subsidised. That is true and I agree with the minister that it is being propped up. Japan is continuing to prop it up. Whale meat, as I understand it, is not popular in Japan, and whaling is not a traditional industry, broadly, in Japan. I am aware that there has been coastal whaling in some communities, but the commercialisation of whaling at the scale that it is not a tradition in Japan. It started in the fifties as a way to feed the country after World War II—the 1940s and 1950s, after the war—but there is no justification whatsoever for continuing this barbaric trade and this barbaric view of whaling.
I think the nations of this world made a very sensible decision to put in a moratorium. We need to ensure that whaling never ever recommences. I am very concerned that the proposals that are being put to the IWC will in fact wind back the good work that has been done in the past. I urge the government and the minister to take an extremely strong stand—but, unfortunately, I think the action has been taken too late. We will be watching IWC negotiations very closely—very closely indeed—and I just hope that the outcome at the IWC does not invalidate the legal action that the government is commencing.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-06-16,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United Nations and other international agencies in Europe and the 121st Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva, which took place from 7 to 24 October 2009. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I have great pleasure in presenting the report of the delegation of which I was deputy leader, with Mr Roger Price from the other place as the leader. I should also mention Senator Crossin, sitting across from me, who was the other senator who was a member of this delegation.
The international agencies in Europe which we visited and had in-depth discussions with were the World Food Program; the Global Crop Diversity Trust, about which I will have more to say later; the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, more commonly known as the FAO; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; the International Atomic Energy Agency; the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty Organisation; and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, known as the OECD.
The particular item that I would like to stress as being very important to this delegation was the global diversity trust. The reason is that not only did we visit this trust but it had a particular place to play in the discussion at the IPU. At the IPU Australia was instrumental in moving a resolution on food security which was adopted by consensus and was, I believe, the first in which Australia played a very constructive role, and we issued a press release to mark this.
The Parliamentary Action to Ensure Global Food Security was adopted by the assembly, as I said, and in particular spoke about the way in which governments can assist to free up both the production and the movement of food. The assembly recognised that the world is experiencing various natural and man-made disasters ranging from drought, famine and floods to locust invasions, and of course all of that affects agricultural productivity and the macroeconomic status of countries, particularly developing ones. We recognised that these severe weather patterns have become so common globally that they have led to the loss of life and property and the destruction of farmlands and transport infrastructure and we reaffirmed that, although obviously each country has primary responsibility for its own sustainable development and poverty eradication, there is a great deal that can be done by developed countries to enable developing countries to achieve their sustainable development goals, particularly those that arise out of the relevant UN conferences and the United Nations Millennium Declaration.
It is interesting to note that the number of malnourished people in developing countries has unfortunately increased to more than one billion. Food prices have fallen from their recent peaks but they remain volatile. That is due, among other things, to speculative trade in futures markets in food grains, and they are expected to remain relatively high in the foreseeable future. Armed conflict, of course, also causes a steep decline in socioeconomic conditions, and the international community’s capacity to respond to the growing demand for food is constrained by increasing urbanisation—a topic that we have often discussed in this chamber—water scarcity, the decline in investment in agricultural research and development, distortions in global food markets, increasing energy prices, environmental degradation and climate change.
Our visit to the Global Crop Diversity Trust pointed out several ways in which Australia can help to achieve the millennium goals by the work that we do. The global diversity trust ensures the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. Australia was an inaugural donor to the trust and is now a leading donor. It has also managed to attract large donations from private sector corporations, but Australia is the fourth biggest contributor behind the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Kingdom and Norway, and we have guaranteed our future contribution by announcements in various budgets. I was very pleased to note that the Grains Research and Development Corporation, a body for which I was formerly responsible as parliamentary secretary, has pledged US$5 million to the trust, of which US$3.25 million has been paid to date.
As well as funding the endowment fund, AusAID funds a three-year seconded position to the secretariat of the trust, and we have had an officer from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in that role. We are also represented on the trust through various members of the board, including in particular Professor John Lovett, who is a former executive director of the Grains Research and Development Corporation.
The global diversity trust, along with the Norwegian government, funded the high-profile Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway, which means that, increasingly, rare seeds and other biological resources can be kept so that the most important collections of priority food crops can be built on in the future and kept in order that agricultural research can be further developed to be the main source of genetic resources for the world’s plant breeders. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault was opened in February 2008 and will eventually store virtually every variety of almost every important food crop in the world. It is essentially the world’s agricultural insurance policy against disaster so that food production can be restarted should it be threatened by a regional or global catastrophe.
When delegations such as this one visit institutions they very rarely make recommendations, understanding that the organisations that they visit are best fitted to run their own business. But in this instance the entire delegation was of the view that Australia could be doing more to ensure the safety and protection of its seed bank. So we recommend in this report that the Australian government work cooperatively with state governments to ensure that their stocks of seeds are securely held in seed banks and that they are duplicated and safely lodged with the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. That is something that I would particularly like to see happen, and it was an integral part of the delegation’s work.
I also want to particularly mention the outstanding work of Mr Neil Bessell, who was secretary to the delegation and accompanied the delegation throughout. He was absolutely assiduous in seeing that every detail that we needed—particularly at the IPU meeting in Geneva—was provided for us and that our every comfort was looked after. In other words, he ensured that all delegates were completely looked after from the start to the finish. His company was excellent and I do want to extend to him the very sincere thanks of the delegation for the work that he did on that delegation and in every other activity that Mr Bessell carries out.
We went on to develop another resolution at the 121st Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and that carried over to the 122nd assembly, which was held in Bangkok, Thailand, earlier this year. I was chair of the drafting committee for that particular resolution, and I hope to report on that process when we table the report of the 122nd assembly in the future. This was the most interesting delegation to go on in terms of learning more about Australia’s role in international organisations and playing quite an important role in the resolution on food security at the IPU assembly.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the United Nations and Other International Agencies in Europe, and the 121st Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva</title>",Delegation Reports,22,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I rise to reiterate some of the remarks of my colleague Senator Troeth and to provide a comment on the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United Nations and other international agencies in Europe that we are tabling this afternoon. As Senator Troeth said, I was the other senator on the delegation, and the two delegates from the House of Representatives were Mr Roger Price and Mrs Sophie Mirabella.
From time to time in this place we get reports of parliamentary delegations and they are often tabled and left for people to read if they so wish, and they are probably very rarely looked at. I would really urge anyone who has an interest in international agriculture and food security to have a very close look at this report. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with my colleagues from this place, and what we achieved as a nation is worth studying in this report. Mr Price and Senator Troeth devised this program and it is thanks to their ingenuity and their foresight that it had a tremendous outcome. What this delegation did that was quite different from previous delegations is that we went to the 121st Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union with the intention of moving the major resolution in the main assembly, and that was on food security. In order to do that, we went to a number of United Nations organisations and we met with and lobbied members of the IPU in various countries on the way to Geneva. It was because of the legwork that we did in gathering the facts, having documentation to back the resolution we put forward, and the support of members of the IPU in places such as France, Italy and Austria, that we actually achieved the outcome that we did.
We went to the United Nations World Food Program, as Senator Troeth said. We went to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. We went to the Global Crop Diversity Trust, and Senator Troeth has talked about the seed bank and the recommendation from this committee following the report to that trust. We also went to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, because food security, lack of food and access to food are interrelated when it comes to serious and organised crime. We also used the time to go to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the OECD.
We spent some time in Italy on the way over, and I want to publicly commend former Senator Amanda Vanstone, the Australian Ambassador to Italy, for her very well organised and warm, hospitable reception. I think she has done this country very proud in the way she has undertaken her duties as ambassador. We were able to meet with the IPU President, Mr Pier Ferdinando Casini, and, of course, Ms Angela Napoli, who played a pivotal role in the IPU.
We also had a chance to meet with the Australian Ambassador to the Holy See, the Hon. Tim Fischer. I know there has been some controversy about that appointment and whether or not we need an ambassador in the Holy See. After spending some time with Mr Fischer and listening to the work that he does, I have no doubt that it is crucial for this country to have a personal presence in Vatican City and the Holy See. I have no doubt that he has played a contributing role—not a pivotal role—in the fact that this year, as Catholics in Australia, we will celebrate the canonisation of our first saint, Mary MacKillop. I think that the liaising that Mr Fischer has done between the Vatican City and this country was, at the time, very crucial and important and that his appointment has facilitated that canonisation.
I also want to mention the fact that we were the very first parliamentary delegation to go to the new country of Slovakia. Of course, that country has existed for a number of years. It was formerly Czechoslovakia and it has now split to become Slovakia. It was a very proud moment for us to be the first official delegation from this country to meet with members of their parliament, to interact with members of their parliament and to talk about how our committee structure works and some of the committee work that we do. I also found that our visit to the parliament in Vienna was quite interesting, particularly the interaction we had with the parliamentary education office there. I have given our Parliamentary Education Office in this building samples of the work that they undertake with children in Vienna. It is interesting that in Vienna they teach children not only about how the legislation program works and how parliament works but also about the media and the perception of legislation and the day’s events as part of their program. I found that that was another interesting way in which you can inform young children about civics and politics in their development.
Finally, I think the delegation was tremendously successful in that on the floor of the assembly there were three items put up to be the main items of debate at that meeting and we and Uganda managed to convince the countries there that our resolution was the one that should be considered. At the IPU they actually vote on what they are going to vote on. Of the three resolutions that were put up, they chose the resolution that we sponsored with Uganda on world food security. That motion, which is about four pages long, is attached to the back of this report.
After a number of hours of debate we were successful in getting that resolution put up. I think internationally it is a watershed resolution. If you want some key pointers for what parliaments, governments, politicians and countries should do when it comes to world food security, I do not think you can go past the range of ideas and options that were in that resolution.
For us as a country, I think it was a tremendously successful delegation. I think the work and lobbying we did on our way to Geneva paid dividends given the fact that we were successful in getting the resolution up. I understand it is the first time Australia has got a resolution through the assembly and I pay tribute again to Mr Price and Senator Troeth for their initiative in taking that forward.
In closing, I also want to reiterate the comments that Senator Troeth made about Mr Neil Bessell and Mr Eric Van Der Wal, who is from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. One of the things that I noticed when I went overseas is that we have some tremendously talented people from this country who know a lot about how the world works and who undertake their roles diligently. They are experts in what they do and they know how to assist delegations such as ours.
Neil Bessell was one of those people. At night, when we had decided we were going to put our feet up and have a bit of a rest, Neil was making sure the next day’s meetings were organised, typing up reports from the day before and making sure that the paperwork was done. He worked many long hours in the days that we were overseas. He knows how to handle a delegation. He knows how to represent this parliament and this country, and he did it astoundingly well. I want to thank him very much for the way in which he accompanied and looked after us. I had a broken arm during my 17 days. With my arm in plaster, they were not exactly the best 17 days I have had travelling in Europe but Mr Bessell made sure that I was comfortable most of the time and not in an awful lot of pain.
I think this report ought to be read by the ministers and shadow ministers in this parliament. It certainly proved to me that we have some very fine people overseas, such as Robert Tickner and Chris Lamb, the head of the International Red Cross. The many Australians we met working in the United Nations certainly do this country very proud. I think that this report and the outcome from this delegation is something this country can be most proud of.

In moving these amendments, the opposition are not in any way seeking to impede the passage or introduction of the government scheme. As we have flagged in the second reading debate, the opposition are concerned that the government is seeking to give business in effect the role of being the PPL paymaster. We are therefore seeking these substantive amendments to extend the role of the Family Assistance Office in administering the Paid Parental Leave scheme indefinitely. This measure would make ongoing use of the taxpayer investment in the establishment of the necessary payment and operating systems beyond the initial six months. We urge the government to embrace the coalition’s amendments in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary and unjustified cost, additional regulatory burden and the compliance risks to the small business community.
I think anyone who has been watching the debate in this chamber about the PPL legislation would be well aware that the opposition have been very responsible in the approach we have taken to amendments that have been put forward. Where amendments have been put forward which may have given effect to part of the coalition’s own policy but where it is clear that there was no prospect of the government agreeing with such amendments in the House, we have not supported those amendments. We have been at pains to do everything we possibly can to facilitate the passage of this legislation. However, the Senate, and the opposition in particular, has an important role to scrutinise legislation, and where we see what we feel to be a genuine problem that can easily and readily be addressed then we think it is the responsible and appropriate thing to move an amendment to that effect. It is the opposition’s hope that the government will seriously consider the amendments we are putting forward.
In moving these amendments I want to acknowledge the ceaseless advocacy in this area—that being the impact of the government’s legislation on business—of Mr Billson, the shadow minister for small business, and Senator Boswell, who is also a ceaseless advocate in this place for small business. We genuinely hope that the government will consider these amendments.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-06-16,"—I was hoping a quorum would have been called as a common courtesy. These amendments are similar to the amendments Family First put to this chamber. This is all about making sure that small businesses and businesses are not inconvenienced. The Family Assistance Office is already involved in handling paid parental leave payments for people who have worked fewer than 12 months in one business. They are already handling it, they are already taking care of it, and they are already doing this sort of stuff, so why would you duplicate and have another set of people worrying about how to make these payments? The Family Assistance Office is already going to have to do it for some. I think it is unnecessary red tape that will be placed on businesses, especially small businesses. These amendments obviously make sense and, seeing as they are Family First amendments, and the opposition’s ones are similar to ours, I am hoping common sense prevails. These amendments make sure that the Family Assistance Office is doing the hard work and not leaving the burden and red tape to small businesses. I think it is an impost that we can certainly do without placing on them.

Unfortunately the government does not support removing employer involvement in the Paid Parental Leave scheme. We want to ensure that women maintain a strong connection with the workforce by receiving their government funded parental leave pay through their employer, as they would receive any other work entitlement. Only nine per cent of all businesses will be involved in Paid Parental Leave in any given year and only three per cent of small businesses. To help employers prepare for the scheme, the role of employers in providing government funded parental leave pay will be phased in over the first six months to align with the new financial year. Parental leave pay will be paid in accordance with an employer’s normal pay practices and the employees’ usual pay cycle. The design of the government scheme as recommended by the Productivity Commission sends a strong message that taking leave from work around the time of a birth is a normal part of work and family life.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech

This amendment seeks to address a question raised at the Senate inquiry as to whether the government scheme was offering entitlements that were additional to those that already exist or whether employers could use the government funding to offset their own schemes. This amendment removes any possible uncertainty over the issue. It makes it clear that an employer cannot use parental leave pay under this bill to meet their obligation to provide employer funded paid parental leave under an industrial agreement.

As indicated, we do not want to be difficult on this but, as there were five days between the drafting of this and its circulation, and it was only circulated today, I ask the minister if this particular amendment could be pushed down the list and a briefing provided for the opposition so that we can get a better understanding as to the working of these proposed amendments.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-16,—There were discussions today with ACCI and AiG and my understanding is that they were both very comfortable with this amendment. This amendment simply confirms that the government’s PPL payment cannot be used to satisfy any other employer obligations as they may exist from time to time. It is no more complex than that.,SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-16,"—It was Tony Melville from AiG.. I do not have the information on ACCI on me at present, but those meetings did take place and, again, this is simply confirming that the payments cannot be used to satisfy other employee obligations.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-06-16,"—It may surprise you to know that as far as I understand it ACCI has concerns about the amendment, and had concerns at the time that they had the amendment relayed to them just before lunch time today. I find your reassurance somewhat at odds with my understanding of ACCI’s position. I look forward to hearing with whom the minister did consult at ACCI and the basis of the minister’s reassurance that ACCI and, indeed, AiG are not concerned about the amendment.
Has the government consulted with the union movement in respect of this amendment, and if so, who with?",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-16,"—The government is happy to withdraw the amendment. This amendment was put in place to provide certainty to employers. It came out of the recent inquiry, but it is not legally required. So if coalition senators wish to oppose it then we are happy to withdraw it.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-06-16,—If the government takes up the coalition’s request that the coalition be briefed about the amendment we may be in a better position to deal with it.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-06-16,"—I did indicate earlier in this committee process that the Greens would withdraw our amendment relating to these issues because the government had subsequently adopted their own solution to the issue and put forward their own amendment. If the government are now going to withdraw their amendment then I will recirculate the Greens amendment. This is a very important issue and I do not want to see the government backtrack on this. This is a clear indication—it was spoken about in the Senate inquiry, and it has been spoken about since by the minister—that there needs to be a much clearer direction given in this legislation to ensure that employers do not cut their existing entitlements simply because this parental leave scheme is coming in. Please, Minister, I would urge you not to withdraw; otherwise, I will put mine back on.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-06-16,"—As I indicated previously, we are not looking to cause a difficulty here. This amendment was only circulated today. There may not be an issue with it, but I think it would facilitate the deliberation of this chamber if the government were prepared to agree to a briefing for the opposition on this amendment. If this amendment can be pushed down the list then I think that would expedite matters. There is only another five minutes before we finish dealing with PPL tonight, so I think if the government could agree to that, that might be a way forward.",SENATE,<title>PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-16,"—I get the feeling that we are heading towards a filibuster from coalition senators which I think government senators find disappointing, especially given some of the earlier comments from Senator Fifield.

         (5)    The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving the report.
I was going to announce that I would be withdrawing this amendment based on the fact that the postponed amendment from the government deals with it. The third issue that the government has picked up on that the Greens have been talking about is the importance of having a legislated review of the scheme. I am thankful that the government has taken this on board. I hesitate to withdraw this amendment because I would hate to think that tomorrow morning we might come back and the government’s amendment has changed.

              (a)    updated at least every 6 months, not later than 31 December and 30 June each year; and

This amendment goes to the fact that we want some data collected through this process so that once the review happens we have access to data to see how this scheme has impacted on workplaces, women who have taken the leave and parents who have access to the scheme, and we ensure that we can track how the scheme is rolling out. There have been a lot of comments made about the fact that this scheme is not perfect; that it is a block which needs to be built upon. The best way of us ensuring that we get that right is to have an audit of the issues it faces.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-16,"—This evening I rise to speak on a matter which I have been involved in for many years. When it comes to cancer, there is no need to reinforce my commitment to the cause. Since 2006 I, along with other committed senators, House of Representatives members, Queensland members of parliament, councillors, trade union officials and members of communities in Brisbane, have been raising dollars to combat cancer and hopefully find a cure for this insidious disease. Collectively to date we have raised over $55,000 to help the Cancer Council of Queensland to fund outcomes. Most of the activities have been concentrated on fundraising through the Relay for Life events in Pine Rivers, Redcliffe and Brisbane. However, on Saturday, 13 March I was invited, along with the member for Longman, Jon Sullivan, and the state member for Morayfield, Mark Ryan, to participate in an event held at the Caboolture hall to commemorate the passing of Toni Lee-Anne Connelly and to raise money for the Cancer Council of Queensland.
To have an understanding of Toni’s illness we need to go back to May 2005, when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, having experienced muscular spasms in her left leg. She was operated on within a week of being diagnosed, her loving family by her side. The operation was followed by extensive radiation therapy. As normal procedure, scans were conducted at six-monthly intervals. By 2008 scans revealed the cancer was returning in the form of an aggressive blastoma multiforme cancer. Doctors were hesitant to operate and the family continued to search for a possible cure, as they had before. Subsequently, a debulking operation was performed in September 2008 at Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, with Toni’s loving family at her side once again. Chemo and stereotactic radiation therapies were administered in further attempts to stop the tumour’s progression.
Toni knew from her many visits to the cancer wards that there were countless others affected by this disease, not just the direct suffers but also their families and friends. Toni always tried to make her family happy and reduce their worries. She never complained about the effects of the treatment or the way it made her feel. Quite selflessly in November 2009, despite all the pain and treatment she had endured, Toni expressed a wish to raise funds to help young children and others affected by cancer. The family spoke with close friends and soon team TLC was formed.
Team TLC set about raising awareness and support for the cause, and a fundraiser was held in March 2010. The Cancer Council Queensland were contacted and they threw their support behind the team’s efforts. Team members reported widespread community support for the cause, and on 13 March 2010 the event became reality at the Caboolture Memorial Hall. The event took on the theme of a mad hatters tea party and auction, with items from the wider community, including political memorabilia from Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, and a multitude of local business donating various items for auction. Along with entry and sales from a sausage sizzle, the auction raised funds of over $16,500 on that day, and the sole beneficiary was Cancer Council Queensland.
Despite Toni spending her palliative days in the care of her family at home and passing quietly in the early hours of the morning of 1 March, 12 days short of the event, I am sure she would have been overwhelmed with the success of main convener Russell Veritz, the TLC team and supporters. Toni was loved by all who knew her. She was a very well respected member of the community, not just as a businesswoman but as a person. She is sadly and deeply missed by her sons and family and all who knew her. Like Toni and the TLC team, I shall continue my commitment to raising funds through my involvement in Relay for Life to one day find a cure for this insidious disease.
In respect of this government’s commitment, the Rudd government provided $500,000 in funding towards the Cairns Base Hospital chemotherapy initiative in the 2009-10 financial year and will provide $7.3 million over three years to establish an integrated cancer centre at Cairns Base Hospital. It will be a purpose-built facility offering a range of cancer treatments, including a radiation oncology service. Funding will also be injected into the states to support follow-up for National Bowel Cancer Screening Program participants who returned a positive test result. Queensland will receive $400,000 in the 2010-11 financial year. Through the Health and Hospitals Fund, the Commonwealth will provide $1.3 billion over six years to support infrastructure to deliver a world-class cancer care system. This will modernise cancer services and improve detection, survival and treatment outcomes.
Since 2007 the government has injected millions into cancer care, including $600 million to ensure Australians with cancer can get the medication they need, $120 million to replace BreastScreen Australia’s analogue mammography equipment with state of the art digital mammography equipment used for screening women with breast cancer, $87.4 million to expand the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, $31 million for women who require breast prostheses as a result of breast cancer, $12 million for the McGrath Foundation to recruit, train and employ breast care nurses for four years, $15 million for a children’s cancer centre in Adelaide, $15 million for CanTeen to establish youth cancer networks, $15 million to set up two dedicated prostate cancer research centres in Brisbane and Melbourne and $15 million to establish the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne.
The Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, recently announced the Rudd government’s plan to create a single national cancer control agency to further strengthen the government’s strategic focus on cancer control and to build a better health and hospital system. The government intends to amalgamate the national lead cancer agency, Cancer Australia, with the successful National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, the government’s expert centre on breast and ovarian cancer control. The proposed joint agency will have a clear leadership mandate across all cancers and a capacity to better focus on Cancer Australia’s responsibilities under the Cancer Australia Act 2006. The benefits of such an approach are as follows: the amalgamated agency would allow the time, effort and expense spent on separate reporting requirements and administration to be redirected so that the maximum resources go to front-line cancer programs and research; all cancer stakeholders would have one Australian government agency to work with, regardless of cancer type; and the government would have one coordinated source of expert advice on cancer care.
Breast and ovarian cancer patients and their families can be assured that these cancers will remain a priority of the Australian government, as the new Cancer Australia will continue to focus on breast and ovarian cancer as it delivers the government’s broader cancer programs and research priorities. The proposed model has proved effective internationally and will create a more strategic approach to fighting cancer, building on the successes in treating specific cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer. When it comes to commitment to combating cancer, I am pleased to say that the Rudd Labor government and my team members who walk and run for 18 hours each year in Relay for Life are as one.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Cancer</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech
