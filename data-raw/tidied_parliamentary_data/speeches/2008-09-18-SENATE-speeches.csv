That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
First Home Saver Accounts (Further Provisions) Amendment Bill 2008
First Home Saver Account Providers Supervisory Levy Imposition Bill 2008

I table a statement of reasons relating to the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 and seek leave to have the statement incorporated into Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1)

Purpose of the Bill

The bill gives the force of law to the revised tax treaty with Japan.

Reasons for Urgency

The revised tax treaty with Japan will broadly update the taxation arrangements between Australia and Japan.  The new taxation arrangements will enhance Australia’s relationship with Japan by further assisting trade and investment flows.
Passage of the bill in the 2008 Spring sittings will permit the revised Japan treaty to commence from 1 January 2009.  Any delay would mean the treaty would not commence until 1 January 2010.  Advice has been received that the Japan treaty has been approved by the Parliament of Japan, and that all domestic procedures necessary for entry into force, for Japan, have been completed.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
First of all, I extend my and the committee’s thanks to the committee secretariat. This particular reference and this inquiry is a very technical one. I think I speak for all the committee members in saying that much of the evidence we got was of a highly technical nature. Some of us were not as well equipped to deal with that as, perhaps, others were, but the secretariat did a magnificent job. I particularly want to mention Mr Stephen Palethorpe and Mr Tim Watling and their staff for the excellent support they gave to the committee. I also thank all of those witnesses who appeared before the committee. Some travelled great distances to assist the committee with the evidence they gave. The committee is particularly grateful to witnesses.
To speak to this report properly will take more than the 10 minutes that is allowed to me today but I want to make some general comments. I will come back to the report in more detail when time permits later in the Senate’s schedule. By and large, the committee heard and I think accepted that the financial management of the relevant state governments around Australia was pretty poor. You only have to look at the New South Wales situation in recent days to give justification to that conclusion. I particularly want to thank Mr Michael Costa, the former Treasurer in New South Wales, who had a parting shot at his former government colleagues when he resigned. He indicated that stamp duty revenues had fallen by $180 million in the first two months of the financial year, the health budget had blown out by $300 million this year alone, and there was a $5 billion capital funding shortfall over the next five years causing Standard and Poor’s to warn that there was a one in three chance of New South Wales losing its AAA rating which would, in turn, raise borrowing costs by over $500 million over the forward estimates.
If you looked at the material presented to us, perhaps you would see that we have not come to such a clear conclusion as Mr Costa made available to us in his media conference. This was one of the issues that the committee found some difficulty with during its inquiry. State governments across the country put out various reports, graphs and details of their financial positions, but they are practically meaningless. One would almost think that the way they present their reports is designed to ensure that the public has no idea of the real state of play in state government finances. That is why one of the committee’s recommendations is that there should be a uniform and simple process for all state governments to report so that you can make an assessment of the financial management of particular state governments.
The GST has been a huge windfall gain for state government finances but, as I will mention in more detail later, they have in many cases squandered the money that has been received. There is evidence to back this up and it is all mentioned in the report. You might recall that part of the deal for the states was to remove a certain number of state taxes, but the committee was disappointed to learn that not all states have done that. That is set out more fully in the report.
The evidence before the committee showed that state governments have generally failed in infrastructure investment and, in recent years, when they have borrowed to try to catch up on the core infrastructure, they have in fact put upward pressure on inflation. We often hear this government saying a whole lot about inflation. I never hear them saying, though, that to a degree the state governments’ ill-timed infrastructure investment has been a real cause of rising inflation in Australia, and I am delighted that our inquiry was able to highlight that evidence. I will detail that a little later in my speech or when I have the ability at some other time.
I want to refer to particular items in the report that may be of interest. We heard that state governments, as I say, have had a major windfall with the GST but that they have not spent it well. I refer to paragraph 4.42 of the report where we detailed that, between 1996 and 2007, the number of public sector employees in the Australian government decreased by 121,700. But, over the same time, public sector employees at the state level increased by 210,700 in number. If you could say that that is because the states are giving increased service to their constituents that might be excusable, but you can pick up any newspaper in any state capital to see the huge problems that state bureaucracies are having in running hospitals, running schools or, in fact, running anything. So that money has been squandered. Also, the report highlights that, between 1996 and 2007, the amount spent by the Commonwealth government on wages increased by 12 per cent. At the same time, state governments’ wages bills increased by 95 per cent. You can just imagine what that is doing to inflation.
I note table 4.6 in the report. Again, it deals with superannuation. State governments will give you headlines and produce some figures saying that they are doing pretty well, but when you look at superannuation liabilities, which, in the main, are unfunded, you see the real position. In relation to the net debt in the general government sector, Queensland’s figures, for example—I will use my own state—show that they have not a net debt but a surplus of some $24 billion for the current financial year which will fall to a surplus of about $13 billion in 2011-12. But, if you include the unfunded superannuation, you will find that what the Queensland government told us was a surplus of $13 billion is in fact a deficit of something like $11 billion—and that is unfunded. That is the sort of financial management we heard about during the inquiry.
I have many, many examples to support my contention that the states have managed poorly, and I very much look forward to being able to advise the Senate of them. But can I just refer the Senate to page 65 of our report where we look at government business enterprises. The Productivity Commission conducted an investigation and found that over half of the government business enterprises they investigated failed to achieve a return on assets above the risk-free rate of return. Further, they found that 12 GBEs, or 14 per cent, failed to achieve a positive return on their assets and, in total, GBEs made payments to owner governments of almost $4.4 billion but poor profitability has led to inadequate returns. The evidence provided to us listed a number of government business enterprises who paid to their shareholding governments more than 100 per cent of their profits as dividends to suit the political purposes of the relevant state government owner. They are listed in the appendix 6 of the report. I am concerned at the way states have managed their finances— (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2008-09-18,"—I rise to speak to this report and particularly to refer to the government senators minority report. Firstly, I endorse the comments of the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on State Government Financial Management, Senator Ian Macdonald, in thanking the secretariat for the work they did during the conduct of the inquiry and in putting this report together. But it is necessary to go back and look at how this select committee inquiry was established because it relates very clearly to what the purpose of this inquiry was about. We have just had that confirmed in the speech by Senator Macdonald.
This select committee inquiry was established within the first couple of days of the sitting of the new parliament following the election of the Rudd Labor government. I can recall the debate that occurred at that time, on 13 February, when the opposition came into this Senate and moved to establish three select committees—one of which is this one to look at state government financial management—with a majority of opposition senators on each of those select committees and an opposition chair.
In all of the 12 years that the Howard government was in office, not once did they ever seek to refer to the standing committees of the Senate—or to establish a select committee on—the issue of state government financial management. That is not to say they were not critical of it. I am not here today to defend state government financial management—that is their job—but not once in those 12 years did the Howard government seek to establish such a committee. And certainly not once since they gained control of the Senate, in July 2005, with a majority of coalition senators did they even seek to establish any select committee into any area. Yet on the first full day of sitting of this parliament under the new Labor government they decided they would get on the political attack straightaway, get stuck into the state governments, and they set this inquiry up.
What is interesting is that the first closing date for submissions was to be 19 March. That had to be extended. In the majority report it says that that was due to time pressures associated with the committee’s hearing program. The real reason why it had to be extended was that they received very few submissions. They had about 18 submissions, and most of their state colleagues in the oppositions had not got around to putting a submission in to attack their Labor governments. They had to be wound up, they had to be contacted and told, ‘Get your submission in,’ so the opposition could actually make something out of this inquiry. That is what happened, so the dates were extended.
We reject the assertions in this majority report that this committee was established, in a serious way, to look at state-federal government relations and state government financial management. While the majority report covers some important and interesting areas, such as specific purpose payments, the need for infrastructure spending, issues to do with financial reporting, Commonwealth-state government financial relations, local government and so on, it is essentially based on the submissions made by state oppositions—state shadow treasurers, shadow finance ministers, leaders of the opposition. You read through the report and they are referred to constantly—it is their evidence—together with that of a number of academics who supported the line that was intended to be adopted by the opposition.
I am prepared to say at the outset that there are a lot of issues of concern with state government financial management. I do not deny that. It was such a godsend for the opposition that Michael Costa had that parting flourish at his press conference and did so just in time for the opposition to take some quotes out of his press conference and put it into their report, because there would have been a big black hole in their report if Mr Costa had not entertained us with his flourish as he departed the Treasury portfolio in New South Wales.
One of the major problems of the majority report is that it fails to take account of what is happening now through the COAG process. We cover this in our minority report, where we refer to the things that are being considered in the current reform process through COAG. The number of specific purpose payments will be reduced from more than 90 to five—that has been negotiated, that has been agreed upon—in the area of health care, early years education in schools, vocational education, disabilities and housing. Secondly, as we state:
... the Commonwealth will give the States the budget flexibility they need to allocate resources where they will produce the best results. The Commonwealth will move away from the prescription of the past, and remove the input controls which inhibit State service delivery and priority setting. Instead, the focus will be on the achievement of outcomes.
Third, the Commonwealth will provide the States with more funding certainty.
There is a very interesting comment in the majority report—and like Senator Macdonald, I am going to need more time not only to deal with this report but also with the important issues that this report starts to deal with, but unfortunately, as I said, from a starting point which was clearly intended to be an attack upon state governments. It is at paragraph 2.4, where the majority report, being the opposition senators, states:
With the propensity of the Commonwealth Government in recent years to proclaim large ‘surpluses,’ one wonders why the states are not making a greater political call for ‘surplus revenue of the Commonwealth’ to be returned to them, although over the years the Commonwealth has found ways of ensuring that no true surpluses exist.
What a fascinating comment! What is being said by the opposition majority senators of this committee is that the states should have just asked for more of the Commonwealth’s money, because the Commonwealth, as we know, through the Howard years—the highest taxing government in the history of this country—racked up huge budget surpluses. We have in our minority report a table which demonstrates the level of surpluses that grew each year under the Howard-Costello budgets. These were surpluses which were often projected to be at one rate but ended up at 100 per cent, 200 per cent or more above that level—surpluses regularly in excess of $5 billion to $10 billion per year. The opposition argues that the states should have asked for more money and then obviously they would not have been in such a difficult financial position. Well, I remind the opposition, I can never recall an era when the state governments have stopped asking for more money from the Commonwealth and asking for more taxation revenue—it is just an article of faith.
What it points to is one of the other major criticisms of the opposition majority report, which is that the states failed to spend on infrastructure when they should have. I can agree with that to an extent, because the states clearly have major infrastructure problems at the moment—ageing infrastructure, much of which was put into place post-World War II, that needs to be upgraded, whether it be rail, health or whatever.
The criticism that is made by the opposition is hypocritical because the prevailing orthodoxy right through the Howard government years was to budget for a surplus and reduce government debt. That was the fiscal direction set by the Commonwealth and it was clearly the prevailing economic orthodoxy that states were expected to follow, and they did. Now they are in opposition, we have the coalition coming in here and saying: ‘The states should’ve spent more money. They should’ve borrowed money, maybe, to invest in infrastructure.’ You cannot have it both ways. If the states had spent massively in the Howard years, you would have criticised them for going into debt. Now you turn around and criticise them for not building infrastructure. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>State Government Financial Management Committee</title>,Committees,10,1
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-09-18,"—I will speak briefly to give other members of the Senate Select Committee on State Government Financial Management the opportunity to say something. I would like to add my thanks to those of Senator Macdonald and Senator Forshaw to the secretariat, particularly Mr Palethorpe, Mr Watling and their staff, for this report.
Unlike Senator Forshaw, I am confident that this report in the years to come will make a valuable contribution to our understanding of how the states have managed their funds. It has some very, very useful information on the history of payments from the Commonwealth to the states. It contains some other extraordinarily useful graphs and tables, developed specifically for this select committee, on the way that the states have gone about accounting for their expenditure and for their assets, particularly in regard to the government business enterprise accounting procedures.
I will briefly comment on Senator Forshaw’s rather extraordinary claim that the Senate should not inquire into matters other than those that the government thinks should be the ones that get inquired into. We apparently now need the Rudd Labor government’s permission to decide on topics to inquire into. But even Senator Forshaw could not help but comment that in fact the inquiry came up with some important and interesting results; he could not get past that.
Of course Senator Forshaw could now happily bag the former Treasurer of New South Wales. But the fact remains that, even if this inquiry had happened when the Howard-Costello government was in power, the now government, the Labor Party, would still have had to produce a dissenting report. They would have had to look after their Labor mates irrespective of whether they were doing the job or not doing the job, and this report clearly points out that they were not doing the job. If this report had come down two or three months ago, I am sure the government would have been telling us what a sterling job New South Wales was doing and what a wonderful man Mr Costa was. Now that he is no longer the Treasurer, they feel safe to criticise him—when he is finally the one telling us the truth about where the big black holes are. They are not in this report but in the accounting procedures of the states.
I would also like to point out that Senator Forshaw claimed that we only had evidence from a few Liberal shadow treasurers and a couple of academics, who presumably are in Senator Macdonald’s pocket, to comment on financial management. I would have thought that perhaps Mr Derek Bazen, who is an analyst with the State Finances and Reporting Unit of Treasury, might be considered someone who is not entirely in the Liberal Party’s pocket. He talks about the need for a uniform presentation framework for the way budgets are presented. I do not think Treasury are known for their overblown language. In fact, they are known for their very measured assessments of things. Mr Bazen points out that the states do not publish their budgetary information in a uniform way; they can do it to suit their own purposes. He says:
In our monitoring of state finances we tend to rely on a uniform presentation framework, particularly because of the ability to compare what is happening between jurisdictions. But states do vary in terms of what they feel the most important fiscal indicator for their jurisdiction is, and this is why the headline measures that states report often seem a bit at odds in terms of how they present their material.
That is the very dry Treasury view of the sort of accounting that went on, which others in the report call creative accounting and even in some circumstances duplicitous, had it been used in the private sector. There is of course a lot more material in the report on infrastructure spending—the need for it, where it went and the way funding has been used by government business enterprises. But the core of this report is about the desperate need for a charter of budget honesty for the states to use in their accounting so people can be clear about what is held, what is not held and how it is being expended on behalf of the Australian taxpayers, who the opposition represents as does the government.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>State Government Financial Management Committee</title>,Committees,10,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-09-18,"—I rise, too, to make a few comments in relation to the Select Committee on State Government Financial Management report. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge Steve Palethorpe and his secretariat for the work that they have done on this report and for their cooperation in putting together our minority report. I only want to make a few comments because I think Senator Forshaw more than adequately put the case for the government in response to what was without a doubt a committee that was established to target state Labor governments. It was one of a number of select committees that the opposition rammed through and was obviously designed to be more of a witch-hunt than a serious attempt to investigate financial management.
Might I say that from the outset this committee was a shameless political exercise by the opposition. That has been borne out by the comments of the two opposition senators who have already spoken. The opposition members were there to score as many political points as possible. Those of you who want to take the time to read the majority report will gather that. If the coalition had been serious, they would have recommended these issues to the relevant standing committee rather than setting up the political exercise we saw here. It is worth noting that the submission date for the committee was extended by six weeks back in March. Obviously the political motivations of the opposition behind this committee had not got the response from their state colleagues that they would have liked.
I do have some experience of financial management, having previously worked for the state Labor government of my home state of Tasmania. The Tasmanian Labor government has done a fantastic job in the last 10 years since it has been in government. It inherited an absolute mess from the previous Liberal administration when it took power. I am a bit disappointed that my opposition colleagues from Tasmania failed to ensure that there was some credit given to a state government that actually has turned the tables. It took the good management of that Labor government to rebuild the faith of the business community, to reinvest in the future of our state and to help build the prosperity that Tasmania finds itself enjoying now. Even the opposition senators from Tasmania should give credit where credit is due—although I will be surprised if they do. It is no surprise to those of us in Tasmania, though. It is a bit of a theme in Tasmania that a Labor government seems to always have to pick up the pieces and rebuild after the Liberals have mismanaged the state.
Let us just look at what Hawke and Keating did. We are doing the same here now at the federal level after the high inflation and interest rate rise legacy of the Howard government. The government senators do not support the core conclusions and recommendations of the majority report. We do not support the first three recommendations in the majority report. While we can see merit in each state and territory government considering the benefits of implementing a charter of budget honesty, it is simply not appropriate for a Senate committee to be making recommendations requiring the direct action of other sovereign parliaments.
I also find it curious that the opposition have recommended that the prospect of state income taxes be investigated—a more complex tax system! What do we get once again from this opposition? Another layer of complexity for the Australian public to deal with. They come into this chamber relentlessly espousing the importance of small business and yet here they are wanting to introduce another level of taxation on the Australian community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The evidence provided to us listed a number of government business enterprises who paid to their shareholding governments more than 100 per cent of their profits as dividends to suit the political purposes of the relevant state government owner. They are listed in the appendix 6 of the report. I am concerned at the way states have managed their finances— (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2008-09-18,"—I rise to speak to this report and particularly to refer to the government senators minority report. Firstly, I endorse the comments of the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on State Government Financial Management, Senator Ian Macdonald, in thanking the secretariat for the work they did during the conduct of the inquiry and in putting this report together. But it is necessary to go back and look at how this select committee inquiry was established because it relates very clearly to what the purpose of this inquiry was about. We have just had that confirmed in the speech by Senator Macdonald.
This select committee inquiry was established within the first couple of days of the sitting of the new parliament following the election of the Rudd Labor government. I can recall the debate that occurred at that time, on 13 February, when the opposition came into this Senate and moved to establish three select committees—one of which is this one to look at state government financial management—with a majority of opposition senators on each of those select committees and an opposition chair.
In all of the 12 years that the Howard government was in office, not once did they ever seek to refer to the standing committees of the Senate—or to establish a select committee on—the issue of state government financial management. That is not to say they were not critical of it. I am not here today to defend state government financial management—that is their job—but not once in those 12 years did the Howard government seek to establish such a committee. And certainly not once since they gained control of the Senate, in July 2005, with a majority of coalition senators did they even seek to establish any select committee into any area. Yet on the first full day of sitting of this parliament under the new Labor government they decided they would get on the political attack straightaway, get stuck into the state governments, and they set this inquiry up.
What is interesting is that the first closing date for submissions was to be 19 March. That had to be extended. In the majority report it says that that was due to time pressures associated with the committee’s hearing program. The real reason why it had to be extended was that they received very few submissions. They had about 18 submissions, and most of their state colleagues in the oppositions had not got around to putting a submission in to attack their Labor governments. They had to be wound up, they had to be contacted and told, ‘Get your submission in,’ so the opposition could actually make something out of this inquiry. That is what happened, so the dates were extended.
We reject the assertions in this majority report that this committee was established, in a serious way, to look at state-federal government relations and state government financial management. While the majority report covers some important and interesting areas, such as specific purpose payments, the need for infrastructure spending, issues to do with financial reporting, Commonwealth-state government financial relations, local government and so on, it is essentially based on the submissions made by state oppositions—state shadow treasurers, shadow finance ministers, leaders of the opposition. You read through the report and they are referred to constantly—it is their evidence—together with that of a number of academics who supported the line that was intended to be adopted by the opposition.
I am prepared to say at the outset that there are a lot of issues of concern with state government financial management. I do not deny that. It was such a godsend for the opposition that Michael Costa had that parting flourish at his press conference and did so just in time for the opposition to take some quotes out of his press conference and put it into their report, because there would have been a big black hole in their report if Mr Costa had not entertained us with his flourish as he departed the Treasury portfolio in New South Wales.
One of the major problems of the majority report is that it fails to take account of what is happening now through the COAG process. We cover this in our minority report, where we refer to the things that are being considered in the current reform process through COAG. The number of specific purpose payments will be reduced from more than 90 to five—that has been negotiated, that has been agreed upon—in the area of health care, early years education in schools, vocational education, disabilities and housing. Secondly, as we state:
... the Commonwealth will give the States the budget flexibility they need to allocate resources where they will produce the best results. The Commonwealth will move away from the prescription of the past, and remove the input controls which inhibit State service delivery and priority setting. Instead, the focus will be on the achievement of outcomes.
Third, the Commonwealth will provide the States with more funding certainty.
There is a very interesting comment in the majority report—and like Senator Macdonald, I am going to need more time not only to deal with this report but also with the important issues that this report starts to deal with, but unfortunately, as I said, from a starting point which was clearly intended to be an attack upon state governments. It is at paragraph 2.4, where the majority report, being the opposition senators, states:
With the propensity of the Commonwealth Government in recent years to proclaim large ‘surpluses,’ one wonders why the states are not making a greater political call for ‘surplus revenue of the Commonwealth’ to be returned to them, although over the years the Commonwealth has found ways of ensuring that no true surpluses exist.
What a fascinating comment! What is being said by the opposition majority senators of this committee is that the states should have just asked for more of the Commonwealth’s money, because the Commonwealth, as we know, through the Howard years—the highest taxing government in the history of this country—racked up huge budget surpluses. We have in our minority report a table which demonstrates the level of surpluses that grew each year under the Howard-Costello budgets. These were surpluses which were often projected to be at one rate but ended up at 100 per cent, 200 per cent or more above that level—surpluses regularly in excess of $5 billion to $10 billion per year. The opposition argues that the states should have asked for more money and then obviously they would not have been in such a difficult financial position. Well, I remind the opposition, I can never recall an era when the state governments have stopped asking for more money from the Commonwealth and asking for more taxation revenue—it is just an article of faith.
What it points to is one of the other major criticisms of the opposition majority report, which is that the states failed to spend on infrastructure when they should have. I can agree with that to an extent, because the states clearly have major infrastructure problems at the moment—ageing infrastructure, much of which was put into place post-World War II, that needs to be upgraded, whether it be rail, health or whatever.
The criticism that is made by the opposition is hypocritical because the prevailing orthodoxy right through the Howard government years was to budget for a surplus and reduce government debt. That was the fiscal direction set by the Commonwealth and it was clearly the prevailing economic orthodoxy that states were expected to follow, and they did. Now they are in opposition, we have the coalition coming in here and saying: ‘The states should’ve spent more money. They should’ve borrowed money, maybe, to invest in infrastructure.’ You cannot have it both ways. If the states had spent massively in the Howard years, you would have criticised them for going into debt. Now you turn around and criticise them for not building infrastructure. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,10,2
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-09-18,"—I will speak briefly to give other members of the Senate Select Committee on State Government Financial Management the opportunity to say something. I would like to add my thanks to those of Senator Macdonald and Senator Forshaw to the secretariat, particularly Mr Palethorpe, Mr Watling and their staff, for this report.
Unlike Senator Forshaw, I am confident that this report in the years to come will make a valuable contribution to our understanding of how the states have managed their funds. It has some very, very useful information on the history of payments from the Commonwealth to the states. It contains some other extraordinarily useful graphs and tables, developed specifically for this select committee, on the way that the states have gone about accounting for their expenditure and for their assets, particularly in regard to the government business enterprise accounting procedures.
I will briefly comment on Senator Forshaw’s rather extraordinary claim that the Senate should not inquire into matters other than those that the government thinks should be the ones that get inquired into. We apparently now need the Rudd Labor government’s permission to decide on topics to inquire into. But even Senator Forshaw could not help but comment that in fact the inquiry came up with some important and interesting results; he could not get past that.
Of course Senator Forshaw could now happily bag the former Treasurer of New South Wales. But the fact remains that, even if this inquiry had happened when the Howard-Costello government was in power, the now government, the Labor Party, would still have had to produce a dissenting report. They would have had to look after their Labor mates irrespective of whether they were doing the job or not doing the job, and this report clearly points out that they were not doing the job. If this report had come down two or three months ago, I am sure the government would have been telling us what a sterling job New South Wales was doing and what a wonderful man Mr Costa was. Now that he is no longer the Treasurer, they feel safe to criticise him—when he is finally the one telling us the truth about where the big black holes are. They are not in this report but in the accounting procedures of the states.
I would also like to point out that Senator Forshaw claimed that we only had evidence from a few Liberal shadow treasurers and a couple of academics, who presumably are in Senator Macdonald’s pocket, to comment on financial management. I would have thought that perhaps Mr Derek Bazen, who is an analyst with the State Finances and Reporting Unit of Treasury, might be considered someone who is not entirely in the Liberal Party’s pocket. He talks about the need for a uniform presentation framework for the way budgets are presented. I do not think Treasury are known for their overblown language. In fact, they are known for their very measured assessments of things. Mr Bazen points out that the states do not publish their budgetary information in a uniform way; they can do it to suit their own purposes. He says:
In our monitoring of state finances we tend to rely on a uniform presentation framework, particularly because of the ability to compare what is happening between jurisdictions. But states do vary in terms of what they feel the most important fiscal indicator for their jurisdiction is, and this is why the headline measures that states report often seem a bit at odds in terms of how they present their material.
That is the very dry Treasury view of the sort of accounting that went on, which others in the report call creative accounting and even in some circumstances duplicitous, had it been used in the private sector. There is of course a lot more material in the report on infrastructure spending—the need for it, where it went and the way funding has been used by government business enterprises. But the core of this report is about the desperate need for a charter of budget honesty for the states to use in their accounting so people can be clear about what is held, what is not held and how it is being expended on behalf of the Australian taxpayers, who the opposition represents as does the government.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,10,2
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-09-18,"—I rise, too, to make a few comments in relation to the Select Committee on State Government Financial Management report. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge Steve Palethorpe and his secretariat for the work that they have done on this report and for their cooperation in putting together our minority report. I only want to make a few comments because I think Senator Forshaw more than adequately put the case for the government in response to what was without a doubt a committee that was established to target state Labor governments. It was one of a number of select committees that the opposition rammed through and was obviously designed to be more of a witch-hunt than a serious attempt to investigate financial management.
Might I say that from the outset this committee was a shameless political exercise by the opposition. That has been borne out by the comments of the two opposition senators who have already spoken. The opposition members were there to score as many political points as possible. Those of you who want to take the time to read the majority report will gather that. If the coalition had been serious, they would have recommended these issues to the relevant standing committee rather than setting up the political exercise we saw here. It is worth noting that the submission date for the committee was extended by six weeks back in March. Obviously the political motivations of the opposition behind this committee had not got the response from their state colleagues that they would have liked.
I do have some experience of financial management, having previously worked for the state Labor government of my home state of Tasmania. The Tasmanian Labor government has done a fantastic job in the last 10 years since it has been in government. It inherited an absolute mess from the previous Liberal administration when it took power. I am a bit disappointed that my opposition colleagues from Tasmania failed to ensure that there was some credit given to a state government that actually has turned the tables. It took the good management of that Labor government to rebuild the faith of the business community, to reinvest in the future of our state and to help build the prosperity that Tasmania finds itself enjoying now. Even the opposition senators from Tasmania should give credit where credit is due—although I will be surprised if they do. It is no surprise to those of us in Tasmania, though. It is a bit of a theme in Tasmania that a Labor government seems to always have to pick up the pieces and rebuild after the Liberals have mismanaged the state.
Let us just look at what Hawke and Keating did. We are doing the same here now at the federal level after the high inflation and interest rate rise legacy of the Howard government. The government senators do not support the core conclusions and recommendations of the majority report. We do not support the first three recommendations in the majority report. While we can see merit in each state and territory government considering the benefits of implementing a charter of budget honesty, it is simply not appropriate for a Senate committee to be making recommendations requiring the direct action of other sovereign parliaments.
I also find it curious that the opposition have recommended that the prospect of state income taxes be investigated—a more complex tax system! What do we get once again from this opposition? Another layer of complexity for the Australian public to deal with. They come into this chamber relentlessly espousing the importance of small business and yet here they are wanting to introduce another level of taxation on the Australian community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-09-18,"—In continuation of my remarks from the other day on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 and related legislation, it is interesting to note that we used to have a senator here, who was well known to all of us and a hard player—a gentleman known by the name of George Campbell. He was one of the great protectors of the Australian manufacturing workers and the Australian manufacturing industry. He was a hard player and was well respected. He was also a very affable person and would come around and have a drink with you at night. But apparently he was not hard or tough enough around this show. He had to be replaced and the Labor Party replaced him with someone who said that he was really going to take a strong line on the protection of manufacturing workers’ jobs.
The person who took his position was, of course, Senator Doug Cameron, who is a lovely bloke. I remember the sort of curry the Labor Party used to give me on issues last year and how they would put the torch on me. One of the first things that Doug did when he arrived here was to roll over on a tax that is going to put manufacturing workers out of a job—the luxury car tax. It is a tax that is going to affect the car industry in South Australia and Victoria. I know that Senator Cameron is a decent bloke. I know he knows that this is going to affect his workers and his union. But he has rolled over for them. He has rolled over and has basically become a doormat. Once more the Labor Left has become a doormat to the Right. They have been walked all over, trodden on and kicked around the room because the Right run the show. And the Right do not care about manufacturing workers’ jobs and they are intent on putting a blowtorch to the Australian car industry. And the tax will cost Australian working families their jobs in the most direct form.
The Labor Party are trying to glam this over and cover this up by saying, ‘You are out there protecting people who drive Porsches, Maseratis, Jaguars and Ferraris.’ I was interested because I thought that I must be able to pick up one of these cars for $57,180. So I went shopping. I had a bit of a wander around to see if I could get myself a Porsche 911 for $57,180. You could have knocked me down with a feather. Do you know how much those things cost? They cost $425,000. I said to them, ‘Senator Cameron reckons I can get one of these for $57,180. He reckons there must be one out the back. Have you got a cheaper version of the Porsche 911?’ But I cannot find one. I thought: ‘Not a problem. I will try a Jaguar XK Coupe. I should be able to get hold of one of them because the Labor Party keep telling me that this is the tax that is protecting these cars.’ I said, ‘Have you got a Jaguar XK Coupe for $57,180?’ And they said, ‘Don’t be crazy. That car is a quarter of a million dollars.’ So I had a look at a Ferrari because we are protecting people who drive Ferraris. The Labor Party, including Senator Carr, put an inflection in their voices when they say, ‘You are protecting Ferrari drivers.’ You would be surprised to find out that the Ferrari 599 is $574,000. They had none for $57,180. I looked everywhere. I looked up and down the car lots saying that there must be one of these Ferraris around here for $57,180. Not a chance. They are $574,000. What is that? It is 574 gorillas. That is a big hit. You just do not seem to be able to get any BMWs under that price either. They are not around. A Maserati Quattroporte was $281,000. But apparently the Labor Party know where you can find them for $57,180.
As we have said before, if someone is down the pub trying to sell you a Ferrari 599 for $57,180, it is hot. It is red hot and dodgy. That is like this policy that the Labor Party has brought out: it is red hot and dodgy. Not only are they putting their own manufacturing workers union members out of a job and not only are they putting excessive pressure on the working families of Victoria and South Australia, but they are apparently in the business of finding dodgy cars. I walked around the lot and asked: ‘What cars can I get for $57,180? I want something that is comfortable.’ They said, ‘If you want to pay a little bit more money, we can get you a Ford.’ I asked: ‘Who makes them?’ And they said, ‘Australia.’ I asked: ‘What about Holdens?’ They said, ‘Yep, we can get you one of those.’ I asked: ‘Where are they made?’ They said, ‘Australia.’ I asked: ‘What about Toyota?’ They said, ‘Yep, Australia.’ In fact every car manufacturing plant in Australia produces numbers of cars that are in this group.
It stands to reason that if you send a price mechanism signal to the consumer not to buy the product, they will not buy an Australian product. What we are exporting—to my good colleagues on the other side—are Australian jobs. That is what we are exporting. We should be exporting cars but instead you are going to export the jobs—just like you will later on with the emissions trading scheme. I wonder how George Campbell is feeling today. I wonder how he is going, sitting back, thinking: ‘Gee, haven’t things changed. Haven’t things got tougher since I left. Haven’t they done a great job looking after the Australian workers since I left there.’ Since George Campbell has left here, we have had the Right of the Labor Party overtaking and walking all over the Left. The Left do not exist; they just turn up to make up the numbers. They do not even have the courage or conviction to clearly display in this chamber what they know and believe to be right. They are absolutely being walked over. That is a shame because, as they are being walked over and do not have the courage and conviction to stand up and go in to bat for their people, it is their people—the working families of both Victoria and South Australia who work in the manufacturing plants—whose jobs are definitely under threat by this.
A clear example of that is the stresses that are on the manufacturing industry at the moment. They are just holding on by their nails to keep this industry in Australia. And the government talk in pipe dreams of things that might happen in the future. They say, ‘We will produce a hybrid car and we will do this and we will do that and the world will be rosy.’ But, right now, they are putting this tax on them—right now! This is the peculiarity that we have.
In this policy, which now looks like a shambles, we in the National Party will be party to an amendment, even though we completely disagree with the whole concept. If the Labor Party has a policy to push you out of a completely reasonable plane, we will then have to move an amendment to wear a parachute. Moving an amendment to wear a parachute does not mean that we agree with the concept of going out of a perfectly decent plane. Our amendment will be nice and simple. All these other amendments are more complex than Kafka’s palace. They are incredible—something to behold. Our amendment will be moved by Senator Williams and Senator Abetz. It will basically say that if a car is $90,000 or less it is exempt from the increase in the tax.
It will mean something to the people who live in towns like Tamworth, Inverell and Roma—irregardless of whether or not they own rural land, irregardless of whether they are a contractor on a farm or the owner of a farm, irregardless of whether they are making the fences on the farm or they own the farm, irregardless of whether they are mustering cattle on the farm or whether they own the place—because we do not want to divide communities down the middle. We want to try to keep them together. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-18,"—The debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 and related bills reminds me just a little of the movie Groundhog Day. We did the same thing a couple of weeks ago and we are doing it all over again. It remains to be seen whether there will be a different result at the end of the day. But, I do respect the right of the opposition to speak to this in the second reading stage. I think it would have been fundamentally wrong for that not to occur, given that that was the wish of the opposition.
I want to make some brief remarks given the developments that have occurred since we last debated this. My position in the debate on the second reading is that I will support this bill and the related bills at the second reading stage, but I will reserve my position in respect of the third reading. As I noted the first time I spoke to this bill, the Australian automotive manufacturing industry is a major part of the national economy, with exports growing to just under $5 billion in 2007. As an independent senator for South Australia I am acutely aware of and proud of the significant contribution that the automotive manufacturing industry makes to South Australia’s economy. And, can I say, it was an occasion of great regret—not just for me but I think for every South Australian—when Mitsubishi closed down its operations not so long ago. They made a great car but unfortunately it was not selling. It was a great car made by a great workforce and I hope that all of those who were dislocated by that closure have found work, because they deserve to.
I will in a moment address the comments made by Senator Joyce about the importance of the manufacturing industry and its potential impact. But there are a number of other factors that are very significant to the viability of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry. One of those is the whole issue of tariffs. I support the 10 per cent tariff. I do not support it being reduced to five per cent in 2010. I note the contents of the Bracks review. I think it is absolutely important—given the upheaval with Mitsubishi and the changes to the world car market relating to low-emission vehicles such as hybrid vehicles, which is an emerging and significant trend that I will refer to in the context of the amendments that the Greens have pushed for and that I have been highly supportive of—that we keep the 10 per cent tariff well beyond 2010. That is the key issue. If you are concerned about the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country, keep the 10 per cent tariff beyond 2010.
The intent of this bill has changed a little since its first introduction. Namely, it aims to raise the luxury car tax from 25 per cent to 33 per cent for vehicles over $57,180. These vehicles will be taxed for that portion of the cost that is above the threshold, with a projected increase in tax revenue of $555 million over the next four years. I note that in the budget forecasts there were, as I understand it, certain assumptions made with respect to the exchange rate. My question to the government is: to what extent will the movements in the exchange rate—the significant drop in the Australian dollar—impact on the projected tax take from these bills? I think it is important that we in the Senate know what that is because clearly it has changed one of the parameters.
But let us put this in context. This increase in the luxury car tax is part of the $6 billion of tax increases that are in dispute and that make up the projected $96 billion budget surplus. I am sympathetic to initiatives to support the local automotive industry. Keeping the tariffs at 10 per cent is a very significant bulwark, if you like, for the industry. I also support measures to encourage so-called green cars in terms of low-emission vehicles. But let us put this in perspective in terms of the concerns raised by Senator Joyce and others—and they are very legitimate concerns. Given that the vast majority of cars subject to this tax are in fact imported—close to 90 percent—I believe that this tax will not diminish the viability of the Australian automotive manufacturing industry. In fact, I think it will enhance it because this proposed tax overwhelmingly and disproportionately impacts on foreign cars.
I have concerns that this is a tax that in some respects is filling a hole to do with the government’s core promise to deliver tax cuts at the last election. There was a bidding war between the two major parties on tax cuts. Some would say it was a me-too tax cut announced by the then opposition to catch up with the then government’s proposed tax cuts. I would have thought a neater and more effective way of doing this, but it would breach a core promise of the Rudd government, would be to have a simple increase of about 0.4 per cent per annum on the top tax rate implemented earlier this year. There was a tax cut, but if there was a 0.4 per cent increase on the top marginal tax rate, the information I have is that that would raise about $510 million in revenue over the next four years. That would have been, I think, a more transparent and neater way of dealing with it. That would impact on approximately 200,000 Australians at that top rate and I believe it would be a more transparent way of taxing the better off, if that is what the government is really trying to do.
I had reservations about the bill in its original form but was prepared to support the second reading on the basis that there were going to be a number of amendments put to the chamber. I foreshadowed a number of areas which, if addressed, would have made it a fairer and more constructive bill. These areas centred on the 13 May cut-off date, the indexation of the threshold and the exemption of low-emission vehicles. As the bill was defeated at the second reading, and I respect that process, I was not able to have these discussions or to seek amendments. However, the reintroduction of the bill would seem to signal the government’s intention to respond to the concerns raised by me and other senators.
For my part, I have actively sought briefings from the Treasurer’s office and consulted the various interest groups in preparation for this bill’s reintroduction. I do not think anyone, except perhaps Treasurers and Treasury officials, likes increased taxes. However, the government must raise revenue to fund its priorities, and I do not wish to obstruct it unnecessarily in this aim. That said, I still have a number of concerns that I have raised with the Treasurer’s office. These concerns relate to: firstly, the indexation of the threshold now and into the future; secondly, exemptions for low-emission vehicles; thirdly, contracts for vehicles signed before 13 May but not delivered until after 1 July; and, fourthly, the impact of these changes on primary producers.
In relation to indexation I note that in 1986 around 4.5 per cent of vehicles were classified as luxury cars—there was a different tax rate, but it was effectively a luxury car tax—and in 2007 that figure had grown to 12 per cent. This gradual creep in the threshold is a matter of concern. It occurs because there is a distinction in the method of indexation: there is a CPIMV as distinct from the ordinary CPI cost of living increases. That is why the threshold has not increased to the same extent as actual cost of living increases. It is based on a formula that has been well described in the Economics Committee’s report in terms of a quality adjustment that is part of the CPIMV. I discussed this in the speech I made in the first second reading debate on this legislation, and the Economics Committee’s report gives a fairly good and robust explanation. I have concerns that, if indexing is not addressed, one day my $18,000 Toyota Yaris may well be deemed to be a luxury car. It may not be in the near future, but it may be eventually because, as you can see if you look at the graph and the material set out at page 7 of the committee’s report, the CPIMV is pretty flat or has actually declined for some years whereas the CPI is growing at a steady rate. That is something that needs to be addressed.
I put those concerns to the government. I did circulate an amendment based on CPI from day one of this proposed new tax or increase in tax. I am not persisting with that amendment. I have withdrawn it, if that is the proper terminology, on the basis of information I received from the Treasurer’s office—and it is a pity we cannot have a guessing game here now, asking honourable senators what they think that figure is. I asked the Treasurer’s office what the cost would be of indexing from 1 July this year. I imagined it would be $10 million to $20 million a year, based on the ordinary CPI. The information I received from the Treasurer’s office in an email is:
The revenue cost of indexing the LCT threshold to the CPI rather than CPIMV would be in excess of $400 million, assuming enacted from 2009-10 and costed out to 2012-13. This is a rough costing only but unsurprising given the measure’s broad impact.
I appreciate the Treasurer’s office did seek advice from Treasury and did their level best based on the limited time available, but that does seem to be an extraordinarily high figure.
Further information I have received from the Treasurer’s office indicates the basic methodology was that this model was indexed to the LCT threshold with the CPI, that it took into account the growth in car sales and that the assumptions were as follows: that the CPI was in keeping with the budget forecasts; that Treasury’s car sales growth rate is a weighted average because of the budget forecasts for vehicle sales growth and Treasury’s analysis of VFACTS—the car industry car sales growth data—to determine luxury car sales; that the car price reach model was averaged across the variants; and that the financial impact was determined by assessing the difference between the LCT revenue collections based on the current indexation treatment and the proposed treatment, keeping all else constant. It may be that other senators will have questions to ask about that. It seems to be an extraordinarily high figure, but I have accepted that figure in good faith on the basis of what I have received from Treasury. However, I do call on the government to provide specific details in the committee stage of the bill as to what percentage of vehicles will be classed as luxury cars and fall within the threshold in future years—perhaps in two, three, four, even 10 years time—if indexation is not applied. I think there ought to be some genuine attempt on the part of the government to advise us of that.
I note, however, that the government will be referring the issue of this tax to the Henry review of taxation. I would like clarification from the government as to whether this issue of indexation will be a specific issue that is referred to the Henry review by the Treasurer so that there is no ambiguity in relation to that. I appreciate the government’s undertaking that this and other issues relating to emissions will be going to the Henry review. I want to hear from the government in the committee stage as to how it calculated indexation. I believe that we deserve more details on that. I reserve my position on whether there ought to be an amendment to look at the whole issue of indexation from after this forward estimates period in four years time so that at least we can say there is a line in the sand. We would then examine whether we should still continue to use the CPIMV method of indexation or simply the CPI.
In relation to my concerns around greenhouse emissions, I note the work of the government and the Greens with this matter and foreshadow my support for these amendments, pending consideration of the technical aspects in the committee stage. I particularly welcome these amendments and congratulate Senator Milne for the work that she has done in relation to this. I believe that the future of the Australian car industry lies with green vehicles. That is the future. If we send a price signal now about exemptions for these green, low-emissions vehicles, that will send a very strong signal to our manufacturing industry here in Australia to plan for the future. We know what Toyota is doing with the hybrid Camry. That is a good step. But I believe that this would really kick-start sales and make a very significant difference by getting rid of that luxury car tax threshold on low-emissions vehicles with that ceiling of some $75,000. That is the way of the future for motor vehicle manufacturers in this country. That is the way that we can secure the future of this industry. That is why I believe that this approach of having those exemptions is the way to go. That is where our jobs will lie: in producing clean, green vehicles.
I also foreshadow that I will be introducing an amendment in the committee stage to address concerns about people who entered into a contract before the announcement of the changes in the luxury car tax but did not take delivery until after 1 July and hence were liable for the tax. For the benefit of senators, the initial amendment that I circulated had some issues with the wording, for which I am responsible. The wording is now clearer. That is something that I should have addressed earlier. But I think that the wording is now sufficiently clear to ensure that if a contract was entered into before 13 May and the budget announcement and delivery took a bit longer than expected then the tax should not apply. I see this as a matter of fairness to consumers. Those who entered into a contract in good faith should not be forced to pay a surprise tax because their vehicle was not delivered until after 1 July 2008.
I also note that my advice is that the amendments to be moved by Senator Fielding—and I know that they will be discussed in the committee stage—are amendments that I in principle support. They are to do with exemptions for primary producers and for tourist operators. I ask what the proposed cost of that will be. I commend Senator Fielding for his work in relation to that. It seems to me to be one way of making this bill fairer for those primary producers and tourism operators. I support this bill proceeding through the second reading stage, but reserve my position in respect to the third reading. From a personal point of view, I hope that this will not be like Groundhog Day and that we can deal with this bill effectively.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2008-09-18,"—I would like have my input on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008. First of all, I oppose the tax totally. It is hurting the industry. I have a graph from representatives from the industry showing the effect on the motor vehicle industry since the introduction of this tax—a tax that is now being collected by retailers and held in trust. The demand for such vehicles has dropped down enormously.
Let us reflect back to the year of 1948. Sixty years ago from this year, the first Australian car, with all its glitter and the chrome on its bumper bar, was proudly pushed out onto the road, the 1948 Holden. What a proud moment that was for Australia. Now we have situation 60 years later in which the government of today is prepared to put a tax on this industry to, as I see it, help close it down.
We heard yesterday from my friend Senator Birmingham about the 4,500 Holden Statesmans built last year which will fall under the umbrella of this increase in tax. We have seen a huge drop-off in demand for these types of vehicles. That spells the loss of jobs in Australian industry. It will be interesting to hear what Senator Carr, as Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, has to say about this situation later on.
We heard time and again about working families as we ran into the federal election. It was like a scratched record; it was as though the Rudd campaign had taken a Working for the man 45 from Roy Orbison and scratched it or restamped it. It went on and on. Working families? What about the working families in our car industry; in Holden and Ford? Don’t they count? Are we going to tax them out of existence?
It is simple. In my time on the farm, we would often be around the sheep yards working in the sun—or hopefully sometimes in the rain—drenching sheep and I would often listen to John Laws, the man with the golden microphone. He had a lot to say, and I often agreed with him. One of his common statements was, ‘The more you tax something, the less you have of it’. It is as simple as that. This government is going to tax our car industry and push it to the wall. It was a tragic day when we saw Mitsubishi close down in Adelaide. I lived in South Australia and I remember when it was Chrysler and Valiants that were made there. My uncle worked there. They were vital jobs. But that has gone. What will be next? These industries are being put under threat by this government.
Tough times are ahead. I fear what is happening in the overseas financial markets; the troubles that we have seen in the United States and the flow-on around the world. We are coming into some very tough times. I hope that I am wrong. But there is clear evidence that things are becoming very scary and very dangerous around the world, and we need to have a government that is prepared to look at what they are actually doing in terms of protecting our jobs, our families and our industries.
Why do they want the extra money? They are fortunate to have been handed a budget well into surplus; they are fortunate to have taken over a government that is debt free—the $96 billion has been paid off. Now they want to grab some more. It is crazy because the economy is definitely slowing. It has certainly slowed in the regions I come from because we have had seven years of drought. There is no need to put the handbrake on them any more; they have had enough.
I simply say this: if the government are concerned about working families, do not assume that all who work in Ford and Holden are bachelors and spinsters and do not have families; in fact they are working families and they will be under threat. I think it is a disgraceful tax, and it is a tax that the government are using to try to show to the people that they are fiscal conservatives. We know it is not true. I live in New South Wales, and we have seen how the Labor Party manages money in New South Wales. We saw what their predecessors pre-1996 did when it came to managing money. They had no hope of managing money.
What about those who live and work in country areas? Take the vet. The vet might have a four-wheel drive wagon. If he is called out to the farm he goes out on the dirt track. The creeks might be running a bit, the road could be rough—bulldust, holes, corrugation; I am familiar with them all. I have travelled them for many years, I can tell you. That vet might have a four-wheel drive wagon that cost more than $57,180. It is essential to his or her job, to carry out their work, but the government views that as a luxury. What are they supposed to drive? Some little imported Hyundai Excel? The first time you drive across a grid you wipe the bottom of the car out. They need to drive in safety. They need to be able to carry out their operations in a safe way. We hear about OH&S—it is thumbed to us all the time in New South Wales by the government there with all the red tape and rot that they go on with. But here they are bringing in a tax that is going to encourage people not to travel in a safe vehicle on rough roads.
We move on to the contractors. As Senator Joyce said yesterday, the only tractor you should have on a farm these days is a contractor, and how right he is because of the cost of machinery. I refer to, say, the wheat harvest coming up. Thankfully this year we have had some rain in the last couple of weeks that saved the wheat crop. Look at the typical contractor. Say he and his wife have three or four headers. You need $400,000 or $500,000 today to buy a new header. The average farmer cannot outlay that sort of money unless they have a lot of acreage of wheat to harvest—some 5,000 to 10,000 acres or whatever. So the contractor comes around. He might have three headers and three header drivers, because they do not drive themselves. He might have a couple of trucks to cart the grain into the storage on farm or to the silo or whatever. What is he supposed to do? Drive a Toyota tray top, which is not exposed to this tax, and cart the workers in the back of the ute? No; what he has got to do is have a wagon to cart people around—a wagon with some weight, size and strength in it. That will certainly be above $57,000. The situation is this: he probably has a trailer behind it with the spare parts, the oil, the grease and everything that contractors take with them but he is going to be taxed. Under the amendments that are being proposed he will not be exempt from it. The amendments—I will get to them later on—are simply unfair and to me look like a dog’s breakfast. The vet and the contractor are some that will not be exempt from the tax.
Then there are those people who choose to live out of town. They might be schoolteachers, wives, kids. They just need a vehicle. They might have four children and therefore need a bigger vehicle—a Toyota Prado, say, that comes in at around $64,000. They might have a couple of hundred acres of land. It is their right to buy that and to live out of town. But if the majority of their income is not sourced through primary production, they are not exempt under any amendments that are going to come forward today. It is just a tax on those country people for having a vehicle for their safety and their security and to be able to get along the rough, wet or muddy roads perhaps even to get their children to a doctor or a hospital in the case of an emergency. But this government says, ‘We are going to tax them out of existence. They are irrelevant.’ It is disgraceful.
I thought that when I came down to this place the first thing I would see would be governments having some compassion. This tax shows no compassion to people, especially those in the rural and regional areas that I am here to proudly represent. So when these amendments come up there will certainly be some strong arguments against them.
The tax is a socialist tax. I will go back to what John Laws used to say before he retired, ‘You do not make the poor rich by making the rich poor.’ And that is what this is about. Someone gets out and works hard, becomes successful and then faces an extra tax because Treasurer Wayne Swan wants to grab the show and say: ‘I’m a great fiscal manager. Look, I have a $22 billion surplus.’ The only reason he has a surplus at all is because of the previous government and the way they managed the money—no other reason at all.
I will give you one example. A friend of mine rang me before I entered this parliament back in about June and he told me what was going on. This bloke comes from a little town called Bundarra, just south of Inverell. He is a shearer. I know those on the other side of the chamber are probably not familiar with shearers but in fact the shearers and the AWU actually started their party. That is how the Labor Party started. He is a shearer and a bulldozer operator and he worked hard and became a little bit successful. Isn’t that what life is about in this free enterprise world? Work hard, work smart and develop wealth? That is certainly the wish of most people I know. Now he faces a luxury tax because his 14-year-old Toyota LandCruiser has done about half a million kilometres and is now due for changeover. He is landed with the tax. So this is what this tax is about—penalise those who have a go. To me that is not the Australian way.
I want to refer to a couple of other issues. I have received some information from Andrew McKellar from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. I have graphs, which I will not present to you, but you can believe me that he has forwarded them to me. They show the way the industry has lost demand since the introduction of this tax. I have been in business for many years. In the last nine years I started my own business from scratch. It is a pretty hard game when you get out into small business and you start from scratch. The first thing you need is a market. No matter what you have got, whether it be goods or services, you need to be able to sell what you are selling. And here is a drop-off in demand in the industry to such an extent that I really fear how these people are going to maintain their jobs and what is going to happen, especially in our domestic motor vehicle industry.
What is one of the worst things you can have happen to a family? One of the worst things is mum or dad comes home Friday night and says, ‘Here’s the good news!’—being a touch sarcastic—‘I finish up in two weeks time.’ The first thing the family thinks is: ‘How do we pay our mortgage, how do we make our payments on our home, what happens to the car’—they might not have paid for it—‘is it going to be repossessed?’ What sort of stress does that put on families? It puts a huge amount of stress on families. I have been through it myself and it is not a lot of fun, as I said in my maiden speech on Monday. But this government says, ‘That doesn’t matter. We’ve got $20 billion in the bank and we want to make it a bit more, so we’re going to tax these people.’ These are the battlers of our nation that are prepared to have a go. ‘That is what we’re going to do and we think it’s good fiscal policy.’ I say it is crazy policy.
I want to refer to those people living out of towns who look at four-wheel drives. My main concern about this tax is for the people who need a four-wheel drive for safety reasons. I have driven about three million kilometres since I left school: a million in semitrailers and about two million in all sorts of other vehicles. One thing that I learnt long ago is that, in Australia, when you are out in the bush, wherever there are trees there are roos. It is as simple as that: if there are trees there, there are roos there. I have yet to go through any timbered area in this nation and there not be kangaroos there. And thanks to the development over 100 years of better water supplies, bores and pumps and everything else, the roo population is extremely high. In the old days they died in the drought—there was no water. That is not the situation today.
If you are travelling at night, mum and dad are bringing the kids home from a school eisteddfod or whatever, the first thing you need is a strong vehicle that can support a strong roo bar. If not, you can imagine, where I live—minus three degrees, 11 o’clock at night and you put the fan through the radiator and you are on Shanks’s pony—it is not a very safe place to be. That is why people, not only the farmers—and Senator Fielding has got some exemptions, I believe, in his amendments for them—but the people who work on these farms and choose to live out in these areas, should not be taxed for being safe, for protecting their wife and children to be able to get home at night without walking along. These are the issues that the government should consider before they push through this tax grab.
Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding, coming from South Australia and Victoria, should realise that they have industries in their states that are vital for jobs. It is vital that those industries stay alive in this tough, competitive world where we see imports of vehicles from countries where you are lucky if you are paid $5 a day. I have been through the factories in Thailand over many years and seen the conditions that people work in. I certainly hope they improve in time, especially when it comes to some of the safety issues there. Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding should realise that this is going to hurt their industries. But the blame will come back on the government. When the economy slows further, as no doubt it will with the traumas around the world, they are the ones who are going to have to answer. And do not think for a minute that everyone in South Australia, Victoria and the rest of Australia are suffering from amnesia, because they will remember it come election time. They will know who put the pressure on industry, who made it harder for the people out in the bush—the contractors and everyone else—and who is going to suffer the most.
As a proud National, I will be putting some amendments up. They are just simple amendments—not a dog’s breakfast, not complicated, not a situation where they will have paperwork to do and claim up to $3,000 back or whatever, but simply a two-tiered system. At $57,180 the status quo remains at 25 per cent luxury car tax. Then at $90,000 the second tier will cut in where the tax will go to 33 per cent. So the situation is this: the money grabbers on the other side, who want to tell the rest of Australia that they are fiscal conservatives—we have heard it all before—and really can manage money, can get the money out of their Maseratis and Ferraris and Porsches and all those things that the Treasurer is holding up after we rejected it last time. I have yet to see a Porsche in Inverell or any country town. Likewise, a Ferrari or these other names of cars I cannot even spell, because we have never seen them. We have hardly ever heard of them, let alone seen them and read the badge on them. They can get their 33 per cent. That doesn’t worry me at all, because they do not exist where people such as myself and Senator Nash have our offices—two of the lucky senators in New South Wales who have our offices not in the city but out in the country areas, because people live there and people need representation. I must thank Senator Faulkner, too, for allowing that to happen. I am very pleased that Senator Faulkner did sign off to allow me to have my office in a country community. I do thank you very much for that.
Our amendment will be simple. There will be two tiers. The current system will remain at $57,180, which will not put more stress on our domestic industries, to keep them alive. Over $90,000 they can grab the tax, because the GXL Toyota LandCruiser 4.5 diesel is under that rate, and that is about the heaviest and strongest vehicle, along with some of the bigger Nissan Patrols, that are the common ones in country areas. If they want to go to a BMW four-wheel drive at $120,000, so be it; we don’t see many of them in the bush either. The amendments will be simple. We will propose to CPI those two levels so that a bit of fairness comes into the tax. That is where we stand on it, to protect the people.
Our first goal is to throw this tax out. It is not necessary, it is not needed. They do not have to crank hard on the fiscal policy of this nation, because the country is slowing. We have seen interest rates drop already. The pessimism is because the government has talked the economy down, they have put the bears into the sentiment. People are becoming negative. We see business and consumer confidence dropping to all-time lows because the government said they had inherited an economy that was so wrong. We will be putting these amendments up; we will be fighting for the people we represent. And I suggest that Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon, who come from those states where these cars are manufactured, have a good look at our amendments, because they will be the ones answering to their states, and the people do not have amnesia, as I said before. I urge people to have a good, close look at the Nationals amendments—they will be supported by the Liberals and our friends over there—so some commonsense and fairness can get into this whole debate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-09-18,"—Labor almost always get it wrong on tax. Year after year, budget after budget Labor routinely voted against the personal income tax cuts, for instance, which we put forward in government. I say that Labor almost always get tax wrong because there was the odd exception, most notably our 2007 income tax policy, which Labor as we all know copied and have legislated. But now that we are out of government, Labor have got it wrong again. As we always said: without the coalition in government to copy, Labor would get policy wrong. They have, and this legislation is yet another example, so I rise to join with my coalition colleagues in opposing this old-style Labor tax grab. The coalition have opposed and will continue to oppose the government’s punitive increase in the so-called luxury car tax. We oppose it for a simple reason: it is bad policy. We also oppose it because it was not an election commitment. The government have no mandate for this. As an opposition and as a coalition, we oppose tax increases as a matter of principle. We are the two parties in this parliament of lower taxation.
What we are seeing here is Labor true to form. It is again the politics of envy and class warfare, the sort of politics that Labor senators opposite have practised all their political lives. We heard a great statement by Kevin Rudd before the election that he was not a socialist. He had put behind him the days of his Christian socialism. He might still doff the cap to Dietrich Bonhoeffer but he was not a socialist—that was all behind him. The politics of Lathamesque class envy were banished from the Labor Party. But we are seeing the resurrection of that sort of socialism here with this tax grab. We are seeing it also with Labor’s attack on private health insurance. We have seen it with their attacks on Catholic and independent school funding. Most recently we are seeing the politics of envy manifest itself in the very vicious and quite personal attacks on the member for Wentworth and Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull.
Labor are resorting to what they know best: the politics of envy. They are using it on this occasion to justify this tax slug. Labor’s claim that the coalition is protecting the Rolls-Royce, Porsche and Ferrari drivers from a tax increase is false, as Senator Williams said. The coalition is acting to protect families, those in rural areas, the tourism industry, those in the Australian car-manufacturing industry and also those on the floors of car dealerships—those who actually sell these cars. Labor’s decision to reintroduce the tax after it was defeated is playing politics with the Australian automotive industry, which is now faced with continued uncertainty and reduced sales at a time that it can least afford it.
The facts are pretty straightforward. Almost 70 per cent of cars subjected to the luxury car tax are below $75,000—cars such as Toyota LandCruisers, Holden Commodores, Toyota Taragos, Mitsubishi Pajeros and Ford Falcons. Only 17 Rolls-Royces were sold in Australia last year and only 522 Porsche 911s were sold, yet over 6,000 LandCruisers were sold. In fact, the LandCruiser is the top-selling so-called luxury car, averaging around $74,000 each. The Toyota LandCruiser is not a luxury car. It is a rural workhorse and it comes standard without carpet. We have to face it: who on earth buys a LandCruiser as a status symbol? Labor is slugging Australian LandCruiser drivers $6 million extra per year, but Rolls-Royce drivers will only be slugged $1 million per year. Worse, under Labor’s deal with the Greens, for example, an imported BMW 3-series diesel would be exempt from a roughly $900 tax increase, but a roughly equivalent optioned-up Australian made Holden Commodore would not. That is bizarre—and Labor pretends to support the Australian automotive industry.
On top of all this, even Labor senators in their majority report after the Senate inquiry into this tax grab concluded that the tax would be inflationary. Labor’s only rationale for this tax is to increase revenue to boost the surplus and supposedly fight inflation. Yet even Labor senators concede in their own majority report that the impact of this tax would be inflationary. The whole argument for increasing this tax was as part of a so-called war on inflation. But I think we are seeing a new Labor doctrine here: fight inflation by increasing prices through higher taxes. I have to admit I have not heard of this particular inflation-fighting concept before, but Labor are always coming up with new economic ideas.
You do not want to take it from me that this tax increase will be inflationary; take it from the words of the Labor senators themselves. At paragraph 2.19 of their report they acknowledge that this measure will be inflationary. The inflationary impact will not be massive—I have to admit that. But I would have thought that, if your objective is to fight inflation and you say that there is an inflation crisis and that there are genies jumping out bottles all over the place, you would not actually do that by introducing a measure that your own senators acknowledge would be inflationary. I would expect that the measure be neutral at worst and anti-inflationary at best. But, no, that is not what we have here. Even Labor senators acknowledge that point—they put their names to that point in their majority report and they have signed off on it.
The Senate economics committee hearings into the proposed increase in the luxury car tax oddly wound up without taking evidence from someone who I think is a key witness—Mr Steve Bracks. Mr Bracks was of course appointed by Senator Carr to conduct a review of the Australian automotive industry. The government refused to release the Bracks review at that time, and its evidence, to the Senate inquiry even though it was sitting on Senator Carr’s desk at that time. Mr Bracks was specifically tasked, amongst other things, with examining the luxury car tax in his review, and indeed in his interim report flagged reducing the tax, not increasing it. Despite having the review, Senator Carr refused to release it.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-09-18,"—In continuation of my remarks from the other day on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 and related legislation, it is interesting to note that we used to have a senator here, who was well known to all of us and a hard player—a gentleman known by the name of George Campbell. He was one of the great protectors of the Australian manufacturing workers and the Australian manufacturing industry. He was a hard player and was well respected. He was also a very affable person and would come around and have a drink with you at night. But apparently he was not hard or tough enough around this show. He had to be replaced and the Labor Party replaced him with someone who said that he was really going to take a strong line on the protection of manufacturing workers’ jobs.
The person who took his position was, of course, Senator Doug Cameron, who is a lovely bloke. I remember the sort of curry the Labor Party used to give me on issues last year and how they would put the torch on me. One of the first things that Doug did when he arrived here was to roll over on a tax that is going to put manufacturing workers out of a job—the luxury car tax. It is a tax that is going to affect the car industry in South Australia and Victoria. I know that Senator Cameron is a decent bloke. I know he knows that this is going to affect his workers and his union. But he has rolled over for them. He has rolled over and has basically become a doormat. Once more the Labor Left has become a doormat to the Right. They have been walked all over, trodden on and kicked around the room because the Right run the show. And the Right do not care about manufacturing workers’ jobs and they are intent on putting a blowtorch to the Australian car industry. And the tax will cost Australian working families their jobs in the most direct form.
The Labor Party are trying to glam this over and cover this up by saying, ‘You are out there protecting people who drive Porsches, Maseratis, Jaguars and Ferraris.’ I was interested because I thought that I must be able to pick up one of these cars for $57,180. So I went shopping. I had a bit of a wander around to see if I could get myself a Porsche 911 for $57,180. You could have knocked me down with a feather. Do you know how much those things cost? They cost $425,000. I said to them, ‘Senator Cameron reckons I can get one of these for $57,180. He reckons there must be one out the back. Have you got a cheaper version of the Porsche 911?’ But I cannot find one. I thought: ‘Not a problem. I will try a Jaguar XK Coupe. I should be able to get hold of one of them because the Labor Party keep telling me that this is the tax that is protecting these cars.’ I said, ‘Have you got a Jaguar XK Coupe for $57,180?’ And they said, ‘Don’t be crazy. That car is a quarter of a million dollars.’ So I had a look at a Ferrari because we are protecting people who drive Ferraris. The Labor Party, including Senator Carr, put an inflection in their voices when they say, ‘You are protecting Ferrari drivers.’ You would be surprised to find out that the Ferrari 599 is $574,000. They had none for $57,180. I looked everywhere. I looked up and down the car lots saying that there must be one of these Ferraris around here for $57,180. Not a chance. They are $574,000. What is that? It is 574 gorillas. That is a big hit. You just do not seem to be able to get any BMWs under that price either. They are not around. A Maserati Quattroporte was $281,000. But apparently the Labor Party know where you can find them for $57,180.
As we have said before, if someone is down the pub trying to sell you a Ferrari 599 for $57,180, it is hot. It is red hot and dodgy. That is like this policy that the Labor Party has brought out: it is red hot and dodgy. Not only are they putting their own manufacturing workers union members out of a job and not only are they putting excessive pressure on the working families of Victoria and South Australia, but they are apparently in the business of finding dodgy cars. I walked around the lot and asked: ‘What cars can I get for $57,180? I want something that is comfortable.’ They said, ‘If you want to pay a little bit more money, we can get you a Ford.’ I asked: ‘Who makes them?’ And they said, ‘Australia.’ I asked: ‘What about Holdens?’ They said, ‘Yep, we can get you one of those.’ I asked: ‘Where are they made?’ They said, ‘Australia.’ I asked: ‘What about Toyota?’ They said, ‘Yep, Australia.’ In fact every car manufacturing plant in Australia produces numbers of cars that are in this group.
It stands to reason that if you send a price mechanism signal to the consumer not to buy the product, they will not buy an Australian product. What we are exporting—to my good colleagues on the other side—are Australian jobs. That is what we are exporting. We should be exporting cars but instead you are going to export the jobs—just like you will later on with the emissions trading scheme. I wonder how George Campbell is feeling today. I wonder how he is going, sitting back, thinking: ‘Gee, haven’t things changed. Haven’t things got tougher since I left. Haven’t they done a great job looking after the Australian workers since I left there.’ Since George Campbell has left here, we have had the Right of the Labor Party overtaking and walking all over the Left. The Left do not exist; they just turn up to make up the numbers. They do not even have the courage or conviction to clearly display in this chamber what they know and believe to be right. They are absolutely being walked over. That is a shame because, as they are being walked over and do not have the courage and conviction to stand up and go in to bat for their people, it is their people—the working families of both Victoria and South Australia who work in the manufacturing plants—whose jobs are definitely under threat by this.
A clear example of that is the stresses that are on the manufacturing industry at the moment. They are just holding on by their nails to keep this industry in Australia. And the government talk in pipe dreams of things that might happen in the future. They say, ‘We will produce a hybrid car and we will do this and we will do that and the world will be rosy.’ But, right now, they are putting this tax on them—right now! This is the peculiarity that we have.
In this policy, which now looks like a shambles, we in the National Party will be party to an amendment, even though we completely disagree with the whole concept. If the Labor Party has a policy to push you out of a completely reasonable plane, we will then have to move an amendment to wear a parachute. Moving an amendment to wear a parachute does not mean that we agree with the concept of going out of a perfectly decent plane. Our amendment will be nice and simple. All these other amendments are more complex than Kafka’s palace. They are incredible—something to behold. Our amendment will be moved by Senator Williams and Senator Abetz. It will basically say that if a car is $90,000 or less it is exempt from the increase in the tax.
It will mean something to the people who live in towns like Tamworth, Inverell and Roma—irregardless of whether or not they own rural land, irregardless of whether they are a contractor on a farm or the owner of a farm, irregardless of whether they are making the fences on the farm or they own the farm, irregardless of whether they are mustering cattle on the farm or whether they own the place—because we do not want to divide communities down the middle. We want to try to keep them together. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,12,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-18,"—The debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008 and related bills reminds me just a little of the movie Groundhog Day. We did the same thing a couple of weeks ago and we are doing it all over again. It remains to be seen whether there will be a different result at the end of the day. But, I do respect the right of the opposition to speak to this in the second reading stage. I think it would have been fundamentally wrong for that not to occur, given that that was the wish of the opposition.
I want to make some brief remarks given the developments that have occurred since we last debated this. My position in the debate on the second reading is that I will support this bill and the related bills at the second reading stage, but I will reserve my position in respect of the third reading. As I noted the first time I spoke to this bill, the Australian automotive manufacturing industry is a major part of the national economy, with exports growing to just under $5 billion in 2007. As an independent senator for South Australia I am acutely aware of and proud of the significant contribution that the automotive manufacturing industry makes to South Australia’s economy. And, can I say, it was an occasion of great regret—not just for me but I think for every South Australian—when Mitsubishi closed down its operations not so long ago. They made a great car but unfortunately it was not selling. It was a great car made by a great workforce and I hope that all of those who were dislocated by that closure have found work, because they deserve to.
I will in a moment address the comments made by Senator Joyce about the importance of the manufacturing industry and its potential impact. But there are a number of other factors that are very significant to the viability of the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry. One of those is the whole issue of tariffs. I support the 10 per cent tariff. I do not support it being reduced to five per cent in 2010. I note the contents of the Bracks review. I think it is absolutely important—given the upheaval with Mitsubishi and the changes to the world car market relating to low-emission vehicles such as hybrid vehicles, which is an emerging and significant trend that I will refer to in the context of the amendments that the Greens have pushed for and that I have been highly supportive of—that we keep the 10 per cent tariff well beyond 2010. That is the key issue. If you are concerned about the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country, keep the 10 per cent tariff beyond 2010.
The intent of this bill has changed a little since its first introduction. Namely, it aims to raise the luxury car tax from 25 per cent to 33 per cent for vehicles over $57,180. These vehicles will be taxed for that portion of the cost that is above the threshold, with a projected increase in tax revenue of $555 million over the next four years. I note that in the budget forecasts there were, as I understand it, certain assumptions made with respect to the exchange rate. My question to the government is: to what extent will the movements in the exchange rate—the significant drop in the Australian dollar—impact on the projected tax take from these bills? I think it is important that we in the Senate know what that is because clearly it has changed one of the parameters.
But let us put this in context. This increase in the luxury car tax is part of the $6 billion of tax increases that are in dispute and that make up the projected $96 billion budget surplus. I am sympathetic to initiatives to support the local automotive industry. Keeping the tariffs at 10 per cent is a very significant bulwark, if you like, for the industry. I also support measures to encourage so-called green cars in terms of low-emission vehicles. But let us put this in perspective in terms of the concerns raised by Senator Joyce and others—and they are very legitimate concerns. Given that the vast majority of cars subject to this tax are in fact imported—close to 90 percent—I believe that this tax will not diminish the viability of the Australian automotive manufacturing industry. In fact, I think it will enhance it because this proposed tax overwhelmingly and disproportionately impacts on foreign cars.
I have concerns that this is a tax that in some respects is filling a hole to do with the government’s core promise to deliver tax cuts at the last election. There was a bidding war between the two major parties on tax cuts. Some would say it was a me-too tax cut announced by the then opposition to catch up with the then government’s proposed tax cuts. I would have thought a neater and more effective way of doing this, but it would breach a core promise of the Rudd government, would be to have a simple increase of about 0.4 per cent per annum on the top tax rate implemented earlier this year. There was a tax cut, but if there was a 0.4 per cent increase on the top marginal tax rate, the information I have is that that would raise about $510 million in revenue over the next four years. That would have been, I think, a more transparent and neater way of dealing with it. That would impact on approximately 200,000 Australians at that top rate and I believe it would be a more transparent way of taxing the better off, if that is what the government is really trying to do.
I had reservations about the bill in its original form but was prepared to support the second reading on the basis that there were going to be a number of amendments put to the chamber. I foreshadowed a number of areas which, if addressed, would have made it a fairer and more constructive bill. These areas centred on the 13 May cut-off date, the indexation of the threshold and the exemption of low-emission vehicles. As the bill was defeated at the second reading, and I respect that process, I was not able to have these discussions or to seek amendments. However, the reintroduction of the bill would seem to signal the government’s intention to respond to the concerns raised by me and other senators.
For my part, I have actively sought briefings from the Treasurer’s office and consulted the various interest groups in preparation for this bill’s reintroduction. I do not think anyone, except perhaps Treasurers and Treasury officials, likes increased taxes. However, the government must raise revenue to fund its priorities, and I do not wish to obstruct it unnecessarily in this aim. That said, I still have a number of concerns that I have raised with the Treasurer’s office. These concerns relate to: firstly, the indexation of the threshold now and into the future; secondly, exemptions for low-emission vehicles; thirdly, contracts for vehicles signed before 13 May but not delivered until after 1 July; and, fourthly, the impact of these changes on primary producers.
In relation to indexation I note that in 1986 around 4.5 per cent of vehicles were classified as luxury cars—there was a different tax rate, but it was effectively a luxury car tax—and in 2007 that figure had grown to 12 per cent. This gradual creep in the threshold is a matter of concern. It occurs because there is a distinction in the method of indexation: there is a CPIMV as distinct from the ordinary CPI cost of living increases. That is why the threshold has not increased to the same extent as actual cost of living increases. It is based on a formula that has been well described in the Economics Committee’s report in terms of a quality adjustment that is part of the CPIMV. I discussed this in the speech I made in the first second reading debate on this legislation, and the Economics Committee’s report gives a fairly good and robust explanation. I have concerns that, if indexing is not addressed, one day my $18,000 Toyota Yaris may well be deemed to be a luxury car. It may not be in the near future, but it may be eventually because, as you can see if you look at the graph and the material set out at page 7 of the committee’s report, the CPIMV is pretty flat or has actually declined for some years whereas the CPI is growing at a steady rate. That is something that needs to be addressed.
I put those concerns to the government. I did circulate an amendment based on CPI from day one of this proposed new tax or increase in tax. I am not persisting with that amendment. I have withdrawn it, if that is the proper terminology, on the basis of information I received from the Treasurer’s office—and it is a pity we cannot have a guessing game here now, asking honourable senators what they think that figure is. I asked the Treasurer’s office what the cost would be of indexing from 1 July this year. I imagined it would be $10 million to $20 million a year, based on the ordinary CPI. The information I received from the Treasurer’s office in an email is:
The revenue cost of indexing the LCT threshold to the CPI rather than CPIMV would be in excess of $400 million, assuming enacted from 2009-10 and costed out to 2012-13. This is a rough costing only but unsurprising given the measure’s broad impact.
I appreciate the Treasurer’s office did seek advice from Treasury and did their level best based on the limited time available, but that does seem to be an extraordinarily high figure.
Further information I have received from the Treasurer’s office indicates the basic methodology was that this model was indexed to the LCT threshold with the CPI, that it took into account the growth in car sales and that the assumptions were as follows: that the CPI was in keeping with the budget forecasts; that Treasury’s car sales growth rate is a weighted average because of the budget forecasts for vehicle sales growth and Treasury’s analysis of VFACTS—the car industry car sales growth data—to determine luxury car sales; that the car price reach model was averaged across the variants; and that the financial impact was determined by assessing the difference between the LCT revenue collections based on the current indexation treatment and the proposed treatment, keeping all else constant. It may be that other senators will have questions to ask about that. It seems to be an extraordinarily high figure, but I have accepted that figure in good faith on the basis of what I have received from Treasury. However, I do call on the government to provide specific details in the committee stage of the bill as to what percentage of vehicles will be classed as luxury cars and fall within the threshold in future years—perhaps in two, three, four, even 10 years time—if indexation is not applied. I think there ought to be some genuine attempt on the part of the government to advise us of that.
I note, however, that the government will be referring the issue of this tax to the Henry review of taxation. I would like clarification from the government as to whether this issue of indexation will be a specific issue that is referred to the Henry review by the Treasurer so that there is no ambiguity in relation to that. I appreciate the government’s undertaking that this and other issues relating to emissions will be going to the Henry review. I want to hear from the government in the committee stage as to how it calculated indexation. I believe that we deserve more details on that. I reserve my position on whether there ought to be an amendment to look at the whole issue of indexation from after this forward estimates period in four years time so that at least we can say there is a line in the sand. We would then examine whether we should still continue to use the CPIMV method of indexation or simply the CPI.
In relation to my concerns around greenhouse emissions, I note the work of the government and the Greens with this matter and foreshadow my support for these amendments, pending consideration of the technical aspects in the committee stage. I particularly welcome these amendments and congratulate Senator Milne for the work that she has done in relation to this. I believe that the future of the Australian car industry lies with green vehicles. That is the future. If we send a price signal now about exemptions for these green, low-emissions vehicles, that will send a very strong signal to our manufacturing industry here in Australia to plan for the future. We know what Toyota is doing with the hybrid Camry. That is a good step. But I believe that this would really kick-start sales and make a very significant difference by getting rid of that luxury car tax threshold on low-emissions vehicles with that ceiling of some $75,000. That is the way of the future for motor vehicle manufacturers in this country. That is the way that we can secure the future of this industry. That is why I believe that this approach of having those exemptions is the way to go. That is where our jobs will lie: in producing clean, green vehicles.
I also foreshadow that I will be introducing an amendment in the committee stage to address concerns about people who entered into a contract before the announcement of the changes in the luxury car tax but did not take delivery until after 1 July and hence were liable for the tax. For the benefit of senators, the initial amendment that I circulated had some issues with the wording, for which I am responsible. The wording is now clearer. That is something that I should have addressed earlier. But I think that the wording is now sufficiently clear to ensure that if a contract was entered into before 13 May and the budget announcement and delivery took a bit longer than expected then the tax should not apply. I see this as a matter of fairness to consumers. Those who entered into a contract in good faith should not be forced to pay a surprise tax because their vehicle was not delivered until after 1 July 2008.
I also note that my advice is that the amendments to be moved by Senator Fielding—and I know that they will be discussed in the committee stage—are amendments that I in principle support. They are to do with exemptions for primary producers and for tourist operators. I ask what the proposed cost of that will be. I commend Senator Fielding for his work in relation to that. It seems to me to be one way of making this bill fairer for those primary producers and tourism operators. I support this bill proceeding through the second reading stage, but reserve my position in respect to the third reading. From a personal point of view, I hope that this will not be like Groundhog Day and that we can deal with this bill effectively.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,12,2
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2008-09-18,"—I would like have my input on the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Bill 2008. First of all, I oppose the tax totally. It is hurting the industry. I have a graph from representatives from the industry showing the effect on the motor vehicle industry since the introduction of this tax—a tax that is now being collected by retailers and held in trust. The demand for such vehicles has dropped down enormously.
Let us reflect back to the year of 1948. Sixty years ago from this year, the first Australian car, with all its glitter and the chrome on its bumper bar, was proudly pushed out onto the road, the 1948 Holden. What a proud moment that was for Australia. Now we have situation 60 years later in which the government of today is prepared to put a tax on this industry to, as I see it, help close it down.
We heard yesterday from my friend Senator Birmingham about the 4,500 Holden Statesmans built last year which will fall under the umbrella of this increase in tax. We have seen a huge drop-off in demand for these types of vehicles. That spells the loss of jobs in Australian industry. It will be interesting to hear what Senator Carr, as Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, has to say about this situation later on.
We heard time and again about working families as we ran into the federal election. It was like a scratched record; it was as though the Rudd campaign had taken a Working for the man 45 from Roy Orbison and scratched it or restamped it. It went on and on. Working families? What about the working families in our car industry; in Holden and Ford? Don’t they count? Are we going to tax them out of existence?
It is simple. In my time on the farm, we would often be around the sheep yards working in the sun—or hopefully sometimes in the rain—drenching sheep and I would often listen to John Laws, the man with the golden microphone. He had a lot to say, and I often agreed with him. One of his common statements was, ‘The more you tax something, the less you have of it’. It is as simple as that. This government is going to tax our car industry and push it to the wall. It was a tragic day when we saw Mitsubishi close down in Adelaide. I lived in South Australia and I remember when it was Chrysler and Valiants that were made there. My uncle worked there. They were vital jobs. But that has gone. What will be next? These industries are being put under threat by this government.
Tough times are ahead. I fear what is happening in the overseas financial markets; the troubles that we have seen in the United States and the flow-on around the world. We are coming into some very tough times. I hope that I am wrong. But there is clear evidence that things are becoming very scary and very dangerous around the world, and we need to have a government that is prepared to look at what they are actually doing in terms of protecting our jobs, our families and our industries.
Why do they want the extra money? They are fortunate to have been handed a budget well into surplus; they are fortunate to have taken over a government that is debt free—the $96 billion has been paid off. Now they want to grab some more. It is crazy because the economy is definitely slowing. It has certainly slowed in the regions I come from because we have had seven years of drought. There is no need to put the handbrake on them any more; they have had enough.
I simply say this: if the government are concerned about working families, do not assume that all who work in Ford and Holden are bachelors and spinsters and do not have families; in fact they are working families and they will be under threat. I think it is a disgraceful tax, and it is a tax that the government are using to try to show to the people that they are fiscal conservatives. We know it is not true. I live in New South Wales, and we have seen how the Labor Party manages money in New South Wales. We saw what their predecessors pre-1996 did when it came to managing money. They had no hope of managing money.
What about those who live and work in country areas? Take the vet. The vet might have a four-wheel drive wagon. If he is called out to the farm he goes out on the dirt track. The creeks might be running a bit, the road could be rough—bulldust, holes, corrugation; I am familiar with them all. I have travelled them for many years, I can tell you. That vet might have a four-wheel drive wagon that cost more than $57,180. It is essential to his or her job, to carry out their work, but the government views that as a luxury. What are they supposed to drive? Some little imported Hyundai Excel? The first time you drive across a grid you wipe the bottom of the car out. They need to drive in safety. They need to be able to carry out their operations in a safe way. We hear about OH&S—it is thumbed to us all the time in New South Wales by the government there with all the red tape and rot that they go on with. But here they are bringing in a tax that is going to encourage people not to travel in a safe vehicle on rough roads.
We move on to the contractors. As Senator Joyce said yesterday, the only tractor you should have on a farm these days is a contractor, and how right he is because of the cost of machinery. I refer to, say, the wheat harvest coming up. Thankfully this year we have had some rain in the last couple of weeks that saved the wheat crop. Look at the typical contractor. Say he and his wife have three or four headers. You need $400,000 or $500,000 today to buy a new header. The average farmer cannot outlay that sort of money unless they have a lot of acreage of wheat to harvest—some 5,000 to 10,000 acres or whatever. So the contractor comes around. He might have three headers and three header drivers, because they do not drive themselves. He might have a couple of trucks to cart the grain into the storage on farm or to the silo or whatever. What is he supposed to do? Drive a Toyota tray top, which is not exposed to this tax, and cart the workers in the back of the ute? No; what he has got to do is have a wagon to cart people around—a wagon with some weight, size and strength in it. That will certainly be above $57,000. The situation is this: he probably has a trailer behind it with the spare parts, the oil, the grease and everything that contractors take with them but he is going to be taxed. Under the amendments that are being proposed he will not be exempt from it. The amendments—I will get to them later on—are simply unfair and to me look like a dog’s breakfast. The vet and the contractor are some that will not be exempt from the tax.
Then there are those people who choose to live out of town. They might be schoolteachers, wives, kids. They just need a vehicle. They might have four children and therefore need a bigger vehicle—a Toyota Prado, say, that comes in at around $64,000. They might have a couple of hundred acres of land. It is their right to buy that and to live out of town. But if the majority of their income is not sourced through primary production, they are not exempt under any amendments that are going to come forward today. It is just a tax on those country people for having a vehicle for their safety and their security and to be able to get along the rough, wet or muddy roads perhaps even to get their children to a doctor or a hospital in the case of an emergency. But this government says, ‘We are going to tax them out of existence. They are irrelevant.’ It is disgraceful.
I thought that when I came down to this place the first thing I would see would be governments having some compassion. This tax shows no compassion to people, especially those in the rural and regional areas that I am here to proudly represent. So when these amendments come up there will certainly be some strong arguments against them.
The tax is a socialist tax. I will go back to what John Laws used to say before he retired, ‘You do not make the poor rich by making the rich poor.’ And that is what this is about. Someone gets out and works hard, becomes successful and then faces an extra tax because Treasurer Wayne Swan wants to grab the show and say: ‘I’m a great fiscal manager. Look, I have a $22 billion surplus.’ The only reason he has a surplus at all is because of the previous government and the way they managed the money—no other reason at all.
I will give you one example. A friend of mine rang me before I entered this parliament back in about June and he told me what was going on. This bloke comes from a little town called Bundarra, just south of Inverell. He is a shearer. I know those on the other side of the chamber are probably not familiar with shearers but in fact the shearers and the AWU actually started their party. That is how the Labor Party started. He is a shearer and a bulldozer operator and he worked hard and became a little bit successful. Isn’t that what life is about in this free enterprise world? Work hard, work smart and develop wealth? That is certainly the wish of most people I know. Now he faces a luxury tax because his 14-year-old Toyota LandCruiser has done about half a million kilometres and is now due for changeover. He is landed with the tax. So this is what this tax is about—penalise those who have a go. To me that is not the Australian way.
I want to refer to a couple of other issues. I have received some information from Andrew McKellar from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. I have graphs, which I will not present to you, but you can believe me that he has forwarded them to me. They show the way the industry has lost demand since the introduction of this tax. I have been in business for many years. In the last nine years I started my own business from scratch. It is a pretty hard game when you get out into small business and you start from scratch. The first thing you need is a market. No matter what you have got, whether it be goods or services, you need to be able to sell what you are selling. And here is a drop-off in demand in the industry to such an extent that I really fear how these people are going to maintain their jobs and what is going to happen, especially in our domestic motor vehicle industry.
What is one of the worst things you can have happen to a family? One of the worst things is mum or dad comes home Friday night and says, ‘Here’s the good news!’—being a touch sarcastic—‘I finish up in two weeks time.’ The first thing the family thinks is: ‘How do we pay our mortgage, how do we make our payments on our home, what happens to the car’—they might not have paid for it—‘is it going to be repossessed?’ What sort of stress does that put on families? It puts a huge amount of stress on families. I have been through it myself and it is not a lot of fun, as I said in my maiden speech on Monday. But this government says, ‘That doesn’t matter. We’ve got $20 billion in the bank and we want to make it a bit more, so we’re going to tax these people.’ These are the battlers of our nation that are prepared to have a go. ‘That is what we’re going to do and we think it’s good fiscal policy.’ I say it is crazy policy.
I want to refer to those people living out of towns who look at four-wheel drives. My main concern about this tax is for the people who need a four-wheel drive for safety reasons. I have driven about three million kilometres since I left school: a million in semitrailers and about two million in all sorts of other vehicles. One thing that I learnt long ago is that, in Australia, when you are out in the bush, wherever there are trees there are roos. It is as simple as that: if there are trees there, there are roos there. I have yet to go through any timbered area in this nation and there not be kangaroos there. And thanks to the development over 100 years of better water supplies, bores and pumps and everything else, the roo population is extremely high. In the old days they died in the drought—there was no water. That is not the situation today.
If you are travelling at night, mum and dad are bringing the kids home from a school eisteddfod or whatever, the first thing you need is a strong vehicle that can support a strong roo bar. If not, you can imagine, where I live—minus three degrees, 11 o’clock at night and you put the fan through the radiator and you are on Shanks’s pony—it is not a very safe place to be. That is why people, not only the farmers—and Senator Fielding has got some exemptions, I believe, in his amendments for them—but the people who work on these farms and choose to live out in these areas, should not be taxed for being safe, for protecting their wife and children to be able to get home at night without walking along. These are the issues that the government should consider before they push through this tax grab.
Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding, coming from South Australia and Victoria, should realise that they have industries in their states that are vital for jobs. It is vital that those industries stay alive in this tough, competitive world where we see imports of vehicles from countries where you are lucky if you are paid $5 a day. I have been through the factories in Thailand over many years and seen the conditions that people work in. I certainly hope they improve in time, especially when it comes to some of the safety issues there. Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding should realise that this is going to hurt their industries. But the blame will come back on the government. When the economy slows further, as no doubt it will with the traumas around the world, they are the ones who are going to have to answer. And do not think for a minute that everyone in South Australia, Victoria and the rest of Australia are suffering from amnesia, because they will remember it come election time. They will know who put the pressure on industry, who made it harder for the people out in the bush—the contractors and everyone else—and who is going to suffer the most.
As a proud National, I will be putting some amendments up. They are just simple amendments—not a dog’s breakfast, not complicated, not a situation where they will have paperwork to do and claim up to $3,000 back or whatever, but simply a two-tiered system. At $57,180 the status quo remains at 25 per cent luxury car tax. Then at $90,000 the second tier will cut in where the tax will go to 33 per cent. So the situation is this: the money grabbers on the other side, who want to tell the rest of Australia that they are fiscal conservatives—we have heard it all before—and really can manage money, can get the money out of their Maseratis and Ferraris and Porsches and all those things that the Treasurer is holding up after we rejected it last time. I have yet to see a Porsche in Inverell or any country town. Likewise, a Ferrari or these other names of cars I cannot even spell, because we have never seen them. We have hardly ever heard of them, let alone seen them and read the badge on them. They can get their 33 per cent. That doesn’t worry me at all, because they do not exist where people such as myself and Senator Nash have our offices—two of the lucky senators in New South Wales who have our offices not in the city but out in the country areas, because people live there and people need representation. I must thank Senator Faulkner, too, for allowing that to happen. I am very pleased that Senator Faulkner did sign off to allow me to have my office in a country community. I do thank you very much for that.
Our amendment will be simple. There will be two tiers. The current system will remain at $57,180, which will not put more stress on our domestic industries, to keep them alive. Over $90,000 they can grab the tax, because the GXL Toyota LandCruiser 4.5 diesel is under that rate, and that is about the heaviest and strongest vehicle, along with some of the bigger Nissan Patrols, that are the common ones in country areas. If they want to go to a BMW four-wheel drive at $120,000, so be it; we don’t see many of them in the bush either. The amendments will be simple. We will propose to CPI those two levels so that a bit of fairness comes into the tax. That is where we stand on it, to protect the people.
Our first goal is to throw this tax out. It is not necessary, it is not needed. They do not have to crank hard on the fiscal policy of this nation, because the country is slowing. We have seen interest rates drop already. The pessimism is because the government has talked the economy down, they have put the bears into the sentiment. People are becoming negative. We see business and consumer confidence dropping to all-time lows because the government said they had inherited an economy that was so wrong. We will be putting these amendments up; we will be fighting for the people we represent. And I suggest that Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon, who come from those states where these cars are manufactured, have a good look at our amendments, because they will be the ones answering to their states, and the people do not have amnesia, as I said before. I urge people to have a good, close look at the Nationals amendments—they will be supported by the Liberals and our friends over there—so some commonsense and fairness can get into this whole debate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,12,2
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-09-18,"—Labor almost always get it wrong on tax. Year after year, budget after budget Labor routinely voted against the personal income tax cuts, for instance, which we put forward in government. I say that Labor almost always get tax wrong because there was the odd exception, most notably our 2007 income tax policy, which Labor as we all know copied and have legislated. But now that we are out of government, Labor have got it wrong again. As we always said: without the coalition in government to copy, Labor would get policy wrong. They have, and this legislation is yet another example, so I rise to join with my coalition colleagues in opposing this old-style Labor tax grab. The coalition have opposed and will continue to oppose the government’s punitive increase in the so-called luxury car tax. We oppose it for a simple reason: it is bad policy. We also oppose it because it was not an election commitment. The government have no mandate for this. As an opposition and as a coalition, we oppose tax increases as a matter of principle. We are the two parties in this parliament of lower taxation.
What we are seeing here is Labor true to form. It is again the politics of envy and class warfare, the sort of politics that Labor senators opposite have practised all their political lives. We heard a great statement by Kevin Rudd before the election that he was not a socialist. He had put behind him the days of his Christian socialism. He might still doff the cap to Dietrich Bonhoeffer but he was not a socialist—that was all behind him. The politics of Lathamesque class envy were banished from the Labor Party. But we are seeing the resurrection of that sort of socialism here with this tax grab. We are seeing it also with Labor’s attack on private health insurance. We have seen it with their attacks on Catholic and independent school funding. Most recently we are seeing the politics of envy manifest itself in the very vicious and quite personal attacks on the member for Wentworth and Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull.
Labor are resorting to what they know best: the politics of envy. They are using it on this occasion to justify this tax slug. Labor’s claim that the coalition is protecting the Rolls-Royce, Porsche and Ferrari drivers from a tax increase is false, as Senator Williams said. The coalition is acting to protect families, those in rural areas, the tourism industry, those in the Australian car-manufacturing industry and also those on the floors of car dealerships—those who actually sell these cars. Labor’s decision to reintroduce the tax after it was defeated is playing politics with the Australian automotive industry, which is now faced with continued uncertainty and reduced sales at a time that it can least afford it.
The facts are pretty straightforward. Almost 70 per cent of cars subjected to the luxury car tax are below $75,000—cars such as Toyota LandCruisers, Holden Commodores, Toyota Taragos, Mitsubishi Pajeros and Ford Falcons. Only 17 Rolls-Royces were sold in Australia last year and only 522 Porsche 911s were sold, yet over 6,000 LandCruisers were sold. In fact, the LandCruiser is the top-selling so-called luxury car, averaging around $74,000 each. The Toyota LandCruiser is not a luxury car. It is a rural workhorse and it comes standard without carpet. We have to face it: who on earth buys a LandCruiser as a status symbol? Labor is slugging Australian LandCruiser drivers $6 million extra per year, but Rolls-Royce drivers will only be slugged $1 million per year. Worse, under Labor’s deal with the Greens, for example, an imported BMW 3-series diesel would be exempt from a roughly $900 tax increase, but a roughly equivalent optioned-up Australian made Holden Commodore would not. That is bizarre—and Labor pretends to support the Australian automotive industry.
On top of all this, even Labor senators in their majority report after the Senate inquiry into this tax grab concluded that the tax would be inflationary. Labor’s only rationale for this tax is to increase revenue to boost the surplus and supposedly fight inflation. Yet even Labor senators concede in their own majority report that the impact of this tax would be inflationary. The whole argument for increasing this tax was as part of a so-called war on inflation. But I think we are seeing a new Labor doctrine here: fight inflation by increasing prices through higher taxes. I have to admit I have not heard of this particular inflation-fighting concept before, but Labor are always coming up with new economic ideas.
You do not want to take it from me that this tax increase will be inflationary; take it from the words of the Labor senators themselves. At paragraph 2.19 of their report they acknowledge that this measure will be inflationary. The inflationary impact will not be massive—I have to admit that. But I would have thought that, if your objective is to fight inflation and you say that there is an inflation crisis and that there are genies jumping out bottles all over the place, you would not actually do that by introducing a measure that your own senators acknowledge would be inflationary. I would expect that the measure be neutral at worst and anti-inflationary at best. But, no, that is not what we have here. Even Labor senators acknowledge that point—they put their names to that point in their majority report and they have signed off on it.
The Senate economics committee hearings into the proposed increase in the luxury car tax oddly wound up without taking evidence from someone who I think is a key witness—Mr Steve Bracks. Mr Bracks was of course appointed by Senator Carr to conduct a review of the Australian automotive industry. The government refused to release the Bracks review at that time, and its evidence, to the Senate inquiry even though it was sitting on Senator Carr’s desk at that time. Mr Bracks was specifically tasked, amongst other things, with examining the luxury car tax in his review, and indeed in his interim report flagged reducing the tax, not increasing it. Despite having the review, Senator Carr refused to release it.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-09-18,"—I rise today to indicate that the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008 will receive the full support of the coalition. The bill primarily gives effect to a new tax treaty with Japan and replaces the previous double taxation agreement that Australia signed with Japan way back in 1969. Like a number of tax bills this year, this bill had its origins last year under the coalition government but lapsed because of the federal election held in October last year.
Japan is Australia’s largest trading partner, which sometimes we forget, and thus it is very important that we build upon this very strong economic relationship. In light of the fact that the original treaty was 38 years old, the coalition government last year began negotiations with the Japanese government to update the tax treaty. The coalition, who were serious about attracting foreign investment into Australia, sought to negotiate an agreement that was based on the OECD model tax convention—consistent with other tax treaties that have been concluded with Australia, such as the agreement that we have with the United States. The new treaty was agreed to in principle by the Japanese Minister of Finance, Koji Omi, and the then Australian Treasurer, the member for Higgins, Mr Peter Costello, on 3 August 2007.
Specifically, this new agreement will reduce withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalty payments. It will improve tax integrity measures and will put in place new rules for real property which bring the capital gains tax treatment into line with that of the OECD. It also facilitates increased cooperation between Australian and Japanese authorities to reduce fiscal evasion.
The coalition parties are the parties of lower taxes, and we support moves that will help to reduce the administrative burdens of tax compliance. When we were in government we moved to lower the corporate tax rate to encourage investment in Australia. This bill is a logical extension as it helps to facilitate investment and trade between Australia and Japan, to the benefit of the people of both countries. I commend this bill to the Senate and urge all senators to support it.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-09-18,"—in reply—I would like to thank Senator Mason for his contribution to the debate on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. I would also like to commend the opposition for their support of the bill.
Both sides of parliament recognise the importance of the new Australia-Japan tax treaty and the significant role it will play in fostering the continued economic development of both economies. Responding to the needs of both Australian and Japanese business, the new Australia-Japan income tax convention comprehensively updates the existing tax treaty arrangements with Japan, which date back to 1969. The existing agreement no longer fully reflects the modern tax treaty policies of either country. The new convention, which will modernise and enhance the bilateral tax arrangements between Australia and Japan, was signed in Tokyo on 31 January this year. The bill will give the force of law to the new tax treaty with Japan by inserting the text of the new convention into the International Tax Agreements Act of 1953 and repealing the existing treaty.
Japanese investment in Australia totalled $55.5 billion in 2007, up $6 billion on the previous year. As a result, Japan is the third largest source of foreign investment into Australia. Direct investment by Japan continues to play a key role in the development of many Australian industries, including export industries such as car manufacturing and natural resource development activities that have driven Australia’s export performance. Australia is now one of the largest recipients of offshore investment by Japanese mutual funds. The new convention underlines the strength of the modern and sophisticated bilateral ties between the two countries and reduces obstacles inhibiting further corporate expansion into Japan. The treaty will underpin the strong bilateral relationship by reducing tax barriers between the two countries and thereby delivering tangible benefits to both Australian and Japanese businesses.
Key outcomes from the convention include: lower withholding taxes on dividend and royalty payments for businesses looking to expand offshore and to obtain access to valuable intellectual property; specified interest withholding tax exemptions that will facilitate more competitive and accessible cross-border debt arrangements; and broadly aligning capital gains tax treatment with international practice and with Australia’s domestic law. The treaty also ensures Australia’s revenue base is appropriately protected by preserving taxing rights over income from real property and income arising from activities related to Australia’s natural resources and enhancing information exchange provisions which allow the tax administrations of both countries to share tax information.
In his address to the House of Representatives, the member for Lindsay highlighted that the tax treaty is:
... an essential element of having an open trading environment across the globe ...
In particular in relation to the withholding tax reductions, the member noted that the removal of withholding tax on certain payments prevents a lock-up of profits offshore while also reducing an impost which is passed on to consumers.
The government is committed to ensuring that Australia’s tax treaties remain relevant to evolving business directions. It is worth while noting that public submissions received as part of their review of Australia’s tax treaty program and policy announced by the government earlier this year strongly supported the outcomes of this convention.
The new convention will enter into force 30 days after both countries advise that they have completed their domestic requirements, which in the case of Australia includes enactment of this bill. The treaty has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended that binding treaty action be taken.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-09-18,—I would like to provide further information to an answer I gave to Senator Brandis yesterday regarding the terrorism trial and the Attorney-General’s remarks. I am advised that the government has not sought legal advice on this matter.,SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,15,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-09-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
In my particular case I refer to the responses by Senator Sherry, who is responsible for the Australian superannuation system. Senator Sherry’s responses show a government that is simply not equipped to understand or to deal with the great global financial challenges in world markets and the impact these will have on Australia. This government of hollow men and women appears blissfully unaware of the dangers to the Australian economy flowing from the events in international capital markets.
Senator Sherry gave a rambling answer to a dorothy dixer yesterday from Senator Collins on challenges being faced by the US financial markets. He said in answer to an interjection from me that he would address the exposure of Australian super funds in his answer but he failed to do so—and he failed to answer my question today. In fact, all he could do was to point to the undeniable fact that Australia is in a stronger position than most to weather the storm and that the regulators are working hard and doing what they can to minimise the impact on policyholders. He pointed to the fact that superannuation is a long-term saving. Of course this is true, but it will be cold comfort to all Australians who are on the verge of retirement. Already, figures show superannuation funds lost in the vicinity of 11 per cent in the last few months and obviously more in the last few days due to volatility on the share market.
The impact on superannuation particularly affects those who plan to retire this year or possibly next year. It may require them to stay in the workforce—that is, of course, if they continue to have an available job—or to go on the pension or a part pension. It may require self-funded retirees to resort to going on the pension or a part pension. Heaven help any elderly Australian who has to rely on this government when it comes to the pension. Heaven help them, I say, because this Rudd Labor government will not.
We have all seen on display day after day the contempt that this government has for age pensioners. This is a government, from the Prime Minister down, that sends its ministers out day after day to say that they could not live on the age pension. They freely acknowledge that they could not live on the single pension. Mr Deputy President, when you think about this for a moment, just think of the cheek of this. These are senior ministers who acknowledge how bad it is for age pensioners but who do nothing to fix it. What sort of government, from its senior team down, admits there is a severe financial impact on the capacity of thousands of vulnerable Australians to meet the bare necessities of life and yet does nothing about it?
There has been a massive rise in prices over the past 12 months since the last coalition budget—in fact, a very substantial increase in prices across the board—and, as we have seen, the Rudd Labor government has proven incapable of doing anything to keep a lid on prices, to keep downward pressure on prices. But of course what it can do and what it refuses to do is to help our pensioners with something to tide them over.
My proposition to the Senate and particularly to those opposite is: let’s act now. Let’s give $30 a week to single age pensioners. We can do this right now. It does not prejudice a review, it does not stop us from doing other things. We can act right now, and any decent government should. If you cannot even manage the economy to provide for a decent pension, you certainly cannot manage the broader economy. We are paying the price for having a nervous and incompetent Treasurer, Mr Swan. We are paying the price for a do-nothing government. Business and consumer confidence is plummeting.
The Australian people have been seriously misled. They have elected a government that has no confidence in Australia’s economy nor the experience to manage it, and certainly no compassion for age pensioners. What we have are endless focus group slogans and ultimately a government that will stand guilty of doing nothing, not having leadership and having no ideas on how to manage the economy at a time of peril.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-09-18,"—Once again I should say how wonderful it is that the coalition have discovered that there are people in their electorates who are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. I should remind coalition senators that a central plank of the Labor campaign in the last election was that the Howard government at that time were just simply not aware of the difficulties people were having in making ends meet—that people were doing it tough and that prices were rising.
We campaigned on the idea that the Howard government was out of touch, that they did not recognise that fundamental fact, and I think the election result showed that the Australian people agreed with us that the Howard government was out of touch and was not aware of what was going on around the kitchen table. And now, having been in opposition for a few months, the coalition are starting to become aware that that was one of the root causes of their downfall. I presume they are trying to rectify that position by calling for this $30 a week pension rise, ignoring the very complexities of existence for pensioners who, if they got a rise in their base pension, would have all kinds of difficulties and might not get the full benefit of that pension because of rate rises in the housing commission properties or whatever.
We have seen the coalition do their usual knee-jerk reaction and propose something without thinking through the consequences, without thinking about how that is really going to be implemented in the real world, because they are still not really part of the real world. They just want to put forward a stunt that sounds good, that will make them look good and that may cause that tiny increase in the polls they so much need at the moment. They accuse the Rudd government of being poll driven and yet they pull a stunt like this, the $30 a week, which we have yet to see in this chamber or the other chamber. It was an ill-thought-out stunt that was not possible to do in the other place, so now they have proposed to bring in a bill in the Senate but have not yet been able to do it and have not shown the kind of follow-through that the stunt really does not deserve in the first place.
Senator Coonan came into this place and accused the Rudd government of being a do-nothing government, which is breathtaking. It is really hard to sit here and hear this when the coalition was in government for nearly 12 years and did nothing about the base rates of pensions. The Rudd government has been in power for less than a year and they ask the Rudd government, before a proper policy and implementation review is finished, to rush in and do something which may have unintended consequences. The fundamental fact arising out of this is that in order to bring about any kind of increase for pensioners the Rudd government needs the budget to do it. One by one, members of the coalition have voted against the very budget measures that would give us the kind of surplus that would allow us to do something significant for pensioners and they have refused to budge from that position. They have refused to acknowledge the irresponsibility of their actions in voting against those budget measures. You cannot call on the Rudd government to spend large amounts—millions and billions of dollars—if you do not give the government the revenue capacity to implement that.
In this chamber, time after time, day after day, we see the coalition voting against the very measures that would enable the Rudd government to give a substantial increase in pensions which is needed not only for single age pensioners but also for a range of other people on government allowances and benefits. We are looking across the sector to implement something that will have a long-lasting, long-term, good result which will be effective and important for pensioners. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2008-09-18,"—As you are well aware, Mr Deputy President, I am very new to this chamber and it is a learning experience. I look at questions today and the good question asked by my friend Senator Coonan in relation to the effect on our superannuation funds of these serious problems in world financial markets—brought about because of ridiculous lending by those in the housing markets et cetera in the United States lending up to 110 or 120 per cent equity. Now the fallout is on, and we must ask the question, ‘Whatever happened to regulation and financial institutions?’ We went through all this in the late eighties and early nineties when the ridiculous lending was on and the big fallout came with high interest rates, people going broke and people losing their jobs.
I remember it well under the then so-called world’s greatest treasurer, Treasurer Keating, who then became Prime Minister. I mentioned last Monday in my maiden speech to this parliament the 25.25 per cent interest rate I was billed. I have a little chuckle when many in the house refer to interest rates going up and how we have had eight interest rate rises in the last four years or so of a quarter of a per cent each time, making a total of two per cent. If my memory serves me right—and I have not checked the facts—I recall that in about November 1987 we had a two per cent interest rate rise in one day. I must check it. I am pretty sure I am right.
To get on to the management of the economy and where we are heading, there is no question that the economy is slowing. I live in rural Australia and we have had seven years of drought. Hopefully the rain that has come along in the last few weeks will continue and we will see some returns to some good incomes into those rural communities, which is desperately needed. But the point I make is the economy is slowing, and we saw it just a couple of weeks ago in the reduction in interest rates. Yet the government consistently want to keep a firm handle on this fiscal policy, their budget policy. That will only cause more harm. There are reasons why they should not hold that break so tight, because we run the risk of the economy slowing too much, and we have already seen the forecasts in the budget of higher unemployment, people losing their jobs and people losing their livelihoods.
How we are going is a worry for the future, and then we get on to the talk of pensions. I was doing some figures the other day. If we were to give an immediate $300 catch-up payment to our pensioners and carers, I believe the figure would be about $840 million. If it were to come along with that $30 a week rise for our single pensions, you would have a total expenditure of around $2 billion. That would do a lot of good promoting some economic activity, especially in the country and coastal areas where things are very slow. It is quite alarming when I get emails from people just in Canberra saying, ‘What is happening to our economy?’ They are losing confidence, their businesses are quietening and the fact that they are losing sales is putting people off. I say this in all seriousness: there are tough times coming and the government must address these issues. If it means spending a little of their surplus I support that, especially in rural communities where we have had tough times for seven years with drought.
Prior to that, in the late eighties and early nineties, we were paying huge interest rates—many businesses were paying in excess of 20 per cent. When the good government came along in 1996 and took the budget to where it is supposed to be—into surplus—and interest rates went down, we unfortunately had times of drought, such as in 1994. Then in 2002 we had the crash of the wool market. That is why rural communities have not recovered anywhere nearly as much during those low interest rate times of the good previous government and hence things are still tight today. So I encourage the government to show some compassion and look at what is actually happening in our economy. There is no need to tell us, as Senator Evans did today, that they ‘built a strong surplus’. They inherited a strong surplus. It was the previous government that built the strong surplus. These people with a chequebook in government can now show some compassion and look after the elderly, who have done so much for our nation, and give them a payout to help them through these tough times.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2008-09-18,"—Senator Williams made some very good points in his first take note speech in this chamber. The first is to remind us of the tough times that are ahead for us, and the second is to invite us to show compassion to people who are finding it very tough living on pensions. But, in reflecting on those two issues, I have to correct the record. I have to address some of the comments that Senator Coonan made in her contribution today because they are simply not true. She suggests that the Rudd government has done nothing in this area. I invite anyone to look back at the budget and at the $900 increase that was delivered through the budget for people suffering in these times and under circumstances related to the pension. As has been indicated on several occasions, the utilities allowance was increased to $500 and the $500 bonus was paid through those measures. So when Senator Coonan says, ‘Heaven help age pensioners,’ we should reflect on how those initiatives compare with what occurred under the Howard government.
One would believe from a lot of the rhetoric coming from the other side that the Howard government have a reasonably responsible history in this area. This is clearly not the case. I will come in a moment to their backflips and stunts in recent months in this area, but let us look at the period of the 12 years of the Howard government—the Howard government that introduced the GST and had to be drawn kicking and fighting to a one per cent increase in base pension arrangements as compensation for the GST. So, yes, pensioners are doing it tough and, yes, their plight is related to current economic circumstances, but it is also related to a 12-year period of neglect under the Howard government.
This brings me now to recent stunts—and I think that is really the only way to describe the way the opposition’s leadership has dealt with this issue in recent months. Back in May we had the shadow minister, Margaret May, suggest that a base increase in the pension would occur. We then had the leader, Brendan Nelson, immediately deny that that was opposition policy.
—A flip-flop.
—An immediate flip-flop, Senator Sterle. And yet, several months later, we do have it as policy. I wonder what we will have tomorrow when Mr Turnbull, the new leader, decides what he is going to do in this area. What I worry about in the interim, though, is the quality of the opposition in comprehending the complex issues that are involved here. If we have, as we did yesterday, the spokesperson in this chamber, Senator Bernardi, addressing the issue, you would think that all it related to was parliamentary catering. You see no substance in what he offers this chamber or indeed what the opposition generally is offering to this debate—no substance but a very simplistic stunt to suggest that a $30 increase would be appropriate. Well, we know from the pensioners that a $30 increase is often going to be almost immediately absorbed into the other arrangements that apply to their circumstances—pensioners in nursing homes, for example, pensioners in public housing. Most of these increases will simply be absorbed into other arrangements. This opposition seems to not understand anything about effective marginal tax rates. Certainly Senator Bernardi in his contribution yesterday, again referring to this pensions issue, offered no viable alternative.
More worrying than that, if you look at all the questions asked today, they do not seem to be able to grapple with any of the serious issues. Senator Coonan sensibly referred again to the consequences for people’s superannuation arrangements with the economic crisis that is developing, and that was a significant question today. We had the question about the pensions stunt, and we had an important question about delivering hospital services and beds and difficulties associated with state and federal government arrangements in delivering some of these services. We had another stunt question about the Prime Minister’s travel, and we had a question about Cairns building demolition. But there was no question of any substantive nature about what would deliver genuine benefits to people on pensions. Nothing of any substantive nature came forward from the opposition other than the stunt about a $30 increase, which anyone who has been informed of the policy debate in this area for longer than half an hour understands is just a stunt.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2008-09-18,"—I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Sherry this afternoon. This week Australian shares have tumbled following Wall Street’s worst day since the September 11 attacks, after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and the insurer American International Group revealed it was struggling to survive. The stock market was not well off before this due to the global credit crisis. Australia’s listed funds management industry has suffered its worst half-year performance for two decades. Now, with the downfall of Lehman, the industry faces even further problems for 2008-09 as asset markets remain volatile. Listed fund managers suffered an average fall in funds under management of 14 per cent in the first half of the calendar year 2008. In the industry as a whole $75 billion in funds under management was withdrawn, resulting in a 5.4 per cent fall in the $1.1 trillion superannuation fund. These figures come from a report by Merrill Lynch published last Friday, 12 September. The analysts say that the lower discretionary superannuation contributions, the move by investors to cash and stronger relative growth in the do-it-yourself superannuation funds also weakened fund flows.
These figures worry many Australians investing in the superannuation funds. They fear that their return will not last to enable them to live their lives as self-funded retirees. This fear is not without reason as the Rudd government fails to outline how to react to this difficult situation. Senator Sherry demonstrated this lack of policy idea very well during question time today when asked about the government modelling of superannuation funds with this big loss. The aim of superannuation is to reduce reliance on the age pension by making super the preferred method of retirement income. With the fading trust in superannuation, the Rudd government risks putting even more pressure on the age pension. Delaying the decision on providing seniors with more financial assistance until the review of pensions and carers payments is finalised in February next year does not help. We already have one generation which has not had the opportunity to invest in superannuation. We cannot risk having even more people relying on the age pension. The Rudd government may hope that the issue of the age pension will just go away. However, despite the rising proportion of self-funded retirees, the issue is not going away.
The Howard government’s 2007 Intergenerational report projected that the government’s spending on the age pension will rise by 1.9 per cent as a share of the national economy during the next 40 years. Even though the proportion of people of eligible age receiving the full pension will decline from 55 per cent to 35 per cent, the number of those eligible will double as a share of the total population. The net effect is a much higher bill to the taxpayer of a 1.9 per cent increase in the average tax rate. The answer is not to further squeeze age pensioners but to fix the retirement income system to improve both work incentives and fairness and to reduce the future cost to the government’s budget. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that living on the single age pension is very tough, yet he expects over 850,000 older Australians to keep doing it tough because he is too much of a bureaucrat to make a decision. Mr Rudd keeps saying that Labor assisted older Australians in the budget by paying a one-off bonus. This is the bonus that Mr Rudd was going to scrap before the coalition and the groups of pensioners put considerable pressure on him to continue with it. Imagine the position older Australians would find themselves in today if the bonus had been scrapped, as Mr Rudd intended.
Mr Rudd went to the election last year promising to ease the cost of living pressures for all Australians and this year Mr Rudd promised those on pensions would not be worse off under a Rudd government. If the Rudd government were serious about helping out people on single age pensions, they could fix this now. They are in government and they have the power to make a change. I would ask that they get on and make the change. My question also today to Minister Evans was: how many of the Labor Party backbenchers were asking that pensioners be given a one-off $30 rise to help their pensions? (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-18,"—I refer to Senator Faulkner’s answers to my questions relating to stormwater harvesting. The issue of stormwater harvesting is vital to supplying the future water needs of Adelaide. As we all know, the Murray-Darling crisis is arguably the greatest environmental challenge this nation has ever faced. The Coorong, an internationally listed environmental site, is being choked. The Lower Lakes, the lungs of the Murray, are gasping their last breath. This once great river, a lifeline to so many communities, is dying. It has been estimated that by 2020 Adelaide’s drinking water will exceed WHO guidelines for salinity on two days out of five if nothing is done to control salinity in the River Murray.
Currently, in an average year, the City of Adelaide depends on the River Murray for approximately 80 gigalitres of water. By contrast, the combined stormwater discharge of the Adelaide metropolitan area is approximately 80 gigalitres of the 170 gigalitres that are released into the ocean each year. I believe that this provides considerable opportunity for the use of stormwater, through aquifer storage and recovery technology, ASR, to relieve the demand for water from other sources. While the South Australian government is proposing a desalination plant that will produce 50 gigalitres a year at a cost of around $1.1 billion—and I note that there is a significant Commonwealth contribution for that—I believe that stormwater recycling will result in much greater gains for about a quarter of the cost. I do not suggest in any way that we should not have a desalination plant—I agree with Senator Faulkner that it is important to have that as a backup—but why aren’t we pursuing something that is as cost effective, as energy effective, as stormwater recycling? In that regard, I acknowledge the long-term support of the Greens with their advocacy for stormwater recycling.
The challenge, Mr Deputy President, is leadership. What Adelaide requires is leadership from the federal government to provide funding through local-state-federal government partnerships to develop a whole-of-Adelaide approach to stormwater recycling. I note that there are already two initiatives, started by the Howard government and continued by the current government, that are contributing to stormwater recycling in Adelaide. Senator Faulkner noted that the Waterproofing Northern Adelaide project, at a cost of $38 million, will be recycling 18 gigalitres of stormwater per annum by 2010. Meanwhile the Waterproofing Southern Adelaide project, at a cost of around $10 million, is similarly making contributions to stormwater recycling in and around the Onkaparinga River. However, there are so many more opportunities that need to be embraced through a joint local-state-federal government process. In the City of Marion, by using the airport site, a further 16 gigalitres of stormwater could be harvested. In the City of Wakefield, around the Gawler River, a further 20 gigalitres of water could be captured, recycled and injected into aquifers to offset the use of Murray water in the northern Adelaide plains.
In addition, there are numerous smaller projects in the range of one to two gigalitres, including along Port Road and the Cheltenham racecourse in the City of Sturt, that could be made possible if leadership were provided, funding made available, and an integrated strategy developed. And can I say about the Cheltenham racecourse site that I fundamentally disagree with the state government’s approach of using that area for housing when it could be used for recycling stormwater. With these opportunities in mind, I believe it is vital for the government to take steps to develop such joint initiatives for stormwater harvesting across the whole of Adelaide. It is this belief that was behind my question without notice and, while I thank the minister for his answer, I believe that much more can be done. We need federal leadership in stormwater harvesting just as we need federal leadership in saving the Murray. If we leave it just to the states, we see responses like the one from the Victorian government to the Murray crisis, which is to build a north-south pipeline that will take out a further 110 gigalitres of water and divert it to the City of Melbourne. Many would say that that is an act of environmental vandalism.
Alternatively we see state governments trying to spend big on energy-hungry projects such as desalination instead of harvesting what already runs down our streets. Metropolitan Adelaide and its plains have many sites with the unique alignment of watercourses to source water, aquifers to recharge and an ocean to discharge. It is the ideal site for strategic stormwater harvesting. In fact, Colin Pitman of the Salisbury council is acknowledged as a world leader. He is a hero when it comes to doing the right thing by harvesting our stormwater and we need to take heed of what he is doing and to expand that substantially. It is my hope that in the future the government will have made more progress in relation to the urgent need for funding and leadership for stormwater harvesting and, as a consequence, the minister’s answers will provide more hope for the River Murray and for the citizens of Adelaide.

Australian Government Response to Report No 138


Inquiry into Australia’s Trade with Mexico and the Region


by the
 
 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade September 2007


Recommendation 1


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, through the Department of Education, Science and Training, reactivate scientific and technological cooperation with Mexico.

The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (DIISR), formerly the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) proposes to make some funding available for an initial activity with Mexico to test the level of interest from Australian science stakeholders in bringing the science and technology relationship to a more active level and will work with the Embassy of Mexico and the Australian Embassy in Mexico City to progress this as a first step. CSIRO’s ongoing work on weed biocontrol at its field station in Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico is also relevant in this context.
By way of background, the former Department of Education, Science and Training recently undertook a review of its strategy for supporting Australia’s engagement with the global science community to consider which countries and research areas would be expected to make the greatest contributions to a high quality science system and present broader social, environmental and economic benefits to Australia.
The review, which involved extensive consultation with the Australian science community, found benefit in concentrating our efforts on two groups of countries: the current science leaders, who are making substantial investment in science and have well established research strengths in fields of particular benefit to Australia; and countries that are emerging as the scientific leaders of tomorrow.
From 2008, funding support for international collaborative projects through the Competitive Grants element of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (DIISR) International Science Linkages programme will focus on a number of countries from these two groups, in specified areas of research, but Mexico currently does not fit into either of these categories.
While collaborations with Mexico are not able to access funding support under Competitive Grants in 2008, DIISR values its S&T relationship with Mexico and will continue to support the relationship at the intergovernmental level. In addition the Australian Embassy in Mexico will continue to encourage further ad hoc scientific cooperation at the individual and institutional levels. Scientific cooperation in the multilateral context on issues ranging from whaling to climate change is also set to increase with Mexico.

Recommendation 2


The Committee recommends that DFAT review the viability of FEALAC and, if it is determined to be viable, ensure a greater effort is made to fulfil its potential.

The Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation (FEALAC) was formed in 1998. Singapore and Chile were the architects of the proposal to form this group. FEALAC held its first Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Santiago in March 2001. The third meeting of Foreign Ministers was held in Brasilia in August 2007. Australia, for the purposes of this regional group, is an East Asian member of FEALAC. All the East Asian members of FEALAC (ASEAN member states, China, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand) are APEC members, but only three Latin American countries (Mexico, Peru and Chile) are members of APEC. APEC is a more established regional forum. FEALAC, however, currently provides a forum in which Australia has the opportunity to engage a wider range of Latin American countries, including the countries of Central America, complementing the bilateral linkages Australia has with those countries.
FEALAC has been slow to develop momentum as a regional group, reflecting in part the higher importance many members give to other established forums such as APEC, and the diverse interests and disparate membership evident in the Forum.
Nevertheless it was clear from the discussion and outcomes of the Third FEALAC Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Brazil that the Forum’s members see potential in this regional grouping and will continue to support it. Japan and Argentina have taken over as the new regional co-ordinators of the Forum and Japan will host the next meeting of FEALAC Foreign Ministers at a date to be determined. Korea and Ecuador are the new co-chairs of FEALAC’s Working Group on Economy and Society, Indonesia and Colombia are the co-chairs of the Political, Cultural and Education Working Group and New Zealand and Panama are the new co-chairs of the Working Group on Science and Technology.
In a welcome development, Brazil, in hosting the August 2007 Foreign Ministers’ meeting, encouraged FEALAC members to give greater priority to strengthening business and commercial links between East Asia and Latin America. Business and academic seminars were held in conjunction with the Ministerial meetings. Australia was represented at the business seminar by a senior executive from Pacific Hydro.
FEALAC’s future and its ongoing viability will depend to a significant extent on the priority and resources member states give to the Forum. The Australian Government will continue to engage with the Forum as resources and opportunities permit. Since the August 2007 Ministerial meeting, Australia has hosted a visit by two Latin American journalists under a FEALAC media visitors program, and has co-sponsored a seminar for FEALAC members in Indonesia on the counter-terrorism lessons learned following the establishment of the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC).

Recommendation 3


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government initiate or continue ministerial discussions with officials of Mexico and the region to address technical market access issues.

The Australian Government will continue to work with Mexico and other Central American countries to reduce technical market access barriers affecting Australian agricultural exports, and will take the opportunity, as circumstances permit, to continue such representations at Ministerial level.
At officials’ level, the main focus of the work in the region by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has been on negotiating arrangements with countries such as Costa Rica, Panama and El Salvador on dairy export plant inspections.
Currently, most Central American countries require on-site visits by their inspectors to list export establishments for export of animal products, including dairy products, to their market. The listing is usually valid only for a period of 2 to 3 years. Inspections by foreign officials are expensive and time consuming and the costs of such inspections have to be met by the participating Australian dairy export registered establishments.
AQIS has made representations to the competent authorities of Panama, Costa Rica and El Salvador seeking a system recognition or equivalence arrangement to remove the need for on-site inspections by providing relevant assurances about the safety of Australia’s products through Australia’s export inspection and certification systems.
Costa Rican authorities recently agreed to extend the validity of listings without conducting an on-site inspection after the previous approval expired in June 2007. The extension was granted after AQIS completed a submission on Australia’s export inspection and certification system. Costa Rican authorities have undertaken to carry out an equivalency assessment of Australia’s export inspection and certification system and will use the AQIS submission to form the basis of their assessment.
In terms of ministerial representations, the Australian Government considers any ministerial representations on these issues would be more appropriately directed to ministerial counterparts rather than officials.

Recommendation 4


The Committee recommends that more resources be provided to Australian Government representatives in Mexico for promotional activities such as trade fairs and exhibitions to capitalise on the strong interest in Australian products.

Austrade Mexico City covers Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The post’s primary focus has traditionally been on Mexico, with a population of over 104 million. Mexico is Australia’s largest trading partner in Latin America with two-way merchandise trade worth $1.8 billion in 2007. Austrade’s post in Mexico City currently manages this market with six permanent staff, which comprises one Australian Trade Commissioner and five local staff. Key events facilitated by the post include Expomin in Veracruz and the Australia Festival (which will be known as ExpoAustralia from 2008) in Mexico City. These promotional activities are critical in raising awareness of Australian capability, particularly in niche areas such as mining, food and beverage and services (including franchising). The allocation and location of resources in Mexico is reviewed regularly by Austrade and options exist for quickly increasing capacity to manage growth in opportunities at the point this becomes necessary. These options include the appointment of trade consultants and/or out posted representatives.
The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR), through Australian Education International (AEI), undertakes a number of key promotional and marketing activities in Mexico, most notably the Latin America Study in Australia Exhibition. In September 2007, for the third consecutive year, the Study in Australia Exhibition included a series of promotional events and activities in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and, for the first time, in Peru and Mexico. In Mexico, the events were held in Monterrey and Mexico City, attracting over 2000 local visitors and participation by 24 Australian education and training institutions from the higher education, vocational education and training, English language and schools sectors. AEI will participate in ExpoAustralia in 2008. To manage its promotional and marketing activities in Mexico, AEI employs a locally-engaged manager based in the Australian Embassy in Mexico City, on an ongoing, full-time basis. Based on the current level of engagement, AEI has adequate resources to support its promotional activities in Mexico.

Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government move forward with a high quality comprehensive FTA with Mexico. In any negotiations, issues relating to agriculture should be determined at an early stage.

The Government’s focus in trade negotiations is to bring the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations to a successful conclusion. The Government sees a role for FTAs provided they are consistent with the goal of strengthening the WTO multilateral trade system.
The Minister for Trade has commissioned an assessment of Australia’s approach to FTAs as part of the current Review of Export Policies and Programs that was launched on 21 February 2008. This FTA research will also include recommendations to the Minister on ways in which future FTAs can strengthen the WTO system and on benchmarks and/or criteria that the Government might apply when considering possible FTAs in the future. The Review is expected to report to the Minister by 31 August 2008 and the Minister will make a determination at that time on implementation of the recommendations in the review report.
As the Committee noted in its report, Australia and Mexico have formed a Joint Experts Group (JEG) to examine all aspects of the Australia-Mexico bilateral economic relationship. The JEG met twice in 2007, and is well advanced in preparing a report for consideration by both governments. The report will identify a range of activities to enhance the bilateral economic and trade relationship, including the possibility of negotiating an FTA with Mexico in the future.
A high quality, comprehensive and WTO-plus FTA with Mexico has the potential to expand trade and investment and deliver economic benefits to both countries. Mexico would seem to be a good prospective partner for a bilateral FTA, especially given that it maintains relatively high tariffs for those countries with which it does not have an FTA. The fact that both Australia and Mexico have FTAs with the United States suggests that there should be significant common ground. But the Australian Government is aware of sensitivities surrounding FTAs in Mexico, especially in the agriculture sector. Australia’s horticulture industry has also expressed concern about the possible negotiation of an FTA with Mexico.
Improved market access to Mexico for Australian agricultural and related products would not necessarily be at the expense of Mexican producers – an FTA would potentially increase Australia’s share of the import market in particular, not necessarily the market as a whole. Australia’s share of the Mexican market in a range of products has declined, as other exporters enjoying preferential tariff and other treatment have improved their share of the market for imported products in Mexico. In other words, improved market conditions through a comprehensive bilateral FTA could be expected to allow Australian exporters to compete in the market on the same basis as most of their competitors.
As part of its broader efforts to build support for enhanced bilateral economic and trade links between the two countries, the Government will continue to examine the details of a potential FTA with Mexico through the JEG. However, any move to commence negotiations with Mexico would require further analysis and consultation with interested parties in both countries. Any decision on future negotiations would also need to take account of the fact that Australia’s negotiating resources are currently heavily occupied with five concurrent FTA negotiations, specifically with ASEAN (jointly with NZ), China, Japan, Malaysia, and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,18,1

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-09-18,"—I have brought the report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare titled Australia’s health 2008 with me and, as the Senate can see, it is a very weighty and detailed document. It looks in a very systematic way at Australia’s health and the performance of Australia’s health.
My focus tonight is on the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare itself. The institute is one of my favourite organisations within the government spectrum. They are extraordinarily diligent and prolific in terms of producing reports that underpin an enormous amount of the work that goes on in the state and federal spheres within the health and welfare system.
This report is an excellent one. It adds greatly to the information that we have about the performance of our health sector. As the report notes, from 1 July 2009 the health performance of Australia will be reported against a new and broader set of indicators, which are currently under development by the Council of Australian Governments. On page 13 the report notes that the information that the institute uses to compile its reports has been significantly improved over the past 15 years as a result of the National Health Information Agreement signed in 1993. It outlines the agreement and notes that the aim of the National Health Information Agreement was to improve cooperation between the states, which are of course the source of most of this data, for the development, collection and exchange of data, and to improve access to uniform health information.
The report also makes it very clear that there needs to be a stronger national approach to improving data collection, to improving the uniformity of data and to improving definitions used when collecting data. It is quite interesting to look at a number of areas within the report in terms of how much information is or is not available to the institute. I certainly commend to the government the need to involve the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in all aspects of program and project development, where their input can assist to ensure that we get information that allows measurement between states and within states to be as good as it possibly can be.
We have heard a lot from the Rudd government about cooperative federalism. They have told us that the way Australia is governed would be improved when we had wall-to-wall Labor—certainly from their perspective, but absolutely not from mine. But the Liberal government of Mr Barnett in Western Australia has rather ruined that for them. What we have in fact is a very concerning situation that continues to go on. The end of the blame game has meant in many cases no blame and no accountability. It is organisations like the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that are now at the forefront of ensuring that the information we get is reliable and comparable in a way that may not suit many of the state Labor governments at all.
I would like to mention briefly a couple of the comments in this report on the health system performance indicators. It is quite interesting that the federal government services—bulk-billing for GP attendance, availability of GP services—all have a favourable trend in 2006-07, but access to elective surgery, which of course is a state based responsibility, has an unfavourable trend. So we continue to have a situation where the history cannot be rewritten to indicate that the federal government—

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-18,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “, but the Senate is of the opinion that, instead of restructuring question time in a manner that could reduce the accountability of ministers to the Senate, the rules relating to questions and answers, contained in past presidential rulings, which require, amongst other things, that questions actually be questions relating to ministerial responsibilities, and that answers be responsive and relevant to the questions, be written into the standing orders, and that the Procedure Committee, with the assistance of external expert advisers, review the effectiveness of question time and the application of those rules at the end of each period of sittings”..
At the end of my speaking time I will seek leave to continue my remarks to make sure there is no vote on this tonight and to give people plenty of time to look at the motion and my proposed amendment over the weekend.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Senator Fielding, have you circulated that motion in writing around the chamber?
—I am just doing that now. I will speak to it. As I said, to give people plenty of time on this issue, I will seek leave to continue my remarks at the end of my speaking time.
—Thank you, Senator Fielding.
—The issue here is that we have a Procedure Committee report that says, farcically, that the idea of all primary questions being put on notice to the ministers of the day should be considered and put around to other senators and members for consultation. That is a farce. That is a holiday for ministers who do not get questions. They can take a holiday break at question time. Those ministers who do not get a question during the day can take a picnic. That is ridiculous. Here we have dorothy dixers from the government of the day with advance warning to the ministers of the day, and look what you get. Here we have a situation where the Procedure Committee says, ‘Look, it’s a good idea to consider having all the questions from this chamber being provided on advance notice by 11 o’clock to the ministers.’ What an absolute joke. I have never heard anything as stupid as this in my entire life.
The whole idea of question time is to make sure that ministers and the government of the day are held to account. The whole idea is to keep them on their toes; to keep them fresh; to hold them to account. I do not think that this is a good idea at all. I will read what it says in the report under ‘Restructuring question time’:
The committee has considered proposals to restructure question time with the aim of making it a more effective mechanism for seeking the accountability of the executive government to the Parliament.
Here is the proposal:
All primary questions to be placed on a Question Time Notice Paper by 11 am.
That is all the questions, so they will already know what the questions are going to be before they even start. I have been watching things a little bit here. Are you sure that you want Conroy’s laptop to be opened up, to spill out pat answers to your questions? Why don’t we just get him to turn around his PC to show us all?
—That wouldn’t be a bad idea. It would be more entertaining.
—Really? Maybe all of the frontbench will have laptops out and there will just be this pat reading out of answers. I have never heard of something so absurd. In actual fact, if you think about what is being proposed, it is a backward step. Do you know why? This Senate can already place questions on notice anytime it wants. So why do you want to stage question time so that all questions are now to be on notice? It is a crazy proposition and a backward step. If someone says that we should be following New Zealand in this regard, I will go he! It is a joke. I cannot believe it.
I read it last night at 11.30 while the Comcar driver was driving me home. I read this report and thought: ‘I can’t believe what I’ve just read here. They want to put all questions on notice.’ I read further and found that up to six supplementary questions can be put without notice. But the minister has already gotten the gist of where the questions are going and can spend from 11 o’clock, to 12 o’clock, to one o’clock, to two o’clock—three hours—preparing pat answers on their computers. The whole frontbench will have computers. What a wonderful idea! This is absolutely crazy. To give others a chance, they can talk now or they can talk next week. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-09-18,"—I want to speak briefly on the matter. I think that Senator Fielding has misconstrued the report. It is not a recommendation; it is a suggestion for discussion. It has been circulated widely for this very purpose: to have discussion. We discussed it today during the adoption of the Procedure Committee’s report. While he has aired some valid concerns and some questions about the process, I am querying the reasons for the amendment. I might be incorrect, because it is only amending a suggestion. Is my interpretation of the amendment that has just been circulated correct?

As I said this morning when this was being debated, we currently have a question time in this place with very few of the ministers ever being able to answer questions. Some of them give the excuse, ‘Oh, I’m only the representative minister so you can’t expect me to understand all this,’ so the whole purpose of question time fails. The purpose of question time is to get information from the government to hold them accountable, to highlight their inefficiencies, and there are many of those. That is not happening at the moment because most of the ministers are so incompetent that they simply are unable to answer questions.
There are one or two exceptions. I mentioned this morning that Senator Evans will occasionally answer a question. Senator Sherry does attempt to answer a question and, when he is in a good mood, Senator Faulkner will attempt to give a factual answer. The rest of them are just a wasted space. That is quite contrary to the way the previous government ministers always attempted to answer questions—perhaps not always successfully or the way the then opposition wanted to hear but there was an attempt to address the subject. Currently, there is rarely an attempt. You get a four-minute talk by a particular minister just talking about himself or how good he and his government policies are. It has no relationship to the question, although occasionally they will pick out one word in the question and use that to pad out the answer.
Unfortunately, that really diminishes the Senate. So the idea is to give the government ministers notice so that they cannot come in here and say, ‘Oh, sorry, I’m only the representative,’ or ‘I haven’t got a brief on that.’ I mean, you would expect that they would know without a brief but obviously they are not terribly competent. This way you will give them an indication of the sorts of areas that you are going to be questioning. So they will have an answer for the original question and then there is up to six—and Senator Ferguson can explain this much better than I can, and he will—or a certain number of supplementary questions, not just from the original questioner but, as I understand it, from right around the chamber. That will really elicit the sort of information we want.
After all, question time is not a game. We do not want to turn it into, say, us coming in here and saying, ‘How can we trick up this minister today and make him look a fool?’ We do not really have to do that; most of them look like fools by their own work.
—You are just so nasty, aren’t you.
—Sorry, if I am saying—
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Order! Senator Macdonald, you will address your remarks through the chair and other senators will not engage in banter across the chamber.
—How else do I indicate they are incompetent? If that is being nasty then, I am sorry, I am nasty. I do not intend it to be personal; I just want to indicate that I do not think they are competent or able to administer their portfolios. The way they act at question time, I suggest with respect, actually demonstrates that. The senator at the minister’s chair may wish to rise and defend them later and point out how good they are. But you only have to see the way they answer questions without notice to know that something needs to be done.
I am suggesting to Senator Fielding that he does need to have a closer look at this. I am not saying that he should necessarily support it but do not dismiss it out of hand because I think there is merit in it. We then might be able to return to the purpose of question time, which is to elicit information, to keep the government accountable and to try, through the style of the questions, to expose some of the various obvious inefficiencies and incompetencies of this very nervous and incompetent government.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,23,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2008-09-18,"—I am very sorry that I only caught the tail end of Senator Fielding’s contribution after it was drawn to my attention. I was quite astonished at some of the statements he made and the misapprehensions that he is under. Firstly, this is a report of the Procedure Committee, which presents to senators some suggestions and a discussion paper which the Senate Procedure Committee will make some decisions on at a later time. It is a discussion paper. It is not a motion before this chamber. The only motion that was moved today by Senator Evans was to put one of the items in the Procedure Committee report into practice until the end of the current session.
I was staggered to hear Senator Fielding say that we should not be following the New Zealanders. I do not know whether Senator Fielding has ever attended a question time in New Zealand, but I certainly have, and in a number of other places. To think that Australia cannot learn from some other countries that follow the same Westminster system that we follow is showing a lack of understanding and a lack of appreciation. If we do not continually reform the procedures of this place—and they have been reformed over a period of time. For 108 years now we have changed the way we run this Senate and the way we run the House of Representatives. Surely it is right for the Procedure Committee to bring a discussion paper to this Senate so that every senator can have some input—not just in this chamber but in other ways as well, including to the Procedure Committee—and we can then move forward from there.
There have already been suggestions today that go outside the discussion paper that I put forward to the Procedure Committee, including some by Senator Bob Brown. He talks about the need to be able to ask questions that are urgent. If something happens after 11 o’clock in the morning and it is an urgent matter then the presiding officer should be able to allow a matter to be asked as an urgent question. That takes place in other parliaments. I did not include it in this discussion paper because I was too busy trying to get the basis of what we might be able to change without going into the details. But I have talked to Senator Bob Brown and I agree with his suggestion—I quite agree with it; as a matter of fact I have asked the Clerk to draw up some wording for our standing orders, which he has already done, and they will become part of the next discussion of the Procedure Committee. I cannot believe some of the wording in Senator Fielding’s amendment:
... that that Senate is of the opinion that instead of restructuring question time in a manner that could reduce the accountability of ministers to the Senate ...
How on earth could having a question on the Notice Paper reduce the accountability of ministers in the Senate? In fact, it will increase the accountability of ministers in the Senate. And the fact is that we have people from the ministers’ offices and from the departments spending hours of their time every day preparing for possible questions that may never get asked.
I was talking to a former minister in the New South Wales government at lunchtime today who has not been in parliament now for some 10 or 11 years. He said that his staff spent two or three hours every day preparing for question time and he rarely ever got a question. He said it was the most wasted time that could be conceived of for his staff and his department. I do not want to see that waste happen here.
The other proposal is that answers be relevant. That is one of the things that has never been in the standing orders relating to question time. There is relevance applied in other areas of the standing orders but nothing to question time. I am not talking particularly about this government; I am talking about every government that we have had. How many times have we seen media journalists ask the Prime Minister or any minister a question at a press conference and receive a direct answer or at least an answer to their question in a short fashion? I have seen the same questions asked in parliament and we have had 12 minutes of non-answer. The journalists simply would not put up with non-answers to questions and yet, in this place, governments of various persuasions have asked us to put up with non-answers for 10 or 15 minutes. So we cannot even treat our colleagues in this place in the same way that a minister or a Prime Minister would treat a journalist who asked a question at a press conference.
It is important in many ways—and this is my hope in the future—that question time in this place should more resemble the types of questions that we get at estimates where ministers and officials are asked direct questions and give reasonably short answers. If a minister does not want to answer a question in estimates, there are ways and means of getting around it so that question is not answered, but it would not take four, 10 or 12 minutes; it would be done in two minutes. It would still be quite possible for a person not to give a non-answer in question time because they would have to be relevant, but they can get around the question in exactly the same way that ministers do when they are in estimates.
The important thing is to show some reform in this place which makes us more relevant to those people outside the chamber who watch what we are doing. I discussed the purpose of question time with former Senator Robert Ray some six or eight months ago before he left this place. He said, ‘Do up a paper and bring it to the Procedure Committee.’ That was Senator Ray’s reaction because he believed in it and I know that there are some people on the government side who think that there is something that needs to be done about question time. They may not agree with what I have proposed in the discussion paper, but everybody agrees that there needs to be some changes.
In this place and in the other place, as I said once before, we are judged by our behaviour in question time. I have watched question time in other parliaments at length, particularly in Canada, the UK, New Zealand and the Scottish parliament. The Scottish parliament is a new parliament which has derived its question time after looking at the current procedures of all of those other parliaments that have been in place for a long time. The one parliament that they disregarded totally was our parliament because of the nature of our question time. We are the only parliament, to the best of my knowledge, that has questions without notice. The object of the exercise is to try to hold any government accountable for its actions and those actions are held to account by asking direct questions and getting direct answers. Maybe there is a lengthy explanation as to the direct answer, but it can be done.
I cannot see in my own mind why people say, ‘It’s a bit difficult to change; we like the way we do things.’ What we have now to be quite frank is an opposition who ask questions they hope the government cannot answer and we have a government who asks questions of their own ministers where the answers are already prepared. That is the downfall of our question time. If you have questions on notice, a minister has a chance to provide an answer, which is what we should be getting—answers as to the activities of governments and the actions or the non-actions of governments. But by having questions without notice, a minister in real difficulty will say, ‘I’ll take that on notice and come back to you at a later stage.’ Why not give them the notice? Let them prepare the answer and then supplementary questions will arise from the answer to the primary question. You do not have to come in here with prepared supplementary questions. If you get an answer, the supplementary question is automatically generated from the answer.
It will test ministers out and I can tell you it will test oppositions out too. It is just as difficult for oppositions to come up with relevant questions as supplementaries as it is for ministers to continue to provide answers. That is what we are in this place for. There is also the fact that we are putting a short time limit on it. In most other parliaments they do not even have two minutes, in Canada, I think, it is 90 seconds. In New Zealand they have up to 63 or 64 supplementary questions a day. You can have as many as you like on a particular item. In here if we have a themed question time, we ask six questions about the same thing. Why not have one question and ask the six questions all at once rather than toing and froing?
There are so many things, I believe, that will help the processes, the procedures and the outcomes of this place. We might finish up with a public who, instead of thinking that we are a rabble at question time, actually watch question time and get some answers to the questions that they have on their minds as well. That is what this parliament ought to be doing. That is why, Senator Fielding, I brought these proposals to the Procedure Committee. I, together with my staff, have spent six months working on them and that is why I believe that they should be supported. (Time expired)

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-18,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “, but the Senate is of the opinion that, instead of restructuring question time in a manner that could reduce the accountability of ministers to the Senate, the rules relating to questions and answers, contained in past presidential rulings, which require, amongst other things, that questions actually be questions relating to ministerial responsibilities, and that answers be responsive and relevant to the questions, be written into the standing orders, and that the Procedure Committee, with the assistance of external expert advisers, review the effectiveness of question time and the application of those rules at the end of each period of sittings”..
At the end of my speaking time I will seek leave to continue my remarks to make sure there is no vote on this tonight and to give people plenty of time to look at the motion and my proposed amendment over the weekend.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Senator Fielding, have you circulated that motion in writing around the chamber?
—I am just doing that now. I will speak to it. As I said, to give people plenty of time on this issue, I will seek leave to continue my remarks at the end of my speaking time.
—Thank you, Senator Fielding.
—The issue here is that we have a Procedure Committee report that says, farcically, that the idea of all primary questions being put on notice to the ministers of the day should be considered and put around to other senators and members for consultation. That is a farce. That is a holiday for ministers who do not get questions. They can take a holiday break at question time. Those ministers who do not get a question during the day can take a picnic. That is ridiculous. Here we have dorothy dixers from the government of the day with advance warning to the ministers of the day, and look what you get. Here we have a situation where the Procedure Committee says, ‘Look, it’s a good idea to consider having all the questions from this chamber being provided on advance notice by 11 o’clock to the ministers.’ What an absolute joke. I have never heard anything as stupid as this in my entire life.
The whole idea of question time is to make sure that ministers and the government of the day are held to account. The whole idea is to keep them on their toes; to keep them fresh; to hold them to account. I do not think that this is a good idea at all. I will read what it says in the report under ‘Restructuring question time’:
The committee has considered proposals to restructure question time with the aim of making it a more effective mechanism for seeking the accountability of the executive government to the Parliament.
Here is the proposal:
All primary questions to be placed on a Question Time Notice Paper by 11 am.
That is all the questions, so they will already know what the questions are going to be before they even start. I have been watching things a little bit here. Are you sure that you want Conroy’s laptop to be opened up, to spill out pat answers to your questions? Why don’t we just get him to turn around his PC to show us all?
—That wouldn’t be a bad idea. It would be more entertaining.
—Really? Maybe all of the frontbench will have laptops out and there will just be this pat reading out of answers. I have never heard of something so absurd. In actual fact, if you think about what is being proposed, it is a backward step. Do you know why? This Senate can already place questions on notice anytime it wants. So why do you want to stage question time so that all questions are now to be on notice? It is a crazy proposition and a backward step. If someone says that we should be following New Zealand in this regard, I will go he! It is a joke. I cannot believe it.
I read it last night at 11.30 while the Comcar driver was driving me home. I read this report and thought: ‘I can’t believe what I’ve just read here. They want to put all questions on notice.’ I read further and found that up to six supplementary questions can be put without notice. But the minister has already gotten the gist of where the questions are going and can spend from 11 o’clock, to 12 o’clock, to one o’clock, to two o’clock—three hours—preparing pat answers on their computers. The whole frontbench will have computers. What a wonderful idea! This is absolutely crazy. To give others a chance, they can talk now or they can talk next week. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-09-18,"—I want to speak briefly on the matter. I think that Senator Fielding has misconstrued the report. It is not a recommendation; it is a suggestion for discussion. It has been circulated widely for this very purpose: to have discussion. We discussed it today during the adoption of the Procedure Committee’s report. While he has aired some valid concerns and some questions about the process, I am querying the reasons for the amendment. I might be incorrect, because it is only amending a suggestion. Is my interpretation of the amendment that has just been circulated correct?

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-09-18,"—Badu Island is one of the larger central western highlands of the Torres Strait. It is a beautiful place, a high island surrounded by coral reefs and covered in trees. It was a traditional home for fishers and hunters of turtle and dugong, and then it became a pearling and trochus shell centre. Today it is a modern community that is looking forward to dealing with its future on its own terms. It is an administrative centre for the central strait. It has a thriving fishing industry and is working to see if its hydroponic gardens can produce enough fresh fruit and vegetables to supply other islands in the Torres Strait cost-effectively.
The people of Badu Island are an energetic and resourceful group. That has always been the way on Badu and it always will be, I am happy to say. The island has been blessed throughout its history with powerful leaders—men and women who have taken up the challenges of their times on behalf of their community. Today I bring to the attention of the Australian people the passing of one such leader, Walter Nona Senior. Athe, or grandfather, died on Monday. To me and many of my colleagues—including the federal member for Leichhardt, Jim Turnour; the state member for Cook, Jason O’Brien; former state member for Cook, Steve Bredhauer; and Bob and Jenny Scott—Athe Walter was a friend, a confidant and a mentor.
I first met Walter in the late 1980s and we quickly became firm friends. Every time I visited Badu I would go up to the school and we would have a yarn about the state of the island, the state of the nation and world events of the day. Athe Walter walked through the barriers of time, place and culture as if those barriers never existed. He was a vastly credentialled and cultured man and I am proud to list in this place some of those credentials—they stand comparison well.
First and foremost he was a highly respected man in his own traditions as well as being perfectly at home in the western way of doing things. He had a quiet way with words and wisdom in both worlds, being a well-known teller of Torres Strait stories and legends and a font of stories of more modern times. He remained a strong advocate of traditional knowledge and culture. When he retired he went—every day—to the school on Badu where he taught those essentials to the island children. Education was a central part of Walter’s life. Athe Walter was the parents and citizens’ president of the island’s school for more than 30 years. He was a life member of the Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens Associations. He was a past deputy chair of Tagai State College—which he named—and a founding member of the Torres Strait Islanders Regional Education Council. Athe Walter’s community commitments included being a member of the Badu Island Council and serving as deputy chair. He was a member of the Mura Badugal Council of Elders and served as the elders’ representative on the Badu Island Interagency Committee. He was also a local policeman.
Like all of his contemporaries, Athe Walter was a great hunter, fisher and gardener, and a seaman of some repute amongst a seagoing people. By the age of 14 he was already a skilled sailor, working on pearling and trochus dinghies in the Torres Strait. At the outbreak of war in 1939, Athe Walter was working in the trochus industry on the north Queensland coast as a diver, sailor and skipper. Like many, many Torres Strait Islanders he immediately volunteered for the army, serving as a pilot on luggers sailing between Australia and what is now Papua New Guinea, and other vessels, including submarine chasers. Officially, he was Sapper Walter Nona, Q304658, and he was, rightly, proud of his voluntary service to his nation.
In 2000 Australia recognised this singular man’s contribution to the community when the Governor-General presented him with a Centenary Medal. He was also a recipient of the Premier’s Award for Queensland Seniors. In 2005 Athe Walter was selected as one of 20 significant elderly Australians to be interviewed for the book Inspiring, not Retiring. He was the only Indigenous person included. Athe Walter may have been a quiet and humble man but there was no doubting his strength of character, his clear-cut views on morality and ethics, his social conscience and his strong sense of justice. These are the characteristics that made him a natural Labor Party member. He has been a member of the party as long as I have known him.
Walter was born on 1 April 1923 at Wakaid on Badu Island, the 13th and youngest child of Tipoti and Ugarie Nona, a family of Torres Strait and Samoan heritage. He was a man proud of his South Sea Islander background and the fact that his extended family reached from Saibai Island just off the coast of Papua New Guinea southwards throughout Queensland. I might point out to senators that those family links directly extend into this parliament. Two of his grandsons, Dennis Nona and Alec Tipoti, are highly regarded artists and their works are part of the collection that we hold here in this place. Alec’s print is a very large print that you see on the way to the parliamentary cafeteria and Dennis has a number of pieces in our collection. I am fortunate to have one in my rooms, but there is also a very large piece of Dennis Nona’s, in the same corridor as the Alec Tipoti piece, which is a sculpture of Stingrays. It is a very beautiful piece. I share the sorrow that they will be feeling tonight.
I pass my condolences to Aka Harriet, Walter Nona’s wife of 57 years, and their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, the rest of his extended family and everyone on Badu Island. I extend my sincere apologies to everyone for not being able to be at the funeral tomorrow. I am really sad that I cannot be with you all. We will all miss a wise and gentle man. He was a true friend and adviser to his family, his fellow Torres Strait Islanders, his state, his nation and us in the Labor Party. He was above all a family man—a loving husband and father, grandfather and great-grandfather. Athe Walter will be remembered with great respect, admiration and affection.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Walter Nona Senior</title>,Adjournment,24,1
