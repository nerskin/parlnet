"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-06-22,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Preventing the Misuse of Government Advertising Bill 2010 having precedence over all government business until determined.
This legislation is to bring into place a process adopted and given lip service by senior members of both the government and the opposition in recent years, about the potential for governments to misuse public funds—in particular, on the way to elections—the most controversial case in recent times being the current $38 million allocated by the government to its defence and advocacy of the mining boom tax. While we are very well aware that the mining industry itself is being financed to the level of 30 per cent of its own advertising campaign—and we intend to deal with that in separate legislation—the matter does require attention now. The question to the government is: why have we not seen legislation on this matter? The Prime Minister, as Leader of the Opposition, committed to it in 2007, and effectively nothing has happened since in terms of legislation through the parliament. The question to the opposition is: is there a better time for us to be legislating on this matter than now, when the feedback we have had—and I am sure the feedback you have had is the same—is that the public is feeling very distressed about the tens of millions of dollars that governments can so readily put into the advocacy of a point of view they have in the run to an election? It is undemocratic, it is illogical and it needs, by agreement, to be vetted.
The legislation that I have introduced to this parliament on behalf of the Australian Greens involves the vetting of such advertising, first by heads of department. If there is a campaign of more than $250,000 to be engaged in by the government, the head of department needs to sign off that the prudent guidelines which are outlined in this legislation have been adhered to. To summarise the guidelines, they are that the advertising must be in the public interest and that it must not be for party political promotion. Then the advertising campaign goes to be seen by the Auditor-General, who is at arm’s length and who does not make the decision as to whether it should go ahead or not but, again, determines whether what the head of department has signed off on is correct. The Auditor-General reports to both houses of parliament, and that report then can be taken up or ignored by the minister of the day, but woe betide the minister of the day who says, ‘The Auditor-General believes this is a political advertising campaign and we’re going to proceed with it.’ That will not happen.
I am aware that the government feels that such legislation as this should not be on the agenda, but I would point out to the Senate that we are dealing with many pieces of legislation at the moment in a much more peremptory way than with this bill, which at least has been to a quick committee opportunity. There were not oral hearings, but there were submissions on a matter that has been debated over many periods of parliament in the past. The government wants bills that have been introduced quickly to this place debated this week, and that means today and tomorrow: the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010, introduced to the Senate yesterday and listed for debate today; the Excise Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010, which is up for debate this week; and the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2010. There were also 20 other bills passed by the Senate over the last week which went through as non-controversial and not requiring great debate.
If there is genuine support from the big parties for an independent vetting of advertising campaigns, let us have this debate. We can make it very fast, we can make it to the point and we can have in law by tomorrow legislation which will ensure that the parliament properly keeps watch over the public interest and the use of taxpayers’ money.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-06-22,"—What we have is a seeking of suspension in relation to the Australian Greens’ Preventing the Misuse of Government Advertising Bill 2010. What the five minutes of speaking time is for is to make a case for why the parliament should suspend to allow this bill to come forward. No case has been made with respect to Senator Brown’s submissions. Senator Brown went to issues of the content of the particular legislation. None of his issues went to why this bill is urgent.
The bill attempts to legislate the Rudd government’s 2008 process for government advertising, which we have now improved. I have to say that it is flattering that the Greens consider that so many aspects of this government’s advertising framework that we introduced in 2008 were so faultless. Another pleasing aspect of the bill is that it is evidence that the Greens agree with many aspects of our current 2010 guidelines, such as the five key principles of the guidelines, the need to be able to advertise before legislation has been passed by parliament and the need to ensure that exemptions can be granted. All of that is contained within the bill.
Of course, the unconstitutional bill was developed and brought forward before this chamber at breakneck speed. Perhaps a little bit more work should have been done on it. It does offend the constitutionality of Australia’s Constitution. It did provide a report a very short time afterwards, less than a week from when it was referred to the Senate committee. The report is surprising. It says the Greens said—I guess you would have to say they had the hide to say—the committee ‘failed to acknowledge the widespread community concerns about this critical issue’. I would like to note that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for members of the community to make submissions to the committee with only two days notice.
If Senator Brown were serious about progressing this bill then you would have expected it to have gone to a committee to allow public input, to allow submissions to be dealt with and to allow the committee to then take its ordinary course of work. But, once again, we see the Greens in this instance unable to live up to the principles that they often espouse. I am sure Senator Brown would concur with me in these remarks when noting that we complained about the short periods in which the previous government pushed legislation through following short committee processes and the inability of the committee to use its committee resources to examine the bill in context and cast its net wide to allow submissions to be made so that a proper report could be produced and recommendations made. It appears Senator Brown has thrown that principle out in bringing on this piece of legislation without providing justified grounds as to why it should now upend the program for this bill.
It does not take away from the seriousness of the bill. I am sure Senator Brown honestly and reasonably believes it is a worthwhile bill to progress. My advice, although uncalled for, is that the proper processes of the Senate would demonstrate that it was unconstitutional—it would allow proper submissions to be made; it would allow proper community engagement in relation to the legislation. You have not chosen to do that and that is a matter for you, but do not complain if I draw it to your attention. This is the last week we have to deal with legislation—that is right. We do have a leaders and whips deliberation and we had one at the beginning of this week to determine what legislation we would deal with before we go home at the end of the week. There are proper processes in this place to ensure that the proper legislative agenda is dealt with in this week.
This bill is unlikely to go forward. It does take up time—I will not take up as much time as I otherwise would like to have committed to this bill, but it is unsupported as it seeks to up-end this parliament for the purposes of what can only be described as selfish motivations of Senator Brown to deal with a very important issue. If Senator Brown wanted to have a debate in relation to this then he could use other forums within this parliament to allow that to occur.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-06-22,"—In making comments in relation to the Australian Greens’ Preventing the Misuse of Government Advertising Bill 2010, I find myself in the interesting position of agreeing with some of the comments of the Special Minister of State, Senator Ludwig, and certainly agreeing with many of the comments of Senator Brown. In relation to the minister’s comments, I think this process has been rushed and I do not think it has been given appropriate levels of consideration. In relation to the comments of Senator Brown, I think there is far more on which I agree with him in relation to this matter than I do with the minister, but, having said that, we will not be supporting this motion.
There is no doubt that there was a great sense of urgency in relation to the question of government advertising. There was a great sense of urgency to address what has been a gross abuse of governmental process over the last two months. Regrettably this particular bill, in my view, is not the way to address this issue. Senator Brown knows that we have had concerns for some time now, and that for the Auditor-General to be the judge and jury is not the best process. I remind honourable senators of the letter the Auditor-General sent to the Prime Minister on 26 November 2007. It read:
Dear Prime Minister
I am writing to outline an approach to addressing your plans to increase the scrutiny of Australian government advertising campaigns.
That was in the days when the Prime Minister actually believed in appropriate scrutiny of government advertising campaigns. Those days, as honourable senators know, are long gone, with this government’s commitment to openness and transparency in government advertising. I go on to page 2 of the letter from the Auditor-General, Mr McPhee:
Given the sometimes controversial history of government advertising there is a real risk that whoever administers the guidelines could be drawn into the policy and political debate as an active participant in, and possible defender of the processes of executive government. To preserve both the real and perceived independence of this office, I and my predecessors have actively sought to avoid placing the ANAO in a situation of being both decision maker and auditor.
Similar concerns have seen previous governments take action with our support to avoid the involvement of this office in ongoing administrative roles—for example, in relation to the electoral redistribution committees and tax agents registration boards.
I think that letter sums up the position of the Auditor-General in relation to this matter. I think the Auditor-General at the moment has been forced into a position where he has indicated to various parliamentary fora over the last two weeks that he would at a pinch be involved again as the judge and jury, but from recollection certainly not with the guidelines as they exist at the moment.
The opposition is absolutely adamant that the role and integrity of the Audit Office must be retained. We do not believe it is appropriate to compromise that independence by making the Auditor the judge and jury. Of course, the Australian Labor Party for, I think, seven or eight years believed that the Auditor-General could be judge and jury, and then, when they saw things occur which indicated that they did not like the Auditor-General being the judge and jury, they just changed the rules. The outcome of those rule changes has been the subject of substantial media commentary over the last month. The outcome of rolled gold promises by the Prime Minister prior to the election, the outcome of Labor Party conventions and the weasel words spoken then in relation to this matter have all been proved to be absolutely false, and we saw the farcical situation some two weeks ago when the minister provided an exemption to the Treasurer—the great big new tax on mining exemption for advertising. The coalition, I must say with some regret, will not be supporting this motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-22,"—I will be supporting the Greens motion to suspend standing orders in relation to the government advertising legislation. It is the appropriate thing to do in the circumstances. I know that the Special Minister of State has said that this process is flawed. I think it would be fair to say—and I do not think Senator Brown would mind me saying this—that the process is not perfect but it is still very much preferable to what we have in place now: a series of government advertising campaigns that have thrown out appropriate process, that have thrown out the whole issue of appropriate scrutiny and have removed the role of the Auditor-General as the independent watchdog to do this.
I think it is important that we look at what the key public policy issue is here—that we actually have some integrity in government advertising. I think that has been lost, unfortunately, as a result of what has occurred, and therefore it is important to support this particular bill to support the suspension of standing orders, because a consequence of not supporting this is that this will continue on right up until election day, in effect. We will continue to see ads that should not be aired because they contravene the government’s own policies prior to the 2007 election. It is important that we do have integrity in this process. Obviously it would have been better if we had a longer lead time, and it would have been better if we had greater consultation, but I think the public opinion on this is very clear: people are quite mortified that the government has gone down this path to break a key promise that they made at the last election in relation to government advertising. I note that the Prime Minister said in opposition that this was a cancer on democracy, or words to that effect—it was very strong language. I agree that it is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. If we want to deal with the problem, if we want to fix it, we can start now by suspending standing orders and debating this piece of legislation that effectively puts into effect Labor Party policy that was put to the people at the last election.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-06-22,"—I thank Senator Xenophon for those supportive comments, which are true. In response to Senator Ronaldson—and I thank him for also acknowledging the importance of such legislation as this being passed in the parliament—it is not true that the bill makes the Auditor-General judge and jury. The beauty of this piece of legislation is that it gives the Auditor-General the ability to furnish parliament and the minister with an opinion, but the decision maker remains the government. But even that does not satisfy this government.
Senator Ludwig has said that the legislation is unconstitutional. How unsatisfactory is that contribution when it is not followed up with any reasoning. It is just an opinion floated in the air. The most debasing part of it is in relation to any parliamentary debate against legislation where members get up—and I have seen this for decades—and say the bill is badly drawn, hastily done or does not fit some unspecified constitutional parameter. That is not an argument; that is specious. If we are to have a proper debate about why legislation like this should not be debated now and rapidly put through the parliament, as are so many pieces of government legislation this week, courtesy of the crossbench as well as the opposition, the government needs to come up with a better argument than that.
Senator Ludwig also said that there was a short committee process. As I pointed out in my submission, we are dealing with a number of important pieces of government legislation here which have had no committee process at all, let alone public debate. As you will know, there has been widespread public debate on this issue. Four major commentators on this legislation, including the Auditor-General himself, have favoured this legislation proceeding, and have offered recommendations—and I have amendments to accord with the suggestions of the Auditor-General—for this legislation, which is now not going to pass because the government and the opposition oppose it.
I would remind the government that in October last year when the sitting times for this year for the Senate were laid down by the government, the Greens pointed out that it was one of the shortest sitting periods set down for a Senate year in history. It was totally unsatisfactory and we moved for an extra four sitting weeks of the Senate, but both the government and the opposition voted that down. Two of those weeks would have been in April and two would have been in August. We would have had plenty of time to debate at length, with fuller committee and public consideration, all the pieces of legislation which are being rushed through, mostly by the government, this week. No, the difficulty we have in getting proper vetting of legislation rests wholly on the shoulders of Senator Ludwig and the government, because they have refused to have this Senate have the sitting times which are appropriate to dealing with the large legislative slate. I have no doubt that, come Thursday, the government is going to say that lots of pieces of legislation have not been dealt with. That is totally a situation of the government’s own manufacture.
The argument used by Senator Ludwig has no internal coherence or logic at all. I might remind the Senate that there are 31 private senators’ bills waiting to be dealt with in this place. They are important bills. There are bills on the improvement of democracy, the performance of the Senate, the wellbeing of Indigenous Australians, environment protection, the promotion of climate change issues and a whole range of other issues that deal with people. These bills ought to have passed this parliament but there is no time to deal with them. This is not only because we do not have private senators’ time—and I have tried very hard to get that up, but that has been blocked as well through the committee system—but because there is no time even to deal adequately with government legislation. That is the responsibility of this government. It is totally on its shoulders. I am very pleased that we have had this debate. I recommend this suspension so that this chamber can pass this important legislation.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-06-22,"—I table three supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to government amendments to be moved to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010. The memoranda were circulated in the chamber today.
On behalf of the government, I thank senators in this place for the various conversations and negotiations we have had on this legislation. I have hope that there is broadly an interest in passage of this legislation forthwith. The government believes it is in the interests of the clean energy sector for us to do so. We have certainly engaged in dialogue with the opposition, the Greens and Senator Xenophon, and I had a brief discussion with Senator Fielding as well. I thank the parties represented in those discussions for the constructive and cooperative way that those discussions have been engaged in, and I thank again Mr Macfarlane for his negotiations on behalf of the opposition.
I seek leave to move government amendments (1) to (8) on sheet AL260 together.
Leave granted.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-06-22,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate our support for these amendments moved by the government. We recognise that this is an important mechanism being introduced in an attempt to provide some certainty of price, particularly in the early years of the operation of the LRET. We have had numerous representations made to us about some of the issues around banked certificates and how they will be discharged into the market. As a result, we think that it is sensible to find a mechanism to ensure that they are discharged in a tidy manner that ensures some degree of certainty for price. In relation to my own state, I have had representations from companies such as LMS Generation, a landfill gas power generator, who highlighted small future projects that might be delayed or put off in future years should something not be done to ensure that there is not a large flow of banked credits onto the market next year, therefore holding down the LRET price in the early years of the scheme. I understand the manner in which this is being presented ensures that any costs borne by electricity users in the early years will be offset in the latter years of the scheme.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-06-22,"—I was anticipating that Senator Milne would speak but, given that these amendments deal with an issue that a subsequent Greens amendment deals with, I might just outline how the government is dealing with the issue, unless Senator Milne wishes to speak first.
—No.
—Okay. If you turn to amendment (3) and look at 30LA(3), it will be clear from that that the minister has the capacity, after taking into account independent advice, to look to various changes to deal with a situation where the small-scale technology certificates created in 2015 would exceed or be expected to exceed six million megawatt hours. As I said, we believe that this deals with one of the issues raised in the Senate committee report—and, while I am on my feet, I will thank Senator McEwen and other senators for their prompt and sensible consideration of this legislation. These amendments deal with one of the issues that were raised in the context of that report, about whether or not the growth in the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme would be substantially more than that anticipated. This provision enables what we think is a sensible and robust decision-making framework to address those issues should they arise.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech

I have had discussions with the government, the opposition and my colleagues in the Greens in relation to them. I hope to be in a position to file amendments very shortly.

My concern is with commercial ventures such as abattoirs and those sorts of businesses. With the proposed legislation, have you done any modelling and can you inform the Senate of what expected price rises we may see in electricity? I asked that in all seriousness, as it is one of my concerns. Even though I support renewable energy—the more renewables we can use, the more finite resources we can leave for future generations—I just have some concerns over the actual costs or the projection of increased costs of electricity because of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-06-22,"—I understood from Senator Birmingham that the opposition were supporting these amendments. In relation to the question of costs, I have outlined to your colleague Senator Boswell on a number of occasions what we estimate with regard to the current renewable energy target, although it will depend on when you model a price on carbon. The modelling I think I provided publicly and explained to Senator Boswell in the context of the estimates hearing was 4.2 per cent for the current renewable energy target—that is, the legislation that you have already supported. With the enhancements in the government bill—prior to these amendments obviously, because this modelling preceded the amendments—it will be an additional 0.2 per cent. That is a cumulative cost between 2010 and 2014 of 4.4 per cent.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-06-22,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (2) on sheet 6114:
(2)    Schedule 1, page 35 (after line 9), after item 65, insert:
65A  After section 40
Insert:
         (1)    The required GWh of renewable source electricity in section 40 for the years 2011 and 2012 must be increased as specified in declarations made under subsection (3) for the relevant year.
         (2)    The Regulator must, by 10 May 2011, make the following calculations in respect of the large‑scale generation certificates on the register of large‑scale generation certificates as at 30 April 2011:
              (a)    the total of the number of registered large‑scale generation certificates and the number of large‑scale generation certificates that are pending registration in the register (total A);
              (b)    the number of registered large‑scale generation certificates that are pending surrender (total B);
              (c)    the number of registered large‑scale generation certificates that are pending voluntary surrender (total C);
              (d)    the number of registered large‑scale generation certificates that have been created on or after 1 January 2011 under Subdivision A of Division 4 of Part 2 (total D);
              (e)    the number of registered large‑scale generation certificates that are subject to eligible pre‑existing contracts for transfer from one party to another party (total E);
               (f)    the figure (total F) that is the result of:
                            total A – (total B + total C + total D) + total E;
              (g)    the figure (total G) that is the result of:
                            total F – 16,200,000;
              (h)    the figure expressed in megawatt hours (total H) that is the result of:
                            total G ÷ 2;
and publish the results of those calculations on the Internet.
         (3)    If total G is greater than zero, the Regulator must, within 5 days of complying with subsection (2), make a declaration increasing the required GWh of renewable source electricity in section 40 for 2011 and 2012 by total H (converted in gigawatt hours).
         (4)    A declaration made under subsection (3) is not a legislative instrument.
This amendment refers to the issue of banking. As we know, each year there is a surplus of renewable energy certificates that are banked or saved for future years. This surplus equals about a year’s worth of demand and it helps the liable parties, the electricity retailers, manage their obligations.
By splitting the renewable energy target into large-scale renewables—that is, essentially wind and small-scale schemes—the bill we are dealing with, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010, ensures that the RECs from the small systems do not crowd out investment in the large renewable energy systems. But the problem is that between now and the end of this year there will be a lot of renewable energy certificates produced from the small systems and they will be eligible to be used towards the large-scale target. So the real question is: how many of those certificates are going to be generated between now and the end of the year and what will that do to the price of certificates in the large-scale system?
The government modelling suggests there will be 16.2 million renewable energy certificates banked by the beginning of next year. If that is roughly correct it would be fine; it would provide the liquidity that is required in the large-scale market. But the trouble is that the industry calculates the number of banked renewable energy certificates will more likely be 23 to 25 million, with AGL saying that it could be as high as 32 million certificates. If the number is that high then you will see exactly the same situation as we have now. We will have a collapse in the price, and so there will be a further delay in investment in large-scale renewable energy. We do not want that to occur. This amendment basically says that if the number of banked renewable energy certificates is higher than the government expects as a result of its own modelling—that is, higher than 16.2 million RECs—the target in the subsequent two years will be increased. For example, if 24 million RECs were banked that would be an excess of 8 million RECs, so the target would be increased by 4 million in 2011 and in 2012 to deal with the problem.
I have raised this matter with the government several times. I am really concerned about the modelling. The government modelling got it so wrong last year that we have ended up in the situation of being back here. At the time when this legislation to increase the target to 20 per cent first came in, I pointed out that all of the renewable energy certificates from the small system would crowd the market and collapse the price and that there would be no incentive for large-scale renewables. I moved an amendment to put those on top of the target, and that was voted down by the coalition and by the government. Nobody actually challenged the government’s modelling, and the government got it wrong.
I am really worried that the government’s modelling of 16 million RECs is wrong again, and that is why I have moved this amendment. I am grateful to the minister for the discussions that we have had in this regard. I believe that the baseline here should be the government’s modelling, 16 million, and anything above that should be added on to targets in future years, so I am moving the amendment to that effect.
I am aware that the minister has had some discussions around this and is thinking of maybe 20 million. The question I would like to pose to the minister is: since the government’s modelling is 16.2 million, why is the government thinking of 20 million as the threshold? Is the government’s modelling wrong? Is industry right? Why has the minister settled on that figure, if indeed she has? I wish to foreshadow that if the government does move its own amendment in this regard then it is likely that I will be seeking leave to withdraw mine. I want to give advance warning to the chamber that that is under consideration.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-06-22,"—I appreciate the sentiments that Senator Milne is expressing. As I said in relation to the first amendment—perhaps when it was more appropriate for this one and a later government one—the coalition is eager to see some certainty for future price in relation to the LRET, particularly taking into account the number of credits that are currently proposed within the scheme.
However, we do note that the government has proposed amendments, which are to be considered later, dealing with a mechanism to try to clear some of the banked credits. We can only take the government’s modelling and advice at its word. I look forward to hearing Senator Wong respond to Senator Milne’s specific questions around that. However, the opposition is not inclined to support this amendment of the Greens, noting that the government has proposals for different mechanisms to address, at least in part, the issue that is being raised.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-06-22,"—Firstly, as we have certainly seen in the RSPT debate and the CPRS debate there are always arguments about modelling. There are always a range of assumptions involved in modelling. My recollection, and I could be wrong, is that the price that was assumed in the previous modelling of solar PV was actually higher than it has trended down to. That is not a bad thing, in the sense that making solar panels more cheaply indicates that that market is becoming more mature and the capacity for unit cost to reduce is increasing.
In these amendments we have sought, after quite a lot of discussion, to try and strike a reasonable balance between the different policy objectives which are of importance here. One of those is electricity cost. Another is a proper assessment of a reasonable allocation of risk in terms of different aspects of the modelling altering—who should properly bear the risk of that and to what extent?
The third thing you have to balance, obviously, is the issue of certainty. The government is absolutely committed to providing industry with as much certainty as is possible and reasonable, given that the whole purpose of this legislation is to drive investment in renewables, both large and small. In relation to the business certainty issue, which arises in the context of banked renewable energy certificates, we have held lengthy discussions with industry and with members of the clean energy sector about what a reasonable level of certainty would be in order to facilitate the investments that I think all of us want. In discussions with various stakeholders, the figure of 20 million has been indicated as reasonable to enable various decisions to be made with a degree of certainty whilst ensuring a reasonable balance of risk is borne by both industry and electricity users under the scheme.
We think that the 20 million target is reasonable, given discussions with the stakeholders. It is the case that our modelling suggests 16.2 million by the end of the year. Under this amendment, even if that level of 20 million is not correct, industry knows the way in which government will deal with those additional renewable energy certificates. We understand that if there are a far greater number of renewable energy certificates banked at the conclusion of this year then that may have an impact on investment decisions which we believe are in the national interest. So we think this is a balanced position. It is a position that reflects a substantial amount of consultation with industry. It provides a level of certainty that is appropriate and, for that reason, the government will not be supporting the Greens amendment. I will be moving the government’s amendment, which has already been foreshadowed and circulated, in relation to dealing with this banked RECs issue.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-06-22,"—I thank the minister for taking on this issue, for giving it the consideration she has and for putting in a threshold, if you like. I do think it is important and industry have indicated very strongly their concern. I would like to know, though, from the minister the assumptions behind the government’s modelling for the 16.2 million so that, by the end of the year, we can understand what is going on with the government’s modelling in relation to these matters. If the assumptions have been so wrong before, don’t we need to know who is feeding assumptions into these models and what level of consultation is going on with industry to ensure the assumptions going into the models bear some resemblance to the reality of the market? The minister may wish to take it on notice, but I would like to know the assumptions behind the 16.2 million RECs. I appreciate the government’s move to 20 million. My amendment states that the figure should be 16.2 million but anything above that should be added on to the target in the two subsequent years. Before I seek leave to withdraw the amendment, though, I would ask the minister to just outline at this time, to save having the debate later, how those additional RECs will be accommodated in the government’s proposal.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-06-22,"—Firstly, in relation to the modelling I have released publicly the modelling report, which includes, from recollection, an iteration of the assumptions contained in it. Secondly, Senator Milne, as I said, we are taking the position we are taking consequent upon a substantial amount of consultation with the industry. The amendment that I will be moving will provide that if the net stock of banked RECs at the end of 2010 exceeds 20 million there will be adjustments to the 2012 and 2013 targets and, as an offsetting adjustment, the annual targets will be reduced over the period 2016 to 2019 by the same amount. So the total number of renewable energy certificates generated over the decade will remain the same.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-06-22,"—I appreciate the fact that by backending the system, so to speak, hopefully, by the time we get to 2016 we will already have a much higher renewable energy target than we now have and that it ought not matter at that point. As the minister herself has indicated, this sector is moving fast and it is no doubt very difficult for the parliament to even keep acknowledging that. Since this legislation was brought in here only last year, solar systems, for example, have come down in price by 40 per cent. Take us out to 2016, and if we cannot improve substantially on 20 per cent renewable energy by then then we are not doing our job. Frankly, we should be moving to a target of 100 per cent renewables as quickly as possible. I am delighted to say that today a report was released in this parliament by Beyond Zero Emissions, based at Melbourne university, outlining how you may achieve 100 per cent renewables in a decade, by 2020. We have a way to go beyond 20 per cent to get to 100 per cent by 2020. So I am not too concerned about backending the system in the way the minister is suggesting, because we will be reviewing this target much sooner and no doubt we will achieve the level of ambition that I think many people in this country, and the Greens of course, support. Therefore, Madam Chair, since the government is addressing this issue of the banked RECs and putting in a threshold of 20 million—I would have liked it to have been less—nevertheless it is dealing with the issue, I seek leave to withdraw Australian Greens amendment (2) on sheet 6114.

These amendments deal with the issue of biomass from native forest vegetation. The Australian Greens are moving to ensure that biomass from native forest vegetation will no longer be an eligible renewable energy source. This is an absolutely critical issue in the climate change debate, the biodiversity debate and the forest industry future debate, so it has garnered the interest of people around the country.
As a matter of context, I will just indicate that over the last decade the market for native forest woodchips has collapsed totally around the world, such that the native forest logging industry is in complete disarray. It has collapsed in Tasmania; it is on the verge of collapse in Victoria. There is no market for the export of native forest woodchips. This is for two reasons. One is because a wall of plantation timber has come on stream from all around the world and is outcompeting native forests into the Japanese pulp and paper market because plantation woodchips are of a higher, more even quality for the purposes of pulping. Also, because they are younger timber, they require less chlorine in the bleaching process, and you can get to a chlorine-free bleaching process if you use plantation timbers. The upshot is that the market for native forest woodchips has collapsed.
The second reason that the Japanese are not buying Australian native forest woodchips is that they recognise that they have to achieve Forest Stewardship Council certification and they are not going to get it for logging primary forests. There is a global focus now on protecting the world’s forests and on protecting biodiversity. We are this year in the United Nations International Year of Biodiversity. Next year is the United Nations International Year of the Forests, and the year after that is Rio plus 20. We are in a global negotiation currently on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation.
There is a fantastic opportunity in Australia right now with the collapse of the native forest industry to move the industry into downstreaming the existing plantation estate. The benefit of ending native forest logging is not only because of its biodiversity and carbon benefits but also because every time a government subsidises the logging of native forests it reduces the price that you can get from downstreaming plantation timber, so it is not in the interests of the plantation industry to have governments continuing to subsidise native forest logging. What is the point of subsidising native forest logging, dropping the price and undermining the price of plantations at exactly the same time as you are providing managed investment scheme tax benefits for the planting of those plantations?
Now we have a scenario where the industry has turned up at the parliament saying: ‘Give us another handout. We want the renewable energy target to include burning biomass.’ This is the rescue package for the native forest logging industry. They do not have an industry at the moment. It has collapsed. So what they are trying to do is say, ‘Let us cut down native forests, burn them in furnaces, generate renewable energy certificates and sell them as green energy.’ They are not green energy. They are known colloquially in the market as ‘dead koala certificates’. They are known that way in the market for a reason: it is completely unjustifiable in economic, biodiversity or carbon terms or any kind of decent debate to say, ‘We need a make-work program for cutting down native forests now that we’ve got no market, so we’ll set up furnaces and we’ll burn them instead.’
As it currently stands, the way the legislation is structured, you can only generate a renewable energy certificate from burning native forest residues if they are generated from a higher use, so the debate is now on as to what constitutes ‘a higher use’. The way it is currently structured has been interpreted to be a higher value use, and as a result the industry has not been able to access the renewable energy certificates in the way it would like. But it is now seeking to do so.
I can tell you that there is a proposed native forest furnace in the southern forests of Tasmania at Southwood. There is a proposal for one in north-west Tasmania. Gunns had a proposal for a native-forest-burning furnace at its pulp mill in the Tamar Valley. There is a proposal for one at Orbost, in Victoria. There is one proposed for Eden as well, and the one at Eden is already in the planning process. The promoters of that native-forest-burning furnace are saying that it is critical to them to access the renewable energy certificates as part of the RET.
If there is any suggestion at all that the logging industry can get a lifeline for continuing logging native forests in the absence of a market by achieving access to the RET then it needs to be knocked on the head immediately, and that is why I have moved these amendments. If we are serious about climate change, we need to now say that in the absence of any market we need to transition people out of native forests into working in the plantation estate. That does not mean that people lose their jobs; it means that people transition out of one type of forestry into a different type of forestry.
We have been facilitating that transition with millions and millions of dollars for a very long time. Into the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement, for example, $72 million was poured, in order to help people get out of the high conservation value forests. We have had millions poured in, right around the country—in fact, $250 million went, as the Community Forest Agreement, to Tasmania. And it is an utter and absolute disgrace that Forestry Tasmania so badly manages the forest estate in Tasmania that they have made a loss. They have no cash at all, and so they have dipped into the Commonwealth funds that were put into the Community Forest Agreement. They have dipped into it for cash reserves because they have got none. Their cash at the end of the financial year was something like $3.3 million, and there is no way they have got the money to pay back right now what they have dipped out of their Commonwealth grant. I have reported this to the federal minister. I have reported it to the Auditor-General. And I am very keen to know how it is that Forestry Tasmania can access specific grant money for operating expenses to give them a cash reserve because they cannot, it seems, get an overdraft for themselves.
So this industry is in crisis in Tasmania. It is in crisis in Victoria. It is in crisis right around the country. This is the opportunity to fix the problem, not to throw them yet another subsidy so that they can just keep limping along, because governments cannot continue to run a native forest industry in the absence of a market. And creating a market in renewable energy would be immoral at a time when we need to be protecting the carbon stores and the biodiversity and transitioning to that plantation estate.
That is why this is a crucial amendment—to make sure that this cannot be exploited as a loophole and a make-work program. And it is not a figment of my imagination. Just have a listen to what the industry players had to say on The 7.30 Report last week—that that plant at Eden depends on this. But also, in the pulp and paper strategy that the government released recently, it said that the native forest industry depends on getting native-forest-burning furnaces up. This REC will be part of doing that, and it will be a wreck for biodiversity and for any hope of achieving a solution.
Right now the conservation movement and the timber industry are sitting down and trying to find a way to a 100 per cent solution to this issue, and if this is not removed from the REC now then this will continue to be there as an opportunity to undermine the solution that is within our reach. So this is critical. We need to be doing it right now. And that is why I am moving this critical amendment that takes away any loophole or lack of clarity and removes biomass from native forest vegetation as an eligible renewable energy source.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2010-06-22,"—I was not going to participate in this but I could not resist the opportunity to come down and put an alternative to the view that we do not admit native forest offcuts, sawdust or by-products into renewable energy. What do we do with those? Do we bury them? Do we tip them down the creek? How do we get rid of them? When you have a sawmill, when you saw logs, the by-product is sawdust. You cannot escape it—well, there probably is one way you can escape it: you do not have timber. These propositions that Senator Milne has put up have to be answered, because they are so unreliable and so stupid that someone has to put up some opposition to them.
I can recall that, maybe a year ago, a friend of mine had a sawmill at a place called Allies Creek. It was a beautiful little turnout: 14 or 15 houses, a community hall, and 60 to 70 jobs. He was shut down. Some of the people who worked for him, the saw doctors, were on $60,000 a year. One ended up counting koala bears. No-one worried whether there were any koala bears there, but they had to find him a job, so it was, ‘Go out and count koala bears.’ He was degraded. People who had been very proud of what they did were so degraded that they were put on a job that had no meaning. Their self-confidence was destroyed. Their jobs were destroyed. Their way of life was destroyed.
The by-product of that—of closing down that 60-job sawmill—was that there were about five acres, two football fields, which had to be dug up and the sawdust and log shavings had to be buried. That would have run a generator—I forget for how long; for six months or something like that. But, no—it had to be destroyed; it had to be buried. I do not know what the CO2 footprint was for burying that sawdust and those timber offcuts but they covered an area about the size of two football fields.
We have to approach this issue with some balance. There does not seem to have been any consideration by the Labor Party, and certainly not by the Greens, for the jobs of these blue-collar workers. They are completely expendable, according to the Greens. They do not even consider them. ‘Don’t worry, we’ll send the boys out to count kangaroos or koalas,’ or to paint rocks or do something that is meaningless and mentally destroys them. Those are the implications in some of the amendments that Senator Milne is moving. They have to be answered in the Senate. We cannot just let Senator Milne get up and make wild accusations that will lead to the continued loss of jobs without answering them. The answer, Senator Milne, is: what do you do with the by-product of timber? You just do not leave it there; it has to be destroyed or put somewhere. Do you put it in the ground at great extra cost? I would think that pushing tractors and diggers around would increase the level of CO2 emissions. I think these issues have to be ventilated and I hope, as I look to our spokesman on this, we will not be supporting these amendments. Senator Birmingham, can you—

(Senator Boyce)—Make your comments through the chair, please, Senator Boswell.
—Through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, I ask Senator Birmingham, and he confirms that we will not be stupid enough to support amendments like these.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-06-22,"—Like Senator Boswell I need to put on the record some comments in relation to what Senator Milne has said and, most disappointingly, in relation to some of the misinformation that she has put about with regard to the forest industry, where the industry is at, what might be possible and what products should and could be used in the timber coming out of Australia’s forests.
Senator Milne quite frequently gets up in various forums and in this chamber to talk about the volume of plantation wood that exists and its capacity to take the place of native forests. That completely ignores the fact that a lot of Australia’s plantations have not been managed for sawlogs. They have not been managed to provide the high-quality timbers that Australia needs and continues to use for a range of things, such as the veneers that go into making the fine furniture in this place, the timber for our homes, fine flooring and things of that nature. These are high-quality-value products that are only able to be derived from Australia’s native forests. It is important that we get full value out of all the product ranges that come out of our native forests. For Senator Milne to assert that we can just move everybody out of the native forest industry to the plantation industry is just plain dishonest. It is not true; it cannot be done. Our plantations have not been managed for those types of quality timber, and they need to be.
When you look at what else is going on, you need to look at things such as the ongoing biodiversity of Australia’s forests. If we want to convert large areas of Australia’s native forests to plantation, which we will have to do if we are to have the supply, Senator Milne should push on with what she is doing. But that is not what we want to do. In Tasmania, we have the quite extraordinary situation where Senator Milne and Senator Bob Brown talk about the destruction forever of Tasmania’s native forests, and for that matter the native forests around the rest of the country. They say that these forests have been destroyed forever and that those that are left must be protected. Yet the really confounding thing is that, in Tasmania right now, 28-year-old regrowth forests that have been regrown from clear-fell and burn operations are now being claimed by the Greens and their friends as high conservation value forests that should be protected.
When you really look at that, what you understand is that the quality of the forestry management in Tasmania is of such a high standard that they are regenerating high conservation value forests, or forests that the Greens would like to claim as being of high conservation value. That can give the Australian community real confidence that the management processes of Australia’s forest industries, particularly in Tasmania but those in other states as well, is of such a standard that, when they get to the age of 28 years, the Greens now claim them as being of high conservation value, even though in their own language they were ‘destroyed forever’ by the forest industry when they were clear felled and burned. The inconsistencies in the arguments put forward by the Greens are plain for everybody to see.
If biomass were to come on stream in Australia, the industry estimates that 3,000 gigawatt hours could be generated from the existing waste that exists today, without transferring from any other product—that is, without touching another tree, without touching another single branch or leaf. So there is enormous capacity to generate energy at a reasonable cost, which is one of the issues that we face in this, by utilising the existing waste. We are not talking about conversion from other uses. Senator Milne tries to put this up as a saviour for the native forest industry. That is not what they are looking for. They want to use the existing waste. Yes, there have been proposals around the country for a number of years to generate energy at places like Southwood and the north-west coast of Tasmania, because there is a significant amount of wood waste from forestry operations in those regions. Rather than burning it in the open and creating a smoke problem, which the Greens and their friends all ring the local radio about on a regular basis, why not use it to generate energy at a reasonable rate? It just makes sense.
When you look at that use in comparison to, say, burning coal, you find that coal generates something like 955 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour. This information comes from the WWF, from a brochure they have been using in Europe. Europe has a 15 per cent of energy target from biomass by 2020; they are talking about generating 15 per cent of their entire energy from biomass by 2020. There are 35 times fewer CO2 emissions over the lifecycle from using biomass rather than coal. Here we have the capacity to use a product that is significantly cleaner and is a renewable energy source, yet the misinformation and the misrepresentation of our forestry industries by the Greens is just outlandish. It is just ridiculous when, having said that these forests were destroyed by forestry operations, they then come back 28 years later and claim them as high conservation value forests. The hypocrisy of this is just extraordinary and it needs to be exposed for what it is.

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2010-06-22,"—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-06-22,"—No, I reject that entirely. We are dealing with an increase in activity from asylum seekers departing by boat from both Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Both of those movements are largely driven by the dislocation and the internal strife in both Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. The largest refugee-producing country in the world at the moment is Afghanistan. Their people are seeking refuge all round the world. We are getting, I think, in the order of 1½ to two per cent of those seeking refuge.
—We used to not get any under the Howard government.
—Senator Brandis, you keep saying that but it is actually not true. Repeating an untruth may make you feel comfortable but the reality is that that is not true. The number of boats steadily increased during last years of the Howard government.
The point I make is that Indonesia is a transit country that has been utilised by a lot of people seeking asylum in Australia and elsewhere. We are working very closely with Indonesian authorities. We are getting very good cooperation from Indonesian police. There have been a large number of disruptions and a large number of arrests. The Indonesian government have now committed to making people smuggling a criminal offence. That legislation is vital to the fight against people smugglers. At the moment it is very hard for Indonesian authorities to hold people smugglers because there is no specific people-smuggling charge.
We expect that legislation to be a huge boon for us in the fight against people smuggling in Indonesia. As I say, we are getting good cooperation. There have been a lot of disruptions. There is one man currently on trial in Australia who was extradited and another is about to be extradited. So we are working closely with them to combat this problem. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-06-22,"—On the basis of the assertion of Senator Williams one would have to maintain that Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Germany and France are all weak in combating people smuggling because they all receive tens of thousands of persons seeking asylum. We receive a small proportion of the total persons seeking asylum around the world every year.
People seek asylum not because of what is occurring in destination countries but because of what is occurring in their own countries. They are the people who seek asylum. When they come to Australia they get assessed against the refugee convention. If they are refugees, they are provided protection; if they are not, they are returned home. We have very rigorous systems which make those decisions. Those who are owed protection are given it. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-06-22,"—The logic of the assertion by Senator Williams is that the Howard government was weak on border security because in 1999 it had 3,700 people arrive, in 2000 it had 2,900 people arrive and in 2001 it had 5,516 people arrive. The logic of the assertion is that if you have people arrive then you are weak on border security. So not only was the Howard government weak on border security but Great Britain is weak on border security, Canada is weak on border security, the United States is weak on border security, France is weak on border security and Italy is weak on border security.
It is a nonsense. It is an argument put forward by the opposition for what they see as political advantage. But they know that the reality of the irregular movement of people around the world is an international problem that is driven by source countries and the internal strife in those countries. That is the problem we have to work with our neighbours to combat. We are doing so. As with all of our neighbours, we are very committed to that. (Time expired).

As I said yesterday, the agreement that has been reached between Telstra and NBN Co. will be remembered as the moment the Australian government and the industry joined together to revolutionise the telecommunications sector in this country. The agreement, once finalised, will mean that Telstra will be involved in the NBN build. It will mean that the build is more efficient, cheaper and quicker, with less use of overhead cable. The agreement will also provide a greater level of certainty for all players in the industry on the pathway forward towards a genuinely competitive telecommunications sector—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—Senator Cormann!
—where all providers receive genuine, equivalent access. Yesterday in this place, Senator Cormann claimed that this is not a real agreement—
—It isn’t.
—and, by implication, that Telstra was trying to spin this announcement. That is what you said. This is an outrageous claim, without basis or credibility. The government, Telstra and NBN Co. made it abundantly clear in the announcement that this was a financial heads of agreement and that there was still further work to be done.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! You are chewing up question time with interjections. Interjections are disorderly; you know that. It has been drawn to your attention already, Senator Cormann. If you want to participate in the debate at the end, there is time at the end of question time to debate the answers.
—In its media release yesterday, Telstra indicated that, while there were some outstanding issues to resolve before this progresses to completion, ‘we believe the proposed transaction is in the best interests of shareholders’. That was signed by David Thodey and Catherine Livingstone. Yesterday Telstra CEO David Thodey was quoted as saying, ‘For two institutions like Telstra and the government to enter into a heads of agreement, we do not do that lightly. We do it with the intention of concluding it.’ (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-06-22,"—Those opposite continue to try to suggest and imply—because it suits their political agenda—that Telstra is engaging in market manipulation. The agreement announced yesterday takes us one step closer to delivering a high-speed broadband platform and the structural reform the sector needs to drive genuine competition. This is what the NBN will deliver. The agreement provides us a clear, more certain pathway to this outcome. As Michael Malone, the CEO of iiNet—one of Telstra’s major competitors in fixed-line broadband markets—has said:
From our initial examination of yesterday’s announcement, the agreement is consistent with the Federal Government’s earlier commitments of an open access network, structural separation and regulatory reform.
It also means less unnecessary duplication of infrastructure—something that Senator Joyce yesterday just did not seem to be able to grasp. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-06-22,"—The Rudd government has a clear plan for Australia’s broadband future that now has widespread support across the industry. On the other hand, the opposition has said they will shut down the NBN. Today the Age editorial said:
Building the NBN is a visionary task whose historic significance will outstrip even that of infrastructure projects such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme …
Unfortunately, as the Age also notes:
A grasp of how the NBN might transform Australian life seems, however, to have eluded Opposition Leader Tony Abbott …
Australians, present and future, deserve better from the alternative government. The opposition’s continued failure to understand the importance of broadband would wreak havoc with Australia’s economic future. (Time expired)

Resources, Energy and Tourism Portfolio 17 June 2010

Topic:
    
 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Montara Incident


Hansard Page:
    
 22-24


Supplementary questions from Senator SIEWERT:

Could the Minister confirm whether all the wells in Australia that have been cemented by the company that was responsible for the cementing of the well with regard to Montara, and is reported to be the same company that did the BP well in the Gulf of Mexico, been audited by the relevant authorities?
The Australian Government has implemented a range of measures following the Montara and Gulf of Mexico incidents. The Government:
Initiated an Inquiry into the uncontrolled hydrocarbon release from the Montara Wellhead Platform that occurred from 21 August—3 November 2009. Commissioner David Borthwick AO PSM, delivered his report arising from the Inquiry to the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson AM MP, on 18 June 2010. The Inquiry was conducted on a “no-blame” basis under the powers of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006.
Requested the Northern Territory Government (as the delegated Designated Authority) to undertake a review of the status of wells suspended by PTTEP at the Montara Wellhead Platform;
Requested all Designated Authorities to undertake a compliance review of existing well approvals;
Developed and introduced amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act which are currently before the Parliament. These amendments will enhance the safety and integrity regulation for offshore petroleum activities; and
Commenced an internal government review of the findings and recommendations arising from the US Department of the Interior’s report on increased safety measures for energy development on the outer continental shelf, for relevance for Australian legislation and regulations.
In addition the National Offshore Petroleum Authority (NOPSA) has increased its focus, in safety case assessments and through its inspection of drilling rigs, on issues arising from the Montara incident. NOPSA has urged Australian titleholders and rig operators to learn from the initial key safety recommendations made by US authorities in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico incident, including in relation to well control equipment (both surface and subsea), review all rig drilling/casing/completion practices and review all emergency shutdown and dynamic positioning procedures that interface with emergency well control operations.
Companies operating in Australia are reviewing their operations to ensure that there are no further incidents. A number of them have already implemented actions in relation to their activities in Australia and worldwide. This includes reviews of well plans, drilling processes, blow-out contingency plans, testing frequencies and training of personnel.
The Montara Commission of inquiry is reporting to the minister for resources tomorrow. When will the government be releasing the report to the public for public review?
Commissioner David Borthwick AO PSM, delivered his report arising from the Montara Commission of Inquiry to the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson AM MP, on 18 June 2010.
The Minister will properly consider the findings and recommendations of the report and act promptly and appropriately on them.
Prior to releasing the report publicly the Minister is bound to take advice to ensure that in the handling of this report he does nothing to prejudice the conduct of further investigations for possible offences including criminal offences, other civil or criminal action, or undermine any natural justice considerations.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,9,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-06-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Williams today, relating to asylum seekers.
There is nothing sadder than the sight of a desperate government deeply in denial, and in all the mishaps, the bungling and the incompetence that have characterised the brief tenure of the Rudd government there is no area of policy in which the Rudd government is more deeply in denial than the catastrophic failure of its border protection policy. In no area has there been a more catastrophic failure than the fiasco of the Rudd government’s border protection policy.
Let us go back to where we stood in August 2008 immediately before Senator Evans announced the weakening of the Howard government’s policies that had kept our borders secure for the last six years of that government. Do you know, Mr Deputy President, how many people were detained at the Christmas Island detention centre at that time? There were five. Do you know how many there are now? The Christmas Island detention centre is over capacity. There are more than 2,500, and others have had to be transported to the Australian mainland, because our borders are out of control. And yet, as we saw in his answers to Senator Williams’s question today, Senator Evans continues to deny that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the weakening of those policies in August 2008 and the tremendous upsurge in the number of unauthorised boat arrivals in the two years since. In the last five years of the Howard government, after tough policies were introduced in 2001, the average number of unauthorised boat arrivals fell from a high number before the coalition government of the day introduced tough policies down to three per year.
—Inhumane policies!
—Three per year! That was the situation the Rudd government inherited. After the tough policies came a phoney humanitarianism, Senator Pratt, which encourages women and children onto hazardous seas and puts them in the hands of people smugglers. After those policies were repealed in the name of a phoney humanitarianism the number of unauthorised boat arrivals skyrocketed. In the 2½-year life of the Rudd government there have now been 139 boat arrivals—an average in this calendar year of more than three per week. In the last five years of the Howard government there were three per year—a 50-fold increase. Senator Evans—no friend or supporter of Mr Kevin Rudd’s, as we all know—who has to bear the rap for these policies in this chamber, tried to persuade us that there was no cause-and-effect relationship between these two things. For five years the number of boat arrivals had flatlined. The policy was changed and suddenly there was an upward spike.
It is getting worse because of the signals that have been sent to the people smugglers. In the 12 months of calendar year 2009 there were 71 unauthorised boat arrivals. So far—not quite halfway through calendar year 2010—there have been 61 boat arrivals already. It is nothing more than denial for the government to say that there is no relationship between the softening of the policies, as they have done, and the surge in boat arrivals. In fact, the government’s own conduct by postponing the assessment of Sri Lankan and Afghan asylum seekers gives the lie to the argument that pull factors are not relevant. They themselves have sought to adjust their policy belatedly, too late in the piece. It has not worked because, as in so many other things, the Rudd government lacks the policy courage to do tough things. The Howard government was criticised roundly by certain sections of the community because its policies did have a hard edge. They had to have a hard edge, because all effective deterrents do. But those policies worked just as surely as the Rudd government’s policies have failed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,11,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2010-06-22,"—Senator Brandis indicated that he thought that there was nothing sadder than—
—A government in denial!
—a government in denial, yes. Thank you, Senator Brandis. He felt there was nothing sadder than a government in denial. I think there is something sadder.
—This government is in serious denial.
—Senator Cormann, I think there is something sadder than a government in denial. What I think is sadder than a government in denial, Senator Brandis, is when a former Liberal prime minister is forced to quit his party because of the policies which that party is adopting. I refer to a brilliant article in the Age—a great Australian newspaper—yesterday.
—How is this taking note of an answer by a minister?
—I am taking note of what Senator Brandis had to say. He said that there is nothing sadder than a government in denial.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I know relevance is broadly interpreted for the purposes of these debates, but Senator Farrell has told the chamber that he is taking note of my remarks. That is not the question before the chair. The question before the chair is that the Senate take note of the answers of Senator Evans to Senator Williams, not what I may have said earlier in the debate.
—Order! Senator Brandis, you are trying a point of order on a technicality, but the nature of debate is that people on either side respond to the comments that are made by the other side. I think that Senator Farrell is only responding to comments that you may have made as part of the debate to take note of answers.
—Mr Deputy President, as a fellow South Australian, I thank you for your protection of me from Senator Brandis. What the former—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Brandis was heard almost in silence. I suggest you give Senator Farrell a fair hearing on his side of the chamber.
—You are perfectly right, Deputy President. Senator Brandis was heard in silence and we would seek the same courtesy.
—What did you call John Howard?
—I would like to be heard in silence from my side as well. The resignation of former Prime Minister Fraser was very sad. As I do not want to quote him out of context, I will read this from the article in the Age:
… he hopes his resignation will send a message to the party to shape up and stay true to its core values.
When I first came to this chamber I was taught that there was at least one liberal Liberal left, and that was Senator Brandis. That is what I understood from what my colleagues told me. That is what even some of my Liberal colleagues—I have a couple of them—said. I always thought that there was one liberal Liberal left, so I was very disappointed with you, Senator Brandis, when you adopted the comments—

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Senator Brandis, civility is not a sign of weakness in debates. Can you please listen to me in silence—the same courtesy I gave to you?
Let us go back to former Prime Minister Fraser. This is a direct quote from him yesterday, as reported in the Age:
I believe playing politics with the lives of vulnerable people, seeking votes out of their misfortune, is about the worst thing any politician can do in any country in any part of the world …
The article goes on to say:
He later told reporters—
after, I think, he had opened an immigration program—
the coalition’s immigration policy, which includes the resurrection of the so-called Pacific Solution, had played a role in his decision to hand in his Liberal life membership.
So he has not only resigned from the party for which he was Prime Minister from 1975 to 1983; he has handed back his life membership of the Liberal Party. If that is not an indication of a former Prime Minister’s view about the policies of the opposition then I do not know what is.
As I said before, there is something sadder than a government that is in denial, and it is when somebody like former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has to resign from his own party to make the point that your policies on immigration are wrong. They are unfair, they are uncompassionate and they need to be changed.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—And it is people like you, Senator Brandis, who ought to be doing the changing. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2010-06-22,"—Doesn’t it say a lot about the Labor Party’s position on this matter that, when asked to justify its failed border protection policy, it defends itself by quoting the views of a man who was Prime Minister 30 years ago? The fact is that today, in 2010, Australians are losing confidence in your policies and in the approach you are taking to border protection.
Today in question time we heard from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, the old view that the fact that the boats are arriving in such large numbers is just a coincidence. He claims that it has nothing to do with their policies and nothing to do with their announced change of policy in 2008, immediately after which the boats began to arrive in significant numbers. He claims: ‘It has nothing to do with that. We are the victims of international circumstances. Those circumstances have conspired to change and to suddenly thrust all of these people onto boats and to cross the sea to Australia’s northern shores.’ I am sorry, but Australians do not believe that.
In recent opinion polls, Australians have demonstrated very clearly that they have lost confidence. They have not lost confidence in international security arrangements or in peacekeeping efforts in different parts of the world, but they have lost confidence in the Rudd government’s border protection policies because those policies are the ones that are now letting Australians down and failing to contain a problem of truly significant proportions to Australia’s border security. The fact is that in 2001, when the Howard government changed the settings on unlawful arrivals, we saw a change in the number of boat arrivals. The number plummeted. As Senator Brandis indicated, we went from hundreds of boat arrivals down to just a trickle—to three or so a year—for the next six years. That, we were told, was a coincidence. International conditions, we were told, had changed sufficiently to allow the boat numbers to reduce. But, in August 2008, the government again changed the policy. It softened the border protection policy in order to, in its own words, make it more compassionate. The boat arrivals began to surge again but, apparently, that was another coincidence. International circumstances had conspired to make people board the boats once again.
Never mind the fact that in 2001 there were more than 12 million refugees classified in the world by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2008, when this surge began again, there were less than 10½ million refugees around the world and many of the regional conflicts which had characterised previous years, such as in places like East Timor, the Solomon Islands and so on, had ceased to take place. Notwithstanding those facts, somehow the surge has begun again. The point is that we know that the government’s policies have led directly to that surge and so does the government, because the government tried a few weeks ago to change its own policy by announcing a freeze on the processing of Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers—coincidentally, the nationalities from which the most boat arrivals were coming. The signal was: ‘Don’t come here. We are not going to process any Afghan or Sri Lankan arrivals, so there is no point coming to Australia.’ Of course, that policy failed spectacularly within days of being announced. Since April, when that was announced, 33 boats have come and 1,492 arrivals, and counting, have taken place. It is a clear indication that this government has lost control of its policies.
The fact is that the questions asked by Senator Williams in question time today demonstrate very eloquently the attitude of people smugglers and their clients to Australia’s present open-door policy. It is that attitude, it is that perception of what the policy is, which is driving the business of those people smugglers. They can go to people in places like Indonesia and beyond and say, ‘We have something for you. We can get you into Australian waters and you’ll be taken into custody and you will get residency in Australia.’ That is the product they are selling. This government’s policy, to its shame, builds in a role for those people smugglers, it builds in a role for their product, and that is why we have seen this surge in boat arrivals. Do not insult the intelligence of Australians, senators opposite, by telling us that it is just a coincidence, that international push factors are causing this. Try changing your policy—and you know all about that; you are very good at changing your policy. Do not get too smug and complacent about what you are doing now, Senator Pratt. You could well be facing a backflip on this policy very soon. You know very well that this policy is what is driving these boat arrivals and that is what needs to change.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,11,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-06-22,"—Senators opposite have argued using simplistic statistics. The peaks and troughs in boat arrivals fail to account for international people movements—movements of refugees driven by international movements of people. Referencing the Leader of the Senate’s answers to the Senate, what is most telling is that we are getting just a tiny fraction of those people who are seeking to flee countries in conflict. A tiny fraction of those people are making their way to our shores. Britain, Germany and France get tens of thousands of refugees. Are you saying they are weak on border protection? Is that what you are arguing? Britain, Germany and France are confronted with a significant problem.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I think you are trying to argue that they are weak. But they simple fact is that those countries and Australia recognise that, if those people are refugees, they deserve our protection. If they are vulnerable children who are refugees, they deserve our protection.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—You want weak? Look at the number of people who arrived under Prime Minister Howard. This is not a rhetorical debate. It is about strong border protection. It is about this government’s proactive agenda on border protection. It has been about the deterrence of people smugglers. It has been about cooperation with our neighbours. It has been about working to resolve and improve the situation on the ground. It is why we have armed forces in Afghanistan and it is why when genuine refugees come to Australia seeking asylum they should be granted it.
—What’s compassionate about letting women and children drown on the high seas?
—Let us not talk about how many people have drowned under whose watch—shameful! Since taking office the Rudd government has implemented a big reform agenda, a necessary reform agenda, by dismantling the Pacific solution; abolishing unjust temporary protection visas; introducing fairer work rights and arrangements for asylum seekers in the community; increasing the size of Australia’s humanitarian program; introducing fairer arrangements for asylum seekers on Christmas Island, including independent review of decisions; providing access to migration advice; and abolishing the ineffective system of imposing charges upon immigration detainees.
I am proud of the values that this government has expressed in its immigration policies and its border protection policies—things like assisting Sri Lanka to resolve its conflict on the ground. There is no solution for any of us unless we can resolve the conflict on the ground. As I said, that is why we are in Afghanistan and it is why we are on the ground in Sri Lanka helping it through its period of transition as it rebuilds following two decades of terrible military conflict which we all saw intensify over the previous couple of years. Indeed, that conflict saw a big increase in the number of people seeking to flee Sri Lanka and in turn an increase in the number of people seeking to come to our shores.
I am pleased to say that progress is being made in tackling the challenging task of resettling hundreds of thousands of displaced citizens and rehabilitating their communities. This is important work and it is ultimately at the heart of the kinds of bipartisan solutions that this parliament should be looking for on the question of border protection and asylum seekers. I am tired of the politicking by those opposite. They seek to gain at the expense of ordinary people.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,11,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2010-06-22,"—When Labor senators on the other side throw around statistics, they need to be very, very careful because statistics do not lie. Mr McClelland was asked in the parliament on 11 June: ‘How many children does the Labor Party currently have in detention behind bars?’ Do you know what the answer was? Was it higher than the 21 that were in detention when the coalition left office in 2007? Yes, it was. The answer was this: ‘Currently’—because the figure might have changed by the time he got back to his office—‘the Labor Party has 528 children behind bars.’ That is a complete failure of their border protection policies.
Despite its protestations, despite the hysterics coming from the other side and despite what it says are very tough words, the Labor Party does not have the moral ground when it comes to border protection. That is owned by the coalition, let me assure you. Under the soft approach to border protection employed by Mr Rudd, over 6,300 people have now risked their lives trying to get to this country. There is nothing humanitarian about implementing policies that encourage people, including women and children, to risk their lives to come to this country.
This is what the Labor Party does not want to tell the people of Australia and what it is afraid the people of Australia may find out: that under coalition governments Australia has a very strong and proud history of refugee resettlement. When the last coalition government was in power do you know how many refugees we resettled in Australia? We resettled in excess of 100,000 refugees and, when we get back into government shortly, we will continue to be committed to supporting Australia’s generous intake of refugees.
The major difference between us and those on the other side is that, for the betterment of this country and for the safety of women, children and families who may well seek to put their lives at risk, we believe in a fair and orderly immigration process for those coming to this country. What Mr Rudd again forgets to tell the people of Australia is that for every place that is given to a refugee who has come here unlawfully we have to say to those refugees who have done the right thing, ‘I’m sorry, mate, but someone else who did the wrong thing has taken your place in Australia.’
The coalition is very proud to stand by its commitment to priority being given to those who are offshore and who have done the right thing. Those who are in the United Nations refugee camps do not have US$10,000, US$15,000 or US$20,000 to pay to people smugglers, who, let us recall, Mr Rudd called the vilest form of human life. They do not have that money. They have nothing. They seek to do the right thing when coming to this country. Mr Rudd and the Labor Party are only interested in scoring cheap political points to deflect from their gross failure in border protection. There is no doubt that the boats will keep coming unless we elect a coalition government.

In relation to Senator Brown’s specific matters about lack of consultation, we did not realise this course of action was going to be open to us until just after question time.

Senator Ludlam, in fairness, indicated he was not supportive of this taking place in any event but if it was a matter that was going to take place he would wish to speak to the motion. This is the only way we can fit this in this week and that is why we have done this. We gave the Greens as much advance warning as we gave the government and as we had ourselves. You will probably see that I have just hastily written out the notice of motion that I have just read to the chamber.

That the Senate notes that:
the Industry Skills Councils (ISCs) are independent, not for profit companies funded by the Federal Government to fulfil various skills and training‑related policy and program responsibilities;
the Rudd Government has boosted public funding and scope for those ISCs significantly, including a:
$83.2 million funding boost in 2008-09 increasing operational funding for ISCs under the 2008‑2011 funding agreement to $118.9 million,
allocation of several hundred thousands of dollars in 2009 to the Construction and Property Services Industry Skills Council to develop the home insulation training package,
$40 million funding allocation in 2010-11 for the Enterprise Based Productivity Places Program,
$19.9 million funding allocation in 2010-11 for the Smarter Apprenticeships Program, and
$2.3 million funding allocation in 2010-11 to revise and rewrite training packages as part of the National Green Skills Agreement;
none of the funding is allocated by open competitive tender, with any competition limited to ISCs between each other for some of the government funding;

They are private companies, and as such they are not directly subject to the scrutiny of the Senate—for example, through Senate estimates. As an example, there has been an $83.2 million funding boost in direct operational funding for industry skills councils as well as funding which may be administered and not totally be for industry skills councils, such as the $40 million funding allocation for the Enterprise Based Productivity Places Program; however, it is industry skills councils as private companies that are administering that funding on behalf of the Commonwealth.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-06-22,"—To put this debate in some context I will read two quotes. In 2007, prior to the federal election, Kevin Rudd said that government advertising was:
… a sick cancer within our system. It’s a cancer on democracy.
Another quote from the Prime Minister, in November 2007 at a doorstop press conference, was:
I can guarantee that we will have a process in place, run by the Auditor-General ... In terms of establishing the office of the Auditor-General, with clear cut guidelines to whom every television campaign is submitted for approval before that television campaign is implemented, you have my absolute 100 per cent guarantee that that will occur—100 per cent guarantee. And each one of you here can hold me accountable for that.
This is a broken pre-election promise from a man who described advertising as ‘a sick cancer within our system’ and ‘a cancer on democracy’.
In the time available to me I want to very quickly talk about the legacy of this government in the context of the resource super profits tax advertising campaign. If you look through this government’s 2½-year legacy you will see that it simply does not deserve to be re-elected. Let us go through some of these matters. There are the obvious ones, such as: $100 million a day borrowed to fund poor economic management; a budget deficit of $60 billion; house fires and tragic deaths from its failed Home Insulation Program; the Building the Education Revolution debacle—$1.5 billion over budget and $5 billion wasted; and an illegal immigrant program in tatters with illegal immigrants arriving in their thousands and no slowdown in the activities of people smugglers. They are the obvious, in-your-face matters for this government. Under the surface bubbles a lack of transparency and a lack of openness that will define this government and in my view will ultimately lead to its quite rightful downfall.
I want to go on to the question of government advertising. I want to talk about the changes that were made by this government. I remind honourable senators of the context that I gave this debate and the context of the Prime Minister’s comments. I want to reacquaint honourable senators with the changes that were made in relation to exemptions to advertising campaigns. Under the Auditor-General, as we know, the guidelines for the use of this exemption by the minister were for ‘national emergency, extreme urgency or other extraordinary reasons’. After having reinforced and put in place proposals in relation to government advertising and the Auditor-General in 2008, this government changed those rules this year. They put in place weakened guidelines, according to the Auditor-General and also, interestingly, the man who reviewed these guidelines, recommended the changes and—remarkably—is ultimately making the decisions. But that is another matter. In his testimony to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit last week, Mr Allan Hawke noted that when he was reviewing the 2008 guidelines he felt that the ‘extraordinary reasons’ in the exemption provision did not take into account the historical position of the Australian Electoral Commission. Historically, although it is an FMA Act agency, the Australian Electoral Commission has traditionally been exempted from having to go through external vetting processes. So rather than creating another specific exemption, Mr Hawke recommended a change in the general exemption provision. That was replicated in the new guidelines—the 2010 guidelines—which then changed the reasons for an exemption to ‘national emergency, extreme urgency or other compelling reasons’.
That there was a change from ‘extraordinary reasons’ to ‘compelling reasons’ was not in any way justified by the government. There is no definition of ‘compelling reasons’. As I said, the Auditor-General has constantly stated that these changes represented a softening of the guidelines and, notably, Dr Hawke has subsequently stated that it was not his intention to have such advertising as the mining tax campaign encapsulated in the compelling reasons rule. The man himself who recommended these changes was only assuming that they would be changed to allow the continuation of the AEC’s previous exemption from external review.
I just want to give an exchange during that committee meeting:
Mr GEORGIOU—… Did you envisage that an advertising campaign on mining and promoting the government’s position on mining was of the same order or the same quality?
Dr Hawke—I did not, no.
                …            …            …
Mr GEORGIOU—… Did you anticipate that your notion of ‘compelling’ would be as elastic as to embrace an advertising campaign designed to combat the so-called misinformation by the mining lobby?
Dr Hawke—… I did not anticipate that this might be used in the way it has …
That is from the mouth of the man who was responsible for changing these rules. He has said that this duplicitous government has actually bent his expectations of the change in the rule.
In the time left open to me, I will turn to the very interesting part—the events of two weeks ago. As we know, the government’s new committee looked at this so-called mining tax advertising campaign once—on 21 April. They met once in relation to this and there was no mention at all of the likelihood of the ministerial intervention by way of an exemption. Two days before the Treasurer wrote a letter to Senator Ludwig, there had been two advertisements in the West Australian. There was no other paid advertising from anyone in relation to the mining tax. But, despite that, the Treasurer wrote to the minister on the back of urgency or compelling reasons. So we got evidence at the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration last week, not evidence given during Senate estimates, that indeed the minister had signed a letter on 24 May granting the exemption that the minister had received from his department on 14 May—a brief containing draft letters to the Treasurer and a draft statement of reasons to accompany it which should have been tabled with the parliament. That was Monday, 24 May.
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration made a decision to hold the question of government advertising over to the Thursday morning. The minister was sitting at the table with these officials for at least 1½ days, and one presumably would have thought that at that stage he had advised them. We then learnt that the department themselves were only advised on the Thursday afternoon that the minister had made this decision and parliament was only advised on the 28th. Now there is only one reason for this. There is only one reason why this minister would have failed to tell his departmental officials. There is only one reason why this minister would have failed to tell the parliament and those who were attending Senate estimates: it was a complete and utter cover-up. The fix in relation to this exemption was on from 14 May. The fix was on on 24 May when the letter was signed, and the fix was really on when there was no mention of it until the following Friday—after Senate estimates in relation to this matter had finished. This is a government that no longer deserves government. It is a government where Operation Sunlight has been completely and utterly thrown out the window—where there is no accountability for the minister, the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, and no accountability whatsoever in relation to the activities of a government that does not deserve re-election.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2010-06-22,"—There is no question that the issues associated with political advertising are very important, but it is about time that the opposition, and in particular Senator Ronaldson, put away its confected outrage. Today’s contribution, verballing Dr Hawke as referring to ‘this duplicitous government’, is starting to get quite ridiculous. After about three minutes he did get to the substance of the motion but, in his reference in his introduction to Mr Rudd’s comments, he again faded well away from the truth. Yes, what occurred under the Howard government—which I will elaborate on later if I have sufficient time—was a sick cancer on democracy and, yes, we honoured our election commitments, but it is about time this opposition stopped hiding behind the independent review that occurred to try to claim we have not met our commitments on transparency and on political advertising.
Let us look at what Senator Ronaldson does not say. He does not say that in Senate estimates the Auditor-General, Ian McPhee, indicated very clearly that, in his view, the framework we have in place under the current guidelines—despite his concerns with those revised guidelines undertaken as a result of an independent review by Dr Hawke—is a significant improvement. There is no qualification and no moving away from it; it is a significant improvement. So what seems to be happening here is that, where the Rudd government acts and then responds to changed circumstances, this opposition continues to try to argue that original commitments have not been met. And let us just deal with the issue about changed circumstances, because that was also referred to in the opposition’s dissenting report into the Greens bill that we have also dealt with on this matter. In fact, quite a bit of attention was paid to the issue of the role of the Auditor-General in the advertising guidelines and, in fact, the change that occurred was your policy.
So on the one hand the opposition have one of very few limited positions or policies—and we have accommodated the concerns that have been raised not only by the opposition but by the independent review—and now they try to claim that we are not meeting our election commitments! I am sorry, Senator Ronaldson, but you cannot have it both ways. Senator Abetz will be following me with his contribution. We will hear him too try to have it both ways as we look at some of the detail about what did not occur under the Howard government and what he will try to justify now. Again, when I looked at the coalition senators’ response to the report of our Senate committee inquiry into the Greens bill on political advertising, it had a very interesting historical discussion. Senator Ronaldson talked about the fact that he wanted to reacquaint the Senate with this. Well, I think he ought to reacquaint some of his own senators with what happened under the 11½ years of the Howard government in this area.
The introduction to the coalition senators’ report refers to the fact that in 1998 the Auditor-General issued a set of draft guidelines for government advertising. This was not in response to the Howard government—and the Howard government continued to ignore them; they were ignored for the full period of the Howard government. However, the coalition senators seem to think that in this little historical discussion they can avoid addressing what they ignored for so many years. They go on to say that these guidelines were the subject of a review of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in 2000—but still no action by the Howard government—and that they were further revised in 2008 as government policy and revised again in March 2010. Well, that is the whole point: it took until 2008 until there was any government policy. Before that time, there was an enormous level of government expenditure on advertising—and it was completely unjustified, completely unreported and hidden.
One of the first things the Rudd government did was to abolish the Ministerial Committee for Government Communications and the Government Communications Unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This, of course, was the body that Senator Abetz chaired when he was the Special Minister of State, when government politicians and staff ran the government’s advertising. So it will be very interesting to hear how he justifies his activities during that period and indeed the present lack of any policy from the coalition on this matter.
I want to try and capture a brief summary of what occurred in the Howard government years. I need to pay tribute to Jason Koutsoukis, who in a piece on 2 September 2007 elaborated on the Howard government’s record on political advertising. He said:
Prime Minister John Howard has spent nearly $2 billion on government advertising and information campaigns since coming to power 11 years ago—
And this is possibly why Senator Joyce is confused about ‘millions’ and ‘billions’—
A Sunday Age investigation has found that just weeks from calling an election—
Remember, this is 2007—
the government has 18 advertising campaigns on the air …
Eighteen campaigns! He continued:
The Sunday Age investigation has also shown that since the last election in 2004, Mr Howard has spent a record $854 million of taxpayers’ money on government advertising.
                …            …            …
The record spending comes despite Mr Howard being elected on a pledge to cut it back.
In 1995, Mr Howard promised that if elected he would instruct the Commonwealth Auditor-General to draw up guidelines on appropriate use of taxpayers’ money for advertising. “There is clearly a massive difference between necessary government information for the community and blatant government electoral propaganda,” Mr Howard said at the time. “Propaganda should be paid for by political parties.”
Despite 11½ years in power, Mr Howard never instructed the Australian National Audit Office to inquire into government advertising. According to Melbourne University academic Sally Young, the author of Government Communication in Australia, the Howard Government’s spending on advertising is among the highest per head in the world. “It’s up there with only a few other countries,” she said.
This puts some broader context around the comments made by Senator Ludwig in question time today. The Rudd government’s expenditure in this area last year was one-third of the Howard government’s expenditure in 2007, and in 2009 it was one-half. The comparison is very stark and speaks for itself.
In my remaining time let me address the RSPT issues and the exemption matters. As Senator Ludwig highlighted, we make no apology whatsoever for defending the national economic interest against the scare campaign from some companies and from those opposite. This scare campaign could damage the economy and hurt working families, whom we strove so desperately to protect against the global financial crisis with a stimulus package. Do not forget that every government that has substantially reformed the tax system has engaged in a public information campaign, including those opposite—look at their advertising expenditure on the GST.
But let us go to the facts of this particular matter. We announced our tax package on 2 May and this campaign was funded in the budget on 11 May. Let us have a look at what happened, though, between those dates. One miner said his company was in trouble, but then he bought a million shares in it with his own money. Of course, we need to remind ourselves about Mr Peter Dutton’s own investments contrary to the complaints of the opposition. At the same time, Rio Tinto put a story in the paper about closing down all their projects and then rushed out a correcting statement before markets opened. And Mr Palmer claimed that he cancelled a South Australian project that did not even exist. This is why Mr Swan asked Senator Ludwig to allow us to bring the planned campaign forward—not to exempt it from scrutiny— (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-06-22,"—Federal Labor has reached a new low. Having promised so much and delivered so little, its backflip to run an unconscionable taxpayer-funded misinformation campaign is another example in the long list of broken Labor promises. To add insult to injury and like with so much else they do, Labor has not only embarked on a $38 million taxpayer-funded propaganda campaign but also rushed it and not consulted. Remember throughout all this that Mr Rudd gave this solemn commitment: government advertising was a cancer on the body politic of Australia that needed surgical removal.
So rushed was its desire for a taxpayer-funded campaign, Labor—through its Special Minister of State—crashed through and ignored its very own pathetically weak guidelines by invoking emergency powers. That is bad enough in itself. But—oh, what a tangled web we weave—having disingenuously claimed urgency and emergency, Labor then withheld this decision wilfully and deliberately from the parliament in an attempt to avoid the scrutiny of Senate estimates process.
Under Labor’s own weak rules, any decision by the Special Minister of State to bypass due process for advertising campaigns needs to be explained by a tabling statement to the parliament. Mr Swan asked for the exemption on 10 May. By 14 May the Special Minister of State had prepared for him a draft letter and a tabling statement. Yet the tabling statement was not tabled until 28 May, the very day after Senate estimates for the Special Minister of State had finished. It was just a coincidence, just serendipitous, according to Labor. In fact, the Treasurer was told a full four days earlier in an extensive two-page letter. Why not just table the letter to the Treasurer as the Special Minister of State’s reasons? It would have been pretty simple.
According to Senator Ludwig at the reconvened Senate estimates hearing forced upon him by the Senate, the letter was not tabled because he was ‘preparing the tabling statement’. When asked later whether he had been provided with a draft tabling statement, the minister said, ‘No, my office and I prepared the tabling statement.’ The minister was asked again, ‘There was no draft from the department?’ The department then intervened and exposed the attempted cover-up by confirming that there was a draft. So the minister did not prepare the statement—he may have finalised it but he did not draft it from scratch. Even more devastating for the hapless minister was when he said to the committee:
… I wanted to not just simply rubber-stamp the department’s draft statement but read it, reflect on it and then decide on what I should say in it. After all, it is my signature at the bottom of the page.
Let us examine this excuse and thereby expose it. Firstly, we were told the minister could not prepare the tabling statement because ‘it was estimates’, but that was before we found out he got the draft on 14 May. Estimates started on 24 May, so the minister had a full 10 days before estimates to consider his tabling statement. Secondly, when listening to the minister you would have thought his tabling statement was a like a High Court decision where the judge says how he has decided the case and will publish reasons later. The only problem was that his tabling statement was even shorter and contained even less information than his letter to the Treasurer. Thirdly, the copy of the tabling statement does not even bear the signature of the minister, which he said he had signed. So on top of his brief is this minister—oh, what a tangled web we weave.
The minister has got himself into a terrible mess. We are to believe that it took all of the minister’s mental acuity and unbridled intellect over 10 days to condense his own letter to the Treasurer into the statement to the parliament from 459 words and nine paragraphs into 180 words and seven paragraphs. Step aside, members of Mensa, and let Senator Ludwig through so we can give full acknowledgement to this unparalleled intellectual giant. This nation should be oh so thankful that we have such a gifted minister who can distil nine paragraphs into seven paragraphs in only 10 days. What wonderful intellectual prowess!
Just look at paragraph 2 of both the letter and the statement to get the full import of this expenditure of intellectual gravitas. First of all, in paragraph 2 of the letter the minister said:
In my capacity as Cabinet Secretary responsible for the guidelines, I can exempt advertising campaigns on the basis of national emergency, extreme urgency or other compelling reasons.
In just 10 days, and after harnessing all his intellectual fortitude, the minister was able to distil that paragraph into this:
As Cabinet Secretary, the campaign framework provides that I may exempt a campaign from compliance with the guidelines on the basis of a national emergency, extreme urgency or other compelling reason.
Can you imagine the mental anguish the minister went through to reflect and decide on how to make those wonderful changes? This is just sheer brilliance personified in none other than the Special Minister of State himself. This minister has a choice: he has either an intellectual deficit or an integrity deficit. I suspect no-one believes the minister’s explanation on pages 17 and 18 of the Hansard:
As I said in answer to your question, having written a letter to the Treasurer on 24 May and provided the reasons therein, I wanted to not just simply rubber-stamp the department’s draft statement but read it, reflect on it and then decide on what I should say in it. After all, it is my signature at the bottom of the page.
The tabled statement is shorter and provides even less explanation than the letter to the Treasurer. If it genuinely is the case that the minister needed 10 days from the draft, or even four days from the letter to the draft, he should not be the minister.
The reason for the delay in tabling was very simply a cynical attempt to avoid the scrutiny of this parliament. If you analyse this excuse that the minister needed to read, reflect and decide on what he should say, and then compare the letter to the Treasurer and his tabling statement, you will see that the statement is word for word but just a condensation of it. No extra reasons, no extra rationale, and no extra thought power went into this, and that is why the minister’s explanation falls so very, very hollow. And it provides the explanation to this parliament and to the Australian people why the tabling of this statement was deliberately withheld until the Senate estimates for the Special Minister of State were over. There was no reason that the minister needed four days—or, indeed 10 days—to redraft this statement. A junior in his office could have undertaken the task.
As I said before, this minister either has a huge intellectual deficit, if he claims that it did take him 10 days and a lot of thought and intellectual grunt to come to this statement, or there is a deficit in his explanation to this parliament; I fear the latter. The Labor Party, the Prime Minister and this Special Minister of State stand condemned.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Government Advertising</title>,Matters of Public Importance,34,1,speech
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-22,"—I rise today to again defend the state of Queensland and the $2 million worth of infrastructure funding that the resource super profits tax will bring to Queensland’s roads, rails and ports and to dispel the myth of Senator Parry’s MPI about ‘the Labor government’s decision to spend $38 million advertising their proposed new super tax’.
I find it entertaining that the opposition have the nerve to stand up in this chamber and make comments about the government’s consultation processes. On the one hand, if we do not make the public aware of our policies they say there is a lack of consultation. On the other hand, when we do share our information with our valued constituents, they say we are wasting taxpayer funds. I find that amazing, coming from a Liberal Party which spent $254 million in 2007 alone on their election campaign and an amazing $420 million to explain the GST in 2000. To put that into perspective, that is $420 million spent on explaining their GST as opposed to $38 million the government has approved for explaining our RSPT. The Howard government also spent $121 million of taxpayer funds to advertise Work Choices, a policy which hurt our working families and enabled employers to dismiss employees without a valid reason, to strip conditions from the award system, to place employees on woeful individual contracts, and the list goes on.
The Rudd government cares about our working families and how taxpayer funds are spent, and that is why we have cut expenditure on government advertising. In fact, in 2008 we spent a third of the amount that the Howard government spent in 2007. In 2009 we spent less than half the amount that the Howard government spent in 2007. We introduced guidelines on how taxpayer funds should be spent and principles as to how materials can be presented. These guidelines make sure that government advertising is authorised, properly targeted and non-political. This initiative is a far cry from the Howard government’s handling of their campaign funds, which did not have this type of scrutiny. When the opposition were in government they were able to produce campaign material which unashamedly endorsed the Liberal Party, and the ministers themselves approved campaigns.
This government makes no apologies for defending the future prosperity of this nation against a massive scare campaign funded by some companies and mining magnates like LNP funder Clive Palmer. By bringing this up in the chamber today, it shows that the opposition’s puppet strings are being pulled by Mr Palmer. It shows that they care more about their next campaign funding than the national economic interest. The opposition do not care that the RSPT will help working Australians increase the amount of money they will be retiring with, that it will provide vital infrastructure for our mining states and that it will provide a tax break for small businesses and an instant write-off on assets worth less than $5,000. In fact, representatives from the mining industry have acknowledged that they can pay more tax. On 3 June the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson said:
A number of major mining company CEOs have said to me, not just over the last couple of weeks, they all knew a tax reform package was coming, that they’ve had a good decade and they’re in a position to actually pay more tax.
The opposition has also pushed that the RSPT will hurt the mining industry and shares. This misinformation is clearly just that: misinformation. Just yesterday, Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd signed agreements worth $10 billion, covering resources and energy.
The Australian today reported that Vice-President Xi acknowledged ‘huge potential for growth’ in energy and resources and went on to pay tribute to Australia’s ‘sound investment market’ whilst encouraging close partnerships on energy, metals and environmental protection. Mr Xi also encouraged parties to ‘oppose trade and investment protectionism’. Fortescue Metals Chief Executive Officer Andrew Forrest, who has been vocal about his opposition to the RSPT, was also present at the signing of the agreement and was given the opportunity to meet Mr Xi. Incidentally, I note that Andrew Forrest’s own shares in his company rose by 20c to $4.57 per share. The Minister for Trade, Simon Crean, said that the RSPT would ‘encourage further investment’ and that the signing of these agreements ‘put paid to the exaggerated claims by some mining executives’. Mr Crean also stated that ‘There has never been any suggestion by the Chinese that it would harm investment in Australia’. The article also stated that Rio Tinto Executive Doug Ritchie said that as long as security and stability were provided by government policies, companies would invest.
The opposition’s claims that share prices would drop because of the RSPT is more scaremongering. In fact, Rio Tinto’s share price is now higher than what it was when the RSPT was announced. It is clear the opposition does not really support its own claims when one of their frontbenchers, the member for Dickson, purchased $2,000 worth of shares in BHP. This government is passionate about giving our Australian families a share in the profits of the mining industry. Australian citizens own 100 percent of this nation’s natural resources and, with mining companies making massive profits of up to $80 billion in the last decade, is it not time our nation shared in this success?
We are being targeted for our spending on this campaign, but what is the government to do when the opposition and the mining industry, which is more focused on reining in profits, is spending millions on misinforming the public about the RSPT? It is up to the government to clear up these myths and to rightfully inform the public of what our policies are and what they mean to our nation. Australians want to know what the impact of the government’s RSPT will be and what it will do to strengthen our economy. The Rudd government is passionate about standing up for our citizens and, even though we are faced with a multimillion dollar scare campaign, we will continue to stand up for working Australians and small businesses, to protect them from the misinformation and scaremongering and to ensure they receive the right information.
Our public campaign, which has already featured on TV, radio and print, provides actual facts to the community about the RSPT and provides them with a contact base where they are able to seek more information. We have held meetings with representatives from the mining industry and we have been nothing but upfront with Australians about the RSPT. We have established the Resource Tax Consultation Panel and have been open at every step—a practice which demonstrates our government’s willingness to discuss this very important tax reform and a practice which is completely different to the previous government’s.
Because of the grubby scaremongering and misinformation being put out by some of the mining industry, the Treasurer applied to the Cabinet Secretary, Senator Ludwig, to allow the government to defend itself and inform the public of the real facts. According to the campaign advertising guidelines, the Cabinet Secretary can exempt campaigns on ‘the basis of a national emergency, extreme urgency or other compelling reason’. This secretary granted his exemption on 24 May, and on 28 May this was tabled in parliament. The reason for the exemption was that:
… there is an active campaign of misinformation about the proposed changes to our tax system … Australians are concerned about how these changes will affect them.
… as the tax reforms involve changes to the value of some capital assets, they impact on financial markets …
The exemption was granted on two grounds: firstly, the extreme urgency, the need, to address misinformation that is being distributed about the reforms; and, secondly, the compelling reason that these reforms impact on financial markets. For the sake of our nation’s prosperity, it is time for those opposite to stop the scaremongering and enable the public to hear the real facts on how the resource super profits tax will provide important infrastructure for our mining states, boost the economy, increase the superannuation of our working Australians from nine per cent to 12 per cent, keep people in jobs and help build sustainable growth. The RSPT is a sensible tax reform which will benefit the Australian economy.
Previous speakers from this side of the chamber referred to the legacy of the Howard government. Senator Collins pointed out that the previous government spent $2 billion during that reign on this type of advertising—in stark comparison to this government. I do not think there are any parallels to be drawn or issues to be made about who is outspending whom. So, once again, I think the opposition need to cease their scaremongering campaign and come back on track in terms of delivering the true facts on what this RSPT is essentially about.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Government Advertising</title>,Matters of Public Importance,34,1,speech
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2010-06-22,"—I may have only been here for a little under two years, but every so often I see a new low reached. It seems that, no matter what the issue, those opposite seek to throw around the words ‘Work Choices’. Representatives of the Australian Labor Party come into this place—many of them having come from trade union backgrounds—and talk about ‘advertising scare campaigns not based on fact’, and they do it with a straight face. That requires a level of gumption that I do not have. The newspaper tells me that the ad campaigns being run by the miners have some of the same people involved in them as the Kevin 07 advertising campaign did. That was a real scare campaign. That is the campaign that is scaring Australians today as they remember what happened 2½ years ago. I assume the Labor Party will start to disown that.
It was the Prime Minister who described advertising as a ‘sick cancer’ on our democracy. I suppose it goes with the ‘great moral challenge’. I suppose it becomes yet another piece of flowery rhetoric that is being discarded by this government that cannot live up to the words of the Prime Minister as he seeks to moralise rather than govern. They claim, after only two years, that the Auditor-General effectively made it too difficult for them to run the advertising campaigns they wished to run. Their advertising campaign today could best be summed up as a PowerPoint presentation—a person in front of a PowerPoint slide. I cannot image a better summary of this Prime Minister than something out of The Hollowmen: an advertising campaign that will put people to sleep, as even government members will acknowledge.
We heard from Senator Ronaldson earlier that once ‘extraordinary’ reasons are now ‘compelling’ reasons. The only thing that was compelling in this campaign was the desperation of the Australian Labor Party as it realised that the tax it blindsided Australians with was in no way going to save it from the debacle of its mismanagement of pink batts, green loans and myriad other issues. That became the compelling reason for this campaign.
The Hawke review used the Australian Electoral Commission’s unique status as the veil under which the ALP thought it could dance away from its commitments. The Prime Minister thought: ‘Here we go. The Australian Electoral Commission is a bit unique. We will use this excuse to dance away from our commitment about describing something as a sick cancer.’ But this veil has been lifted, and the Australian people quite frankly do not like what they are seeing. What they are seeing is the underbelly of the Australian Labor Party using taxpayer funds to campaign for a policy thought-bubble that has no draft legislation and has not been brought before this parliament. We see no indication of it coming any time soon. This is nothing short of a series of campaign ads—bad though they are—for the Labor Party to try to dig itself out of a political hole.
This brings me to the time line. Just prior to me speaking, Senator Furner spoke about the four days between 24 May and 28 May as if it was December. These were not four average days; these were the days when the Finance and Public Administration Committee of this Senate was holding estimates hearings. The committee rearranged its timetable to accommodate Senator Ludwig’s personal timetable to discuss government advertising on the Thursday morning, the 27th, at the request of the minister. These were not four average days—four quiet days; this was an issue in these estimates hearings. The estimates committee changed its schedule to accommodate the minister. Despite having the draft statement for four days, he did not see any reason to inform the estimates committee, nor did he find any reason to table out of session the statement outlining that he had exempted this advertising campaign from his own guidelines. He could have done so but he chose not to.
This government are now learning the lesson of Nixon: it is not the action that gets you into trouble; it is the cover-up. What we have here is an attempt by the government to avoid scrutiny, and they have been caught out. They have been caught out by tabling this statement after Senate estimates hearings had concluded. Then they acquiesced in this chamber to allow those estimates hearings to be reconvened last week. I cannot think of another example where something like that has been slipped out at 9.30 the next day—as a number of us were at the airport leaving after estimates hearings—in order to specifically avoid scrutiny.
No-one believes that to delete two paragraphs of a statement and turn it from a nine-paragraph statement to a seven-paragraph statement takes four working days—four working days in this building while this was an issue discussed in those hearings. This delay was not due to the decision Senator Ludwig took; it was due to this government trying to craft the language to justify the decision they took. The decision to exempt and declare this partisan advertising campaign a ‘compelling reason’, albeit one for the Labor Party, had already been taken. What the minister was trying to do was avoid scrutiny and come up with language that would not make the government look bad, and he has been caught out.
Why will the minister not show us the draft? The minister is not keen for us to see those extra two paragraphs, those extra couple of hundred words. He says he took four days to delete those two paragraphs and table it in the Senate. No-one believes that. The minister should table in this Senate and make public the draft statement so that we know what took four days. I am certain that those four days were only used to try to craft the language to make this government look a little better. But it cannot because this decision stands very clearly in contradiction to the language they used themselves.
This government is simply trying to claim credit for a policy it implemented and junked. You do not get to claim political credit saying, ‘We were being all good two years ago but we have decided to be bad now.’ That is its only defence. Just like everything else about this Labor Party, this government only wants to speak about the opposition. It does not want to be tested against its own record. It avoids being tested against its own words. It wants to talk about the opposition—and it always brings up Work Choices whenever it can. The only thing I would say to that is that the Penrith by-election made clear that—with the little stunt with T-shirts—that did not have the traction that the Labor Party thought it might. According to this government, a small cancer is okay. We can have a small cancer on our democracy because its only defence is that it is smaller than it once was.
I would like briefly to turn to the tax itself which is the subject of this advertising campaign. Contrary to specific government commitments, there was no consultation with industry about this tax. They were blindsided like everyone else was on 2 May. It is a flawed tax based on flawed assumptions. Former finance minister and senator in this place, Peter Walsh, made the comment that the only barrier to a resolution of this was the current Prime Minister. Another comment that is of particular interest is that in his own memoirs, where he says that ‘there is rarely if ever any economic rent in iron ore’. He said that in his memoirs. He said it was different to oil, petroleum and gold, but this government sees it differently. Then again, I suppose this Labor Party has spent the last 2½ years running away from the Hawke years back into the arms of the Whitlam years and now, as it attempts to take national stakes in key industries, it is in some ways running back to the Chifley years.
The motives of this government with respect to this tax are betrayed by its attempt to apply it to existing projects. Those existing projects do not get the alleged benefit of the 40 per cent allowance for capital. It is simply a grab for money to try to fill the government’s budget black hole, which has been created by its unprecedented spending—spending which it did not flag in any way before the last election when, on the hills of Nambour, the Prime Minister was describing himself as an economic conservative.
There are myriad issues with this tax that this government is trying to hide with its advertising campaign. Royalties are the property of the states. The Commonwealth cannot seek to take those unconstitutionally. The royalties are the property of the states. They do not belong to all Australians in a legal sense. We also have the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which quite effectively redistributes income from those states which have a resource bounty compared to those that do not—and that is nearly a century-old tradition.
I will conclude with this: the key flaw in this tax—which this government is trying to hoodwink the Australian people into with its advertising campaign—is that, unlike petroleum, gold and other precious metals, iron ore and some of our key mineral exports are not rare. What is rare is the investment required to take them to market—to get them out of the ground, to get them on ships, or however they are to be transported, and to get them to market. This government is making a fundamental miscalculation in assuming that this tax can be introduced without impacting future investment levels in Australia—and this advertising campaign will not save it.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Government Advertising</title>,Matters of Public Importance,34,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2010-06-22,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. It is good to speak last because you get to listen to all the other contributors—and some certainly challenge the thought processes on this side of the chamber. I want to clear the air on one thing—and sorry to those poor souls outside of parliament who may be listening because they are stuck in a traffic jam or whatever. I have been in this place for five years and have listened to many debates. But when I was listening to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz from Tasmania, lecture the Special Minister of State about ‘decency in dealings’ and the other words he used, I found what he was saying absolutely disgraceful. It is absolutely incredible because that senator was caught colluding with a witness to train that witness how to answer questions at a Senate hearing. I am dying for someone from the other side to challenge me on this, because no senator in this chamber would dare think that they could get away with that sort of corrupt behaviour.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.
—Thank you!
—I think that Senator Sterle is casting aspersions on the motivations of another senator. He is also misquoting the findings of the Privileges Committee.
 (Senator Ryan)—Senator Sterle, I ask you to be very careful with your words and to reflect on what you said. I ask you to withdraw the imputation against Senator Abetz.
—Yes, I hear what you say, Mr Acting Deputy President. I withdraw.
—Your withdrawal is noted.
—We have cleared that up, but I just want to put on the record that the minister, Senator Ludwig, has never attracted that attention. I do not think anyone could argue with me on that.
I want to remind those outside the parliament who may be listening about the Howard government’s spending on advertising. On this side, we all know that the Howard government actually took some $420 million of taxpayers’ money to promote the GST. Remember the ‘Unchain my heart’ ads and whatnot? Let us not forget what was said in this chamber earlier: in 2007, the Howard government put their hands into taxpayers’ pockets and took out $254 million to use in their election campaign. I will mention Work Choices; I cannot help but mention Work Choices. Let us not forget that $121 million of taxpayers’ money was used to promote that failed policy that poisoned the Howard government’s last three years in office.
As a senator from Western Australia, a resource state, it is good to stand in here and talk about the advertising against the resource super profits tax. I do not disregard any senator from any other part of Australia, but I come from a state where the mining industry is a very, very important industry. Unlike others in this chamber, particularly those with the bigger mouths, I actually made my living off the back of the mining industry—not sitting in a courtroom with my hands in other people’s pockets. The mining industry is important and it was a fantastic way of making a living. It is still important. But what we have here is the mother of all scare campaigns. Let’s face it and tell it as it is: there is a massive scare campaign being driven by the Minerals Council of Australia and a certain few.
In the West Australian a couple of weeks ago, before the rally and all that stuff, it was reported that Western Australian Liberals were writing to all the mining companies saying, ‘Please fund our campaign and we will get rid of this tax.’ Let us not lose sight of the fact that this is political comfort for the Libs. They are thinking: ‘We’re broke. We need some money. Let’s get it off the mining companies. Let’s be part of this massive scare campaign.’ What is this scare campaign saying? It is not saying so in as many words but it is coming across as this: if a resource super profits tax was implemented in the great state of Western Australia, all of a sudden, overnight, every individual employed in mining or in servicing the mining industry would find their employment at risk; that the work of every small business that relies on the mining industry or supplies the mining industry would come to a sudden end the very day the tax was implemented.
This could not be further from the truth. It has suited those opposite to encourage a campaign of some mistruths. That is what it is all about. There is no argument about that. Look at a gathering of concerned people on the esplanade in Perth recently, where the front row was the Liberal members of parliament. They were shaking their jewellery in disgust. Ms Gina Rinehart’s pearls were glowing in front of the camera and she was saying, ‘It is so bad that the mining companies have to pay extra tax.’ Senator Ryan said that it is disgusting that existing mining projects should come under the umbrella of a resources tax. I want to know what Senator Ryan and others on that side think of the agreement obtained by the Western Australian Premier, Colin Barnett, for Rio Tinto and BHP mining in Western Australia to obtain $1 billion extra in royalties.
All the time in this chamber we hear the cliche thrown about that you cannot have it both ways, so why is it great for Mr Barnett, the Premier, to achieve that—and quite rightly so; it is fantastic, as long as it delivers to Western Australia along the lines of our Regional Infrastructure Fund, and I would like to know where that money is going—but bad for the federal government to want to get a bit of the profit being made by these supercompanies to deliver it back to Western Australians in the form of $2 billion in the Regional Infrastructure Fund? Why is it bad for the federal government to do something that would put important infrastructure projects into mining communities—communities affected by mining and communities that supply to the mining industry? For the life of me, I cannot understand how that could be any different.
I would also encourage senators over there who want to make contributions about the evil of a fair and equitable tax on the mining industry to take the time to visit some of these mining communities. I will talk about the mining communities in Western Australia. Two that come to mind are Port Hedland and Karratha. I remember Karratha in 1979. I took up a load of door jams for the brand new second suburb. There are now nine or 10 suburbs. If one wants to know the effects of the lack of infrastructure in these mining communities one should visit Karratha and Port Hedland—let alone Tom Price, Paraburdoo, Newman, Pannawonica, Wickham or wherever.
When I was on the road delivering furniture up there through the seventies and eighties, I went into these mining towns and it was clear the mining companies ran them. They built the infrastructure—they built the homes; they built the roads; they built the community facilities; they built the playgrounds; and they built and maintained the sporting venues, whether it was tennis, whether it was bowling or whether it was football, netball or soccer. Then, in the eighties, the mining companies decided that that was not their core business; they did not want to do that anymore. As I said, I made my living moving them in and out. It was a fantastic way to make a living, running through the great state of Western Australia. That is no longer there. It is mainly fly-in fly-out.
I encourage you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to pop into Port Hedland. Go and meet the mayor; go and meet the councillors. Ask them what their thoughts are on seeing some of the hard-earned dollars from their region actually coming back into their communities, because I have to tell you there is not a lot to be seen. It is quite irksome to have a major mining company tell you what a wonderful job they have done in Port Hedland because they put some sails over a playground. They said that to me, and I thought, ‘Well, that is wonderful, but where is the rest of the contribution back to that region, which they have successfully worked?’ They have employed a heck of a lot of people and they have paid some good wages. It is time to bring it back.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION EXAMINATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2007-2008


JUNE 2010


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


Recommendation 1


2.56 The committee recommends that the Australian Government amend the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 to include a statutory definition of contempt, the statutory power of referral, plus ancillary provisions and/or expedite the judicial process for Australian Crime Commission contempt matters.

Accepted.
The Government has introduced legislative amendments into Parliament that will provide a contempt regime for the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) to deal with witnesses who refuse to cooperate with the ACC. These amendments are contained in the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill No.2 2009.
As the ACC Act already contains offences for dealing with uncooperative witnesses, the regime will ensure that a person can be dealt with for contempt or charged with an offence but not both.

Recommendation 2


2.112 The committee recommends that the Australian Government expedite the process to include the Commissioner of Taxation as a full member of the Australian Crime Commission Board.

Accepted.
The ACC and the ACC Board support the appointment of the Commissioner of Taxation to the ACC Board.
The Government has introduced an amendment into Parliament to have the Commissioner of Taxation included as a member of the ACC Board. This amendment is contained in the Crimes Legislation Amendments (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill No.2 2009. Pending these legislative changes being passed by Parliament, the ACC Board has invited the Commissioner of Taxation to attend ACC Board meetings as an observer.

Recommendation 3

2.133 The committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity develop a practice to ensure publication of corruption or possible corruption matters in an appendix of Australian Crime Commission annual reports is done in a manner which will neither compromise current investigations nor the reputations of individuals facing allegations.
Accepted.
The ACC and Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) will work together to develop an appropriate reporting template for the next annual report that neither compromises current investigations nor the reputation of individuals facing allegations.

Recommendation 4


2.145 The committee recommends that the Australian Government review existing arrangements for the suspension and dismissal of Commonwealth law enforcement agency employees believed on reasonable grounds to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption, and that the Government take action as appropriate, bearing in mind the need to respect the rights of employees.

Accepted in principle.
The Government recognises the need for the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the ACC to have appropriate arrangements in place to address serious misconduct or corruption.
The AFP has a strong regime under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (AFP Act) and the Australian Federal Police Regulations 1979 (AFP Regulations) to suspend and dismiss officers who the AFP Commissioner reasonably believes have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption.
Regulation 5 of the AFP Regulations allows the AFP Commissioner to suspend an AFP employee where he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that the employee has, or may have, engaged in corrupt conduct or conduct that contravenes the AFP professional standards.
Under s 28 of the AFP Act, the AFP Commissioner may at any time, by notice in writing, terminate the employment of an AFP employee. Where the termination was made because the AFP Commissioner believed on reasonable grounds that the employee’s behaviour or conduct constituted serious misconduct or corruption, the AFP Commissioner may make a declaration to this effect (s 40J). Where a declaration is made, it is likely that the decision to terminate will not be subject to workplace relations laws but may be judicially reviewed.
The Government is confident that these arrangements are generally appropriate and well adapted to the needs of the AFP and will consider any amendments should the need arise.
Employees of the ACC are engaged under the Public Service Act 1999 (PS Act) and are required to uphold the Australian Public Service Values and the Code of Conduct and, under section 15 to the Act, the agency head may impose sanctions on an employee who is found to have breached the Code of Conduct.
The power of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the ACC to suspend and dismiss employees for suspected misconduct or corruption arises from his or her status as an ‘Agency Head’ for the purposes of the PS Act and the Public Service Regulations 1999 (PS Regulations). The ACC operates under the same legislative regime as the majority of the public service.
The CEO may suspend an employee in compliance with regulation 3.10 of the PS Regulations (s 28 PS Act). Suspension (with or without pay) is possible where the Agency Head believes on reasonable grounds that:
the employee has, or may have, breached the Code of Conduct, and
the employee’s suspension is in the public’s, or the Agency’s, interest.
The CEO may at any time, by notice in writing, terminate the employment of an APS employee in the ACC (PS Act s29). Termination of employment is subject to rules and entitlements laid out in the Fair Work Act 2009. A notice of termination for an ongoing APS employee must specify the ground or grounds that are relied on for the termination. The grounds include non-performance, or unsatisfactory performance, of duties; breach of the Code of Conduct and any other ground prescribed by the regulations.
The regulations may prescribe grounds or procedures applicable to the termination of the engagement of non-ongoing APS employees but this does not, by implication, limit the grounds for termination for a non-ongoing APS employee.
The Attorney-General’s Department has reviewed existing arrangements for the suspension and dismissal of ACC employees believed, on reasonable grounds, to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption and is developing options to strengthen the powers of the CEO of the ACC. This review has involved extensive
consultations, taking into account the views of the Committee.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE AUSTRALIAN COMMISSION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT INTEGRITY INQUIRY INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT INTEGRITY MODELS


JUNE 2010


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE


Introduction

On 23 February 2009, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity tabled the report from its Inquiry into Law Enforcement Integrity Models.
The Committee made a comparative analysis of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) to its state-based counterparts to inform possible changes to the governance structure and operation process of ACLEI, to enhance its current operation and support the potential extension of ACLEI oversight to other Commonwealth agencies with a law enforcement function.
The Committee made eight recommendations to which the Australian Government is pleased to respond. The recommendations consider ACLEI’s resourcing levels, capabilities, external relationships and the misconduct reporting arrangements in the agencies it oversees. Of the eight recommendations, the Government has agreed to two recommendations and agreed in principle to three recommendations. The remaining three recommendations are noted.

Recommendation 1


5.12 The committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake a review of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity’s funding levels, as a matter of urgency.


Agreed

The Australian Government reviewed the funding arrangements for the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) prior to the 2008-09 Budget. As a result, the Australian Government committed an additional $7.5 million over four years (including a one-off $750,000 capital injection) to ACLEI in the 2008-09 Budget to improve its investigative capacity. This measure effectively doubled ACLEI’s appropriation in 2009-10 to $4.1 million.
The Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) will continue to work closely with ACLEI on resourcing issues, including assisting ACLEI during the development of new policy proposals for Government consideration.
The Government acknowledges that the volume and complexity of ACLEI’s investigative caseload has increased over the two and half years of its operation. As a result, AGD has committed to working with ACLEI to review its business practices and funding structure. This will draw on the outcomes of the three-year review of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006.
Any changes to ACLEI’s funding arrangements will be considered by Government through normal budget processes.

Recommendation 2


5.18 The committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, the Australian Government fund the establishment of a prevention and education unit in the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. Further, the committee recommends that the prevention and education unit undertakes, but is not limited to, the following activities:

education of law enforcement personnel
public education and awareness-raising
corruption-risk reviews
research

Noted

See response to Recommendation 3 below.

Recommendation 3


5.19 The committee recommends that the corruption prevention and education function be strengthened in the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 following the review of the operation of the Act, which is due to report no later than 30 June 2010. Specifically, it is recommended that a corruption prevention and education function be included under section 15 (Functions of the Integrity Commissioner) of the Act.


Noted

Under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, the Commissioner’s primary function is the investigation of corruption issues. Further, the Act provides the Integrity Commissioner with significant and extensive power—specifically coercive and intrusive information-gathering powers similar to those potentially available to Royal Commissions—to carry out this primary role.
While a broad mandate for education and prevention is not provided for under the Act, there is scope for the Commissioner to undertake certain education and prevention activities incidental to the investigation function.
Careful consideration needs to be given to whether ACLEI is best placed to undertake a broader prevention and education role, given the contribution other agencies already make to education and prevention—notably the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) and the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. These agencies carry out this function at a ‘whole of Government’ level, whereas ACLEI’s purview is limited to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Crime Commission (ACC).
In this context, the Government considers at this time that ACLEI’s efforts are best directed to carrying out its primary role of investigation.
Any future proposals for funding a prevention and education unit would also need to be considered by Government through normal budget processes.

Recommendation 4


5.38 The committee recommends that the Australian Government initiates the establishment of a national forum through which matters of mutual interest to state and federal law enforcement integrity agencies can be addressed.


Agreed in principle

The Government agrees that there is value in an appropriate forum for state and federal law enforcement integrity agencies to discuss matters of mutual interest. The Government notes that the biennial Australian Public Sector Anti-Corruption Conference is a forum established for this purpose, and that state and federal integrity agencies, including ACLEI, participate.
The Government supports ACLEI exploring other opportunities for engagement with state law enforcement integrity agencies.

Recommendation 5


5.41 The committee recommends that the Australian Government consider in the longer term the establishment of an integrity inspector to assist in the oversight of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.


Agreed in principle

The Government considers that the existing accountability arrangements are sufficient for the current scrutiny of ACLEI. This includes the capacity for the Minister to refer ‘ACLEI corruption issues’ to a special investigator under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006.
The Government notes that supplementary arrangements—including the appointment of an integrity inspector or some other model—could be considered in the future. This consideration should occur when ACLEI’s size and the complexity of its workload justifies a review of accountability measures, and/or when other new considerations arise.

Recommendation 6


5.44 The committee recommends that as a priority the Australian Government fund the establishment and ongoing maintenance of a secure hearing room, associated technical infrastructure and personnel support.


Noted

The Government considers that it is important that ACLEI has access to appropriate facilities. However, in view of the relatively small number of hearings currently conducted each year by ACLEI, and based on advice from the Attorney-General’s Department, it is not evident that the current arrangements—that is, utilising the facilities of other agencies as required—are inadequate.
Any funding proposal for the establishment and maintenance of a secure hearing room must be considered within the Government’s normal budget processes.

Recommendation 7


5.50 The committee recommends that the Australian Government review existing obligations on employees of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies to report misconduct. The review should consider whether these arrangements need to be strengthened, including by legislative means, and whether there are sufficient measures in place to support and protect whistleblowers.


Agreed

The Government recognises that the mandatory reporting of misconduct is an important element of the professional standards frameworks of the ACC and the AFP. Currently, this obligation arises under management arrangements implemented by the ACC and the AFP. The Government considers that the present arrangements are appropriate and likely to encourage reporting of misconduct as part of the professional standards frameworks of the ACC and the AFP.
The Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 allows for people to refer corruption issues—as opposed to misconduct issues—directly to the Integrity Commissioner. Other complaints about employees of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies may be made to the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
More broadly, the Government has made a commitment to introduce legislation strengthening whistleblower protections in the Australian Government public sector, which includes employees of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.
The Government will consider whether any amendments to misconduct reporting arrangements in the ACC and the AFP are required in the context of the Government response made on 17 March 2010 to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Report: “Whistleblower Protection: A Comprehensive Scheme for the Commonwealth Public Sector”.

Recommendation 8


5.53 The committee recommends that the Australian Government review existing arrangements for the suspension and dismissal of Commonwealth law enforcement agency employees believed on reasonable grounds to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption, and that the Government take action as appropriate, bearing in mind the need to respect the rights of employees.


Agreed in principle

The Government recognises the need for the AFP and the ACC to have appropriate arrangements in place to address serious misconduct or corruption.
The AFP has a strong regime under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (AFP Act) and the Australian Federal Police Regulations 1979 (AFP Regulations) to suspend and dismiss officers who the AFP Commissioner reasonably believes have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption.
Regulation 5 of the AFP Regulations allows the AFP Commissioner to suspend an AFP employee where he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that the employee has, or may have, engaged in corrupt conduct or conduct that contravenes the AFP professional standards.
Under s 28 of the AFP Act, the AFP Commissioner may at any time, by notice in writing, terminate the employment of an AFP employee. Where the termination was made because the AFP Commissioner believed on reasonable grounds that the employee’s behaviour or conduct constituted serious misconduct or corruption, the AFP Commissioner may make a declaration to this effect
(s 40J). Where a declaration is made, it is likely that the decision to terminate will not be subject to workplace relations laws but may be judicially reviewed.
The Government is confident that these arrangements are well adapted to the needs of the AFP and will consider any amendments should the need arise.
Employees of the ACC are engaged under the Public Service Act 1999 (PS Act) and are required to uphold the Australian Public Service Values and the Code of Conduct and, under section 15 to the Act, the agency head may impose sanctions on an employee who is found to have breached the Code of Conduct.
The power of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the ACC to suspend and dismiss employees for suspected misconduct or corruption arises from his or her status as an ‘Agency Head’ for the purposes of the PS Act and the Public Service Regulations 1999 (PS Regulations). The ACC operates under the same legislative regime as the majority of the public service.
The CEO may suspend an employee in compliance with regulation 3.10 of the PS Regulations (s 28 PS Act). Suspension (with or without pay) is possible where the Agency Head believes on reasonable grounds that:
the employee has, or may have, breached the Code of Conduct, and
the employee’s suspension is in the public’s, or the Agency’s, interest.
The CEO may at any time, by notice in writing, terminate the employment of an APS employee in the ACC (PS Act s29). Termination of employment is subject to rules and entitlements laid out in the Fair Work Act 2009. A notice of termination for an ongoing APS employee must specify the ground or grounds that are relied on for the termination. The grounds include non-performance, or unsatisfactory performance, of duties; breach of the Code of Conduct and any other ground prescribed by the regulations.
The regulations may prescribe grounds or procedures applicable to the termination of the engagement of non-ongoing APS employees but this does not, by implication, limit the grounds for termination for a non-ongoing APS employee.
AGD has reviewed existing arrangements for the suspension and dismissal of ACC employees believed, on reasonable grounds, to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption and is developing options to strengthen the powers of the CEO of the ACC. This review has involved extensive consultations, taking into account the views of the Committee.

COMBINED AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO TWO SENATE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORTS ON PETROL SNIFFING IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES


PART A: BEYOND PETROL SNIFFING: RENEWING HOPE FOR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES (2006)


PART B: GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITY OF OPAL: ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE PETROL SNIFFING STRATEGY (2009)


Introduction to combined response

The Australian Government welcomes the Senate Community Affairs References Committee reports on Petrol Sniffing in Indigenous Communities: Grasping the opportunity of Opal: Assessing the impact of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy, and its companion 2006 report, Beyond petrol sniffing: Renewing hope for Indigenous communities. This document combines the government’s response to both reports. 
The Petrol Sniffing Strategy forms the Australian Government’s response to the devastating effects of petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities. Funding for this Strategy is now ongoing and this year’s Budget has provided $38.5 million over four years to further strengthen the roll-out of Opal fuel. This proposal has been developed in the context of findings that Opal significantly reduces the incidence of petrol sniffing in communities where it has been made available.
The government understands the importance of providing significant lead time to fully address the complex issues surrounding petrol sniffing and other forms of substance abuse in remote Indigenous communities.  In this context, it is pleasing to note the Senate Committee’s acknowledgement of the good work that has been achieved to date, as well as its proposals for moving forward that build on many of these successes.  Together, the Committee’s reports suggest an approach for undertaking further work in this significant policy area, clearly identifying a number of important strategic and program options for the government’s consideration.
Responsibility for the government’s Petrol Sniffing Strategy is shared across four departments, including the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA), the Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA), the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR).  FaHCSIA is the lead agency for overall coordination of this strategy.  As partners in the Petrol Sniffing Strategy, these departments work closely together to ensure a collaborative, integrated and complementary approach to delivering key initiatives across the Eight Point Plan (see Attachment A at the end of Part A of this document), drawing on the strengths of each portfolio area.
The success of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy, however, is not solely dependent on the government’s efforts.  It is important to recognise the assistance and support that is provided by a wide range of stakeholders, including State and Territory governments, local councils and shires, non-government providers such as the Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service and NPY Women’s Council and Indigenous communities themselves.  Collectively, these groups ensure a multifaceted response is in place that works across a broad front, to achieve effective and sustainable results within a complex and ever-changing policy environment.
Since September 2005, the Australian Government has contributed a total of $86.3 million to combat the effects of petrol and other substances on individuals, families and communities in the remote central Australian tri-state zone of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, the East Kimberley region in Western Australia, and Mornington Island and Doomadgee in Queensland.
 This funding has supported a wide range of initiatives, including:
the rollout of Opal fuel, as a highly effective supply reduction measure;
a crackdown on the trafficking of petrol and other substances through improved intelligence gathering and policing activities; and
the strengthening of vulnerable communities through the provision of targeted youth diversion activities, treatment and rehabilitation support, family and community development services and local infrastructure projects.
This funding is in addition to other complementary programs that have also been implemented by the government to strengthen and build the capacity of remote Indigenous communities, particularly in the Northern Territory.
The government’s investment to date has achieved a number of notable successes in the battle against petrol sniffing and other forms of substance abuse:
as at 30 April 2010, there were 129 sites receiving or registered to receive Opal fuel across regional and remote Australia. This includes 80 communities, 37 service stations/roadhouses, seven supporting organisations and five pastoral properties;
a demonstrated decrease in petrol sniffing in regional and remote communities. The Evaluation of the Impact of Opal Fuel, completed in 2008-09, measured a 70 per cent reduction in petrol sniffing across the sample communities between baseline and follow up data collections;
eleven new houses and three temporary accommodation complexes have been provided to support the employment of youth workers in the high need priority communities of Finke, Docker River and Imanpa in the Northern Territory, and Wanarn, Jameson, Warburton, Warakurna and Blackstone in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands;
a new recreation hall has been built in Finke, at a cost of just under $2 million, and two existing halls in Docker River and Imanpa refurbished;
a new major substance misuse treatment facility in Amata, South Australia, has also been constructed, with the Australian Government contributing just over $3 million and the remaining funds provided by the South Australian Government together with ongoing operating costs of $1.4 million a year;
there has been a significant expansion in youth services and activities across the Petrol Sniffing Strategy zones, including the employment of two senior youth workers and local Anangu trainee youth workers in each of the central Australian communities of Finke, Docker River, Imanpa and Mutitjulu, 17 youth workers in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands and East Kimberley in Western Australia,, a range of sporting and recreational activities being provided by these workers, and other initiatives such as the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands Regional Partnership Agreement in South Australia; and
there have also been substantial reductions in the trafficking of petrol, illicit drugs and alcohol across the Petrol Sniffing Strategy zones, following successful operations by the Alice Springs and Katherine Substance Abuse Intelligence Desks.
However, more work is needed to achieve fully effective, long-term and sustainable solutions to the inter-generational cycle of substance abuse that continues to prevail in many remote Indigenous communities. 
The Australian Government will continue to identify opportunities to consolidate and expand development and implementation of programs that address the debilitating effects of petrol sniffing and other substance abuse amongst young Indigenous Australians living in communities of high need, particularly in remote locations.  These opportunities will be developed in the context of important reforms the government is currently putting in place to improve the way governments work with Indigenous people, through strengthening local service planning processes and fostering more effective working relations with State and Territory governments.
 

PART A: Australian Government response to


Beyond petrol sniffing: Renewing hope for Indigenous communities

Report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee (2006)
June 2010

Background

On 5 October 2005 the Senate referred the following matters relating to petrol sniffing in remote Aboriginal communities for inquiry and report:
the effectiveness of existing laws and policing with respect to petrol sniffing in affected Indigenous communities;
the effectiveness of diversionary initiatives and community level activities; and
lessons that can be learned from the success some communities have had in reducing petrol sniffing, including the impact of non-sniffable Opal petrol.
The Committee’s report on the inquiry was tabled in Parliament on 20 June 2006. Part A of this document contains the government’s response to the recommendations of the 2006 report.
A second Senate Inquiry was announced on 17 June 2008.  The Senate referred the following matters to the Community Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report:
the ongoing effectiveness of the eight-point plan in combating petrol sniffing in Central Australia;
the extent of the roll-out of Opal fuel;
the delivery of youth services in affected areas;
the effectiveness and adequacy of resources provided to address petrol sniffing and substance abuse in Central Australia; and
what more needs to be done to effectively address petrol sniffing.
The Committee’s report, Grasping the opportunity of Opal: Assessing the impact of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy was tabled in Parliament on 19 March 2009.  The report reaffirms a number of the recommendations made in the 2006 Report and the response is contained in Part B of this document.
A number of the recommendations contained in this combined report have led to significant policy development, review and evaluation activity on the part of the agencies involved. These include a cost-benefit analysis of a proposal to mandate the supply of Opal fuel, published online at the following Department of Health and Ageing website: http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-oatsih-pspp-reports.
FaHCSIA also commissioned an independent review of the Central Australian Petrol Sniffing Strategy Unit (CAPSSU) which was completed at the end of 2009, an independent review of inconsistent legislation (completed in March 2010), and exploratory work in the context of PSS communications issues which was finalised in February 2010. These three reports have been published at: http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/sa/indigenous/pubs/evaluation/Pages/default.aspx
The outcomes of this activity, and of significant policy work associated with a strengthened roll-out of Opal fuel to begin later in 2010, have informed the content of this combined report.
As the lead agency, FaHCSIA has coordinated the combined response to the two Senate Committee Enquiries. The Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA), the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and the Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) have provided input to responses in cases where recommendations relate to their respective portfolio areas.

Recommendation 1

That the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), as a matter of urgency, revisit the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in order to:
prioritise the recommendations that have not been implemented; and
establish as a standard item on the COAG agenda the implementation of these recommendations.

Response


The government notes this recommendation.

The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) made recommendations to lessen the extent of substance misuse by Indigenous people.  These recommendations concerned data collection and research into substance misuse, the promotion of health strategies targeted at substance misuse, the establishment of early intervention programs in areas with a high incidence of substance misuse, the employment and training of Indigenous drug and alcohol community workers, and the provision of adequate cultural awareness and skills training for all workers involved in substance misuse programs1

Recommendation 286 referred to petrol sniffing in particular, suggesting more effective coordination of petrol sniffing measures across Australian, State and Territory governments and non-government agencies2.
The government believes that the current measures to address petrol sniffing, as detailed throughout this response and the government’s response to the 2009 Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Grasping the opportunity of Opal: Assessing the impact of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy, are meeting those recommendations of the RCIADIC that relate to this issue.
In 2007-08 COAG agreed to a number of ambitious targets to close the gap in Indigenous disadvantage.
The Closing the Gap agenda was developed in response to concerns raised with governments by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, including through the Close The Gap Campaign and the National Indigenous Health Equity Summits.
The COAG National Indigenous Reform Agreement, agreed in November 2008:
commits all jurisdictions to achieving the Closing the Gap targets;
defines responsibilities and promotes accountability among governments;
provides a roadmap for future action;
notes the significant funding provided through Indigenous-specific National Partnerships to assist in meeting the targets; and
links to other National Agreements and National Partnerships which include elements that will address the targets.
In 2008, COAG committed $4.6 billion in Indigenous specific funding over 10 years to drive fundamental reforms in remote housing, health, early childhood development, jobs and improvements in remote service delivery.
The Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments are committed through COAG to the Closing the Gap agenda and this partnership, underpinned by effective engagement with Indigenous Australians, establishes a genuinely national approach.

Recommendation 2

That COAG, as a matter of urgency:
reaffirm petrol sniffing as a priority area under the National Framework of Principles for Delivering Services to Indigenous Australians; and
establish a Standing Committee of COAG to monitor and evaluate programs addressing petrol sniffing and to report annually to COAG on progress.

Response


The government notes this recommendation.

The government considers that the existing PSS governance arrangements and PSS Eight Point Plan adequately allow for periodic review and refinement of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  A coordinated approach to updating the existing PSS Evaluation Framework, and further refinement of evaluation and data collection methodologies across the Eight Point Plan, including the roll-out of Opal Fuel, continues to be overseen and strengthened by the PSS SES Steering Committee in collaboration with FaHCSIA’s Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination. The 2010-11 Budget has provided funding to establish an ongoing annual surveillance system to monitor the incidence and prevalence of petrol sniffing and transference to other substances.  This annual data collection will also assist to evaluate the effectiveness of the Opal fuel program and other interventions that affect petrol sniffing prevalence.
Reducing the incidence and impact of petrol sniffing and other substance abuse in Indigenous communities is a significant priority for the government. Between the launch of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy in September 2005 and April 2010 the Australian Government contributed $86.3 million to this strategy
The rollout of Opal fuel is the only element of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy Eight Point Plan (see Attachment A) that is specific to petrol sniffing. All other elements of the strategy are fundamental to reducing not only petrol sniffing but also broader substance abuse issues. COAG has specifically acknowledged the importance of tackling the effects of substance abuse on Indigenous Australians and the impact this will have on closing the life expectancy gap3.
COAG has therefore provided funding through a number of complementary measures to address substance abuse. Consistent with the comprehensive approach taken under the PSS Eight Point Plan, this includes funding for drug and alcohol treatment and rehabilitation services in regional and remote areas through the following initiatives:
2006 Council of Australian Governments – Addressing Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities – Drug and Alcohol Treatment and Rehabilitation Services for Indigenous Australians in Remote and Regional Communities; and
2007 Council of Australian Governments – Closing the Gap – Indigenous Drug and Alcohol Services.  
Youth diversionary activities have also been funded in the Northern Territory through a range of measures. As part of the Northern Territory Emergency Response, the government has spent some $18 million over two years on FaHCSIA’s Youth Alcohol Diversion measure to support projects across targeted Northern Territory communities.
Further funding of $28.4 million over three years was announced in the 2009-10 Budget as part of FaHCSIA’s Youth in Communities measure, to enhance the quantity, quality and cohesion of youth services in Northern Territory Indigenous communities.
This funding will continue the important work commenced under the Youth Alcohol Diversion measure, with just under $9 million allocated in 2009-10 to improve recreational infrastructure, fund more youth workers and provide diversionary programs targeting young people aged between 10 and 20 years.
The government has also invested considerable funding in a range of sporting activities that promote healthy lifestyle choices and provide positive role models and mentoring support to Indigenous youth.  Examples include:
a funding contribution towards the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands Multi-Sports Activities Regional Partnership Agreement (RPA). The RPA provides for structured inter-community sports competitions across APY communities including a very successful and popular inter-community Australian Football League (AFL) competition, regular multi-sports activities for young people throughout the year, and recreation activities such as horse riding, BMX and motocross;
joint funding of an AFL Club Fostership Program and AFL Ambassadors for Life Mentoring Program with the Australian Football League in 2007, to promote healthy, active lifestyles and increased school attendance for youth in selected Indigenous communities (mainly in the Northern Territory), and to provide mentoring from Indigenous Australian Rules players, as positive role models to over 100 Indigenous youth from around Australia; and
funding to expand AFL activities in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia, through the employment of a Community Development Officer, an administrator to manage football activities in the region, and two AFL Indigenous trainees to help deliver schools-based programs.

Recommendation 3

That the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner be funded to conduct a review of the implementation of the Royal Commission and Coroners’ Recommendations in twelve months time and every twelve months following until the Commissioner can report that the recommendations have been sufficiently addressed.

Response


The government notes this recommendation.

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner’s independent statutory functions include reviewing the impact of laws and policies on Indigenous peoples, reporting on Indigenous social justice and native title issues and promoting an Indigenous perspective on issues. In addition, the Commissioner monitors the enjoyment and exercise of human rights for Indigenous Australians.
The Commissioner is already required by law to produce an annual Social Justice and a Native Title Report regarding the exercise and enjoyment of human rights by Australia’s Indigenous peoples. This allows the Commissioner to make recommendations as to action that should be taken to safeguard such enjoyment.

Recommendation 4

That the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council through the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and the National Advisory Group on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Information and Data work to improve data collection on substance abuse, including petrol, by Indigenous people as a matter of priority.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation, noting that improved data collection on Indigenous health including substance abuse is a long-term national priority.
The Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health no longer exists. Work around Indigenous health data, including substance abuse, is being progressed through the National Advisory Group on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Information and Data. This committee provides broad strategic advice on the improvement of the quality and availability of data and information on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and service delivery.
The government has undertaken considerable work to improve the quality and consistency of data being collected on petrol sniffing and other substance abuse. A coordinated approach to updating the PSS Evaluation Framework, and further refinement of evaluation and data collection methodologies across the Eight Point Plan, including the roll-out of Opal Fuel, continues to be overseen and strengthened by the PSS SES Steering Committee. The $38.5 million funding provided in this year’s Budget to strengthen the delivery of Opal fuel will also cover establishment of an ongoing annual surveillance system to monitor the incidence and prevalence of petrol sniffing and transference to other substances. This annual data collection will also assist to evaluate the effectiveness of the Opal fuel program and other interventions that affect petrol sniffing prevalence.

Recommendation 5

That State and Territory Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages require that, where abuse of petrol or other inhalant is a contributing factor to a death, the inclusion of inhalant abuse and the type of inhalant used be recorded on death certificates as recommended by the Northern Territory Coroner in 1998.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that information recorded on death certificates is a matter for State and Territory governments to consider.  The recording of inhalants as a contributing factor to death would provide important data which could be used to more fully assess the health impacts of petrol sniffing. The government will write to State and Territory governments, bringing this matter to their attention.
Recommendation 6
That the Commonwealth evaluate, as a matter of urgency, the effectiveness of Indigenous Coordination Centres’ implementation of the whole-of-government policy with a view to improving coordination of government programs.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation.

The government is committed to improving the coordination of programs and services to Indigenous Australians and notes the new model of service delivery associated with the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Service Delivery and the role of the Regional Operations Centres and Boards of Management in coordinating activity across governments. 
The National Partnership Agreement on Remote Service Delivery is one of six Indigenous National Partnership Agreements. It commits the Australian Government and the relevant States and Territories to investing $291.2 million over six years in the 29 priority communities to build community capacity, test new service delivery models and harness the benefits of funds and initiatives provided through the other National Partnerships.  In identifying where to concentrate initial investment, the Remote Service Delivery investment principles were considered, including the following criteria:
significant concentration of population;
anticipated demographic trends and pressures;
the potential for economic development and employment;
the extent of pre-existing shortfalls in government investment in infrastructure and services; and
where possible, investment will also build on other significant investment already in progress.
To implement the new Remote Service Delivery arrangements in each jurisdiction, the Commonwealth and State/Northern Territory Governments have established Regional Operations Centres. Working in these centres are officials from the Commonwealth and the relevant State and Territory governments.
Each Regional Operations Centre provides support to locally-based government staff, who live in and work with the community. One of their main functions is to work across government with local Indigenous people and other stakeholders to develop the Local Implementation Plans and ensure they are implemented in a timely way.  
The development of Local Implementation Plans with each of the 29 priority communities and the role of the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services will ensure oversight of the activity of governments and that governments are held to account for delivering on their commitments.
This commitment is also reflected in the service delivery principles for programs and services for Indigenous Australians, agreed to by COAG.  All governments have agreed to increase collaboration between and within governments at all levels, their agencies and funded service providers to effectively coordinate programs and services.

Recommendation 7

The Committee notes that the Eight Point Plan is being developed for a designated area of Central Australia and considers that this is an important step in addressing petrol sniffing. The Committee considers that, as a matter of urgency, the plan must be implemented more widely and that effective community consultation must be part of the implementation process. The Committee recommends that:
the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments, as a matter of urgency, commit to the implementation of the Eight Point Plan in all areas across Australia that have a substantial petrol sniffing problem;
a transparent strategy be developed for the plan’s further implementation including timing, evaluation and adaptive management processes; and
effective consultation be undertaken with Indigenous communities before the plan is implemented.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation, noting that the Petrol Sniffing Strategy Eight Point Plan (see Attachment A to Part A of this document) has been implemented in four priority zones including:
the remote cross border region of Central Australia covering the Ngaanyatjarra Lands in Western Australia, the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in South Australia and the communities of Docker River, Imanpa, Mutitjulu and Finke in the Northern Territory;
an extended region of Central Australia in the Northern Territory covering the communities to the west and north of Alice Springs;
Doomadgee and Mornington Island in the southern gulf area of Queensland; and
the East Kimberley in Western Australia.
Responses to petrol sniffing outbreaks outside these priority zones are carried out through tailored solutions developed in consultation with community leaders, local police and service providers. 
Implementation of the PSS Eight Point Plan is carried out through the PSS Senior Executive Service (SES) Steering Committee attended by each agency with an interest in the PSS, guided by a comprehensive workplan (including timelines) which is currently being updated.
A comprehensive PSS Evaluation Framework, including extensive consultation with Indigenous stakeholders, forms one of the elements of the PSS Eight Point Plan, and is overseen by the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination (OIPC) in FaHCSIA. OIPC is also represented on the PSS SES Steering Committee. Under this Framework, a review of the first 12 months of the Plan’s operation was completed in July 2008. Component evaluations of the Eight Point Plan were carried out in 2009-10, and a coordinated approach to updating the PSS Evaluation Framework, and further refinement of evaluation and data collection methodologies across the Eight Point Plan, including the roll-out of Opal Fuel, continues to be one of the key focuses of the PSS SES Steering Committee.
The government recognises that successful implementation of the strategy requires ongoing collaboration and coordination with all levels of government, service providers and communities.  Local implementation plans have been agreed across all of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy zones, which have been developed in close consultation with a range of stakeholders including State and Territory governments, local service providers and Indigenous communities.
In line with Recommendation 4 of the Senate Committee’s 2009 report Grasping the opportunity of Opal: Assessing the impact of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy an independent review of the Central Australian Petrol Sniffing Strategy Unit was commissioned in mid-2009. The CAPSSU Review Report, which was finalised at the end of 2009, and an internal response to that Report, developed between partner agencies (including CAPSSU) and overseen by the PSS SES Steering Committee, is now in the implementation phase. This Report has been published on the following site: http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/sa/indigenous/pubs/evaluation/Pages/default.aspx

Recommendation 8

That the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments address the sporadic nature of funding and disruption of successful programs by:
committing to longer term funding models;
actively assisting communities to access government programs and meet the governance requirements; and
providing long term support to successful programs in Indigenous communities.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that long-term funding is already being provided up to 2014 under the Petrol Sniffing Strategy and through complementary programs.
The Northern Territory Integrated Youth Services Project, for example, was funded over three years (April 2007 – March 2010) through a single funding agreement with FaHCSIA, the Attorney-General’s Department and DEEWR. It was the primary youth diversion and community development project under phase one of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy. The provision of three year funding allowed these departments to work with the provider, Mission Australia, to put in place a coordinated and complementary response to the problems of petrol sniffing in Finke, Imanpa, Docker River and Mutitjulu. The services provided under this contract were transitioned to the NPY Women’s Council in April 2010, with funding provided until 2012 under the Youth in Communities (YIC) measure.
The YIC measure is an investment of $28.4 million over the next three years (2009-10 to 2011-12) to develop a comprehensive youth strategy in the Northern Territory. This builds on the $18 million that has already been provided under the Northern Territory Emergency Response Youth Alcohol Diversion measure. As a complementary program to the Petrol Sniffing Strategy, YIC funding will provide longer term planning certainty in seeding the development of a sustainable network of youth services in the Northern Territory. It will also enable the government to work in closer partnership with the Northern Territory Government in establishing the broad directions, service principles and type of projects to be funded under this strategy. 
The government is also implementing flexible funding arrangements to make it easier for communities to respond to emerging priorities, flowing from local planning processes. The Indigenous Capability and Development Program administered by FaHCSIA, for example, provides a mechanism for developing flexible solutions and opportunities through better coordination and targeting of funding to locally identified priorities. A number of service streams under this program, such as the Indigenous Communities Strategic Investment (ICSI) Fund, also fund projects that extend beyond a single year. Indigenous Coordination Centre Managers can also approve the release of funding from ICSI locally.

Recommendation 9

The Committee, in concluding that the importance of consistent policing strategies in the effective regulation of volatile substance abuse in Indigenous communities cannot be understated, recommends that each State and Territory Government ensure that legislation is in place that empowers police and justice officials to intervene and prevent petrol sniffing.

Response


The government notes this recommendation.

The government recognises that inconsistent legislation and policing practices across jurisdictions can be an impediment to the effective regulation of volatile substance abuse in Indigenous communities, particularly in the Central Australian tri-state area. Some community stakeholders have reported a concern that legislative variations between jurisdictions may give rise to inconsistent treatment of the same behaviour and to different treatment protocols depending on where the behaviour takes place. 
While policing and criminal justice issues are primarily the responsibility of State and Territory governments, the Commonwealth continues to play an important research and coordination role in identifying and assisting to address any difficulties caused by inconsistent legislation and policing practices, as evident in the response to Recommendation 10 below.

Cross-border justice agreement

As an example of a successful cross-jurisdictional initiative to counter the effects of inconsistent legislation and policing practices, the Cross-border Justice Scheme (a cooperative arrangement between the Australian, Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian governments) allows officials to deal with offenders from any one of the participating jurisdictions where the offender has a connection to the cross-border region. This will streamline the delivery of justice services and improve public safety in the cross-border region.
State and Territory legislation relating to this agreement has been passed by all three jurisdictions. The government amended the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 (Cth) in 2009 to support the effective operation of the cross-border justice scheme.

Substance Abuse Intelligence Desks

In support of better-aligned policing practices across jurisdictions, the government has also provided funding for three Substance Abuse Intelligence Desks (SAID) in Marla, Alice Springs and Katherine targeting drug trafficking, including the trafficking of petrol and kava. These Intelligence Desks are staffed by Northern Territory Police (and, in the case of Marla, South Australian Police) and work collaboratively with Western Australian police to gather intelligence, to educate communities, roadhouse operators and local police and to conduct joint enforcement activities. 
For example, the Australian Government is supporting the Western Australian Police’s efforts to disrupt trafficking and use of illicit substances throughout Western Australia’s goldfields district, including Esperance, Kimberley and Pilbara, providing $300,000 over two years to enable Western Australian officers to further target abuse of drugs, alcohol, petrol, kava and other licit and illicit substances in remote communities.
As part of the strategy, the Crime Intelligence and Coordination Units in each Western Australian Police District will specifically target substance abuse in remote communities, working with the existing Substance Abuse Intelligence Desk and Dog Operations Units located in the Northern Territory and South Australia. Information sharing that currently exists across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and South Australia will culminate in a series of targeted multi-jurisdictional operations and patrols.
Cross-jurisdictional initiatives allow officials to deal with offenders from any one of the participating jurisdictions where the offender has a connection to the cross-border region. This will streamline the delivery of justice services and improve public safety.

Recommendation 10

That the Attorney-General’s Department, with the cooperation of the State and Territory Governments, conduct an audit of current legislation used to police and combat petrol sniffing with a view to ensuring a consistent and cooperative approach in legislation across all jurisdictions by 2008.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation. The government commissioned an independent report (the Shaw Report) which involved community consultation and was finalised in March 2010. The Shaw Report found that the range of legislative approaches adopted in various jurisdictions, while different, were not necessarily inconsistent; and that this did not impact significantly on service delivery or policing. The need for consistent legislation was not identified as a key priority by stakeholders, who were more urgently concerned with the need for better coordinated service delivery. The Shaw Report has been published at http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/sa/indigenous/pubs/evaluation/Pages/default.aspx

Recommendation 11

The Committee recognises that the violent acts of petrol sniffers are at times being directed towards vulnerable community members and considers that community safety and personal protection are the right of all people. The Committee therefore recommends that Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments commit to:
continuing to implement strategies as a matter of priority to achieve a permanent police presence in all Indigenous communities;
recruiting Aboriginal Liaison and Community Officers;
establishing and supporting community night patrols; and
considering multi-functional police centres as a best practice strategy.

Response


The government notes this recommendation.

The government agrees that all Australians have a right to community safety and personal protection. Community safety is a State and Territory responsibility, and the Australian government has provided significant support to State and Territory initiatives aimed at achieving this objective.
On 14 July 2006, COAG announced a $130 million package of initiatives including $47 million over four years for a policing review, audit of the number of police officers in remote Australia, and improved policing infrastructure including:
Northern Territory - a permanent police station and multifunction facilities including officer accommodation at Galiwinku
Queensland - construction of police housing at Hope Vale, Aurukun, Woorabinda, Lockhart, Pormpuraaw, Doomadgee and Mornington Island
South Australia - construction of permanent police station and multifunction facilities at Amata and Pukatja on the APY Lands; and
Western Australia - construction of multifunction police facilities, staff housing and visiting officers’ quarters at Burringurrah, Looma and Blackstone, and additional visiting officers’ quarters at Bidyadanga.
The independent review into policing levels in remote Indigenous communities in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory was used to assist in identifying priority locations for the construction of police infrastructure under this COAG initiative.
In response to the South Australia Commission of Inquiry report, Children on the APY Lands (Mullighan Inquiry) report, the Australian Government provided an additional $15 million to provide police facilities to Mimili on the APY Lands and additional accommodation for police officers and child protection workers in the three communities with new police stations.
Through the Northern Territory Emergency Response, the government has also provided significant funding to increase the police presence in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory.  In 2007-08 and 2008-09, a total of $36 million was provided for the establishment of 18 temporary Task Force Themis police stations, the deployment of additional police, and the construction of infrastructure including visiting officers’ accommodation, upgrades to police stations and the Northern Territory Police College.
In 2009-10 under the Closing the Gap in the Northern Territory National Partnership Agreement (NPA), the government will provide $156.6 million over three years to continue the remote policing and substance abuse initiatives implemented under the Northern Territory Emergency Response.  Funding will be used to maintain the increased police presence, replace five temporary police facilities with permanent stations and continue substance abuse activities including the SAIDs and Dog Operation Units, alcohol management plans, licensing inspectors and signage.
In the 2009-10 Budget the government announced further funding of $34.6 million over three years as part of the Closing the Gap in the Northern Territory measure, to promote ongoing engagement with Indigenous communities, with a particular focus on Northern Territory Emergency Response prescribed communities.  
In November 2009, all Australian Governments endorsed the National Indigenous Law and Justice Framework (the Framework).  One of the issues that mark the interaction between Indigenous Australians and the justice systems is the strong link between substance abuse, including petrol sniffing, and offending. In recognition of this, Goal 4 of the Framework outlines strategies and actions to increase safety and reduce offending by addressing alcohol and substance abuse.
Night patrols have been established in 72 of the 73 prescribed communities identified by the Northern Territory Emergency Response. Consultations are continuing with the remaining community. Night patrols are funded under the Closing the Gap in the Northern Territory budget measure, which provides $80.2 million over three years from 2009-10 for law and order initiatives. Other activities under this measure include interpreter services, legal assistance providers and the Welfare Rights Outreach Project.
State and Territory initiatives aimed at improving community engagement include the establishment of Aboriginal Community Police Officer positions within the Northern Territory Police, Community Constables and Police Aboriginal Liaison Officer positions within the South Australian Police, and Police Liaison Officer positions in Queensland.

Recommendation 12

Community safe houses provide an appropriate place to temporarily house users of volatile substances and other drugs who threaten the safety of other community members. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth conduct an audit of existing safe houses, identify Indigenous communities in need of safe houses and, as a priority, provide additional funding to establish safe houses in these communities.

Response


The government notes this recommendation.

Community safe houses are a State and Territory responsibility. The Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia have legislation in place which enables a police officer or, in some cases, another authorised person, to temporarily place an intoxicated person in protective custody if they pose a danger to themselves or others.  Persons apprehended are not under arrest and no criminal charges are laid. The purpose of apprehension and detention is to protect that person or to protect other people from the risk of harm, while the person is intoxicated. An important safeguard is that in no jurisdiction can a child be detained in a police lock-up or cell, except in exceptional circumstances.
Since 2007, the government, in partnership with the Northern Territory Government, has provided funding to establish safe houses under the Northern Territory Emergency Response Family Support Package. This Package has supported the establishment or expansion of 22 Safe Places in 15 remote communities as well as Alice Springs and Darwin; the formation of a Mobile Child Protection Team; and the recruitment of Remote Aboriginal Family and Community Workers. 
Of the 22 safe places, 13 are safe houses for women and children, and nine are cooling off shelters for men.
Safe houses provide an essential refuge for women and children away from family violence, while men’s cooling off shelters provide a safe place for men offering family violence education and programs on dealing with alcohol. Safe places also act as a link to other services including counselling, legal and support services such as well-being programs and cultural healing programs. 
 Sobering up shelters are also available in communities, as a safe place for people to sleep off the effects of acute intoxication. Whilst the government does not provide dedicated program funding for sobering-up shelters, it is providing capital works funding to support improvements to sobering-up shelters in Tennant Creek and Katherine in the Northern Territory under the COAG drug and alcohol measures.
The government, through DOHA, also funds a range of Indigenous-specific substance use services nationally, delivered through residential and non-residential rehabilitation services and primary health care services.

Recommendation 13

Women and children who are at risk of harm from intoxicated adults and sniffers need safe places to protect  them from violence, hurt and abuse. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth provide additional funding to establish safe houses, in addition to the safe houses in the previous recommendation, for women and children at risk in Indigenous communities.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation, noting that safe houses are a State and Territory responsibility. Protecting children and families and helping to build stronger and safer communities are key COAG priorities fundamental to Closing the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
The government has a national leadership role to stop the abuse and neglect of women and their children, and is working in collaboration with State and Territory governments, community service providers and Indigenous people to tackle this problem. In May 2008 an 11-member National Council was appointed to advise on strategies for reducing violence against women and their children.  The National Council has conducted a number of consultations with members of Indigenous communities across Australia and held an Indigenous Forum at Parliament House. After consulting with more than 2,000 Australians the Council presented to the Australian Government a comprehensive report, Time for Action to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children.
The government has committed to immediately progressing 18 out of the 20 priority recommendations from the National Council’s report and to giving effect to the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children, as endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments.
The government remains committed to building stronger and safer communities for all Australians and this means working to address issues and provide opportunities at the local community level.

Recommendation 14

The Committee strongly supports the development of community-based programs and recommends that State, Territory and Commonwealth Governments provide long-term funding for community-based programs and when providing funding ensure that:
strong agency support is provided;
programs are established which build the capacity of community  members such as training in youth work and training that builds skills of program management and governance;
appropriate levels of funding are made available to ensure the operation of youth programs during times of need, for example into the evenings and during school breaks when petrol sniffing is more prevalent; and
adequate resources are provided for trained, skilled and committed staff to be retained in communities on a permanent basis rather than a fly-in-fly-out roster system.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation.  State and Territory governments have primary responsibility for funding of community based programs for youth at risk. The Commonwealth’s role is complementary to State and Territory funding. The government acknowledges both the merits of community based programs, particularly those aimed at transferring skills and knowledge and building local capacity to deliver key community services, and the limitations imposed by budget cycles and changing political priorities.
This recommendation is consistent with the remote service delivery principles agreed by COAG, and the longer-term implementation issues associated with translating these principles into standard program practice are under consideration by program and policy areas across government.
Notable examples of relevant recent initiatives that have been funded by the government under the Petrol Sniffing Strategy include:
Provision of $12 million towards the establishment of the Northern Territory Integrated Youth Services Project (IYSP), as the primary community development and youth diversion project under the Petrol Sniffing Strategy. Mission Australia was funded for three years to March 2010 under this Project to deliver holistic youth services to the four central Australian priority communities of Finke (Aputula), Imanpa, Docker River (Kaltukatjara) and Mutitjulu, comprising:
the employment of two full-time youth workers (one male and one female) and relief staff in each community, to deliver a comprehensive youth service available 24 hours a day, seven days a week;
the employment, training and supervision of local Aboriginal people, to fill up to two full-time equivalent youth worker positions on each community; and
the establishment of appropriate governance arrangements in these communities.
Projects funded under the IYSP have been transitioned to the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (NPY) Women’s Council through funding made available under the Youth in Communities measure.
Infrastructure funding of $4 million was also provided through the IYSP to build much needed youth worker accommodation in the communities, as well construct a new recreation hall at Finke and refurbish two existing halls in Imanpa and Docker River.
Under the Northern Territory Emergency Response Youth Alcohol Diversion measure, the government funded a pilot initiative involving several West MacDonnell communities in the Northern Territory Expanded Petrol Sniffing Strategy Zone, to provide part-time employment, training and supervision to local Anangu people as youth workers. This project is being managed by the MacDonnell Shire Council.
The APY Youth Engagement Program was funded to engage 70 young Indigenous people aged 12 to 20 years who are disengaged from education and at risk of substance abuse. The program provides Indigenous youth with accredited training, work experience and support through case management and mentoring.
The government recognises the importance of providing youth services at critical times, particularly outside school hours and during school holiday periods. Various projects were funded under the Northern Territory Emergency Response Youth Alcohol Diversion measure to encourage and support youth engagement and participation in school. Funding has also been provided for a number of school holiday programs, which aim to keep children in their communities during the holiday breaks, so that they are available and ready to return to school at the commencement of the new term.

Recommendation 15

The Committee recognises that there are some elements that are critical to the success of community programs and recommends that:
government  funded  programs  must  provide  for  these  critical elements including community ownership, the involvement of families and youth in their development and combined with the provision of essential support and expertise;
the Commonwealth identify, evaluate and provide ongoing support to allow the continuation and further development of those community-based programs that have proven particularly successful; and
the Commonwealth develop and implement a communication strategy that facilitates information sharing and the development of such programs in other communities.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation, recognising that successful implementation of the PSS requires ongoing collaboration with key stakeholders, including Indigenous communities. 
Community engagement is a key element of this Strategy. Under the PSS Northern Territory Integrated Youth Services Project (NT IYSP), for example, Mission Australia was required to establish appropriate governance arrangements and links to communities, families and young people to ensure effective and responsive service delivery. It should be noted that the success of this approach depends on a range of factors including community leadership and capacity.
As discussed in the response to Recommendation 7 above, evaluation is one of the components of the PSS Eight Point Plan. A comprehensive PSS Evaluation Strategy was developed in 2009 to support a whole of government approach to evaluating the PSS, as well as separate evaluations of each of the components of the Eight Point Plan. Component evaluations (2009-10) assess the achievements and lessons learnt from key projects implemented under the PSS, including the extent to which community members were involved in their design and delivery. In January 2010, the PSS SES Steering Committee agreed to commission a complementary PSS Monitoring and Evaluation Plan to refine data collection and monitoring capability and to streamline the existing PSS Evaluation Framework, in alignment with data collection requirements arising as a result of the strengthened roll-out of Opal fuel.  The outcomes of these evaluations will inform future program development under the PSS as well as other relevant programs, for instance those funded under the Youth in Communities measure.
Similarly, communication forms one of the elements of the PSS Eight Point Plan. FaHCSIA recently received an independent report identifying and mapping communication strategies and messages used by relevant youth and substance abuse programs in the PSS Zones. This completes the first stage in the development of a range of communication strategies and resources, together with key messages and target audiences, to achieve a more consistent, integrated and community-focused approach.
Communication issues were the subject of recommendations made as part of the CAPSSU Review Report. These are further discussed in the government’s response to the 2009 Senate Committee Report (see response to Recommendations 2 and 4).

Recommendation 16

The Committee acknowledges the success of Yuendumu programs including the Mt Theo outstation and while recognising that this model will not fit for all communities, recommends that the Commonwealth provide long term funding and support to assist other interested communities to develop similar programs.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation in principle.  The government acknowledges the success of the Mt Theo program and has a long history of providing recurrent funding to Mt Theo through DOHA’s Substance Use Program. FaHCSIA also invested $2 million in funding for the Mt Theo program through the Northern Territory Emergency Response Youth Alcohol Diversion measure.
Under the PSS Evaluation Framework, component evaluations have assessed the full range of projects being implemented under this Strategy.  The lessons learned from these evaluations will inform the design and development of future projects carried out under or aligned with the PSS.

Recommendation 17

The Committee notes that as part of the Eight Point Regional Strategy for Central Australia, the Commonwealth is undertaking an assessment of the most feasible options for rehabilitation facilities for petrol sniffers. The Committee considers the provision of rehabilitation facilities for petrol sniffers a priority and recommends that Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments urgently provide adequate levels of additional funding for new and existing rehabilitation facilities.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation noting that a number of initiatives have provided funding to Indigenous substance use treatment and rehabilitation since this recommendation was made in June 2006.
DOHA provided additional funding of $3.89 million over three years from the 2007 COAG substance use measure to new and existing services that provide petrol sniffing programs. The funding enhanced service delivery through increased bed occupancy and/or increased scope and reach of services for young people in Central Australia and the Top End of the Northern Territory.
The additional funding provided under the 2007 COAG substance use measure was a whole of government initiative requiring joint consideration from the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments.
The Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) Northern Territory Office in collaboration with the Northern Territory Government will continue to monitor the demand for services and need for additional funding in Central and the Top End of the Northern Territory.
The Australian Government through DOHA currently provides ongoing funding to services through the Substance Use program, COAG funding and the Northern Territory Emergency Response measures to organisations for residential and non–residential rehabilitation services in the Central Australia Zone (that includes the Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian areas of Central Australia):
Warlpiri Youth Development (Mt Theo);
Drug and Alcohol Services Association Alice Springs Incorporated (Northern Territory);
Ilpurla Aboriginal Corporation (Northern Territory);
Bush Mob NT (funded by OATSIH through Northern Territory Government over two years);
Central Australian Youth Link-up Service (CAYLUS);
Sunrise Health Service Aboriginal Association; and
Miwatj Health.

Recommendation 18

That the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments establish priorities for extending the roll out of Opal fuel to the current production capacity of 20 million litres. The strategy should include:
the identification of critical roadhouses and townships in close proximity to Opal communities;
promotion of the Petrol Sniffing Prevention Program to roadhouse and townships; and
identifying and combating barriers that prevent a complete roll out of Opal throughout the Central Australian region.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation noting that the rollout of Opal fuel has extended beyond a production capacity of 20 million litres per annum, having secured increased production capacity for up to 40 million litres per annum in 2006.
As at 30 April 2010, there were 129 sites receiving or registered to receive Opal fuel across regional and remote Australia. This includes 80 communities, 37 service stations/roadhouses, seven supporting organisations and five pastoral properties.
This recommendation is closely linked to Recommendation 8 of the recent Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report Grasping the Opportunity of Opal: Assessing the Impact of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy.  
Please refer to the Australian Government’s response to that recommendation, which identifies current priority regions and sites being targeted for the Opal fuel rollout.

Recommendation 19

That the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments agree on a complementary subsidy approach that ensures Opal can retail in Queensland for the same price as regular unleaded.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation, noting that it has already been implemented.
The Queensland Government’s Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 received royal assent on 10 November 2006 and took effect on 1 December 2006. This means that unleaded Opal fuel is now a standard retail fuel product attracting the fuel subsidy in its own right, therefore effectively ending the Queensland Opal Trial.

Recommendation 20

That Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments develop systems to secure premium and other sniffable fuels at key roadhouses and townships which can then be applied in larger centres such as Alice Springs.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation, noting that it has already been implemented.

Recommendation 21

That the Commonwealth:
undertake a study with BP Australia to determine the potential to increase the current 20 million litres production capacity at Kwinana; and
approach other refineries to use their existing production capacity to produce Opal.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation, noting that it has already been implemented.
In May 2006, BP Australia advised that it has increased its capacity to enable production of up to 40 million litres of Opal fuel per annum from their refinery.
The Australian Government continues to work with key stakeholders to ensure the availability of low aromatic fuel, however no other fuel refiners have committed to producing Opal fuel or an equivalent.

Recommendation 22

That the Commonwealth Government discuss with BP Australia what role they may have to assist the distribution of information on Opal and the distribution of Opal identification stickers.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation, noting that it has already been implemented.
As a part of its Opal Fuel Communication Strategy, DOHA is working closely with BP Australia to develop consistent and credible messages and branding about Opal fuel for a range of target audiences, including tourists.

Recommendation 23

That the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments examine the procedure at Maningrida whereby contracts are used to prevent contractors bringing regular unleaded petrol into their communities and facilitate the adaptation and spread of this technique to other communities.

Response


The government will give further consideration to this recommendation, noting that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee reaffirmed it in Recommendation 7 of its 2009 report Grasping the opportunity of Opal: Assessing the impact of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy. The government understands that a number of State and Territory governments have included or are planning to include similar clauses in their contracts.
A number of significant legal and operational issues would need to be addressed before this recommendation could be implemented. These include:
ensuring the clause is consistent and applicable across all Australian Government contracts and funding agreements that may be operating within a designated area;
whether the clause should be made mandatory, and the implications of this for monitoring compliance and enforcement;
how best to define “areas where petrol sniffing is a problem” in a way that is legally meaningful for the purposes of a contract, particularly in circumstances where a contract may apply across a broad area or where the nature of petrol sniffing is sporadic and opportunistic; and
the extent of the obligations that should be imposed on service providers to prevent regular unleaded petrol entering a community.
 

Attachment A

Eight Point Plan
Petrol Sniffing Strategy
The Petrol Sniffing Strategy takes an integrated regional approach to addressing the problem of petrol sniffing in Indigenous communities and is implemented through an Eight Point Plan.
The Petrol Sniffing Strategy Eight Point Plan was announced in September 2005. Initially funded for three years this Plan consists of the following components.
1. A consistent legal framework
2. Appropriate levels of policing
3. Further roll out of Opal Fuel
4. Alternative activities for young people
5. Treatment and respite facilities
6. Communication and education strategies
7. Strengthening and supporting communities
8. Evaluation.

COMBINED AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO TWO SENATE COMMITTEE REPORTS ON PETROL SNIFFING IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES


PART B: Australian Government response to


Grasping the opportunity of Opal: Assessing the impact of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy

Report of the Community Affairs References Committee (2009)
June 2010

Recommendation 1

Given that DoHA provides assistance with the supply of Opal fuel to any community that requests it, and that there was no evidence given to the Committee to indicate that communities were aware of this, the Committee recommends that the department actively promote this option in a way that is accessible and well understood by Indigenous people and their communities.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation.  Given that the rollout of Opal fuel is now undertaken in a more targeted and regional approach, the Australian Government will re-examine how it promotes the availability of Opal fuel.
When Opal fuel first became available in 2005 there was rapid uptake of the product. During the 2005-06 and 2006-07 financial years 66 new sites commenced receiving Opal fuel. 
The majority of these sites had significant issues with petrol sniffing or were located in close proximity to a community experiencing petrol sniffing. The introduction of Opal fuel offered an immediate solution to reduce the impact of petrol sniffing on their communities. Most of these sites were aware of the assistance provided to supply Opal fuel because they approached the government to receive the product.
Following the initial growth of the Opal fuel initiative and after securing increased production capacity for up to 40 million litres per annum in 2006, the rollout to new sites is managed in a more targeted way with a focus on supplying Opal fuel across a region.
Communities and sites are identified to supply Opal fuel with the assistance of Indigenous Coordination Centres, DoHA state offices, Government Business Managers, State and Territory governments and non-government organisations. The introduction of Opal fuel is only undertaken after a consultation process with local stakeholders where communication needs are identified and fuel distribution is organised.
To ensure the availability of Opal fuel and its impact are more effectively communicated to Indigenous communities, DoHA will examine options to improve internal communications with Indigenous Coordination Centres and Government Business Managers who provide vital intelligence and linkages at the local level.

Recommendation 2

That any future rollout of Opal fuel be accompanied by an appropriate communication strategy that is implemented well in advance of the rollout. As such, the Committee urges the government as a matter of priority to finalise the revised communication strategy before the next phase of the rollout of Opal fuel. The Committee does not consider that this should cause any delay to the further rollout of Opal fuel. 

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation, noting that a communication strategy to support the ongoing rollout of Opal fuel has been finalised in the context of ongoing PSS Communications activity being developed and carried out as part of the PSS Eight Point Plan.
The additional $38.5 million over four years provided for Opal fuel by the Australian Government in the 2010 Budget includes funding for the implementation of the communication strategy.
 A key component of the rollout of Opal fuel to new sites is a communication strategy that addresses the need to educate residents, key stakeholders and tourists about the effectiveness and reliability of Opal fuel, and that overcomes any negative perceptions about the product.
As communication requirements vary from site to site due to locality and demographic, a broad overarching communication strategy has been developed. The Opal Fuel Communication Strategy provides a framework for research, supporting communication activities and materials, community and stakeholder engagement, a media strategy, advertising and web based communications. This framework will be adapted and applied to individual sites and regions as Opal fuel is introduced or if the need for renewed communication messages is identified in areas that already supply Opal fuel.
As a part of the Opal Fuel Communication Strategy, DoHA is working closely with BP Australia to develop consistent and credible messages and branding about Opal fuel for a range of target audiences, including tourists.

Recommendation 3

That Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland provide similar mechanisms to those in place in the Northern Territory which empower individual communities to ban the importation, supply and sale of regular petrol and other volatile substances in a designated local council or shire area.

Response


The Australian Government notes this recommendation.

The government recognises the importance of local solutions to substance misuse problems.  Measures empowering communities to regulate volatile substances in a designated local council or shire area fall within State and Territory responsibility and are currently in place in Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. Specific regimes are as follow:
Western Australia:  Section 206 of the Criminal Code 1913 (WA), which creates an offence of supplying an “intoxicant” (including volatile substances) to a person likely to abuse it. It applies both to the sale or supply of such substances. In addition, under the Aboriginal Communities Act 1979 (WA), the council of an Aboriginal community is permitted to make by-laws dealing with a number of matters, including “the prohibition, restriction or regulation of the possession, use or supply of alcoholic liquor or deleterious substances”.  The term “deleterious substances” is not defined.
Queensland:  Section 23 of the Summary Offences Act 2005 (QLD), which makes it an offence to sell a “potentially harmful thing” to another person if the seller:
“knows or believes, on reasonable grounds, that the other person—
(a) intends to inhale or ingest the thing; or
(b) intends to sell the thing to another person for inhalation or ingestion whether by that person or someone else.”
In addition, Aboriginal councils may make by-laws and subordinate by-laws about any matter, so long as they follow the procedure set down in Part 7 of the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984 (QLD) for the making of by-laws.
South Australia:  The Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA), which contains three separate offence provisions, covering the sale or supply of volatile solvents, the purchase of volatile solvents at the request of another person, and the sale or supply of petrol to a person under 16.  In addition, under section 42D of the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981 (SA), there is a specific offence of sale or supply of a “regulated substance” on the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, knowing or with reason to suspect that the person to whom it is sold or supplied will inhale or consume it.  This includes participation in or possession for the purpose of sale or supply.  “Regulated substance” is currently defined to mean petrol.  This offence carries a maximum penalty of $50,000 or imprisonment for 10 years.
The government will continue to monitor progress on these matters.

Recommendation 4

While the Committee recognises the importance of a local ‘on the ground’, coordinated presence for the effective implementation of the Eight Point Plan, it is concerned about CAPSSU’s ability to effectively implement the Petrol Sniffing Strategy.  The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth government immediately commission an independent review of the role and function of CAPSSU, specifically:
its capacity to implement the strategy effectively;
whether its current location in the Alice Springs ICC as part of FaHCSIA delivers the requisite level of accountability and governance standards;
processes in place for the effective ongoing monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the Unit’s role;
its ability to effectively engage and consult with Indigenous people and communities; and
the effectiveness of the tri-state whole of government approach including the staffing and collaboration between departments.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation and notes that it commissioned an independent review of CAPSSU in 2009. That review report was received at the end of 2009. The review found that CAPSSU has made a significant contribution to the implementation of the PSS, particularly in the area of diversionary activities for young people.
The review also identified several opportunities for enabling CAPSSU to draw on the full range of resources available in the community, in achieving a better-integrated implementation of the PSS. These include:
addressing the barriers to cooperation and collaboration, to reaffirm CAPSSU’s role as the body with oversight of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy in the Northern Territory  and across State and Territory borders;
better aligning CAPSSU’s work with parallel activities within the broader volatile substances area; and
strengthening the governance arrangements and program frameworks within CAPSSU, to provide greater transparency, program logic and accountability to the work of the unit.
The government welcomes the key findings and recommendations of the report and significant whole-of-government work in response to the report is underway under the supervision of the PSS SES Steering Committee and in consultation with CAPSSU. This will inform the next phase of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy, and build on the strategy’s significant outcomes to date in reducing sniffing rates in remote Indigenous communities. 

Recommendation 5

Given the continuing resistance to Opal fuel by some retailers across all jurisdictions in central Australia, the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth government complete, as a matter of priority, the necessary work to determine whether legislation is both possible and practicable. If these retailers do not voluntarily agree to supply Opal within six months, and if it is established that there are no legal impediments to the implementation of Commonwealth legislation, the Commonwealth government should immediately commence the drafting of legislation to mandate the supply of Opal fuel within the petrol sniffing strategy zone.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation in part.

In June 2009, DoHA engaged the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the legislative options to mandate the supply of Opal fuel and control the sale of PULP in designated regions of Australia.
The study examined the voluntary roll out of Opal fuel in three different analysis areas, and considered the long and short term outcomes and costs of the program, balanced against benefits to individuals, communities and governments. The legislative options for mandating supply of Opal fuel were also examined.
A broad range of stakeholders were consulted including: Indigenous communities; fuel retailers and distributors; health organisations, non-government organisations and government officials (including community-based government officials and police). 
The final report of the study was received in January 2010 and is now available on DoHA’s website at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-oatsih-pspp-reports
The cost-benefit analysis concluded that the community benefits exceeded the costs, both in the short and the long term.  However, the study also noted that the conclusions were based on limited data on the prevalence of petrol sniffing and that fuel storage and distribution issues needed to be addressed to enable a full roll out of Opal fuel in northern Australia.
The Australian Government has provided $38.5 million, over four years, in the 2010 Budget to enhance the current voluntary roll out of Opal fuel. This funding will be used to:
establish new storage facilities for Opal fuel in Darwin and northern Queensland.  These new facilities will enable Opal fuel to be delivered to 39 new sites in the East Kimberley of Western Australia, the Top End of the Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria region in Queensland.  In addition, the storage facilities will also ensure a more reliable supply of Opal fuel to Indigenous communities already receiving Opal fuel;
implement a communication strategy both with the roll out of Opal fuel and to sites already receiving Opal fuel; and
implement a surveillance system to collect data on the impact of Opal fuel and the broader Petrol Sniffing Strategy. This monitoring system will collect information on the prevalence of petrol sniffing, switching to other substances and individual and community behavioural changes.
The information collected through the surveillance system will be used by the government to inform future decisions regarding the value of an additional legislative approach once the full voluntary roll out of Opal fuel has occurred in 2012-13.
There are currently only a small number of retailers refusing to supply Opal fuel. The new funding will address the reasons some of these retailers have given for not supplying Opal fuel. This includes initiatives to ensure:
increased communication about Opal fuel to address myths about the fuel’s reliability;
communication about Opal fuel targeted at tourists to address concerns that the fuel is bad for tourism; and
the roll out of Opal fuel occurs on a regional basis in northern Australia to address concerns that individual retailers will be disadvantaged if they supply Opal fuel.

Recommendation 6

In the event that the introduction of Commonwealth legislation is not possible, the Committee recommends that State and Territory governments introduce legislation to mandate the supply of Opal within the petrol sniffing strategy zone.

Response


The Australian Government notes this recommendation.

Please see comments in response to recommendation 5 above.

Recommendation 7

Given that the Committee in its 2006 report recommended that all governments replicate the procedure used in Maningrida to prevent contractors bringing regular unleaded petrol into communities by making it a term of contract, the Committee reaffirms this recommendation and recommends that contracts for service in areas where petrol sniffing is a problem contain terms which prevent regular unleaded fuel entering the community and require that all other volatile substances and inhalants be locked away when not in use.

Response


The government will give further consideration to this recommendation and understands that a number of State and Territory governments have included or are planning to include similar clauses in their contracts.
A number of significant legal and operational issues would need to be addressed before this recommendation could be implemented.  These include:
ensuring the clause is consistent and applicable across all Australian Government contracts and funding agreements that may be operating within a designated area;
whether the clause should be made mandatory, and the implications of this for monitoring compliance and enforcement;
how best to define “areas where petrol sniffing is a problem” in a way that is legally meaningful for the purposes of a contract, particularly in circumstances where a contract may apply across a broad area or where the nature of petrol sniffing is sporadic and opportunistic; and
the extent of the obligations that should be imposed on service providers to prevent regular unleaded petrol entering a community.
The government notes that preventing contractors from bringing regular unleaded petrol into communities is just one of a number of measures that may be employed to control the supply and use of petrol in areas where petrol sniffing is a problem. 
Other measures that would complement this strategy include the use of alternative low aromatic fuels such as Opal, council by-laws and relevant State and Territory legislation such as the Volatile Substance Abuse Prevention Act 2005 (NT).  By way of example, this Act already enables communities in the Northern Territory to create area management plans to manage the possession, supply and use of volatile substances in a particular area defined by the community. It is a criminal offence under the Act for a person to contravene an approved community management plan. The government understands that a number of communities in the Northern Territory have approved community management plans in place.

Recommendation 8

The Committee reaffirms its previous recommendation that the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments revise and agree upon priorities to consolidate and extend the rollout of Opal fuel to utilise the current production capacity of 40 million litres per annum. The immediate focus should be on:
delivering a comprehensive exclusion zone in central Australia;
the option of establishing a bulk storage facility in Darwin in order to provide a sustainable long-term distribution system in northern Australia; and
actively expanding the rollout of Opal fuel to the far west coast region of South Australia and Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation and notes that its current priorities for the rollout of Opal fuel align with the Committee’s recommended focus.

Delivering a Comprehensive Exclusion Zone in Central Australia

To deliver a comprehensive exclusion zone in central Australia, the areas surrounding the central desert region are being targeted for the rollout of Opal fuel. The immediate focus is the rollout to Laverton and the Goldfields region of Western Australia and Coober Pedy in South Australia.
Discussions have commenced with fuel distributors servicing Laverton and the Goldfields area (located further west of the existing Central Desert Region) regarding a broader rollout of Opal fuel to this region. The comprehensive rollout in Laverton and the Goldfields could see an additional nine sites commence supplying Opal fuel. This will help reduce the amount of regular unleaded petrol being taken onto the Ngaanyatjarra Lands including Warburton.
To support the rollout in this region, the Australian Government is working with BP Australia to establish bulk storage for Opal fuel in Kalgoorlie, announced in March 2010. Establishing storage in the area will help guarantee continuity of supply to the region.
This rollout will occur in the 2010-11 financial year with a targeted communication campaign to support Opal fuel’s introduction.
The town of Coober Pedy has been approached to supply Opal fuel to prevent the continued trafficking of petrol into the APY Lands for sniffing purposes and also to limit the migration of sniffers to Coober Pedy to access regular unleaded fuel. Initial discussions have commenced with local government and key stakeholders in the community. To date these groups have given support to the rollout to all service stations in the town. A communication strategy informed by community and stakeholder consultation will be implemented to support the rollout of Opal fuel to this town.

Bulk Storage Facility in northern Australia

The 2010 Budget has provided an additional $38.5 million to continue the current voluntary rollout of Opal fuel by addressing storage and distribution issues. Under the new measure, storage facilities for Opal fuel will be established in the Top End of Australia including Darwin in the Northern Territory and Northern Queensland.  Establishing these facilities will enable Opal fuel to be provided to an additional 39 sites surrounding 11 Indigenous communities with known petrol sniffing issues.
The storage facilities are expected to be ready for use in 2012-13.

Expanding the Rollout of Opal Fuel to the Far West Coast Region of South Australia and Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory

Yalata and Nullarbor Region

The community of Yalata is approved to receive Opal fuel but does not currently have a working fuel pump. A working group lead by the Indigenous Coordination Centre in Ceduna is assisting Yalata Community Council with a project to establish a supply of Opal fuel to Yalata. The Commonwealth Government together with the South Australian Government is providing funding to obtain a stand alone fuel unit to supply Opal fuel to the community. This project is being undertaken as a trial of this facility in a community.
 The project timeframes have been extended due to a number of complexities surrounding approval of the site for the fuel unit. The extension also ensures that the project is implemented in line with Yalata Community’s requirements and in a way that makes certain that this project remains viable in years to come.  
The immediate priority in the region is the provision of Opal fuel to the Yalata Community. The further rollout of Opal fuel to the Nullarbor region will be considered following the supply of Opal fuel at Yalata and whether a need for the introduction of Opal fuel beyond Yalata is identified.

Arnhem Land

The majority of communities in this region participated in the Comgas Scheme and switched to Opal fuel shortly after its introduction in 2005. There are currently 13 sites receiving Opal fuel in Arnhem Land.
To support the existing sites in Arnhem Land, Opal fuel will be introduced to surrounding regions including Katherine/Mataranka and Kakadu National Park/Jabiru.  The establishment of a storage facility in Darwin will provide a reliable and sustainable supply chain for Opal fuel to this region allowing these rollouts to progress. 
Initial conversations with fuel retailers and other local stakeholders in these regions produced a generally positive response to the introduction of Opal fuel, with the proviso that all retailers agree to switch. 
It is anticipated that Kakadu National Park/Jabiru will introduce Opal fuel in 2010-11 under interim distribution arrangements with sites in Katherine/Mataranka being added in 2011-12.
The rollout of Opal fuel to these regions will be supported by a communication campaign informed by the results of community consultation.

Recommendation 9

The Committee considers that the Guidelines for the Responsible Sale of Premium Unleaded Petrol are a necessary response to the availability of sniffable premium fuel and recommends the Commonwealth government finalise and distribute the guidelines without delay, making sure that adequate support is provided to ensure their implementation.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation.

The Guidelines for the Responsible Sale of Premium Unleaded Petrol were printed in March 2009 and are now being disseminated to service stations that supply both premium unleaded petrol and Opal fuel, and also to Opal fuel distributors.
Initial dissemination of the Guidelines has been targeted to service stations and roadhouses in Alice Springs and the Central Desert Region that supply premium unleaded petrol. An officer from DoHA has conducted site visits to a number of these service stations to explain the Guidelines and to provide assistance with their implementation.
Through funding provided by DoHA, the Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service (CAYLUS) will also assist with the Guidelines’ implementation by working with fuel retailers to encourage and support their introduction. This is similar to work already undertaken by CAYLUS around the responsible sale of solvents.

Recommendation 10

That twelve months after the distribution of the Guidelines for the Responsible Sale of Premium Unleaded Petrol the Commonwealth government undertake an audit of both the uptake and effectiveness of the guidelines in reducing access to premium fuel for the purpose of sniffing.
Subsequently, if the audit finds that these guidelines are not proving effective, the Committee recommends that, while conscious of the potential commercial costs, consideration is given to subsidising the development of an Opal equivalent substitute for premium fuel.

Response


The Australian Government notes this recommendation and will continue to monitor and review the uptake of the Guidelines in new and existing regions where Opal fuel and premium unleaded petrol are sold side by side.
The Australian Government is not presently considering the option to fund the development of low aromatic premium unleaded petrol. In the event that a suitable substitute is developed and presented to government, options to subsidise this product’s production and distribution may be considered.
No fuel supplier has indicated an ability to produce a low aromatic premium substitute to date. Information from BP Australia suggests that the low volume of premium unleaded fuel sold in the designated petrol sniffing zones means that any premium substitute would have to be heavily subsidised by the Australian Government. The subsidy is likely to be considerably higher than the subsidy paid currently to BP for Opal fuel.

Recommendation 11

That the Commonwealth government, as a matter of priority, expand current efforts to improve data collection on the prevalence and trends over time in relation to petrol sniffing and substance abuse in Indigenous communities so as to collect comparable data across all jurisdictions.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation and notes that significant progress has been achieved to date in improving the quality and consistency of data being collected on petrol sniffing and other substance abuse. Recent initiatives include the following.
A set of indicators to monitor petrol sniffing prevalence and effects commissioned by DoHA from James Cook University  in December 2006. These indicators were used to collect baseline prevalence, health and social outcomes data relating to petrol sniffing in 74 remote Indigenous communities that had recently begun using Opal fuel.
The final report was not available for public release due to the sensitivity of the community information. However, a summary of the report, including key findings, was publicly released on 1 May 2008 and is published at the following site: http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-oatsih-pspp-reports.
DoHA contracted James Cook University to undertake data collection from the East Kimberley region, and the Tangentyere Council to undertake data collection in Alice Springs Town Camps. All of the data collection projects employed the same methodology to ensure data consistency.
DoHA commissioned from James Cook University an impact evaluation of the roll-out of Opal fuel to:
identify the impact of the roll-out in contributing to changes in the prevalence of petrol sniffing and other outcomes, including any potential unintended consequences; and
identify and analyse the range of factors that determine the success or otherwise of the outcomes of the Opal fuel roll-out.
The evaluation included a second round of data collection on the prevalence of petrol sniffing from a sample of 20 communities where baseline data was previously collected. The selection of 20 communities provided a representative sample across jurisdictions where petrol sniffing has been a problem and of the different manifestations of petrol sniffing. This data collection utilised the same methodology to ensure the full impact of Opal fuel was measured. 
The Evaluation of the Impact of Opal Fuel was finalised in October 2008 and the report’s Executive Summary is publicly available on DoHA’s website at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-oatsih-pspp-reports. 
The Evaluation’s conclusions pointed to an overall decrease in the number of people petrol sniffing and the frequency of sniffing in 17 out of the 20 communities in the data collection sample. Across the whole sample there was a decrease of 431 (70 per cent) in the number of people sniffing between baseline and follow up. Of particular significance is the finding that:
“Central Australia and the APY Lands are the regions with the largest decreases in petrol sniffing, with 94% and 93% decreases respectively.”
DoHA will be collecting petrol sniffing prevalence data annually. This data collection will use the same sample and methodology that was used in the Evaluation of the Impact of Opal Fuel, and it will monitor the prevalence and frequency of all volatile substance use.
FaHCSIA has also completed Baseline Community Profiles in a number of communities across the PSS Zones, including communities in the East Kimberley.  FaHCSIA will continue to develop further profiles over the next 12 months.  These profiles examine a range of aspects in communities including housing, health, early childhood, education, employment and substance abuse. Baseline data on the instances, prevalence and frequency of petrol sniffing for the Central Desert Region was collected at the commencement of the PSS.
As part of the review of the Central Australian Petrol Sniffing Strategy Unit (CAPSSU) referred to in the response to Recommendation 4 of this Part, an appropriate methodology will be identified to help CAPSSU take on a stronger coordinating role in the future, in monitoring the prevalence and trends over time of petrol sniffing and other substance abuse in Indigenous communities. This methodology will allow data to be compared across jurisdictions and will be linked with the data collection processes of other agencies (such as DoHA), to ensure the full impact of petrol sniffing problems and interventions are measured.
The 2010-11 Budget has provided funding to establish an ongoing annual surveillance system to monitor the incidence and prevalence of petrol sniffing and transference to other substances. This annual data collection will also assist to evaluate the effectiveness of the Opal fuel program and other interventions that affect petrol sniffing prevalence.

Recommendation 12

That the Commonwealth government, in partnership with State and Territory governments, provide adequate resources to enable the extension of quality youth services and the employment of a male and a female youth worker for each community in the Petrol Sniffing Strategy zones.

Response


The government notes this recommendation. State and Territory governments have primary responsibility for funding of youth services. The Commonwealth’s role is complementary to State and Territory funding. The government acknowledges the importance of sustainable youth services to effectively address the underlying causes of petrol sniffing and other forms of substance abuse in remote Indigenous communities.  
The government has to date provided considerable funding and support for youth services through the PSS and complementary Australian Government programs that cut across a number portfolio areas. Notable examples of projects that have direct relevance to PSS Zones include the following.
$12 million over three years (April 2007 – March 2010) to fund the Northern Territory Integrated Youth Services Project, the primary youth diversion and community development activity in central Australia under the PSS.  The Project provided integrated structured youth services to Finke (Aputula), Docker River (Kaltukatjara), Imanpa and Mutitjulu and included $4 million in supporting infrastructure. These projects have been transitioned to the NPY Women’s Council under funding awarded through the Closing the Gap in the Northern Territory Youth in Communities measure (a total of $27 million for the measure) in early 2010.
$18 million over two years (2007-08 and 2008-09) under the Northern Territory Emergency Response Youth Alcohol Diversion measure to fund a wide range of diversionary activities and youth focused infrastructure projects throughout the Northern Territory. The measure complements the PSS by providing additional resources to address youth substance abuse in Indigenous communities. Funded projects include the development of a Northern Territory Youth Development Network in the West Arnhem and Daly River regions and medium to large scale youth diversion projects and recreational infrastructure in central Australia.  A number of these projects have been developed in partnership with Local Government Shires and the Northern Territory Government.
Funding to provide youth worker accommodation and other supporting infrastructure including:
$3.4 million in 2008-09 from the Aboriginals Benefit Account was provided to the Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service (CAYLUS) (under the auspice of Tangentyere Council) to fund infrastructure projects in the Expanded Central Australian Petrol Sniffing Strategy Zone, including the construction/refurbishment of recreation halls in seven communities and the construction of youth worker accommodation in four communities.
$2.7 million (2006-07 and 2007-08) to construct five duplex units to house youth workers in Warburton, Warakurna, Wanarn, Jameson and Blackstone in the Ngaanyatjarra Lands in Western Australia. This allowed for the expansion of the Shire’s youth network through the engagement of additional youth workers.
Funding of $1.34 million in 2008-09 for the CAYLUS Youth Wellbeing Program. This Program provides education, prevention and diversionary activities to Indigenous communities, with a focus on inhalant misuse including petrol sniffing, and has received DoHA funding since 2001. Following positive evaluation results in 2007, DoHA has committed to fund the CAYLUS Youth Wellbeing Program until the end of the 2011-12 financial year.
A contribution of approximately $2.4 million (2008-09 and 2009-10) towards the development of the Shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley Youth Network and the Halls Creek Youth Services Network Coordination Hub. Both of these projects expanded existing youth services, identified service delivery gaps, implemented new youth activities and facilitated capacity building to support ongoing activities in several East Kimberley communities including Kununurra, Wyndham, Kalumburu, Oombulgarri, Halls Creek, Halls Creek town camps, Balgo, Mulan, Bililuna, Warmun and Ringer Soak.
In addition to these initiatives, the government is also investing in a range of sporting activities, particularly in remote areas. Examples include:
a funding contribution towards the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands Multi-Sports Activities Regional Partnership Agreement (RPA). The RPA provides for structured inter-community sports competitions across APY communities including a very successful and popular inter-community Australian Football League (AFL) competition, regular multi-sports activities for young people throughout the year, and recreation activities such as horse riding, BMX and motocross;
joint funding of an AFL Club Fostership Program and AFL Ambassadors for Life Mentoring Program with the Australian Football League in 2007, to promote healthy, active lifestyles and increased school attendance for youth in selected Indigenous communities (mainly in the Northern Territory), and to provide mentoring from Indigenous Australian Rules players, as positive role models to over 100 Indigenous young people from around Australia; and
funding to expand AFL activities in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia, through the employment of a Community Development Officer, an administrator to manage football activities in the region, and two AFL Indigenous trainees to help deliver schools-based programs.
In the May 2009 Budget, the government announced funding of $28.4 million over three years under FaHCSIA’s Youth in Communities (YIC) measure, to support the establishment of a comprehensive youth strategy for the Northern Territory. The government has worked in consultation with the Northern Territory Government to develop the broad directions, service principles and projects to be funded through this strategy, and to oversee delivery of the initiative over the next three years. For more information about the YIC measure, please see the response to Recommendation 15 of this Part (below).
Improving the coordination of youth services is a high priority for the government.
The Australian Government released the National Strategy for Young Australians in April 2010. This Strategy sets out a vision for all young people to lead safe, healthy and happy lives. It provides a framework to guide Australian Government investment in young people, highlights what the Australian Government is already doing to support young Australians as well as the areas where Government can and will do better.
The government is committed to developing youth service models that are sustainable, appropriate and relevant to individual community needs. Building the capacity of local people to run diversionary activities is particularly important, and is already occurring in a number of funded projects such as the Mt Theo Substance Abuse Program and the Northern Territory Integrated Youth Services Project. Pilot projects are also being funded to provide important training and employment opportunities for local Aboriginal people in youth work.

Recommendation 13

The Committee reaffirms Recommendation 17 from its 2006 report which called upon Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to provide additional funding to new and existing rehabilitation facilities in order to provide a quality service while meeting current demand.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation.

DoHA provided additional funding of $3.89 million over three years from the 2007 COAG substance use measure to new and existing services that provide petrol sniffing programs. The funding enhanced service delivery through increased bed occupancy and/or increased scope and reach of services for young people in Central and the Top End of the Northern Territory.
The additional funding provided under the 2007 COAG substance use measure was a whole of government initiative and as such required joint consideration from the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments.
The Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) Northern Territory Office in collaboration with the Northern Territory Government will continue to monitor the demand for services and need for additional funding in Central and the Top End of the Northern Territory.
The Australian Government through DoHA currently provides ongoing funding to services through the Substance Use program, COAG funding and the Northern Territory Emergency Response measures to organisations for residential and non–residential rehabilitation services in the Central Australia Zone (that includes the Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian areas of Central Australia):
Warlpiri Youth Development (Mt Theo);
Drug and Alcohol Services Association Alice Springs Incorporated (Northern Territory);
Ilpurla Aboriginal Corporation (Northern Territory);
Bush Mob NT (funded by OATSIH through the Northern Territory Government over two years);
Central Australian Youth Link-up Service (CAYLUS);
Sunrise Health Service Aboriginal Association; and
Miwatj Health.

Recommendation 14
          

The Committee considers the provision of successful programs in remote Indigenous communities to be a highly specialised area for which mainstream programs and ‘one size fits all’ solutions are not necessarily appropriate. The Committee recommends that in order to maximise local ownership and effectiveness of programs, the awarding of contracts in remote Indigenous communities must take into consideration a tenderer’s:
on the ground presence, reputation and standing in the region;
existing relationships, networks within the region and support or endorsement from communities; and
ability to provide tailored programs to individual communities or groups of communities in response to the diverse cultural expectations, kinship systems and protocols of the region.

Response


The Australian Government accepts this recommendation in principle.

The government agrees with the principle of ensuring that appropriate knowledge and abilities are taken into account in any procurement or funding process, particularly those involving remote Indigenous communities with specialised needs that do not readily fit into mainstream programs. Program funding is awarded to providers through competitive application processes (either open or selective) undertaken as prescribed under the Commonwealth Financial Management and Accountability Act (FMA).
Specific requirements under the FMA include the need to ensure that any spending proposal is an efficient, effective and ethical use of Commonwealth resources that is not inconsistent with the policies of the Commonwealth.
The policy requirements are set out in the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines (CGGs), as well as other relevant policies and legislation relating for example to privacy, anti-discrimination and social inclusion. These guide assessment panels in awarding funding to providers who have submitted applications.
In particular, the CGGs set out key principles for grants administration. These include probity and transparency, and achieving value with public money.
Under the internal guidance given to officials conducting tender processes involving program funding, high-level principles must be applied in any government selection process.
In December 2009 Northern Territory State Office and CAPSSU hosted an information session for agencies and non government organisations who wished to submit tenders for funding under the Youth in Communities measure. This allowed the prospective tendering agencies the opportunity to ask detailed questions regarding the process and what information needed to be in tender documents to satisfy the tender requirements. Positive feedback was received from the participant agencies and consideration will be given to providing information sessions of this nature for future tender processes.

Recommendation 15

The Committee reaffirms the recommendation of its 2006 report that the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments immediately provide long term flexible funding, especially for successful programs already operating in communities, to address the sporadic nature and short term focus of current funding models.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that funding for the Petrol Sniffing Strategy was made ongoing in 2007; and that long term funding is also being provided through complementary programs.
The Northern Territory Integrated Youth Services Project, for example, was funded over three years (April 2007 – March 2010) through a single funding agreement with FaHCSIA, the Attorney-General’s Department and DEEWR.  It was the primary youth diversion and community development project under phase one of the Petrol Sniffing Strategy.  The provision of three year funding allowed these departments to work with the provider, Mission Australia, to put in place a coordinated and complementary response to the problems of petrol sniffing in Finke, Imanpa, Docker River and Mutitjulu. The services provided under this contract were transitioned to the NPY Women’s Council in April 2010, with funding provided until 2012 under the Youth in Communities measure.
Longer term youth funding was also provided under the Northern Territory Emergency Response.  In the May 2009 Budget, the government announced that it will invest $28.4 million over the next three years (2009-10 to 2011-12) under the Youth in Communities measure, to develop a comprehensive youth strategy in the Northern Territory. This builds on the $18 million that has already been provided under the Northern Territory Emergency Response Youth Alcohol Diversion measure. As a complementary program to the Petrol Sniffing Strategy, Youth in Communities funding will provide longer term planning certainty in seeding the development of a sustainable network of youth services in the Northern Territory. It will also enable the government to work in closer partnership with the Northern Territory Government in establishing the broad directions, service principles and type of projects to be funded under this strategy. 
The government is also implementing flexible funding arrangements to make it easier for communities to respond to emerging priorities, flowing from local planning processes. The Indigenous Capability and Development Program administered by FaHCSIA, for example, provides a mechanism for developing flexible solutions and opportunities through better coordination and targeting of funding to locally identified priorities. A number of service streams under this program, such as the Indigenous Communities Strategic Investment (ICSI) Fund, also funds projects that extend beyond a single year. Indigenous Coordination Centre Managers can also approve the release of funding from ICSI locally.

Recommendation 16

That governments, and departments within governments, work to design application and accountability processes which avoid duplication and reduce the number of contracts that service providers are required to enter into and aspire to a single contract where possible. This is to minimise the reporting and administrative burden on service providers. The Committee notes that governments should aspire to providing a single contract where possible.

Response


The government notes this recommendation, acknowledges the benefits for an organisation of a single agreement and recognises the challenges involved in creating one. Work is being progressed to reduce and streamline reporting requirements and the administrative burden on Indigenous organisations funded by the government.
The Cross Agency Working Group on Indigenous Funding and Governance Reform, formerly under the auspice of the Secretaries Group for Indigenous Affairs and now overseen by the Executive Coordination Forum for Indigenous Affairs (ECFIA), has identified a number of areas where significant progress can be made to improve the interaction between government funding processes and Indigenous organisations. 
DoHA consistently reviews its risk assessment and monitoring processes in an endeavour to reduce the impact on Indigenous service providers. In 2008, DoHA undertook a minor review of its risk assessment framework. This review resulted in a reduction to the frequency of risk assessments for organisations with “low” or “medium” risk ratings, from annual to biennial. DoHA is also considering reducing the information that is required as part of the risk assessment for those organisations which have been accredited under organisational/management accreditation standards, such as the Quality Improvement Council or International Organisation for Standards.
In addition, the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) within DoHA is moving forward with reforms of its reporting requirements, and in May 2009 undertook further consultation with key stakeholders based on the directions proposed in the Consultation Paper: Review of Reporting Requirements for OATSIH funded Organisations (available on DoHA’s website at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-oatsih-pspp-reports.) The revised reporting requirements for OATSIH service providers will include a streamlined set of questions, with the phased implementation of a web-based reporting tool and improved reporting back to service providers. Feedback from the latest round of consultations is currently being reviewed, and will be used to guide implementation of the key elements of the framework, which are aimed at reducing the reporting and administrative burden on service providers.
FaHCSIA is also progressing work on the development of a standard data collection framework to ensure a consistent approach to data collection, including data for use across multiple programs. 
In addition, FaHCSIA is progressing work to reduce the number of funding agreements administered through its mainstream program areas. This is being achieved through the use of header agreements and the amalgamation of projects into one schedule per program. This initiative was introduced from 1 July 2009.  DEEWR also currently uses header agreements for programs under the Indigenous Education Targeted Assistance Act 2000. Each funded organisation has one agreement with one or more schedules (depending on the number of projects being delivered by the provider). 
In partnership with non-government agencies, the government finalised in February 2010 a National Compact with the Third Sector. This compact will ensure that the complementary roles of government and non-government stakeholders are fully aligned in order to maximise service delivery outcomes.
Through these measures, the government aims to reduce the administrative burden for Indigenous organisations, to facilitate more streamlined funding and reporting arrangements and to foster genuine partnerships in the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians.

Recommendation 17

That additional resources be provided for adult education classes in communities where the reduction in petrol sniffing has created a need for these services, and that appropriate adult education engagement and training methodologies are used, delivered by qualified adult educators.

Response


The government accepts this recommendation, noting the many benefits of adult education that addresses the multiple barriers faced by people previously involved in petrol sniffing and the long term disengaged.  These barriers may include ongoing mental health issues, low self-confidence and low literacy and numeracy levels.
Under the PSS, the government has funded five diversionary education and training projects in the PSS Zones.  These projects are based on the needs of individual communities and target disengaged people aged between 11 and 25 years. The projects help to address multiple barriers faced by young Indigenous Australians, including those who have been previously caught up in substance abuse, and to support them through a range of complementary interventions to engage with other programs and services. 
Some projects, such as the Mornington Island Parents as First Teachers Project, specifically target young adults, including people who have formerly misused volatile substances, who are unable to engage with mainstream schooling due to barriers such as their age. These projects provide participants with basic literacy, numeracy, support and pathways to help with their re-engagement with education. 
In the 2009 Budget the government announced that a further $21.6 million would be invested in the Workplace English Language and Literacy (WELL) program, to complement broader reforms to the Indigenous Employment Program which aim to make employment and training services more responsive to the specific needs of Indigenous job seekers.
This funding is in addition to the commitment already made by the government through DEEWR under programs such as:
Training Initiatives for Indigenous Adults in Regional and Remote Communities (TIFIARRC):  This program operates in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. The government has committed $21.4 million over four years (2008-11), with state jurisdictions jointly managing the program and providing matched funding.  TIFIARRC provides funding to attract, engage and support Indigenous adults in regional and remote communities to access vocational education and training opportunities, including the Australian Government’s additional training places as part of the Skilling Australia for the Future policy.  Funding is also available for projects to build the capacity of Indigenous training providers or develop new community-based providers. Preference is given to training that results in, or is linked to, Certificate Level II or above qualifications. 
While not specifically targeting petrol sniffing communities, the program has funded the delivery of Certificate II in Community Services Work and Certificate III in Aged Care Work to Community Development Employment Program and Home and Community Care kitchen workers on the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in South Australia. The Waltja Remote Youth Worker training project in the Alice Springs region also delivered accredited training in youth services for adults from up to six communities, comprising on the job learning and training tools developed with cultural advisors.
Language Literacy and Numeracy Program (LLNP):  This program delivers language, literacy and numeracy training to assist job seekers, including Indigenous Australians, to improve their language, literacy and numeracy skills so they can better achieve sustainable employment, education or training outcomes. In the Northern Territory Central Desert region, Structured Training and Employment Programs (STEP) Training is contracted to deliver LLNP training and assessment services.
Indigenous Employment Program (IEP): The IEP offers tailored solutions to assist employers to recruit, train and provide sustainable employment for Indigenous Australians.
Other DEEWR programs that provide Indigenous people, including those from remote communities, with the ability to engage with accredited training or university include:
The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program (IYMP) supports Indigenous youth who wish to move away from their home community to gain the qualifications they need to have a greater chance of obtaining sustainable employment in either their home community or elsewhere.
While IYMP is aimed primarily at 16–24 year old Indigenous young people from remote areas to take up an apprenticeship, or to undertake a VET or university course, young people from major towns and cities are also encouraged to apply to participate. They may, however, be required to relocate to an alternative host location, rather than the one nearest to their home. The program operates in 17 locations across the country.
Away from Base for ‘mixed mode’ delivery (AFB), provides funding to cover travel costs including fares, meals and accommodation, for eligible Indigenous students studying approved ‘mixed-mode’ courses, when they are required to travel away from their permanent home for a short period of time to undertake approved activities. This includes students required to attend short courses, field trips, occasional residential schools or practical placements. Eligible providers in the Higher Education and Vocational Educational and Training sectors administer this funding. 
Where it is more cost effective to do so, AFB funding can also be used to meet the travel costs of lecturers who travel to the home communities of students to deliver the face to face component of an approved ‘mixed-mode’ course.
The primary objective of AFB is to increase access and participation by Indigenous students from rural and remote areas in tertiary study (higher education and Vocational Education and Training), leading to increased enrolments and retention, improved educational outcomes and improved employment prospects, life choices and quality of life for Indigenous people.
A ‘mixed-mode’ course is a nationally accredited course that is delivered through a combination of distance education and face-to-face teaching for students who are based in their home communities and undertake occasional intensive study periods on campus.
A complementary program, ABSTUDY AFB, is administered by Centrelink.
The Youth Connections Program provides a holistic approach to servicing young people at risk including support for individual young people and the broader community. The Youth Connections program is available to eligible young people who are most at risk of disengaging, or already disengaged from education, family and/or the community. Service delivery will be characterised by flexible and individualised case management to young people to remain engaged or re-engage them with education and/or further training, and to improve their ability to make positive life choices. Youth Connections Providers will also work to strengthen and better coordinate services in their regions and build the capacity for key stakeholders.
The government will continue to promote these programs, and the benefits of adult education to these communities, including those where there has been a reduction in petrol sniffing. Any potential additional investment targeted to these communities, should continue to focus on addressing the multiple barriers faced by young Indigenous people.

Recommendation 18

The Committee reaffirms Recommendation 3 of its 2006 report that the Commonwealth government provide adequate additional resources to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner to monitor and report annually on the progress towards implementing the above mentioned recommendations until the Commissioner can report that all recommendations have been sufficiently addressed.

Response


The government notes this recommendation.

The government notes that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner currently monitors and reports on issues arising from petrol sniffing and substance abuse in the annual Social Justice reports.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2010-06-22,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the report of the committee, Review of administration and expenditure: No. 8––Australian intelligence agencies, and seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security’s oversight of the Australian intelligence community, the AIC, is a key element of our national security architecture. I am therefore pleased to present the eighth review of the administration and expenditure of the Australian intelligence community by the PJCIS.
This review examined a wide range of aspects of the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies, including the financial statements for each agency and their human resource management, training, recruitment and accommodation. The committee made a total of eight recommendations as a result of this review which cover a number of important issues that arose during the course of the inquiry. I will now refer to four of the committee’s recommendations in more detail.
During this review the committee found that a significant inconsistency exists in the committee’s oversight of the Australian intelligence community. The committee took evidence from a number of the agencies that they have attachments or secondments within the AFP. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and terrorist attacks in Bali, the AFP has been increasingly involved in counterterrorist activities and there are sections of the AFP that have been created to address significant counterterrorism and national security functions. It is clear to the committee that the AFP has evolved to include a significant intelligence function and that sections of the AFP have deep operational and intelligence linkages with the Australian intelligence community. The committee therefore recommends that the Intelligence Services Act 2001 be amended to include AFP counterterrorism elements in the list of organisations that the committee reviews.
The committee takes the view that, in considering parliamentary oversight of the AIC, it is essential that all of the agencies with a significant role in intelligence come before the same committee of the parliament. In order for parliamentary oversight to be effective all agencies need to report to the one committee. Without this oversight, it is inevitable that black spots in knowledge and supervision will dramatically impair the effectiveness of parliamentary oversight. ASIO, ASIS, DIO, DSD, DIGO and ONA all currently report to the intelligence and security committee. Requiring the AFP counterterrorism elements to appear before the PJCIS would reflect normal oversight practice as applied to all other Commonwealth departments and agencies.
The committee also examined the issue of access to information beyond administration and expenditure. In the committee’s view, it is clearly impossible to conduct any meaningful review of the administration and expenditure of the Australian intelligence community without knowledge of their activities, operations, skills, methods and the product they create all being made available to the committee. This has been acknowledged by previous committees and by the Australian intelligence community.
The committee therefore recommends that the government agree to amend the Intelligence Services Act to enable specific material which does not affect current operational activity to be provided to the committee. A small working group drawn from relevant departments, agencies and the committee should be set up to prepare this amendment for consideration by the government.
The review also examined archival practices as a result of the government’s proposal to reduce the open access period specified in the Archives Act 1983 from 30 to 20 years. The committee took evidence from all the agencies that moving from a 30-year archiving regime to a 20-year regime would result in an increased workload and increased redactions. On the evidence available to the committee the committee concludes that a document released at 20 years would be more redacted than one released at 30 years. This would have the unintended consequence of providing less information to the public than at present although providing it 10 years earlier. The committee recommends that, should the proposal to amend the open access period of the Archives Act 1983 proceed, consideration should be given to special provisions for the AIC documents to be exempted, on a case-by-case basis, from release at 20 years.
The committee took the opportunity afforded by this review to look at the budget of the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the OIGIS. The OIGIS’s budget has not grown in line with ASIO’s budget growth. In light of the increases in the number of personnel and activities of the AIC as well as an expansion in the IGIS’s role, the committee recommends that the budget of the OIGIS be increased.
Overall, the committee is satisfied that the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies is sound, and it thanks the heads of the Australian intelligence community agencies and all those who contributed to this review. Lastly, I would like to thank the secretariat. I commend the report to the Senate.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,39,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-22,"—I move:
That the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2010 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2010 No. 80 and made under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, be disallowed.
In September last year I moved a disallowance motion against the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009, which included strict liability provisions against pilots which were then and still are today internationally unprecedented and unacceptable. My motion last year was supported by both the opposition and the Australian Greens. I thank them for supporting last year’s common-sense motion to disallow the regulations. Imagine my surprise, then, when on Wednesday, 12 May, in the first sitting week since the six-month disallowance period expired, the government announced it was introducing near identical regulations under the Aviation Transport Security Act to come into effect on 22 May. Once again, under these regulations, it will be an offence of strict liability by a pilot if the cockpit door is not locked when the aircraft is in flight. For example, if a pilot in command while flying his or her aircraft called someone from the cabin crew into the cockpit and the crew member accidentally failed to lock the cockpit door securely, under these regulations the pilot would be held liable. Because the regulations specify the pilot in command, another potential scenario could be that the pilot in command takes a break and is out of the cockpit when the pilot navigating the plane accidentally leaves the door open. Even in this circumstance, the pilot in command would be held liable. Under the offence of strict liability, only the act needs to be proven for someone to be found guilty. It is something that airline pilots in Australia have been very critical of, very concerned about, and at an international level there has been comment made about it. I will go to that shortly.
This regulation shows how poorly thought out these regulations are. During the recent Senate estimates, Mr Peter Robertson, General Manager Aviation Security with the Office of Transport Security, said that there was concern around ‘vulnerability created through a general provision of access to the cockpit’. He said:
As you can imagine, the consequences of a breach there can be substantial; catastrophic, in fact. It is the ultimate goal of the terrorist to be able to take control of an aircraft and create shock and awe. We are trying to protect against a vulnerability that could be exploited in any way ...
I do believe that security in our skies is absolutely crucial. There is no question about that. I share the government’s concern about trying to ensure absolute safety for passengers and crew on aircraft, but I would prefer the pilot on a plane to be looking out of the window of the plane and not checking the door behind him just in case someone has not closed it properly. When we consider issues of security on aircraft we should be guided by the pilots who have command of those aircraft. They would know better than, with respect, any bureaucrat that is looking at this particular issue.
My concern is that under these regulations pilots will be held responsible if a so-called unauthorised person enters or remains in the cockpit of the aircraft when the aircraft is in flight under his or her command. These ‘unauthorised persons’ include anyone who is not a member of the aircraft’s crew and is not otherwise permitted by the operator or the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to be in the cockpit during the flight. That means that in the unlikely event of an emergency an off-duty pilot who is on the flight but not on the flight deck at that time would not be allowed to access the cockpit to assist and ensure the safety of passengers, because that would be illegal. I think that defies common sense. On the issue of whether an off-duty pilot should be allowed to be in the jump seat in the cockpit of an aircraft, Mr John McCormack, Director of Aviation Safety with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, acknowledged that his personal opinion was that that was not a safety issue. I think it would actually enhance safety to have another set of eyes, that of an off-duty pilot, in the cockpit. I have given a number of examples previously where having an off-duty pilot on an aircraft was very beneficial for safety. There have been a number of such instances in recent times around the world.
I moved a disallowance motion against these regulations last year, and I move a disallowance motion again today, because they are a significant departure from global practice. The government will say that consultation did occur between the department and various airlines, pilots associations, unions and flight attendants’ representatives following the disallowance passed last year in preparation for the regulations to be reinstated, but I would like to know what the government says constitutes consultation because none of the pilots associations or representatives that my office has spoken to, or the pilots I have spoken to, can remember any consultation taking place. They acknowledge that meetings were held initially to discuss concerns, but there was nothing beyond that, I am told, and certainly they were not privy to a viewing of any of the redraft regulations so they could provide further comment.
The President of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations, Captain Carlos Limon, was recently in Australia, and during his time here he campaigned heavily against these regulations. Captain Limon is London based and has flown all over the world and he says he has never come across regulations such as these. He recently said in a statement:
This proposal runs counter to internationally accepted conventions that the airline as the Air Operator Certificate holder is ultimately responsible for regulatory compliance. Abandonment of this principle could have far reaching effects for aviation safety since it could allow unscrupulous operators to claim they have no responsibility for safety of operations.
Second, in its present form the legislation—
that is, the regulations—
will exclude licensed company pilots from the list of people allowed to travel on the flight deck. This proposal is without merit, since past experience in real world operations has shown that an additional pilot on the flight deck enhances the safety of flight operations.
Captain Limon goes on to say:
Furthermore, the fact that this legislation supposes that a pilot, who may well have been in command of another company aircraft shortly before or subsequently, somehow poses a security risk when travelling on the flight deck when off duty …
is conceptually very poor and illogical. I note that similar concerns have been expressed by pilots in the Australian and International Pilots Association in terms of these new regulations.
This is a case where it is important that the government adequately consults with airline pilots. It is important to consult with those who have responsibility for the safety of aircraft. There is no-one who wants more to be able to go safely from point A to point B in an aircraft than the pilot and crew. That is their interest. They want to do the right thing by the safety of passengers and, when you have pilots associations, both here and internationally, saying that these are unprecedented, unfair and counterproductive regulations then they ought to be defeated. With due respect to the government, I believe they ought to go back to the drawing board to consult with airline pilots in a meaningful way so that we can ensure that these sorts of regulations are not brought up again. I think it is important that we listen to the pilots in relation to this. We should listen to those who have the primary responsibility for the safety of their passengers and crew. If we choose not to listen to the pilots, we do so at our peril. That is why I have moved this motion to disallow these regulations and I would urge for the support of my colleagues, again, in relation to this.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2010 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,40,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-06-22,"—I, on behalf of the coalition, want to indicate to the Senate that the coalition will be supporting the disallowance motion, as we have done twice in the past. We do it for the reasons which Senator Xenophon has very clearly and precisely put. One wonders why the government continues to regale the Senate with these regulations. This is at least the second, and I suspect the third, time that they have been brought back in much the same form on each occasion, and on each occasion we have indicated at some length that the opposition does not support the strict liability element on pilots—that is, making it a strict liability offence for pilots if someone else happens to open the door. I know that the shadow minister, Mr Truss, has had a number of discussions with the minister or his staff and has tried to negotiate a way through this. We have been given some verbal assurances—that really do not go far enough, in any case—but nothing in writing.
It is indicative of the sheer arrogance of this government that they are bringing these regulations back in the same form as they have before. It is the same arrogance that has led this government to introduce a huge mining tax on Australian industry, a tax which will destroy the jobs in my state of Queensland and Western Australia in particular. There was no consultation with the mining companies. Mr Rudd looked at the polls, realised he had to do something dramatic and so brought in this tax without any understanding of it and without any consultation. It was certainly not on the recommendation of Mr Henry. Mr Henry has subsequently said, again I say with some respect, that it is a tax that should be repeated across other industries in Australia, and that must start the alarm bells ringing.
This arrogance is also clear from the way the government simply paid Telstra whatever they asked for to get the NBN through. And why? Not because the NBN had proved its worth. Not because there had ever been any cost-benefit analysis done, but because Mr Rudd noticed the opinion polls and needed something to distract attention from them. Many commentators are saying today, and I particularly refer to Terry McCrann, that Telstra are laughing all the way to the bank. They got more out of Mr Rudd on the NBN proposal than they ever might have expected. And why? Simply because Mr Rudd was going downhill in the polls and needed some sort of a circuit breaker.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—We know, Senator Sterle, that Mr Rudd is about to do yet another backflip on the great big new mining tax. Deny to me, Senator Sterle, that in the very near future we will hear of some negotiations with the gas industry, which Mr Rudd will hold up as the success of this whole enterprise. He and everybody who drills down into it will know that there is nothing in it for the gas people—and he will also know that the miners will not be part of it. I am currently speculating, of course—unless the announcement has been made in the—

Senator Sterle interjecting—

 (Senator Carol Brown)—Order! Senator Macdonald, please resume your seat. Senator Sterle, interjecting is disorderly and I ask you to refrain.
—Thank you for protecting me, Madam Acting Deputy President. I know that Senator Sterle is very concerned about this, coming from Western Australia as he does. He can read the polls. On the last poll in Western Australia there would not be a Labor Party member left in Western Australia. If Senator Sterle is unfortunate enough to be on the Senate ticket this time, he might not even get there. We have two Western Australian senators in the chamber—Senator Sterle and Senator Evans—defending the great big new tax on mining that will destroy Western Australia. We all know that Mr Rudd will do one of his famous backflips and try and pretend that he has solved the issue. But everyone will be able to see through that and understand that Mr Rudd has again thought more of his own personal political future than the country’s future.
The motion before the chamber is related to airline safety. I come from Northern Queensland where air safety is particularly important. In Cape York we use small aeroplanes and large aeroplanes all the time. The impact of safety regulations on those of us who live in the remoter parts of Australia is always important—as is the Queensland Labor government’s awful wild rivers legislation, which this Senate is trying to overturn with a private member’s bill that is before the chamber at the moment. I had desperately hoped that I, Senator Barnett, Senator Boswell and others would have been able to talk to a report that was tabled that clearly shows just how awful that wild rivers legislation is for the Indigenous people living in Cape York. Unfortunately, we were prevented from talking to that report before the Senate, but that does not in any way stop the very good dissenting report by the coalition senators, drafted by Senator Guy Barnett, that clearly shows that the interests of the Indigenous people in Cape York are severely and badly impacted upon by the Queensland government’s wild rivers legislation. Hopefully later tonight we will have the opportunity of discussing in this chamber, albeit very briefly, that overturned wild rivers bill. And hopefully we will pass a bill which will effectively overturn the Queensland government’s wild rivers legislation which is so destructive to Indigenous people—providing, of course, that it is passed by the other place.
The people of Cape York have a difficult time now with small aircraft around—and we have to use them. The people who live in Cape York deserve every opportunity to get ahead. But what is the Labor Party in Queensland doing? It is preventing these people from the proper, adequate and free use of their own land. Through its declaration on wild rivers in Cape York the Queensland Labor government has simply locked up rivers and made it impossible for Indigenous people to get full value from their land. This deprives them of the opportunity for wealth and full-time work, and the dignity that goes with that, and condemns them yet again to a life of welfare dependency. This is something that their leaders are desperately trying to get them out of but they find it impossible.
I only mention Cape York in relation to the motion before the chamber, which deals with aircraft matters. I am conscious that we have to finish with the disallowance motion by 6.50 pm. I guess that Senator Milne might like to speak on this motion and that someone from the government might like to speak on it, and I know that Senator Back is very interested in a making a brief contribution as well. But let me quickly reiterate why the coalition will be supporting Senator Xenophon’s disallowance motion. There was never any genuine consultation with the group that looks after the airline pilots. That is typical of this government—no effective consultation whatsoever.
I have mentioned that the coalition was very concerned about the strict liability issues of the proposed legislation. These new regulations do not address the concerns that were expressed by the coalition previously and, as I have mentioned, they differ little from the previous regulations. The only significant difference is that they have deleted an employee of the aircraft operator from the list of people able to enter the cockpit. Hence, the new regulation makes the class of persons able to enter the flight deck even more limited. The coalition has always had concerns that it is sometimes in the interests of safety of the aircraft and all on board if an off-duty pilot is able to sit in the jump seat. The government has said to us that they have addressed some of those issues; but, if they have addressed them, why not amend the regulations to make absolutely clear the issues they were talking to us about?
There are some other, almost cosmetic, differences to the regulations, which are referred to in the explanatory statement, but again they do not address the real issue. It would have been so easy for the government to fix this matter, and had they done it properly I am quite sure that neither Senator Xenophon nor the coalition would have been moving to disallow this regulation. Mr Albanese will be going wild in the other place tomorrow, accusing the coalition and Senator Xenophon of not having any regard for aeroplane safety. We expect that from Mr Albanese. He is well known for his over-the-top hyperbole. The actual situation here is that if this is a problem it could easily have been fixed by the government negotiating with the pilots and talking more seriously with the opposition. We retain our concerns about the inability of other pilots to use the jump seat. Evidence, experience and example show that a third pilot in the jump seat has on occasions been a particular boost to airline and aircraft safety. The other issue of the strict liability I have briefly referred to.
There are some other things I would have liked to have said, but I am conscious of the time constraints and that others may wish to speak. There are many things I could have said about legal advice given, but again the government has simply drafted clumsy and draconian regulations. It is again an example of an inexperienced government that has not learnt humility nor the fact that good law-making takes place only after thorough and considered consultation. Clumsy, ham-fisted laws are not the way to do business. For those and all the other reasons that I and Senator Xenophon have mentioned, we will be supporting the disallowance of the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2010 (No. 1).",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2010 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,40,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-06-22,"—In the past the Greens have supported Senator Xenophon in disallowance and we will be doing so again. I also sought a briefing on this from the government, to reconsider the matter, and I too find it very disturbing that the Australian and International Pilots Association oppose this particular change. These are the people who fly constantly. These are the people who put their own lives on the line every day as they take to the air. I am sure that if they thought there was a loophole in safety they would be in here clamouring to have it fixed.
The main issue that the pilots are most concerned about is the exclusion of licensed company pilots from the list of people who can travel on the flight deck of their companies’ aircraft. Admittedly, the airline can be approached to give permission for one of its own pilots to travel in the jump seat, and it was put to me that this is a loophole. A terrorist could train as a pilot, get employed as a company pilot and therefore be able to get access to the cockpit. But if a terrorist trained as a pilot and became a company pilot, why would he or she attempt to hijack the aircraft from the jump seat? Why would they not just do it on a day when they were flying the plane, when they had control and were in charge? Why would they wait until they were in the jump seat? Yes, there is always the risk that somebody might train as a pilot and become licensed to an airline. But they then have access to the cockpit every day that they go to work for that airline, so I cannot see that that actually deals with the issue. More particularly, it goes to the issue of determining the profile of the people you train and employ as pilots in the first place rather than to this regulation.
Another issue is the shift of criminal responsibility from the airlines to the pilot in command in relation to safety breaches, in particular, to the shutting of the door. Again, this comes down to the issue that if the door is not properly shut who is responsible? Should the pilot be criminally responsible for breaches of the safety regulations or should it be the airline? As the Australian and International Pilots Association make very clear it is a long-held international aviation principle that the airline is ultimately responsible for the actions of its pilots. The shifting of criminal responsibility to the pilot in command is, in my view, not the appropriate way to go and could be exploited by an airline to get out of doing what it should be doing in taking responsibility in the event that an incident of some kind occurs.
I am aware, as everybody is, that there are pilots who are travelling backwards and forwards to places—sometimes on duty, sometimes off duty—who use the jump seat. Sometimes you could regard it as a perk of the airline if they are off duty and they are going on holidays or whatever.  But that is an issue for the airline to deal with if a licensed pilot of the airline is using a jump seat as a perk. It is a question for the airline as to how it regards the behaviour of its pilots and whether it is appropriate. In relation to how an airline may manage that particular issue it is not up to governments to determine or to judge what is a perk and what is and what is not allowable.
My focus is entirely on the safety of the aircraft and its passengers, on ensuring that an airline always has to take criminal responsibility for anything that occurs in relation to that airline. I just cannot believe that the Australian and International Pilots Association will not be supporting these regulations if it has real concerns about a loophole for security reasons. I am aware that the government is going ahead with these regulations because it has advice from its security people about loopholes, but I am afraid I just cannot see that these regulations will do anything to address the security issue. I think it goes much further back in terms of whom you are training and whom you are employing as pilots. That is where the real scrutiny is needed—psychological profiles et cetera in relation to that—rather than trying to shift criminal responsibility or trying to take away these long-held aviation principles. That is why I, on behalf of the Greens, take the position that I do.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2010 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,40,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-06-22,"—I recognise that Senator Back wants to make a brief contribution to this debate on Senator Xenophon’s disallowance motion. As he makes his way to the chamber and before he makes that contribution I have to say, in a rare show of solidarity with Senator Milne, that I agree with much of what she has said. There seems to be a great advocate for common sense in this case, because governments have to learn that they cannot micromanage every industry. If any government should heed that lesson it should be the Rudd government. Where they have sought to impose their authority, their will or their wisdom—or lack thereof—on particular industries we have seen disaster after disaster. You can recover from financial incompetence, you can recover from mismanagement of particular industries, but you cannot recover from a catastrophe on an airline. Everyone is interested in protecting the safety and efficiency of pilots, air traffic and air transport in Australia. There is no doubt about that. I believe this chamber and in fact this entire parliament would subscribe to that view. But in doing so we cannot for a moment pretend that the government knows best in these areas. We already place a great deal of faith and trust in our pilots and in our airline maintenance systems and some of that is through regulation but, frankly, the bulk of it is through common sense.
As Senator Milne pointed out, if the intention of these regulations is to protect a potential terrorist from training as a pilot and hijacking a plane, it beggars belief that they will do it to a plane other than the one that they are already in command of. We should listen to the Australian and International Pilots Association which clearly has a vested interest as, frankly, we all have in maintaining safety. But we should also recognise that airlines have a corporate responsibility to uphold their own standards. To shift criminal liability onto a particular pilot when they may just be adhering to traditional customs or to business-as-usual behaviour which historically has provided no real threat to airline safety is, I believe, a step in the wrong direction.
I think I have made my point. Since I have a note that Senator Back is unable to join us, I will cede the time to the government and to Senator Evans for his contribution, but I stand at one with the coalition in supporting Senator Xenophon’s disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2010 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-06-22,"—The opposition seems to be confused on this issue. I do not think Senator Macdonald’s contribution will look good in Hansard, given the rather ranting contribution he made to what really should be treated as a much more serious issue. Aviation safety and security is certainly the government’s No. 1 priority and it should be a bipartisan issue. The terrorist attempt on the United States bound flight on Christmas Day last year showed that we cannot afford to be complacent. Australia’s aviation security regime is built upon a number of layers of security measures to ensure that Australia’s aviation industry is safeguarded and able to respond quickly to threats of unlawful interference with aviation.
Hardened cockpit doors and restricting cockpit access are the last lines of defence to stop terrorists taking control of a plane. Stringent rules must apply to who can open the hardened cockpit door and enter the cockpit. Aircraft operators have invested heavily to meet regulations requiring hardened cockpit doors in certain aircraft. As a parliament, we now need to ensure that there is no uncertainty as to who is responsible in different scenarios for ensuring that the cockpit remains secure.
The effectiveness of hardened cockpit doors as a security measure is compromised if there are not clear and consistent regulations governing cockpit access. Put simply, the government takes the view that if a person does not have an operational, safety, security or training reason to be in the cockpit they should not be there. Frankly, if a person does not have an operational reason to be in the cockpit, does not have a safety reason to be in the cockpit, does not have a security reason to be in the cockpit or does not have a training reason to be in the cockpit then why should they be allowed to be in there?
This is an important aviation security matter, and aviation security is an important part of national security. All aircraft operators, including Qantas, Virgin, Tiger and Jetstar should have consistent rules setting out when the cockpit doors should be locked and who can access the cockpit. There have been substantial consultations with pilot associations on this issue. Mr Albanese met personally with representatives of the pilot unions and there have been several meetings between pilot unions and the minister’s department.
The Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2010 (No. 1) commenced on 21 May 2010. The regulations restrict access to the cockpit to persons who have an operational, safety, security or training need to be there. Under the regulations that decision is made by the aircraft operator; in other words, the airline takes responsibility for determining who is in the cockpit. However, the act and the regulations permit the pilot in command to allow a person into the cockpit for a safety or security reason during flight.
Pilot unions have raised the issue of the potential safety benefits of allowing off-duty pilots and other aviation professionals to utilise the jump seat in the cockpit. We want to be clear about this: the regulations do not impact on the ability of the pilot in command to take whatever action may be necessary and reasonable to protect the safety or security of an aircraft. This may mean, for example, that a passenger who is a doctor, off-duty pilot or engineer is allowed by the pilot in command into the cockpit if there is a safety or security need to do so. Of course, off-duty pilots and other company employees can use the jump seat in the cockpit for repositioning of crew returning home after duty or other operational travel. The regulations mean it is a safe decision for the pilot in command as to whether an off-duty pilot who is travelling for recreation can enter the flight deck. The regulations place responsibility on the pilot in command of the aircraft to ensure that the cockpit door remains locked except for certain allowable circumstances such as to permit authorised persons to enter or leave the cockpit and for safety reasons.
A breach of the regulations is a strict liability offence. Strict liability offences are fairly common and are used where it is necessary to ensure the integrity of a regulatory regime, such as security or public health. Of course, there are many other strict liability offences that apply to pilots. For example, there is a strict liability offence requiring a pilot to comply with an aircraft’s flight manual, and under longstanding regulations a pilot will commit a strict liability offence if they commence a flight while there is outstanding maintenance required on the plane, if they fly an aircraft over a prohibited area or if they tow anything without approval.
These strict liability offences all relate to the operation of the aircraft and their fundamental purpose is to protect the safety and security of the aircraft and its passengers. The responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the cockpit is such a responsibility. If the person who is operationally in charge of the aircraft is not the person who should be operationally responsible for basic measures to protect the security of the flight deck it begs the question: who else could do it? In practical terms there is no other person who would be in a position to exercise control over the cockpit door and the associated access entitlements while the aircraft is operating.
The government has placed responsibility for this important measure on the pilot who is operationally in charge of the aircraft at the time. If the chief pilot is on a sleep break or on a long-haul flight then responsibility rests with the pilot who is in command of the aircraft at the time. And at all times, if the pilot is acting reasonably to protect the safety or security of the aircraft, its cargo, a person, other aircraft or an airport there can be no offence committed. Those absolute defences are set out in primary legislation in section 10A of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004.
Should the disallowance motion be passed there will be no legal constraint on who can enter the cockpit. This is completely inconsistent with the policies of successive Australian governments that only people with a genuine safety, security, operational or training need may be permitted to enter and remain in the cockpit of an aircraft. Of course, aircraft operators can direct pilots as to who can enter the cockpit. But Qantas will have one set of rules, Jetstar another set, Virgin another and Tiger will have its own rules.
 (Senator Carol Brown)—Order! It being 6.50 pm, pursuant to order the Senate will now proceed to general business, under a limitation of debate.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2010 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,40,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2010-06-22,"—I rise to support the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 [No. 2]. This is a very simple piece of legislation. It does two things, in effect, but they are important things. It will require the agreement of traditional owners; that the development and use of native title land in a wild river area cannot be regulated under the relevant Queensland legislation unless Aboriginal traditional owners of the land agree. There are three other parts to it: one gives the capacity for the Governor-General to make regulations and the others are a transitional provision to ensure that the time line does not go forever and it deals with the capacity under the Constitution about how we can make this law.
Aboriginal people in this country have been through a long and arduous process of having their legal rights recognised, and I know that many of those in this place have supported that process. But it seems in many cases that when you get to the end of that process everybody says, ‘Oh, fantastic—wasn’t that great?’ Aboriginal people, if you like, for a long time have been in the struggle for land rights and have gathered the eggs. They have gathered them in, and often the processes by which they gather those eggs are limited. They might be land councils, and we only give them money to gather eggs. There has not been much story in terms of the development. So we should not see the involvement of land and sea based economic activity as the endgame. The first step is over; they now need to be able to be involved in that process without any impediment. So that should be the beginning of the process—certainly not the end.
Many of our first Australians—I see this as I move around Australia, not only in Queensland but in a number of places—have seen their lands locked up as national parks, in some cases as part of a deal. A New South Wales land council speaking to me the other day told me it is not part of a deal; it is part of meeting some weird quota that they have in New South Wales. So we need to ensure that Aboriginal people have the same access to economic opportunities from their land as every Australian should.
As people interested in this debate will all know well, there is a great tragedy visible when we enter Aboriginal land. I worry that they might have very few things and they live in very sparse conditions, and many people would see abject poverty. They smile at me and say: ‘But, Nigel, look at our land. Look at our country. Look at our riches.’ It recalls, of course, the old phrase ‘land rich and dirt poor’. I wonder why this exists. Here is an opportunity today to support a piece of legislation that is not symbolic. It might not get it completely right, and I understand why some people would choose not to support it, but what it says is that we need to make sure that we take every single blockage that is not an essential blockage out of the way so that our first Australians can have equity in the simple process of being able to use their land.
We go out of our way sometimes to protect values, whether they be biodiversity values or cultural values, but we do not seem to spend enough time protecting economic values and opportunities for people to use the land that they have. Of course, Australians would have no problem at all with unique biodiversity or other particular cultural values being protected, and of course the very first people that will tell you that they need protection are our first Australians. They will tell you that that protection is absolutely needed. When we particularly protect unique and rich biodiversity—and that is effectively the motive behind the wild rivers legislation—nobody would disagree, but if that is going to be the case then everybody should bear the cost. We as Australians should all bear the cost. But the sad part about the wild rivers legislation is that the cost is fundamentally borne by the people who live in that area, because it is the cost of not having economic opportunities. That is a cost that I think is inequitably imposed on them. If there is unique biodiversity on some farmers’ land or in other areas, there are a whole range of other processes that take place to ensure that there is no inequity in that regard. So this is a piece of legislation that we cannot allow to remain in place, for that reason.
The notion of sustainable development of land and conservation being mutually exclusive, of course, is insupportable, and I have spoken about that before in this place. Supporting Aboriginal people to create economic activities for future generations is not asking anything special. It is not that we are asking anything different from any other Australian. If land has any special biodiversity or cultural values, yes, it should be protected, but we need to support the protection that will already be given by our first people; we do not need to take it over.
I can recall that when this first came up Mr Abbott did not raise this issue, as has been claimed, to somehow belt up the Queensland government. Aboriginal people should have the right to develop their own land, because they also have a right to ensure that they leave an economic legacy to their children. We have heard Noel Pearson, who spoke so eloquently about how this is not an issue about a decision for himself; this is an issue about a decision for his grandchildren. To leave a legacy in this place should be one of the smartest things we ever do. Support this legislation and provide that legacy. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>WILD RIVERS (ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT) BILL 2010 (NO.2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,41,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2010-06-22,"—The debate on the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 [No. 2] in this chamber this evening is nothing but a political stunt, and I want people listening to the broadcast and people in the press gallery to clearly understand that this is a political stunt. The fact that as Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which inquired into this legislation, I have only five minutes to contribute to this debate and that this legislation will be debated within only half an hour proves how desperate the Leader of the Opposition and the people opposite me are to try to gain support, for some reason or other, in the Cape York Peninsula.
I say on record that never in my history of being involved in committees in this parliament and as chair have I seen my committee secretariat harassed, bullied and verballed by witnesses—by one particular witness, in fact—as I have during the course of this inquiry, to comment on the way in which committee decisions were made. With no dissent, committee decisions were made, and particular witnesses—one particular witness, in fact—then had the audacity to ring and verbal my committee secretary about that. We have had undisclosed material—an undisclosed privilege matter—and the whole conduct of this inquiry has been nothing but a sham in respect of the opposition, who have tried to bully, filibuster and bring this debate on well before time.
—Who’s the chairman? If there’s a sham, it reflects on the chair.
—Senator Macdonald, I will take that interjection, because never before in the history—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on Senator Crossin’s remarks in respect of those in the opposition, and specifically those on the committee, because I find them incredibly and personally offensive. I would ask her to withdraw her remarks. Those members on the committee were bona fide and they did everything right. Her remarks were personal and offensive, and I ask her to withdraw her remarks.
—I have not named individuals.
 (Senator Carol Brown)—Senator Crossin, I ask you to be mindful of your comments.
—I have not named individuals. At every single committee meeting I held there were unanimous decisions made and the record of that will stand. Let me go to the conduct of this inquiry in the 2½ minutes I have remaining. There is no explanatory memorandum with this piece of legislation, so from the very beginning our committee was not aware of what it was that the author of this piece of legislation intended to achieve. It makes it particularly difficult. I might add that this matter was mentioned by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. They highlighted the fact that there was no explanatory memorandum with this piece of legislation.
I also add for the record that the Queensland parliament passed a Queensland act for the purpose of preserving the natural values of rivers that have all, or almost all, of their natural values intact. It was not the job of my committee to inquire into the piece of legislation that the Queensland government enacted. My committee’s role was to look at the piece of legislation that was before it, and I do not believe that a number of witnesses clearly understood that point during the conduct of the inquiry. We got 38 submissions—15 supporting the bill, eight disagreeing with the bill, with four being from Indigenous parties. There were 10 submissions that were critical of the Wild Rivers Act but were not supportive of the legislation that I as chair had before me. Therefore, we had 18 of the 38 submissions against this piece of legislation, not one way or the other, and 15 for it. So you cannot say that the majority of those who made submissions to this inquiry were in favour of this piece of legislation.
This bill raises significant legal issues and would substantially increase red tape, including for Aboriginal entrepreneurs and developers. It is inconsistent with the Native Title Act and I urge people to read the committee’s view in the Senate report. The last chapter goes to the explanation as to why we believe it is inconsistent with the Native Title Act. This is not in fact a future act under the Native Title Act and we go into the reasons why. This bill is poorly drafted, it is unclear and it could not be responsibly supported by any Australian government. A broad range of views was expressed at the Senate committee inquiry. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-06-22,"—As the Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has said very clearly, this debate on the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 [No. 2] is a stunt. It is a political stunt and it has nothing at all to do with the economic aspirations of people who live in Cape York. It has everything to do with the gathering of votes in the lead-up to an election later this year. I am terribly disappointed that the behaviour of the Liberal-National Party I have observed on Cape York is being continued here today in the Senate. We have observed over years Liberal-National Party members intentionally dividing the community of Cape York Peninsula for their own political benefit and I am tired of watching communities that Senator Scullion himself described as not being able to have an economic advantage being used by those of you who sit over there and would like to sit over there in the other place for your own political advantage—and you know it. You know that this is the purpose of what you are doing. The Liberal-National Party has form in this area.
—You have no idea—go back to Canberra.
—I will take that interjection, Senator Macdonald. Which area in Australia under the Liberal-National Party government never had a natural resource management board? Cape York Peninsula. Which area in Australia more than any other needed some sort of leadership through a natural resource management board? Cape York Peninsula. It is the actions of Liberal-National Party members that meant that that area never had a representative voice on natural resource management. It is a political stunt and you are getting more time to play with people who live on Cape York Peninsula.

Senator Crossin interjecting—

—As Senator Crossin indicated, this bill is not only a stunt but also an unworkable bill. Evidence provided to the committee by many witnesses talked about the drafting problems that were evident and the unworkability of the bill in effect. I refer people to paragraphs 2.31 to 2.37 of the report which concludes by saying:
Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation concurred, stating that, in the absence of any draft regulations, it is impossible to tell whether the consultation processes proposed by the Bill would be any better than those currently in place:
If you want to make an amendment, make it to the Native Title Act.
Let me go to another issue. The assertion from that side is that the Queensland legislation means that economic opportunities that could be available to people of Cape York are now not available. If this is the case, why were those economic opportunities not taken up prior to the beginning of the wild rivers legislation? Why have things changed? There is simply no change. There have been 173 applications made since the instigation of the Wild Rivers Act on Cape York Peninsula. One hundred of those 173 applications have been approved and a number of them are in abeyance.
I go to the role of the Balkanu Cape York Peninsula development Corporation. Balkanu is the economic development organisation of Cape York Peninsula and they, as is their right, are running a campaign against the Queensland legislation. That is their right, but at the same time they are tasked and funded to assist Aboriginal people of Cape York to progress any economic aspirations. Why are we not surprised that the economic development organisation is not in fact doing this? If you were an Aboriginal person living on Cape York, why would you go to Balkanu to get assistance when you knew they were running the campaign against the state government? I think that is a problem. It needs to be resolved and it was canvassed during the hearing. Let us also go to the division in the community about whether or not the Queensland legislation is a good or a bad thing. It is a shame that I cannot finish my speech. (Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-06-22,"—The reason Senator McLucas did not get to complete her speech is that this debate has been crammed into 25 minutes on a Tuesday night. Before I comment on the substance of the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 [No. 2], I would like to make some remarks on the process that has brought us here. This is the first time in my experience, having been here for two years as a full member of the Senate Legal and Constitution Affairs Legislation Committee, which Senator Crossin chairs, that I have ever seen a proposed motion come through this parliament to cut short the reporting period of a committee. That is what happened. Senator Crossin, in her brief time, did not make mention of that. Then we saw the procedural chicanery that occurred this afternoon, and which has been going on for the last 48 hours, to find some time to have this debate. The Greens have been proposing, and the coalition opposed our proposition, additional sitting hours so that we could debate the bill—and we will get to the merits of it in a moment—without the farce of everybody watching the clock for periods of four, five or six minutes.
I would also like senators to recognise that we are on Ngunawal land tonight and that no Aboriginal voices are represented in this debate, as has been the case for the last several hundred years. So here we are again, debating the future and the sovereignty of Aboriginal people in their absence in this parliament. We have some affinity for the principles in this bill. We welcome the Liberal Party’s newfound commitment to increasing the rights of native title holders. The principle here, as I read it, is that native title holders should be able to agree or disagree with legislation and determinations that affect their land, so, for a moment, let us give the coalition the benefit of the doubt.
As the additional comments of the Australian Greens outline, there are substantial flaws contained in Senator Scullion’s bill and we identify in those comments why we do not believe the Senate should pass this bill. It will quite clearly not achieve what it says it will. We would be much better off with substantive Native Title Act amendments which would implement the bill’s stated intent far more effectively than what has been presented to us tonight. Any change to the native title rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should apply nationally, rather than in one part of one state. Professor Jon Altman, who provided evidence to the inquiry, said:
... unless such provisions are extended Australia-wide this change will constitute Cape York bioregion-specific legal exceptionalism. This is hardly appropriate given that the Closing the Gap framework applies nation wide ...
Changes to the Native Title Act would be far more likely to produce an outcome consistent with what we believe Senator Scullion’s legislation is trying to achieve, if this is really about a requirement to obtain the agreement of Aboriginal people before a wild rivers declaration on their land is made. Senator Scullion’s bill is silent on the processes that should be used in obtaining the consent of what the legislation refers to as ‘the traditional owners of native title land’.
Many witnesses to the inquiry pointed out—and Senator Scullion knows this well—that there is an existing process under the Native Title Act for negotiating Indigenous Land Use Agreements. This exists, it is already well defined and the Greens believe it makes sense to have this reflected in any legislative changes which seek to require the consent or agreement of Aboriginal people with regard to wild rivers declarations. Those increased rights should be available to all native title holders across the country and in all circumstances, rather than only on Cape York and only with regard to one particular Queensland state law.
As the committee’s report notes, many submissions and witnesses to this inquiry also raised the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and, in particular, the principle of ‘free, prior and informed consent’, which is detailed in article 19 of that declaration. The Greens have consistently supported the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and we supported the current government’s decision to sign that declaration. That is why we recommend that the content of this declaration be reflected in domestic laws and domestic policies, with priority given to examining how the principle of free, prior and informed consent should be consistently and effectively applied. The Liberal Party opposed that declaration while in government and continuing public statements—correct us if we are wrong, Senator Scullion—would suggest that their official policy is to continue to oppose it. But, nonetheless, we welcome the support that Liberal Party senators expressed throughout this inquiry for the principle of free, prior and informed consent as it is contained in the declaration. The committee notes the declaration and consent principle contained within it is not yet binding in Australian law. We do not believe that we should be signing international declarations unless we are prepared to make an effort to implement them in domestic law.
In Australia, free, prior and informed consent provisions exist only under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and, even here, there are ways of overriding the right of veto and the right of consent. In other jurisdictions, apart from WA, under land rights under state laws, there are specific forms of consultation and negotiation possible. But, just as we have seen, not just in Cape York but right across the Top End in the Kimberley and the goldfields—right across the country—the Native Title Act does not contain the right to say no and have that no respected. For this reason, the Native Title Act should be amended to provide native title groups with free, prior and informed consent rights. Instead, under the future acts regime, they perhaps, at best, have a right to negotiate or, more weakly and at the worst, they have a right of consultation, and then various developments can roll right over the top of them. If the coalition has suddenly discovered the benefits of giving traditional owners a veto power over developments on their land, then let us talk about sovereignty and let us have that principle enshrined nationally.
In 1999 the Nunavut Act was signed in Canada. That is just one example, I suppose, of just how far it seems we have to come in this country, that we should be having a debate here in parliament in 2010 in the absence of Aboriginal voices in this parliament or people to put their own views without white fellas putting them for them yet we had an act of parliament in Canada that established the newest federal territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the north-west territories on 1 April 1999 by the Nunavut Act. How far are we in Australia from that kind of discussion of sovereignty of Aboriginal peoples? Rather, we have these continued legalistic wranglings over the way the land rights act operates in the NT and the way the Native Title Act operates around the country.
There are big structural changes that require more than a 25-minute debate squashed into a Tuesday night more or less against the will of the chamber. I think we need to give more substantive time to this debate. This is one of the worst abuses of process I have seen in the brief number of years I have been here, both in the committee stage when it was being dealt with and in the way this debate was brought before the chamber this evening.",SENATE,<title>WILD RIVERS (ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT) BILL 2010 (NO.2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,41,1,speech

The principal matter is the United Nations International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. I will quote from the Prime Minister’s apology two years ago. He said:
… unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong.
The great irony, of course, was that the day that Rudd subscribed to the International Declaration on the Rights of the Indigenous People was the same day that the Bligh government in Queensland applied the wild rivers legislation to the significant—

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-06-22,"—Today in the Mural Hall there was an expo of services that are being provided in our nation for people who are homeless. For the first time in my experience in this place there was due respect and acknowledgment given to the very important work that a number of agencies are doing in this very difficult field. One of the organisations that was showcasing the work they are doing was Micah Projects from Brisbane. Micah is an extraordinary organisation. It has been working in the Brisbane area with a true mission to create justice and to respond to injustice at the personal and structural levels of society. It aims to break social isolation and build community. Micah Projects works across a range of social justice fields in the inner Brisbane area and its services have been acknowledged by a number of governments, both in Australia and internationally, for its professionalism and the compassion which it provides.
A key program that Micah is now involved in is called 50 Lives 50 Homes—and that is the badge in a beautiful yellow that I am wearing at the moment. This is a campaign to house and support Brisbane’s 50 most vulnerable homeless people. This project is being worked on by a range of people in the Brisbane community. It gathers partners from government, not-for-profit organisations, business and citizens who are committed to ending homelessness for people in Brisbane. A wide range of clubs and organisations have been involved. The 50 Lives 50 Homes project was made possible with the support of the Mater Foundation and it has worked with the principles that have been developed in the US by an organisation called Common Ground USA. It is an amazing and reputable organisation which was founded in 1990 by Peter Ezersky and Rosanne Haggerty. They have the mission to end homelessness by creating environments that foster growth in individuals and the development of supportive relationships.
They have a three-pronged strategy which has proved to be successful. They have a commitment to affordable housing that is linked to services to help people rebuild lives and get back on their feet individually. They have a commitment to outreach—to identify and house the most vulnerable and to develop a vulnerability index which surveys and identifies chronic homelessness. This particular index is the tool which has been used by Micah in Brisbane for its current project. The third part of the Common Ground program is prevention, which looks to address and tackle social and economic factors that cause homelessness in order to prevent it.
Common Ground have the runs on the board. To date, they have helped over 4,000 people to conquer homelessness. They have built and maintained permanent and transitional housing in the US and they have plans for the future. One of their programs is called Street to Home, which was proved to decrease homelessness by 87 per cent in one neighbourhood in New York City.
The Common Ground process relies on effective partnerships and one of the organisations with which they have developed an effective partnership is Micah in Brisbane. A wonderful relationship has developed between these organisations. It involves people from Micah travelling to New York and working on the ground there and people from Common Ground coming and sharing their wonderful knowledge with us in Brisbane. One of the processes that have been used to work on the 50 Lives 50 Homes project is a survey that was conducted in inner city Brisbane between 7 June and 11 June this year. During that period, between the hours of 4 am and 6 am—and I might have been there—12 teams, made up over 70 community volunteers, canvassed the streets of Brisbane’s metropolitan area. Specialised teams also worked with food vans, in emergency accommodation, youth services and squats. The locations were based on current knowledge of the hotspot areas in Brisbane.
The volunteer teams used the Common Ground USA vulnerability index to survey and create a personal, by-name registry of individuals who were experiencing chronic homelessness and rough sleeping and those who were really at risk of premature death. Over 100 volunteers in total participated during the week by helping with the data entry, administering the surveys, fundraising for household items and providing meals and support for the people who were working.
The project relied on people being engaged personally and actually feeling trust in the system. People were able to systematically gather the names, pictures and dates of birth of individuals sleeping on the streets. They captured data on their health status and institutional history. That is a really important point: these were people who had been in prison or hospital and, in some cases, people who had been in the military. They captured data on how long they had been homeless and the patterns of crisis accommodation use—the idea, as we know, of the merry-go-round of services that end up with them still being lost without any sense of belonging or future.
The data was collected by using a 38-item questionnaire that again used the methods that had been developed by Common Ground. The vulnerability index was used to identify those who had been homeless the longest and who were the most vulnerable. This register will now be used to target new and available housing and services to the most vulnerable in an effort to make a real difference in reducing chronic homelessness within Brisbane.
The index is based on research by Dr Jim O’Connell of the Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program. His research shows that certain medical conditions place a homeless individual at a higher risk of dying than others if they remain on the streets. The at-risk indicators showed the number of people who had psychiatric, medical or substance abuse problems and the number of times that people had been involved in ER services over the previous year or three months. They also showed their age, HIV status, general health conditions such as cirrhosis or liver condition and kidney disease and also any history of vulnerability to cold or wet weather injuries.
All of this data being pulled together will give us a real basis on which to build plans for the future. The whole concept of having the 50 homes for the 50 people who are the most vulnerable means that there is an accountable and transparent way of seeing what results can be achieved within a set time. We need to put together the full program, give ourselves clear goals and work effectively with our partners—and the list of people who want to be involved in this project is very long—to ensure we get results.
Among the issues that are looked at is the age of the people—and we know that there are particular age groups that are most vulnerable, such as young people who are under the age of 20. I heard from one of the project workers today about a young woman who was a student from overseas at one of the universities. She had not had the confidence or the ability to link in with the support services of the university and she was actually sleeping out, because she did not know how to get the services that were available. Micah was able to immediately link her to the services provided by the university. Another case that was mentioned today was that of a young man who had left home and had lost many links with his family and friends. Through the process of filling out the survey, he was able to be reunited, with help from Micah, with his family in North Queensland. That is an amazing, immediate result of the personal, strategic way that this program is operated.
The idea of matching together 50 homes and 50 lives indicates that this is a start and that there are real outcomes. One of the most interesting things about the way this is working is that people are using the various social networking sites to share facts and information. Through the US process there has been usage of things such as Twitter. So the volunteers who were working on the ground over the weekend in Brisbane were not only putting together information and talking about their experiences but also sharing it with other agencies in the US so that they could learn and find strength from each other and also celebrate the results.
I truly respect the work of Micah Projects in Brisbane. Their coordinator, Karyn Walsh, has been involved in so much of the social justice work that is being done in our community. This one project is part of the overwhelming scheme that is being carried out through the work on homelessness. They are working effectively with the government through their white paper process, which means that progress is being made on the critical issue of homelessness. We can learn from this and we can celebrate the results.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Brisbane: Homelessness</title>,Adjournment,42,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-06-22," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 29 March 2010:
Has the Government commissioned any review of research into the health effects of mobile phone use; and
Is the Government aware of a greater health risk for children who use mobile phones.
Has the Government considered health warnings for mobile phone use; if so, what was the outcome of each consideration; and
At what point would the Government consider there is enough research to warrant health warnings.
Is the Government aware of any increase in the incidence of brain tumours in Australia or other developed countries; if so, are there particular age groups where increases are more marked than others.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Mobile Phones</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,44,1,question
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-06-22,"—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
The Australian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), as the Government’s primary advisor on radiation protection, maintain a continual review of international and Australian scientific research regarding the health effects of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted by devices such as mobile phones.  In 2002, ARPANSA published a scientifically based human exposure Standard that is closely aligned with international guidelines.  The limits within this Standard form the basis of regulation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.  ARPANSA is currently undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the research published since the preparation of the Standard, including the latest publications from the Interphone Study Group, with the aim of formulating recommendations regarding the need to review or amend the Standard.
No health risk from exposures to RF EMR below the limits given in current exposure standards have been established for adults or children.  Some theoretical studies have shown that absorption and penetration of the RF EMR into the body may be different in children due to differences in anatomy and composition of tissues but no clear relationship with health risk can be determined.
The ARPANSA exposure standard includes a requirement to minimise unnecessary or incidental exposure to RF EMR but ARPANSA does not recommend the use of specific health warnings in regard to unknown health risks.  ARPANSA continues to inform the Australian community about potential health risks from EMR, including recommending that children should be encouraged to limit exposure from mobile phones to their heads by reducing call time, by making calls where reception is good, by using hands-free devices or speaker options, or by texting.
If, and when, there is scientific evidence that demonstrated that a significant risk to health could be reduced through the use of health warnings, ARPANSA would expect to make recommendations in that respect together with other regulatory and policy responses.
As reported by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the incidence over the last few decades of brain tumours has increased in most developed countries, mainly in the older age groups.  This increase was confined to the late 1970s and early 1980s and coincided with the introduction of improved diagnostic methods.  IARC reports, in their World Cancer Report 2008, that ‘After 1983 and more recently during the period of increasing prevalence of mobile phone users, the incidence has remained relatively stable for both men and women.’  Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that the Australian age-standardised incidence rates of brain cancer, and gliomas and meningiomas specifically, (all age groups combined, as well as for 15–19 year olds and 20–24 year olds) have been stable over the 10‑year period 1996–2005.  A recent paper reported that an analysis of statistics from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) showed a statistically significant increase in benign brain tumor incidence but commented that no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the reasons for such changes.  Others have noted that legal requirements for increased surveillance of benign tumours may explain why the CBTRUS figures do not represent international trends.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Mobile Phones</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,44,1,answer
