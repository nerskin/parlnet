"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,1998-06-23,"—by leave—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be able to table this progress report on the implementation of the government's health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas. The report covers the period from 1 November 1996 to 31 March 1998. The health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas was my portfolio's response to the government's election commitment to improve the services provided to people living in rural and remote areas of Australia. The development of a health policy for rural veterans was also one of my major personal priorities when I became Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I made this matter a priority for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I knew from my own personal experience as a representative of a rural electorate that health services and facilities in rural areas were not as accessible as they were in the cities. Secondly, it was evident that with the inevitable ageing of veterans their health was becoming increasingly critical to their quality of life. Thirdly, rural Australia 
 is the chosen home of many veterans and their families. Many took up soldier settler blocks after the world wars and others simply returned to the regions from where they had been recruited.
The end result was that, by October 1996, 106,600, or 31.6 per cent, of the veterans, war widows and dependants entitled to health care benefits through my department lived outside the major metropolitan areas. By 31 March 1998 this number had increased to 108,592, or 31.9 per cent, an increase which may be due to the improved awareness of entitlements.
The health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas was developed to provide innovative and cost effective ways to make information and health and community services more accessible to members of the veteran community living in rural and remote Australia. Initiatives outlined in the policy were to be implemented within existing resources.
The goals of the policy were to maintain and improve the health and wellbeing of the veteran community in rural and remote areas and also to increase the awareness of the Department of Veterans' Affairs entitlements and services among the veteran community and health care providers in rural and remote areas. In the implementation of the policy we took into account the unique characteristics of rural and remote Australia—the extreme and harsh climate, the physical and social isolation, the immobility of the population, the lack of public transport, the close-knit nature of communities, and the limited and often low quality communication services.
The policy spelt out what we could do to make more health services available, to promote awareness of preventive care measures and to improve communication with the veteran community and health care providers. Simply put, it all boils down to access, information and communication. Improving access to services is an important part of the better rural health equation. Providing better health information and building communication channels is equally important and complementary. 
During the reporting period, one of my personal highlights was presenting the keynote speech at the 4th National Rural Health Conference in Perth in February 1997. As I said then, the government is acutely aware and appreciative of the role played by rural doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, community nurses, voluntary workers and health administrators in striving to meet the health needs of those who live outside our capital cities.
In developing the health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas, we identified 10 priority areas which need attention. These areas spelt out in the policy include: firstly, improved access to health care services in local communities which have limited and sparsely distributed services and facilities; secondly, more flexible transport arrangements for veterans who need to travel long distances for treatment; thirdly, improved planning and delivery of the department's services, particularly in remote areas; and, fourthly, the improvement in the flow of information to the veteran community and health care providers about available health care services and entitlements.
The progress report focuses on action undertaken and proposed in these 10 priority areas. I am pleased to report that since I announced the policy on 16 October 1996 much has been achieved.
During the development of the policy, I had the opportunity of visiting several of Australia's most remote communities, including Thursday Island to visit the Torres Strait Islanders, to see for myself the service delivery challenges they were facing. The report notes the development of some very innovative service delivery initiatives, sponsored by my department, in many of these communities.
I would like to briefly describe some of the most significant of these initiatives highlighted in the report. One hundred thousand copies of A guide to services for the veteran community in rural and remote areas have been published and distributed. The feedback on the guide, including letters of commendation, indicates that this publication has raised the awareness of the department's services with 
 veterans as well as health and community care providers.
Support for rural ex-service organisations, ESOs, has been increased, in some cases providing motivation for groups to continue. Podiatry clinics on Thursday Island and Norfolk Island have been introduced. The numbers of mental health counsellors providing counselling services in rural areas has been increased to over 240 nationally. Annual health care plans have been introduced through doctors in various rural and remote areas, thereby providing more comprehensive care to veterans with complex and chronic medical conditions.
The repatriation transport guidelines have been improved to assist veterans in rural and remote areas who have to travel long distances for medical treatment. The guidelines recognise the importance of support from family and friends in the treatment and recovery of veterans who are ill by providing assistance to help meet the costs of an attendant's accommodation or return travel while the veteran is receiving treatment away from home.
Local government agents have been contracted to provide information services in country areas. For example, the Mildura Rural City Council now provides information services in Mildura and the Sunraysia region. The Queensland Government Agents Program, QGAP, the New South Wales Government Access Centres, NGAC, and the Australian Country Information Service, ACIS, are also now providing Department of Veterans' Affairs information services in many country regions throughout Australia, as is Centrelink in Wagga Wagga, Orange, Tamworth and Rockhampton. We are assisting local veteran groups through seeding grants, training and support to establish veterans' information centres in Murray Bridge and Port Lincoln in South Australia, as well as in Alice Springs.
Funding and expertise are being provided to community organisations so that they can provide programs and services for the veteran community. Examples include: funding a respite holiday program for veterans and their carers in Queensland; training two Aboriginal welfare officers in Northern Queensland and 
 two in Western Australia to provide information on Department of Veterans' Affairs services to their communities; funding the establishment of a `one telephone number' central information and referral service for older people in the Clarence Valley of New South Wales to assist members of the veteran community to access the wide range of community services, including residential and in-home respite places in the region, and providing funding for a range of volunteer based services to veterans and carers within the Bridgetown-Greenbushes shire in Western Australia.
Finally, the number of training information program courses conducted in rural areas has been increased. More than 2,750 people, mainly volunteer ex-service pension and welfare officers, have attended in excess of 59 courses in rural areas since November 1996.
Looking to the future, the government will continue to assist veterans in accessing health services by working with rural communities, local health care providers, and ex-service and community groups. While we will continue to address all 10 priority areas, particular focus will be given to further improving the availability of timely and accurate information in rural areas.
Initiatives planned for 1998 and beyond include further expansion of our network of advice and information services to fill the current gaps in these services in rural Australia. This includes the direct provision of information and advice on veterans' entitlements to services through contracting more government agencies such as some rural Centrelink offices or by the use of `information kiosks' in the various state-run Government Access Centres and the Australian Country Information Service.
This year, agent agreements have been entered into for the Queensland towns of Emerald, Roma and Rockhampton and, in Tasmania, Smithton and Queenstown will be serviced through the Service Tasmania Project. Our training and information program courses for ex-service organisation pension and welfare officers will be increased. Refresher courses will be available in some areas 
 for those participants who were trained some time ago.
We will soon be introducing an online information system known as DVA FACTS which will build on the success of A guide to services for the veteran community in rural and remote areas. The system will enable rural veterans to access detailed, up-to-date information on the department's programs and services, either through offices of the department, its agents or the Internet.
What I have spoken about today is just a snapshot of the many rural and remote initiatives being implemented within my portfolio. I recommend that you take a closer look at the report. Improving services in rural and remote areas will continue to be a major priority of the government's. We do not accept that the price of living outside our capital or major regional cities means doing without reasonable standards of services, especially when such services can be made available with an appropriate degree of commitment, coordination and creative planning. I believe that our experience translates well to the general community and provides a valuable model for delivery of health services to the broader community and, in particular, to the aged.
Finally, I would like to thank veterans and service providers in rural and remote areas of Australia for the important contribution they have made to the development and continuing implementation of the health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas. I would also like to extend my appreciation to the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs for their enthusiasm, hard work and commitment to improving the quality of life of veterans living in rural and remote areas. I commend the report to the parliament.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Implementation of the Health Policy for the Veteran Community in Rural and Remote Areas</title>,Ministerial Statements,11,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—by leave—In October 1996 the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) made a ministerial statement detailing the government's policy entitled `Health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas'. This afternoon's statement is essentially a progress report on the 1996 report, covering the period November 1996 to March 1998.
Whilst Australia's repatriation system has many strengths, historically it has suffered from an excessive degree of centralisation, with its public presence restricted to massive offices in capital city central business districts and a small number of designated repatriation hospitals. The location of these facilities was often as problematic for veterans and their families living in outer suburban areas and regional cities as it was for veterans living in what could properly be described as rural and remote areas.
Over the last decade or so, we have seen praiseworthy efforts to reverse this trend. Specialist services such as Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service offices have long been established in suburban and regional sites that broadly reflect the distribution of the Vietnam veteran community. Veterans' Affairs Network—VAN—offices have been established in a considerable number of centres. And of course entitled veterans can now, with some variation from state to state, access private patient hospital treatment through a considerable number of public and contracted private hospitals.
Many of these service delivery models still, however, required a critical mass of veterans in order to be economical and effective. They were therefore most suited to significant regional centres like Townsville, Wollongong or Launceston. There is thus the problem of devising ways of providing adequate support to veterans in rural and remote areas. The DVA's definition of these is `non-metropolitan areas which have populations of less than 100,000'. It is appropriate to acknowledge that some 30 per cent of the veterans treatment population—that is, veterans, war widows and dependants entitled to health care through DVA—live in such areas. It is also clear that this definition covers centres that are themselves diverse. Not all are inland and some would generally be considered small cities rather than rural towns.
The opposition acknowledges that more could and should be done for veterans in rural and remote areas. All veterans are entitled to enjoy ready access to both information and services. As shadow minister I am happy to 
 acknowledge the enthusiasm of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his commitment to progressing this particular policy agenda.
A particularly notable statistic in the 1996 policy statement was that 40 per cent of the veterans living in rural and remote areas were aged 75 years or over—42,000 of 106,000. This at least partly reflects the fact that rural Australia was an important source of enlistment during the Second World War. It was therefore appropriate that a key component of the strategy was on preventive health care measures focusing on an increasingly frail generation of veterans.
Many of the detailed measures outlined in the 1996 statement were also small scale and focused on named locations. In saying this I am not implying criticism of the government. It is sensible to identify what is achievable and realistic and not to raise excessive expectations that cannot be feasibly met in the immediate future.
You can best review progress on reform measures in the light of the announced goals for them. In this regard, the 1996 policy statement said that the goals were:
to maintain and improve the health and well being of the veteran community in rural and remote areas; and increase the awareness of DVA entitlements and services among the veteran community and health care providers in rural and remote areas.
To address these goals, 10 priority areas for action were identified: improved access to, and availability of, health care and support services in the local community; more flexible transport arrangements for entitled veterans who require health care outside their local community; increased focus on health education and preventive care; improved planning and delivery of DVA services, particularly in remote areas; better information for the veteran community and health care providers about DVA entitlements and the range of health care services; greater support for groups who have special needs within the veteran community; greater support for health care providers; greater support for ex-service organisations; better information and support on housing assistance; and better information about income support and disability compensation. 
 At this juncture it is not possible for me to make an immediate and definitive assessment on progress, as the actual report arrived shortly before question time. I can acknowledge that some worthwhile things are happening, in particular with the enhancements to the repatriation transport guidelines and the trialling of various models of providing outreach information services to veterans in rural areas.
I would like to canvass some of the other issues that have been raised with me by veterans in rural and remote areas. Amongst Vietnam veterans, in particular, there are still clear difficulties in accessing specialist services, particularly for psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Even in large regional cities such as Townsville, veterans have reported to me—and the minister has not disputed this—that local specialists have not been keen to perform such work and those that do cannot cope with the level of demand. The alternatives facing veterans are either to visit capital city specialists, which is disruptive and costly to the taxpayer, or to decide that it is not worth the bother, which could have long-term adverse consequences for veterans, their families and the wider community.
I turn next to domiciliary nursing services for veterans. These are an important support to veterans who have been discharged from hospital or are terminally ill. The minister's statement makes no reference to the reform of DVA's funding arrangements for private nursing agencies, reforms that came into effect last year. Without debating the details of this somewhat complex issue, I note that the agencies that have approached me with concerns about these reforms have overwhelming been those based in rural areas, particularly in New South Wales. This is an issue that requires continuing scrutiny to ensure that there is no reduction in the level and nature of nursing care that veterans receive, as guaranteed by the minister. I am afraid to say that this guarantee has not always been reflected in the feedback I have received from individual veterans and service groups. 
I also note that veterans in rural and remote areas are not immune from the coalition's broader cuts. These broader cuts mean that veterans, while finding it easier to make contact with DVA, then find it harder to gain legal aid to the required degree because of Commonwealth cuts or to obtain adequate public hospital care. If and when they need access to a nursing home, they now face paying the hefty annual entry fee for five years, totalling $20,000 in many cases.
In conclusion, the 1996 policy statement contained worthwhile initiatives. Indications of some progress cannot be disputed. They must, however, be viewed in the context of the impact of changes in nursing home care, pharmaceutical benefits and legal aid which daily affect rural veterans. The minister must ensure that the hyperbole is matched by actual budget dollars, given the scant reference to expenditure in the report, lest it be thought that these aspects are actually just a shuffling of the cards rather than the introduction of new initiatives.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Implementation of the Health Policy for the Veteran Community in Rural and Remote Areas</title>,Ministerial Statements,11,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—Let the House note that not one National Party backbencher is in the parliament and only one Liberal backbencher is in the parliament—this 
 from a government that came to power promising to recharge our regions. Under this government, regional Australians have experienced savage cuts, the removal of vital services and the loss of the businesses and industries that made their communities prosper. The government has not recharged the regions; it has betrayed them and it has abandoned them.
Labor took a big defeat in the regions in the last election. It held only seven of the 51 seats. One of Labor's mistakes in government was to talk about the big picture and simply assume that regions would understand how they fitted in. It was Canberra imposing on the regions, not empowering them. But we have listened and we have learnt. The big picture is still important, but we have to construct it from the ground up, encouraging each region to develop its piece of the mosaic.
That approach has meant Labor involving itself with communities in the development of the agenda for each community; an agenda owned by the community and one which Labor and only Labor is prepared to back. This election will be fought on a number of different levels, but none more important than the local agendas. Whilst jobs are priority one in the national campaign, strategies and solutions to secure and grow job opportunities in our regions are really what matter.
On 17 July 1996, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), then the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, said:
There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development.
That was an extraordinary admission by a senior minister—and a National Party minister at that. The government did not see a role, did not see a need and did not see an opportunity. But it is not just selling out regions; the government sees a diminished role in child care, in schools and universities, in nursing homes, in the provision of pharmaceuticals to our elderly, and a diminished role in the provision of unemployment programs to get young people back into work.
This government is not just pursuing a lesser role for government but also introduc 
 ing in every one of those areas a user-pays principle. From the cradle to the grave, this government is about slugging communities and their constituents. It has done that in the pursuit of a surplus—a budget surplus at any cost; a budget surplus regardless of the consequences. Labor was capable of producing budget surpluses, but we were also prepared to run a deficit if it was important to run a deficit to get growth, to get regions going and to get opportunities going. This government has an ideological fixation with budgets and budget surpluses regardless of the consequences.
This government destroyed the $150 million regional development program. It abolished the infrastructure fund. It froze infrastructure bonds, but it did not tell anyone before the election that it was going to do it. Quite the contrary; it said it was going to keep all of them. It also destroyed and silenced the voice of regional communities who were developing a capacity to speak through regional structures; organisations that Labor backed then and which Labor will back again when it is returned to government.
It also promised to hold regular cabinet meetings in the bush. In its first two years in office, it has met just three times outside capital cities. It slashed funding to regional universities. It closed regional CES, Medicare and tax offices. It watched as bank branches vanished from regional towns. It destroyed vital job opportunities. It will be introducing the common youth allowance in less than two weeks and cutting up to $87 per week from the family entitlement, putting added pressure on families in regions where youth unemployment is over 40 per cent in some areas. It will be introducing it with the support of the Independent member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who voted for that change.
In sharp contrast to the Howard government, Labor does see a vital role for government in regional development. We are committed to empowering regions to develop their agendas. We believe in supporting regional structures to help regional communities develop and implement those agendas. We consider that government must equip communities with expertise to assess the feasibility 
 of projects and more effectively connect good, viable regional initiatives that stack up and connect them to the financial markets. In particular, this will let them develop access to venture capital with a regional focus.
We are also committed to restoring support for infrastructure in the regions, not just through the re-establishment of the infrastructure fund but also through ensuring that the cap and scope of the infrastructure bonds are widened. We will increase the cap and widen the scope. At the moment, this government's bonds only apply to road and rail infrastructure. Anyone who knows anything about regional development knows that it is not just road and rail that is important for infrastructure.
Whilst I am on the topic of infrastructure, there is no more important infrastructure needed in regional Australia today than access to telecommunications technology. But what has this government done? It is determined to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra. This, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would probably well know, will cause immeasurable damage to people and businesses in regional Australia already suffering from delays in getting connections and service under a one-third privatised Telstra.
What incentive will a fully privatised Telstra have to provide good service levels to unprofitable rural customers let alone provide new telecommunications technologies? Nothing in the bill before the parliament requires new technologies to be made available to regional Australia. Regional Australians will have their telecommunications networks frozen in time. They will be left behind again by this government. Up to 35 per cent of Telstra may be owned by as few as seven overseas companies under this government's proposal. No shareholder in Tokyo, London or New York will be concerned about the lack of access to the Internet in Lismore. Why should they? They are after the same bottom line that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is after. They could not care less about the impact in the community.
In addition, the lean, mean corporate Telstra will continue the extraordinary job shedding that we have seen as a result of the one-third 
 part privatisation, with over 16,000 jobs lost in the last 18 months, many of them in regional centres. How will this benefit regional Australia? As a demonstration of Labor's commitment to oppose the sale of Telstra, not just for the election but into the future, and to lock in that opposition, we have announced through the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on Sunday that an ongoing and fixed proportion of the Telstra dividend will be paid into a fund. Part of that fund will be used for regional development and nation building.
There is an important connection between industry policy and regional development, but the Howard government does not care about that connection. This is a government that stood by and watched BHP announce the closure of its steel operations in Newcastle. It watched Amcor announce its planned closure of the pulp mill in Burnie, and it did nothing. On steel, Labor is committed to a metal fabrication industry plan. We argued successfully for a parliamentary committee which recommended the same, but the Howard government ignored the calls. In the words of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, `Black Jack' Moore, `It is not proposed that the government will respond to it.' That is their commitment to the steel plan for not only Newcastle but also other steel centres around the country.
But Labor is committed to such a plan just as we are committed to developing an industry plan for the forest products industry. It will complement the regional forest agreements process. What is the point of securing an ecologically sustainable way of utilising our resource if we are not prepared to value add it? Yet this government has allowed the reverse. The closure of the Burnie mill will see more woodchips exported and no value adding taking place. It is perverse.
This lack of action on the industry policy front has not only hit Newcastle and Burnie; it threatens Shoalhaven, Maryvale, Whyalla and Port Hedland. The government's decisions on the book and ship bounties threatened regional centres in Tasmania, Maryborough and Fremantle until Labor led the campaign for their restoration, just as we led the campaign on cars and textiles. The mem 
 ber for Oxley supported the government's decision to end the book bounty, voting for the legislation. She did not even bother to turn up in relation to the ship bounty vote. In all these cases, we have argued that the regional impact was too severe to justify the government's decisions. We sought amendments to the Industry Commission legislation to mandate that it have regard to regional impacts. The government voted these amendments down. So did the member for Oxley.
In the case of cars and textiles, we were able to secure reciprocal obligations from the manufacturers on growth in investment, jobs, net exports and research and development. These are commitments that can in turn be translated into commitments to regional growth, localising the impact, if you like, to ensure that prosperity, security and job opportunity growth is translated to the regions. It is about the big picture with a local dimension. That is what we would do in government across a whole range of industries. We would secure commitments to higher growth through a more interventionist industry policy built around reciprocal obligations.
The policy would enable regions to get a slice of the action by value adding and combining our natural resource strengths with our skill and innovation base. Our innovation base has also sadly been let down by the massive cuts that this government subjected it to two years ago. Now the scorecard is in on that too. There is declining investment in research and development by the private sector.
If Labor wins office at the next election, we would as a matter of urgency call in the parties in the steel industry and in the pulp and paper industries. Together, we would develop in partnership the appropriate growth strategies for those industries, based on new investment, based on innovation, based on the growth coming from net exports, and based on a commitment to job opportunities.
Regional Australia is losing services that city residents take for granted. Banks are closing branches at a rate of knots, leaving individuals and businesses without access to even basic banking services, let alone complex financial and investment advisory services. Australia Post remains in many areas, 
 with over 5,000 retail post outlets across Australia, but the government has refused to rule out deregulating Australia's postal services. Today, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) refused to say where the $67 million in cross-subsidy now paid by Australia Post would come from if the deregulation occurred in its most profitable activities.
This is a government that does not accept responsibility to guarantee the provision of accessible and affordable postal services for all Australians. What they want to do is to allow deregulation, and the private sector to move in. They are hardly likely to go for less profitable areas in regional Australia. Why would they? Why would they unless they have a government commitment to do it? Instead, they will move into Australia Post's profitable urban services, leaving Australia Post to pick up the tab in the bush. They will not be able to do it. With decreased profits, Australia Post will have no choice but to reduce services. Bush post offices will close. You cannot believe the Prime Minister when he says it will not happen.
—Rubbish!
—You say, `Rubbish,' but he said two years ago there would be no GST. He said, `Come back in two years and ask me again.'
—Never, ever.
—He said, `Never, ever.' How can anyone believe him on anything? This was the Prime Minister who deceived rural Australia on the last occasion. This was the Prime Minister who said he would not cut their services, and he did. He hid it from the Australian public, just as he has hidden the GST from the Australian public, just as he has hidden what he is going to do to Australia Post. This is a government that deceived Australia at the regional level. It betrayed them. It is a government that should be turfed out at the next election. (Time expired)

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,1998-06-23,"—As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) just said, we have just listened to the policy 
 speech of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). People in regional Australia will never, ever forget what the Labor Party did to them during the 13 years that the Labor Party were in office. Mr Deputy Speaker, you well know, being a representative of a regional seat, the impact of what the Labor Party did during their 13 years in office and what their high interest rate regime did to regional Australia.
We have just heard the member for Hotham crying at the dispatch box about the damage that has been done to manufacturing industries, to small business and to exporters and primary producers in regional Australia by this government, and that has not happened. We have worked with regional Australia on all our policy objectives to assist everybody in regional Australia on the basis of a whole of government focus across all portfolios—not just a single focus, as the previous government had. They thought that regional Australia meant the outer suburbs of the cities of Australia. That is where they spent the money that they maintained that they spent on regional Australia, but at the same time they ran the highest interest rate regime this country has ever seen. That had an absolutely incredibly devastating effect on everybody who lives, works and runs businesses in regional Australia.
The most significant thing that our government—the Howard-Fischer government—has done for regional Australia is to tackle that interest rate situation that we inherited, along with the economic settings that we inherited in 1996. The interest rate set-up in Australia when we came to power in 1996 was not an accident. We are managing the economy at the moment in a situation where there is very low growth in Asia. The Labor Party managed an economy with high interest rates when the growth rates of our near neighbours in Asia were at record levels, yet they ran these high interest rate regimes that had an absolutely devastating effect on regional Australia. We saw record bankruptcies in small businesses in regional Australia; there were record bankruptcies in small and medium sized manufacturing enterprises; and there were record bankruptcies of small farmers and 
 primary producers in regional Australia. There is absolutely nowhere in Australia where the Labor Party can hide from that record.
It is illustrated best in an article written by Max Walsh in the Sydney Morning Herald called `A pocketful of wry from the Reserve'. He quoted from the biography of Paul Keating written by John Edwards titled Keating: The Inside Story. I will quote a passage from that book which talks about how the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, handled monetary policy in this country and how it was absolutely no accident that we saw the high interest rates that slaughtered everybody in regional Australia when the Labor Party was in power for 13 years. I quote:
Keating had returned from the summer holiday all fired up about the way in which Noosa was full of bulldozers. He wanted the Reserve to lift rates by 2 percentage points in one hit.
The Reserve procrastinated but, under daily urging from Don Russell, lifted the rate by 1.75 percentage points.
Between March 1988 and November 1989, the cash rate was lifted by nearly 8 percentage points—
I repeat: eight percentage points—
with Paul Keating cracking the whip. Rates were pushed too high for too long.
Then, at the end of 1989, Don Russell—
and we all remember Don Russell, the chief adviser of the former Prime Minister and Treasurer—
(as he told a seminar a few years later) heard the economy snap: not a slowdown or a steady decline, but an audible snap.
It was no accident, under the management of the Australian Labor Party of the Australian economy, that we suffered from those high interest rates, and the people of regional Australia will never, ever forget. There is nowhere in this country that the Australian Labor Party can hide from that record.
There was an interesting quote the morning after the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced the budget this year. This is the importance of low interest rates and what our government is doing for regional Australia in providing security for regional Australia. That is what this MPI is all about: security and a prosperous future for regional Australia. We are providing the right economic environment, 
 underpinned by a low interest rate regime in Australia, so that people working, operating businesses and producing and exporting out of regional Australia can do that in a stable environment. That is what provides security in regional Australia. The New South Wales Farmers Association spokesman, Mr Mick Keogh, said in the Sydney Morning Herald on the morning of 13 May 1998:
With an average farm debt of $130,000, a 1 per cent hike in interest rates costs the farm sector $80-$100 million per annum . . . The `big picture' stuff is worth more to the average farmer than micro-economic grants.
They are the grants the Australian Labor Party talks about, the grants that were run under 13 years of Labor. The farm sector are more interested in the big picture stuff, they are more interested in ensuring they have a stable economic environment to operate within, as well as a government that is working to expand their export marketplace.
So a one per cent reduction in interest rates is worth an enormous amount of money to not only the farm sector in Australia but also small business in regional Australia. For a $100,000 variable interest rate business loan, a 2½ per cent reduction in interest rates is worth $2½ thousand a year to that small business. That can mean an enormous amount to the survival of that small business.
It is interesting to note that the Labor spokesman, the member for Hotham, moved this MPI. I referred to what the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, was doing to regional Australia with interest rates, and it is interesting to note what the member for Hotham's position was in that government. He happened to be the Minister Assisting the Treasurer. There was the Minister Assisting the Treasurer driving up interest rates under the leadership of Paul Keating, and he is in here today crying about what this government is doing to regional Australia. Regional Australia knows that the Howard-Fischer government has provided them with a low, stable interest rate regime in this country.
I will give one further example on interest rates that is incredibly important to regional Australia, particularly in the transport sector. In my area, I have a large transport operator, 
 Jim Pearson Transport. If he goes out to buy a prime mover truck for $250,000, it is not just that he is paying less than half the interest that he was paying under Labor—he was paying in excess of 20 per cent on those borrowings under Labor—but that he is paying less than 10 per cent under the coalition government. That is providing the security and the stability in regional Australia for those businesses to prosper, to do well and to provide jobs. That is the most important thing that the Howard-Fischer government has done for regional Australia, and we must never lose sight of that fact.
I will repeat again: there is nowhere in Australia that the Labor Party can go and hide from its record of 13 years of mismanagement of the economy, which had a dramatic impact on regional Australia and did nothing but provide insecurity and bankruptcies in regional Australia. You will never ever get away from that history and that track record.
It was interesting to note through question time today also that members of the opposition were talking about different towns around Australia and how it was going to affect this area and how it was going to affect that area. Since I have been the Minister for Transport and Regional Development over the last nine months, I have been around regional Australia. I have been around regional Australia talking about the circumstances of regional Australia under the current environment, some of their problems with regard to transport infrastructure and how we can help in assisting them to do much better.
I have also been talking to the local government bodies. As well, the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) has been around a lot of areas. I will just instance that I have been to the electorates of Richmond, Grey, Northern Territory, Parkes, Calare, Capricornia, Maranoa, Groom, Hinkler, New England, McEwen, McMillan, Farrer, Braddon, Kennedy, McPherson, Herbert, Leichhardt, Dawson, Braddon, Riverina, Canning, Pearce, Ballarat and Page, to name just a few, as well as my own electorate of Lyne, which is in regional Australia.
I am a minister who comes from regional Australia. I used to run a business in regional Australia. One of the main motivating factors that put me into this parliament was the fact that, when I was running a business in regional Australia during the 1980s, I nearly died. My business was nearly crucified by the high interest rates that were forced up by the Australian Labor Party when in government here.
Whilst I have been travelling around regional Australia, we know where the member for Hotham has been. The member for Hotham has not been around regional Australia; he has been down on the wharfs with the MUA. He has been down there playing cricket on the picket. How is the fast bowling going, Simon?
Here is the Australian Labor Party supporting the Maritime Union of Australia, who have done their damnedest to absolutely crucify the manufacturers and exporters of regional Australia to the extent where the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), the member for Hotham and the rest of the members of the Labor Party support what the MUA and their cohorts in the United States did with regard to sending 40 tonnes of Australian beef, produced by some poor beef producer in regional Australia desperately trying to get some export income into his pocket to pay his bank loan back and to pay his kids' school fees in regional Australia, and you are sitting over there in collaboration with the Maritime Union of Australia stopping those exports getting to the export marketplace.
—No, that's not right.
—You were. You sat there and you collaborated with them. That is what you were doing while we were consulting operators, producers and small business people in regional Australia. As I say, the Labor Party has nowhere to hide on this issue.
There are a number of other areas on which our government is totally focused in support of regional Australia. In this year's budget, in the 1998 budget, there was $3.5 billion worth of spending for regional Australia. The first thing was the Natural Heritage Trust fund. Remember that? One of the commitments we made at the federal election in 1996 was that, 
 upon selling the first third of Telstra, we were going to establish a $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund. That fund is designed to address the major land degradation problems across rural and regional Australia.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that earlier this year we were criticised by the Australian Labor Party for the amount of funding out of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund which was being spent in regional Australia. Well, guess what! That is where a lot of the environmental problems that we are trying to address actually exist—they happen to be in regional Australia. The Australian Labor Party opposed our spending of that money in regional Australia. For weeks and weeks, they asked questions in this place. They forced an inquiry. They criticised this government for the areas in which we were spending that money; and yet they are in here today moving an MPI about our lack of support for regional Australia!
To give one classic example, our government has provided $700,000-odd dollars to the Wallis Lake area in my electorate, where there has been a health scare about the oyster industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know only too well that the scare was propagated by the Labor Party in New South Wales through its environment minister, Pam Allen, and that it was an absolute beat-up. There has been no scientific evidence to establish that the origin of that outbreak of hepatitis was the area that she alluded to, but we have provided Natural Heritage Trust Fund money to improve the management of the Wallis Lake estuary in that area.
We have committed a billion dollars through the Federation Fund. We have heard from the Labor Party spokesman this afternoon, in the MPI, about regional telecommunications. We have established the $250 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to address the very problems in regional Australia that were bequeathed to it by 13 years of the Australian Labor Party in government in this country. We have taken action on those problems by allocating that funding to regional Australia.
We have established the Agriculture—Advancing Australia policy whereby $500 
 million will be spent on a number of issues critical to regional Australia, particularly the agricultural producers in regional Australia. One very important element is the $2.7 million allocated to rural and remote communities for credit care. The market forces are creating a situation where the banks are leaving rural areas. We have facilitated an opportunity—through the establishment of the credit care program and through the reforms and restructuring of the financial institutions in Australia—to allow the credit unions to compete on an equal footing with the banking sector. We are seeing those credit unions establish branches to provide that service right throughout rural and regional Australia.
We have made the legislative changes that have underpinned the framework to allow those organisations to compete with the banking industries. Rather than regulate from the top, we have provided the framework for credit unions to compete and to provide that service to regional Australia. So it is no good the Labor Party coming in here and crying about rural and regional Australia. There is nowhere for them to hide on this issue.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—It is very interesting that the previous speaker, the Minister for Transport and so-called Regional Development, Mr Vaile, spoke for 10 minutes about interest rates and how they rose over 13 years in the cycle of the Labor government. Of course, if you went back seven years prior to that, they would have risen and fallen also, and they will rise and fall over the next 10 years as well. He spent 10 minutes of his time doing that.
He hardly got to anything that his government have done for regional Australia. That is not unusual, because they have done nothing in regional Australia except cut services and remove opportunities. He did mention the National Heritage Trust Fund. They have taken money out of the landcare budget and moved it into that fund and claimed to have done something more than that.
Then he mentioned that he did a bit of pork-barrelling in his own electorate—something to do with oysters—and he fixed that up to make himself look like a good 
 bloke. So that is what he has done in regional Australia—very little indeed.
I said yesterday in the grievance debate, and I will say it again today, that, given the importance of this matter and the fact that people in rural and regional Australia are suffering hugely under the current policies of this government, I have travelled to a lot of different districts—similar to mine—all over Australia and the message is always the same: why doesn't the government see what they are doing to the people in the country? I can understand only too well why people voted the way they did in the Queensland state election. The government is leaving country towns. They are closing up services such as the employment service, the Medicare offices, schools and hospitals. Everything is being `rationalised'.
The private sector and the farmers are suffering because policies are moving away from individual small business to pander to the multinationals. The banks have gone, doctors are leaving and the police are serving bigger and bigger areas and so might as well not be there at all. As a result, companies are leaving and going elsewhere. They are leaving their workers jobless. The heart is being ripped out of small rural towns and their residents are trapped there.
Why is it so important to balance the budget when you throw so many out of work? The surplus is $2.7 billion dollars. I wonder how many jobs we could create with that sort of funding.
Look at the nursing home situation. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has cut half a billion dollars from that sector and introduced two new fees for people having to enter nursing homes. One of them—the accommodation charge—is particularly cruel to rural people. If someone has more than $44,000 in assets, they have to rent, remortgage or sell the family home. In country areas, and particularly in Tasmania, trying to sell their house is almost impossible because of the decline in those areas. The government has to have its pound of flesh somehow—so it makes the nursing home charge fees, and then it lets the debt grow. Not only is this unfair on the resident but it is pretty hard on the 
 nursing home that is trying to make ends meet—because the government is not paying maintenance costs to these homes any more.
To add insult to injury, the government announced a year ago $10 million for urgent capital works. But where is it? I am pleased that the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) is at the table—a colleague from Tasmania. Where is the $10 million that, it was said, would be spent on capital works? Not a cent has been spent, and the idiotic thing is that this government and the minister keep reannouncing it! He keeps reannouncing that they are going to spend $10 million on capital works, but not a cent has been spent yet.
This is not good enough. Not only is it not good enough but people from all over Australia are saying, `We cannot go on like this. We are prepared to vote for anyone who can give a glimmer of hope that things could be different.' I do not believe we can go backwards. Change is important. We are living in a different age to the 1950s. Communication is better, travel is cheaper and tastes and interests have changed. Changes are affecting jobs, security and even the way we do things, such as banking and collecting mail. Our expectations have grown too. Our children expect more than they ever did. We teach them that that is what they are to expect, and then we cannot deliver for them.
We are getting worried because, although some things are changing about us, the government are not attuned to how that change is effecting everyday life. They are not listening and they are not talking to us. That is what people say to me in my electorate and in other electorates. They say that the government just does not care and, further, that politicians do not care.
It is a hard one to argue when the jobs go, the services disappear and many are left isolated in country towns without any options. They cannot afford to leave and they cannot afford to live where they are. If they get sick—well, tough, they will have to wait two years before they can get into a hospital bed. If you want to try to get a loan to improve your business, you could try the bank, but the bank is closed. The head office is in another 
 state now. It hasn't a clue who you are or what you are trying to do to improve your lot in your own town, so the metaphoric door has shut in your face—and of course the real door went some years ago.
We the politicians cannot ignore this situation. We cannot shirk our responsibilities to the communities. The government of the day needs to intervene. It needs to be creating new jobs where employment opportunities are scarce. It needs to provide incentives for new enterprises to start. Many locally inspired inventions have come to my attention in recent years but few, if any, get off the ground. Why? Because it is difficult to find local financial backing. They are forced to look overseas for the money.
Markets may be the lifeblood of the free enterprise system, but they do not always work efficiently. They suffer from deficiencies, concentrations of market power, differences in wage levels and other imperfections. So, although the private sector can create new local initiatives, a complementary role needs to be played by government, otherwise the system will fail.
Look at Amcor in Burnie. The forest industry in Tasmania has taken a beating for over 10 years trying to get resource security so it can supply companies such as Amcor with a regular supply of wood that can be processed in the state. Now it has the wood, but the federal government cannot get its act together to finalise the regional forest agreement or get a proper wood and paper strategy in place. So the company says, `Thanks, guys, but we don't need you any more. You have left the door open and therefore we're leaving. There is no reason to stay. You aren't offering anything, nor are you making us develop the industry in any way. There are no positive things to help develop this industry for downstream processing in Australia. So tough titty. Away we go.' This government has failed. No wonder the whole country is stirring itself and saying, `We have been misled.'
Labor has a philosophy and that philosophy encompasses the idea that government has the right to intervene where the market fails. Not only does it have the right but it has a duty to do so. Labor is serious about the changes 
 going on. We believe that we need to keep a close eye on the marketplace along with the people. We need to be there with the safety net when the market fails. We will put the funds back into nursing homes. We will look at developing job programs, better ones than were there before. We are going to strengthen Medicare. We will be helping to provide more child-care places. We want to see the dental services returned and the waiting lists in public hospitals fall. We want to see families realise their expectations. We want the regional areas not only to survive but also to be places where people want to live. We want to put community back into our small towns and we will do everything we can to make sure that happens. We want to see change as a useful, vital and exciting time brimming with opportunities and jobs. We also want to help those less fortunate, allow them a safety net and nurture them back into our communities to become useful and welcome citizens. We will do these things under a Labor government. The other side have failed in government. They have failed by tearing the heart out of regional Australia. They deserve to fail at the election.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—I thought the title of this MPI put forward today by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) really showed his breathtaking audacity. How could the member for Hotham have the audacity to get up and use the words `security' and `regional communities' in the same sentence when he was a member of the government that absolutely destroyed security in regional areas? In fact, I think it is worth while reminding the members here in this House exactly what the member for Hotham and his former government did to regional areas. I must say that I speak with some authority on this matter because I happen to represent a regional electorate and I live in a regional area. I have lived for the past 22 years in a very tiny rural community.
We only have to cast our minds back just a few years to remember the number of farmers who lost their farms because of high interest rates. For those families that did not lose their farms, often the husband had to leave the farm and seek work off farm while 
 his wife was left to manage the farm and the family. Similar stories can be found in just about every small business in rural communities. Families had to pull together, pull in their belts and work so hard just to keep that small family business going and manage their families at the same time. Sadly, many thousands of businesses did not survive, and the effect of the policies of the previous Labor government on small rural communities was catastrophic.
When we came to office just over two years ago, the legacy we inherited was those people living in the small regional communities who had been battling for over a decade. They had battled a recession, they had battled high interest rates, they had battled poor prices for their commodities, and in many areas they had battled drought and flood. It was really only the tenacity and courage of those people who lived in those small rural communities that actually kept those small towns going. They were just in survival mode.
I listened to the member for Hotham, the first speaker in this MPI debate. He talked about how the previous government concentrated on the big picture. Well, in concentrating on the big picture, they failed to take notice of the detail; all of those details that were tearing small rural communities apart.
The member for Hotham also talked about services. He talked about closing Medicare offices. My electorate is approximately 14,500 square kilometres in area. I tell you: I did not have one Medicare office in the entire 14,500 square kilometres. It is sheer hypocrisy for the member for Hotham to get up and start talking about closing Medicare offices in regional areas. I can tell members in this House that this government has placed a real emphasis on regional communities. It has not just devoted one small office or department to looking after regional communities; as the minister has said, it has taken a whole of government approach. What that means is that every single department governed by every single minister in this government has a priority when developing policies to say how these policies are going to be implemented and what effects they are going to have in regional communities.
I am very proud to stand here as a member of this government and say that, for the very first time, there are towns in my electorate that have services they never ever had in the 13 years that Labor was in government. The member for Hotham said that this government abolished a $150 million regional development fund. Yes, we did, and we did so for very good reasons. Those funds were not getting through to the regional areas. I have one very large shire in my electorate, the Murrindindi shire. Not one inch of that shire fitted the boundary of a regional development authority, not one square kilometre of it fitted. That example is replicated right across the country.
In place of that one small office and department, as I have said, this government has placed a whole of government emphasis on regional communities. We are spending $3.5 billion more than the previous government. I think that bears repeating: $150 million went, but we are now spending $3.5 billion. We are restoring services in all of those regional communities to provide the sort of security people living in those areas want. Let us face it, what is it that families and individuals in regional areas want? They want much the same as people living in any other part of the country: they want to be able to afford to hang on to their businesses; they want to be able to afford the mortgage payments on their homes; they want decent access to, and a decent standard of, education for their children; they want decent access to health care; and they want to make sure that they too are getting access to the telecommunications infrastructure that members in metropolitan areas take for granted.
You have already heard the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) talk about the provision of $250 million for telecommunications infrastructure. Just recently, $610,000 of that money went into a small area of my electorate. That means that people living in the regional areas of my electorate are not going to be left behind. They are not going to be ignored the way they were by the previous government. You have heard mention of the millions of dollars that have been put into environmental works. 
 A lot of small projects have also been funded, like the Lake Nagambie project in my electorate.
In this very brief debate today, one of the things that I want to touch on that I believe has caused the greatest amount of insecurity in regional areas is the misunderstanding and lack of knowledge about how small rural communities can tap into trade reform. The term `trade liberalisation' gets bandied about, and it gets a negative response from people. I am going to lay the blame for that level of ignorance fairly and squarely at the door of the previous government, which must bear a large responsibility for the lack of knowledge and the lack of information given to both producers and members of the general public.
It may surprise you to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that at the grassroots level of all regional communities there is very little understanding, for example, that 70 per cent of all agricultural products of this nation are exported. Many people do not understand that we must take part in an international marketplace, even though our primary producers have been doing a fantastic job. Last year they increased their production by 7.4 per cent, which rated just in excess of $21 billion. But we have only one per cent of the world's agricultural trade. All of this stems from the fact that the previous government did an extremely poor job of informing people of exactly what the benefits are of trade to regional areas. (Time expired)

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the second 
 report of the committee for 1998 relating to new facilities for the National Museum of Australian and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, the report which I have tabled today concerns the proposed construction of new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. The indicative cost of the capital works is $133 million. The ACT government has also committed $3 million for infrastructure and is proposing to establish the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Centre on the site.
The committee has recommended that the project should proceed. This recommendation is contingent on a number of conditions which I will address shortly. Let me begin by saying that this report follows a lengthy and protracted inquiry by the committee. It was lengthy because of a number of complexities which surfaced. These are addressed at length in the report, but they encompass changes to the award winning design, the cost of the proposed work and the project delivery mechanism to be used.
I might add that all members of the committee from all political parties had considerable concerns about the presentation of the facts associated with this proposed development, which, as I have already reminded the House, is for a very large amount of money—some $133 million. I congratulate all the members for pursuing the issues in the way that they did in the interests of making sure the department in particular was aware of its responsibility in this matter. On the other hand, I would say in some defence that it is a very large project with a very short timetable. It is to be completed in time to recognise the centenary of Federation.
The report begins by providing the history of the development of the concept of the national museum. This goes back almost 30 years and involves an almost endless series of studies and reports. The proposal examined by the committee was initiated by an international architectural competition which was promoted as such overseas. Unfortunately, as the 
 committee discovered, it did not qualify for this title. The report spells out the reasons and how the competition was conducted.
The basis for the design of any building is the architectural brief. A brief was prepared for the five competition finalists to give them some idea of what was required. Unfortunately, again, the committee found that the brief was completed with considerable haste and was not properly costed until after the design competition closed. These factors resulted in the inclusion in the brief of what can best be described as `ambit claims for space'.
The committee found that none of the five final designs from which the winning design was selected met the cost cap, nor did the costing of the brief undertaken by the Commonwealth's own cost consultants. This resulted in what were described to the committee as further refinements and a tightening up of space, requiring `further testing and refinement of the original concept'.
The committee believes the final design is a significant departure from what the public was advised the museum would look like. The original concept and the revised design are illustrated in the report and honourable members can make their own comparisons. Further refinements to the winning design have resulted in a building which appears to depart from the original design concept. These changes appear to the committee to have been driven in the main by the need for the winning design to meet the budget rather than simply as improvements to functionality.
As this is a project of national significance funded by taxpayers, major departures from the published design are a cause of concern to the committee. Whilst the design of the proposed building to house the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies largely remained intact, the layout was transposed to offer improved views of the lake. This transposition was intended, however, to save two heritage trees on Acton Peninsula.
A feature of the design was the provision of a wetlands area. This was intended to demonstrate a commitment to ecologically sustainable development principles. Gabions, or small man-made islands, would form part of 
 the wetlands. The committee has recommended that the need for the inclusion of gabions in the wetlands should be reviewed. Submerged wave barriers associated with those gabions should not be provided due to their deleterious effect and, in fact, danger to navigation.
The proposed works include the construction of an ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Centre in conjunction with the museum and the institute project.	This will be funded by the ACT government. The committee has recommended that, on completion of the National Museum of Australia, consideration should be given for the facilities at Yarramundi Reach to be vacated for use by the ACT Cultural Centre. This will provide scope for future expansion of the museum on Acton Peninsula.
It is proposed to employ a form of delivery process known as project alliancing as the preferred method of delivery for this construction project. It is the first time that such a process has been used on an Australian construction project. It is the first time on a Commonwealth project and—need I say—the first time on a project examined by the committee.
Project alliancing is a process whereby a group of builders and subcontractors get together with the designers as a team. The idea is that they progress the activity together. They do not have the normal power of litigation after the project is completed if there are changes to the project. In fact, they forgo the right to litigation. Problems have to be solved internally.
The alliancing concept was described to the committee at the end of the third day of public hearings as `complex'. This occurred after the committee had spent a considerable amount of time questioning departmental officials about how it would work in relation to cost and profit, minimising the risk to the Commonwealth, the anti-litigation provision, checks and balances, negotiation of variations, the protection of subcontractors, and quality control.
Although the committee gave approval to the Department of Communications and the Arts to call for expressions of interest for 
 alliances—which they have done—and to undertake the work, the committee remained concerned about the suitability of the alliance concept. The committee concluded that although a project alliance has commenced for the Sydney Water project its outcome has yet to be proven in delivering a quality product in the public sector. Moreover, this delivery system is untested in the construction industry in Australia—having previously been used in major development resource projects.
Notwithstanding that the committee has given approval for the Department of Communications and the Arts to advertise for expressions of interest from possible alliance participants, considerable doubt remains about how the interests of the Commonwealth will be protected in an alliance arrangement. Issues relating to quality control and cost imposts associated with delays due to mismatched delivery of works between the construction partner and the service provider remain to be answered to the committee's satisfaction.
In terms of cost, the submission to the committee from the Department of Communications and the Arts advised that the total establishment costs for the museum and the institute, including capital works, were $152.374 million. This is somewhat at variance with the cost of the project when referred to the committee, which was $133 million.
At the public hearing on 8 December 1997, DOCA amended the establishment costs for the museum and institute to $151.9 million. The report details the committee's dissatisfaction with the lack of consistency in the budget proposed to be expended on the proposal. As already stated, the work as referred was for $133 million. Since the amount to be expended was subsequently stated to be $151.9 million, the committee is unable to understand why the total amount was not the same as the amount originally referred. Furthermore, the committee wishes to place on record its concern about the proposed increase in cost on the basis that the committee's consideration is limited to the expenditure of $133 million, as originally referred.
Having said that, the report recommends the construction of the works in this reference at a cost of $133 million at October 1997 prices, subject to the provision to the committee of six-monthly reports on the progress of the project until completed. The reports should address: progress of works and services elements identified in the construction and fit-out program; any variation to the timetable for the completion of the project; any further design changes—their nature, justification and cost; expenditure and audit reports; confirmation that subcontractors have been paid on time for work undertaken—and I am pleased that the committee took some time on this and on a couple of other projects it has investigated in recent times to raise the issue of the mechanisms for protecting subcontractors; if applicable, details of disputes between any parties on the site, notwithstanding the fact that they are to be resolved internally; if applicable, details of delays to the project due to the mismatch of timetables between the construction alliance partner and the service provider; specified standards of finish and the standard of finish provided; and details of attempts, successful or otherwise, to obtain endowments and bequests for the museum.
Finally, if it is considered necessary to proceed with lump sum tendering, the aim of completing the project by January 2001 should be reviewed for the reasons stated by the Department of Communications and the Arts in the paper discussed in the report which addresses the disadvantages of proceeding with this delivery method. I commend the report to the House and welcome any comments from the deputy chairman of the committee.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,17,1
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—by leave—I rise to support the comments made by the chairman of the committee. It is true to say, as is outlined, that the committee did have some concerns about some of the evidence provided. It really seemed to us that we had been there for a couple of days before we started to get to the nub of the matter we were inquiring into. What people sometimes overlook is that we are a committee charged by this parliament to protect the taxpayer dollar. In this case, I think that the committee, 
 as it always does, exercised the charge that this parliament has given it.
We were concerned about some aspects of the costing because it seemed to us that there was a variation between what had been proposed originally and the figures that came before the committee. The chairman has already said that it was a lengthy inquiry; and indeed it was. In fact, I think the whole committee was quite frustrated because we felt that we did not really get to the nub of it until day 2, or something like that. Many of us had travelled some distance to get to Canberra, at some expense to the taxpayer, and a day or two were wasted in that regard. However, the committee worked well. It was a complex hearing. We had to familiarise ourselves with many aspects, but the complexity was not helped by some of the evidence given by the department, as was outlined by the chairman.
This building will be an important addition to Canberra, but it is also a building of national significance, so it is an important building for the whole of Australia. Personally, I would have preferred the building of the National Museum to go to the original site at Yarramundi Reach, but a case was made and it was decided that it would go to Acton Peninsula. I agreed with that, but I think that with a little bit more imagination we could have had something at Yarramundi Reach.
I do not want to reopen that argument, which has been well canvassed within Canberra. With the proposition that came to us, we were not asked to decide on the site. This is a point that some people may have overlooked. We were not invited to decide on the best location for the museum. It was accepted that it was going to go on Acton Peninsula. We were charged to look at the building, not to consider the merits of Yarramundi Reach or Acton Peninsula.
The final building will be different from the plan that was released in this building. I remember being here when the five final entries were displayed and the winning entry was pointed out. The building that will be built on Acton Peninsula is somewhat different from the building that won that so-called competition. 
I think all the members of the committee had some concerns about project alliancing. It took some time for people to explain to us exactly what this new concept meant. We are not experts in this field; we can only make decisions on the evidence that is presented to the committee and with the best will in the world. We have decided to take a punt on project alliancing. It has not been tried before with a building like this, and only time will tell whether or not we have made the correct decision. As always, the committee accepted the responsibility it has in regard to this project. We were all conscious that we were deliberating on a building of national significance; a building of significance not only to Canberra but to all of Australia.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the second 
 report of the committee for 1998 relating to new facilities for the National Museum of Australian and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, the report which I have tabled today concerns the proposed construction of new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. The indicative cost of the capital works is $133 million. The ACT government has also committed $3 million for infrastructure and is proposing to establish the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Centre on the site.
The committee has recommended that the project should proceed. This recommendation is contingent on a number of conditions which I will address shortly. Let me begin by saying that this report follows a lengthy and protracted inquiry by the committee. It was lengthy because of a number of complexities which surfaced.

"Miles, Chris, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—I move:
That the amendment be agreed to.
The Senate amendment to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Bill 1998  is minor in nature and amends clause 56 which contains the word `powers' by replacing it with the more correct reference of `functions'. The proposed amendment has no financial impact and is supported by the government.
It is appropriate that I take this opportunity to remind the House of the key role that APRA will play under the regulatory regime. APRA will be the prudential regulator of banks and other deposit-taking institutions, life and general insurance companies, superannuation funds, and retirement income accounts. APRA will have comprehensive powers, including for licensing and regulation of the institutions authorised to provide these financial services.
In the case of superannuation and retirement savings accounts, APRA will also be responsible for regulation designed to achieve retirement income objectives. This reflects the close relationship between regulation for that purpose and prudential regulation in these sectors. While APRA will initially take regulatory responsibility for all superannuation funds, it is anticipated that this responsibility in respect of most excluded superannuation funds will later pass to the Australian Taxation Office.
Provision is made for APRA to be accountable through an independent board and to operate under a charter that ensures that the safety objectives of prudential regulation are balanced with efficiency, competition, contestability and competitive neutrality considerations. The APRA Bill sets out the framework for APRA's operation. This bill establishes the powers and functions of APRA, while other legislation in this package of bills will provide for the laws and regulations to be administered by APRA in relation to each sector.
APRA will be an independent regulator but, like the Reserve Bank, will be subject to an overriding policy determination power of the Treasurer in the very rare event of unreconciled disagreement with the government of the day. As a Commonwealth authority, it will be accountable to the government and the parliament as provided for under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. In addition, the bill provides for additional reporting requirements in APRA's annual report, including a report on any investigations on prudential matters under section 61 of the Banking Act 1959.
Any reports presented to parliament by APRA may, of course, be referred by parliament to a committee, such as the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, for detailed examination. APRA will also be expected to appear before the parliamentary committees on request. APRA will be governed by a nine-member board, whose terms and conditions of appointment will be subject to determination by the Remuneration Tribunal. To ensure that there is a close 
 relationship between APRA, the Reserve Bank and ASIC, two of APRA's board members will come from the Reserve Bank and one from ASIC.
The bill also provides for the powers of the board to set terms and conditions of APRA staff. It is envisaged that, in the first instance, the bulk of APRA's staff will come from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, and the Reserve Bank supervision area, together with the staff of state based regulatory agencies when they join the regulatory scheme. I take this opportunity to reiterate that the interests of staff transferring from the RBA and the ISC are being fully protected.
The government envisages that APRA will become fully operational at the Commonwealth level on 1 July 1998. In this context, this bill provides the changeover responsibilities for a prudential supervision of the financial sector at the Commonwealth level. Transfers of staff and responsibilities for state based institutions may require separate legislation at a later date once final agreement has been reached with the states and territories.
The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has announced that the headquarters of APRA will be based in Sydney to ensure that a close relationship is maintained with the Reserve Bank, which will continue to have responsibility for the overall stability of the financial system. This will facilitate close communication and operational cooperation between these two bodies. He did, however, emphasise that the government expects a presence to be retained by APRA in the major state capitals and, at least for some considerable time, in Canberra, which is the current base of the ISC.
In summary, APRA represents the centrepiece of the new regulatory structure. It is a specialised regulatory agency focused on clear regulatory purposes. As the single prudential regulator, APRA will be able to provide flexible, efficient and coordinated and consistent regulation across the financial sector, particularly for financial service conglomerates, which now make up the major part of the financial system. It will be in a position to achieve regulatory excellence, provide broader and more enriching career opportunities for its staff and develop close and com 
 prehensive links with the whole financial system. I commend the amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—I join with the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in making a few observations about the amendment, or at least about the role which APRA is intended to play. The existing regulation of the Australian financial system is quite complex but it is worth perhaps setting out briefly. The Reserve Bank is responsible for the supervision of the banks. The Australian Financial Institutions Commission is responsible for the regulation of building societies, credit unions and special service providers. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has responsibility for the supervision of life companies, general insurers and the superannuation funds. The Australian Securities Commission has responsibility for the supervision of unit trusts, merchant banks, finance companies and pastoral finance companies. Finally, the state authorities are responsible for the supervision of friendly societies, trustee companies, public trustees, cooperative housing societies and state government owned insurance offices.
It is quite a complex regulatory system. It is intended that this be changed in a way that will involve APRA taking over responsibility for the supervision of six separate types of institutions: the trustees of superannuation funds; the retirement savings account providers; the life companies; the insurance companies; authorised deposit taking institutions, which is obviously banks; and authorised non-operating holding companies. It is the opposition's view that it is a change worth making. We have been supportive of this legislation and are supportive of the amendment, which is a minor amendment substituting the word `functions' for `powers'. I do not think in what might turn out to be the dying days of this parliament we will be served by a long discussion of the changes that that might involve.
While the parliament is playing its part in terms of the supervision of banks and deposit taking institutions and is endeavouring to provide a regulatory framework that will 
 enable them to perform in an optimal way, I do not think we as a community are getting value from the banks in terms of their performance. There has been increasing community concern about branch closures, staff sackings and redundancies and increased fees and charges. If you look at performance, you find a parliament doing its job in terms of the regulatory regime but banks that are not providing a level of service which the community feels it is entitled to and is indeed entitled to. Unless the banks are prepared to look more seriously at their social obligations than they have so far, we will come to a time when the parliament has to revisit some of these issues. Having said that, the opposition supports the amendment.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—I rise to associate myself once again with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Bill 1998  as amended ever so slightly. It is interesting that the Senate was able to find one word which it wanted to strike out and replace. But this is democracy in action. Constituents in my electorate would be delighted by the prowess of those in the other place in finding that the word `powers' should be substituted with the word `functions'.
Nevertheless, the bill as it stood and now stands, as supported by both the opposition and the government, really highlights the fact that we have in place in this country a national government prepared to look at some of the practical and futuristic reforms which need to be undertaken. We have the wonderful situation where we are going to put more pressure on some of the key institutions in our community that are not responding as well as we would like to consumers' aspirations. The Wallis report, the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who I note is in the chamber right now, and the executive have been determined to put into the hands of everyday bank consumers, superannuation fund consumers and insurance consumers in this country competition which will bring about some real responsiveness to their needs and concerns.
The legislation is practical and straightforward. It provides some very landmark reforms to Australia's financial institutions sector. It 
 involves a large package of bills which have been before this House once before. The legislation nevertheless recognises the fact that Australian companies are able to participate openly on the world stage. They can contribute something to world's best practice and participate in the world without fear of being intimidated and without any form of economic or cultural cringe being imposed upon the nation. Our financial institutions can proudly stand on the world stage as a player in international affairs.
For the everyday person, this sort of talk may not seem like bells and whistles. However, when any of my constituents go into a bank and find that they are disappointed by the level of service or they find that a fee or charge has suddenly been imposed or when they go into, for that matter, a private health insurance provider and find that their cheques are now no longer good enough to get a discount, they should bear in mind that greater competition will introduce companies into the equation that may be able to provide them with the sort of service they want. Consumers have the right to choose between various providers. Obviously people facing these sorts of major decisions in their lives are often reluctant to move from one particular institution to another.
While government is playing its role in making the reforms in a legislative sense and while the government is playing its role in providing financial incentives to people to participate in private health insurance, to take out superannuation and to save money for their future, I think it is also important for government to provide a clear signal to those institutions which govern those particular areas of our community that we expect them to respond to consumers' needs and demands. Competition is always the best mechanism to bring in those sorts of responses.
The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) quite rightly said that if we do not see the responsiveness we want and need from our major financial institutions in their various forms we could well be back in the parliament to look at other ways, means and measures. Until that day, I think what we have before us, as amended, is an excellent 
 bill. I commend the Treasurer on his personal efforts in making sure that these matters are driven, and driven well. They will set in place yet another part of the rock solid foundation the Howard government has established so people can realise their personal ambitions and individuals can go out and achieve. For those sorts of reasons, I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—I hope that the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) has had the opportunity since he last spoke in this place on this legislation, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Bill 1998 , to review some of the more recent history on the matter, because at the time that he last spoke he was a little less than charitable in terms of the role that former governments had played in financial deregulation. I suggest that even the Treasurer (Mr Costello) would concede that the proposals that are currently before this place are certainly worth while and welcome. They build on a lot of that financial deregulation which has occurred in this country and, in fact, did occur under Labor.
My comments on the particular amendment that we are dealing with today go specifically to a point that was raised about making Australia and Australian financial institutions able to compete more effectively on the world stage. I think this is what we are really trying to achieve in any amendments that we bring into this place which certainly oversight the prudential supervisory arrangements that apply to financial institutions in Australia. My views on this have been pretty well canvassed.
Importantly, while we are doing that, we should also provide an opportunity for some of those banks that are in Australia to take their rightful place as major players with the big boys in the rest of the world. I know that this is one of the unfinished issues that the Treasurer is going to deal with at some stage. Perhaps he will not necessarily be the person who will deal with it; it may well be dealt with by a Labor Treasurer. The unfinished business relates to dealing with the six pillars policy and whether that is going to continue.
—Six?
—Six down to four now. A number of people, particularly those in the Melbourne banking establishments, have been talking about the way in which there is a need for further rationalisation to give an Australian bank at least a mega presence in the world as a financial institution. That is an issue which will be returned to by the next government. I know that, as part of that next government, we will be more than happy to do so.
It is important that we reflect on the fact that this legislation is about giving surety and security to people in the financial industry. It is also about giving security and surety to those people who have placed their faith in the financial institutions that exist in Australia. There is no doubt that the Wallis report was a timely reminder to us all that governments have to be ever vigilant when looking at the financial structure of the Australian economy, that times do move on, that methodologies that are applied in banking systems change and that people have to be prepared to move with those changes.
Some of those changes may be painful. People generally do not like change, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, as I am sure you well appreciate in your own electorate. People do not like change; people see changes when existing regional banks, for example, are swallowed up and turned into larger banks or when building societies take out banking licences and decide to compete in that regional market, and so on. Those changes are an inevitable consequence of the competition that the honourable member for Moreton was referring to a little earlier, and about which the Treasurer was nodding in agreement. They have a real role to play in the Australian economy. It is a mixed economy. It is an economy in which both government and private enterprise play a very important role, no more so than the Australian banking industry and the Australian finance sector.
Government has to be there through its regulatory regime which this bill seeks to fully explain and put in place, so that those artificial arrangements which previously existed between banks, insurance products and all the rest of it can now be clearly dealt with, and the former arrangement which grew out 
 of an inquiry which I was involved in has now evolved into a further stage. All of these matters are important. At the end of the day, it is this parliament which oversees the way in which the financial system in this country ultimately works for the betterment of each and every one of us in that economy.
The strength of Australia lies very much in the way in which the financial services sector deals with the everyday flow of money into and out of the economy. It is important that it is done in a safe environment and that people have confidence in it. I think what the Treasurer has brought forward as a result of the Wallis inquiry is a very useful extension of the work that has already been undertaken.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
This bill contains further amendments implementing the government's financial system reform package. Taken together, the bills in this package put in place a new regulatory structure to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the financial system while preserving its integrity, security and fairness.
The legislation implements the first stage of the government's response to the recommendations of the 1997 financial system inquiry, FSI, chaired by Mr Stan Wallis. Negotiations are proceeding with the states on the implementation of the second stage of the reforms which will move state based financial institutions into the new prudential and consumer protection framework.
The rationale for the reforms and the detail of the measures being put in place were outlined in the second reading speeches that were made when I introduced the initial package of bills into the House of Representatives last sittings. These bills, among other things, establish the two new financial system regulators—the Australian Prudential Regu 
 lation Authority, or APRA, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC. APRA and ASIC are expected to commence operation on 1 July 1998. The amendments included in this bill ensure that other Commonwealth legislation and the Corporations Law is made consistent with the new regulatory arrangements.
A number of the amendments in schedules 1 and 3 to this bill are consequential to the amendments to the Banking Act 1959 contained in the  Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998 . Generally, these consequential amendments change references to the words `bank', `banker' and `banking' in other Commonwealth legislation and in the Corporations Law to equivalent references to `authorised deposit-taking institutions'. Similarly, this bill also includes amendments as a consequence of the repeal of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987.
References to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in Commonwealth legislation and in the Corporations Law are to be amended to refer to either APRA or ASIC, or both, depending upon which organisation will take on regulatory responsibility. A number of the consequential amendments also give effect to the proposed renaming of some of the financial sector levy acts—in particular those applying to excluded superannuation funds—as amended by the financial sector reform package.
Recommendation 3 of the FSI was to the effect that ASIC should have sole responsibility for administering consumer protection regulation within its jurisdiction over the financial sector. For this purpose, consumer protection provisions comparable to those in the Trade Practices Act 1974 were recommended to be included in the legislation that ASIC administers. Schedule 2 to the bill will confer on ASIC sole responsibility for consumer protection in relation to financial services.
As a result of amendments included in the first package of bills introduced on 26 March 1998, ASIC will administer the specific market integrity and consumer protection functions under the various pieces of legisla 
 tion listed in proposed section 12A of the ASIC Act. The amendments in schedule 2 will add to these functions by transferring responsibility for consumer protection in the financial system under parts IVA and V of the Trade Practices Act from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to ASIC. ASIC will therefore have the full complement of functions and powers to exercise its role in the most effective manner in the interests of consumers.
The removal of regulatory overlap was one of the goals of the financial system inquiry. To facilitate this goal, ASIC will become the specialist regulator for consumer protection in the financial system. It will have a high level of expertise in all matters concerning consumer protection and market regulation while consumers and other market participants will benefit from having a dedicated regulator in the sector.
To ensure that consumers of financial services are not inconvenienced by the changeover in functions from the ACCC to ASIC, the two regulators will be entering into an operating agreement. This agreement will also facilitate the smooth operation of the new arrangements in the transitional period. ASIC and the ACCC will work cooperatively to address any areas of overlap which may arise between their jurisdictions.
The Australian Securities Commission has already established the Financial Complaints Referral Centre, which operates as a `one-stop shop' to direct consumers who have a complaint about a financial service to the appropriate consumer complaints forum, for example, the Australian banking industry ombudsman scheme or the Life Insurance Complaints Service. ASIC will ensure that the centre continues to operate effectively for the benefit of consumers, and that appropriate matters are referred to the ACCC.
The ASC has a significant track record in implementing programs of investor education. It is expected that ASIC will build on these programs to ensure that consumers are well informed about their avenues of redress. As the regulator responsible for enforcing the consumer protection provisions in the ASIC Act, ASIC will, of course, act diligently to 
 enforce the act and punish breaches of it where appropriate. The government has considerably enhanced ASIC's budget to enable it to perform its new functions.
ASIC's activities in the area of consumer protection under the ASIC Act will be subject to the annual reporting requirements under the act. The reporting requirement will be amended by this bill to specifically require ASIC to report on its monitoring and promotion of consumer protection in relation to the Australian financial system and the provision of financial services.
ASIC will also be subject to the scrutiny of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The duties of that committee include inquiring into and reporting to both houses of parliament on the activities of the commission which the committee considers should be brought to the attention of the parliament. The committee also has the function of examining each annual report prepared by ASIC and reporting to the parliament on matters that appear in that annual report and to which, in the committee's opinion, the parliament's attention should be drawn. If necessary, the committee is also able to report on questions which it is asked to inquire into by the House of Representatives or the Senate.
The government is firmly committed to strong and vigilant consumer protection in the financial system. ASIC's enhanced role will enable it to focus on the needs of consumers of financial services and provide more efficient market integrity and consumer protection regulation throughout the financial system.
The government sees the transfer of consumer protection responsibilities for the financial sector from the ACCC to ASIC as an `upgrade' in the level and quality of regulation because ASIC already has had years of experience in the consumer protection field. With its enhanced resources, ASIC will be able to effectively build on its current expertise and infrastructure.
In conclusion, let me return to the beginning of this financial sector reform process. Immediately after our election in 1996, the financial system inquiry was established to 
 consider improving regulation in this area. Our policy motivation was the fact that the financial system has entered an era of accelerated change that is likely to continue into the next century and the government's recognition that the performance of the financial system—its stability, integrity and efficiency—and the cost effectiveness of its regulation are critical to the performance of the entire economy.
The financial sector has not been immune from change since the Campbell committee recommendations were adopted in the early 1980s. Against the background of technological change and globalisation in particular, the Wallis inquiry identified three main reasons for further reform. First, Australia's financial sector performance was assessed to be close to the world average rather than the world's best. Second, existing regulatory arrangements do not treat all new market structures and activities equally and do not always ensure that we get the maximum benefits from change. Third, there are a number of areas of the financial system which could be more competitive.
The passage of this bill, the last in a substantial package of legislation, will see the implementation of the new prudential and consumer protection framework proposed in the Wallis inquiry. The financial sector lies at the heart of the entire economy and we all depend on, and benefit from, its success. The reforms embodied in the FSI legislation will facilitate greater choice and competition in financial services. They will encourage more rapid innovation, providing wider access and enhanced levels of service. Australia will have a world class regulatory structure that ensures the highest standards of prudence and safety and consumer protection. Regulation will be more efficient, with greater consistency and less overlap. More openly contested markets will drive down industry costs and prices. These benefits will flow to all areas, including small business, those in rural and remote areas and consumers generally.
At the same time, Australia's financial system will be positioned to compete strongly in the global economy, and to continue to grow as a service export industry. The government's initiatives will ensure that 
 Australia's financial system provides the best possible foundation for the continued development and growth of the whole Australian economy. In short, Australia will have a world class regulatory and consumer protection framework for the financial system to take us into the next century. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—The main thrust of this bill, the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998, is to transfer the necessary powers to the Australian Securities and Insurance Commission, ASIC, for the day-to-day provision of consumer protection in the financial services industry. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has indicated, this represents one of the final pieces of legislation to implement recommendations from the 1997 financial system inquiry which was chaired by Mr Stan Wallis and which became widely known as the Wallis report.
While we are on the subject of Mr Wallis, I cannot resist making the observation that Mr Wallis is presently acting as spokesman for the Business Coalition on Tax Reform which is screening advertisements for what it describes as `the need for tax reform'. However, that same Mr Wallis has indeed let the cat out of the bag by saying that one of the things they want to get out of this is lower business taxation. The only way to get lower business taxation is to have higher household taxation. So these are, in fact, advertisements from people who essentially want you to open your pockets so they can pick them.
Throughout the Wallis debate, the Labor Party has made it abundantly clear that we did not want to see any diminution of consumer protection as a result of the changes being made. Our position is clear. We believe that the ACCC should be an economy-wide regulator, which can intervene in any market on behalf of the consumer. In particular, we see this economy-wide character as important to the avoidance of regulatory capture. All too often, the regulatory authorities which are set up ultimately become dominated by the industries they are supposed to be regulating. Consumer groups are very active when they 
 are aggrieved, but often pass on to other concerns. In contrast, the regulated industries are there every day, getting closer and closer to the regulator. Nevertheless, there is a role for industry-specific expertise. In the financial services industry, the ACCC has been relatively less active than in other consumer areas. The hope is that the ASIC will better understand the products and methods of the financial	services industry and will be better resourced to pursue consumer interests.
The Labor opposition has been supportive of the general thrust of the Wallis package and we have worked constructively with the government to ensure that the Wallis package of bills is passed in time for the projected starting date of the new regulatory regime. That level of cooperation is reflected by the fact that we are, indeed, debating this bill at once.
We have had disagreements over aspects of the package and this bill is no exception. Our first concern was the maintenance of the working conditions and entitlements of the employees who would be transferred from the Reserve Bank, the ASC and the ISC to form the new body ASIC. After raising the matter with the government we are now assured by the relevant unions that there will be no loss of conditions and that the transitional difficulties will be addressed by ASIC.
We are concerned that there should be no confusion about the application of the Criminal Code to matters such as implied warranties, because the burden of proof is higher for criminal offences. We did not think it appropriate that the regulators had to prove intent. In this regard, we have been assured by the Treasurer and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that the Criminal Code will not apply. We have a major concern that there will be confusion in the mind of the consumer as there is, apparently, still considerable overlap between the ACCC, the state offices of fair trading and the new ASIC. A consumer using a plastic card at an ATM will fall under ASIC if he or she presses the `debit' account button, but will fall under the state fair trading offices if he or she presses the `credit' button. You could add any number of other similar products, which combine debit and 
 credit features and which are sold by financial advisers or accountants in one package.
The one-stop shop that is proposed, which will be a common gateway for all consumer complaints, assumes an enormous importance when dealing with these products, and the Labor opposition has been insistent that the government promote this entity to the fullest. We have also insisted that ASIC's educative and compliance roles be promoted adequately, not only because this is a new institution but also because the potential for confusion amongst consumers is considerable in the increasingly complex world of financial products.
The opposition was also concerned about the delegation of the considerable powers of ASIC. For example, ASIC has the legal power to initiate proceedings, to accept 87B undertakings and to receive delegated power from the ACCC. These are not powers which should be delegated to the most junior staff of any regulator and the government has accepted that only a handful of the most senior officers in ASIC will be the recipients of such delegation. This bill also leaves unconscionable conduct with the ACCC. It seems an anomaly to leave this area of small business with the ACCC, but the government has made it clear that such is its intention. Be that as it may, we are concerned that there should be no loss of protection for small business as a consequence.
In making these observations about the ACCC, I want to say—and I note that the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) is here as well—that speaking for myself I am disappointed with what we have ended up with concerning the issue of unconscionable conduct, a matter which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, will be familiar with. The committee which inquired into issues of fair trading made very comprehensive recommendations in this area in its report Finding a balance, and recommendation 2.2 stated:
. . . that the Minister request the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to approve the Uniform Retail Tenancy Code for underpinning in the Trade Practices Act 1974, thus providing for the courts to take into account provisions of the Uniform Retail Tenancy Code in determining 
 whether or not business conduct in the area of retail tenancy has been `unfair' and thus unlawful.
That report was known as the Reid report and that recommendation was amongst many which we in the opposition supported and looked forward to being implemented. Unfortunately, when the legislation came forward, it did not contain this provision. When we raised the issue, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said:
That was never our objective. We do not want two sets of legislative schemes, federal and state, for retail tenancy. Nothing could be worse, nothing could be more costly and more burdensome for the small business community.
So what the minister did was reject out of hand a recommendation which that committee had come up with after considerable consultation and after a great deal of discussion with retail tenants and small business generally which were aware of some of the issues at stake. It has become increasingly clear that the minister's alternative—to farm it out to the states—has been less than satisfactory and we are not getting from the states anything like uniform retail legislation across the nation.
Indeed, the Victorian small business minister, Louise Asher, introduced her own Retail Tenancies Reform Bill to bring in a number of provisions which she regarded as appropriate for Victoria. One does hope that legislation will be of some benefit to retail tenants in Victoria, although I note there is no provision in that legislation for a retail tenancies tribunal. I think that is a really important feature of this whole area. There should be appropriate protection for retail tenants—it is one thing to have legal rights, it is another thing to have mechanisms to implement them. The absence of a retail tenancies tribunal means that retail tenants in Victoria, and indeed in other states, will have a less than satisfactory situation. So while we are talking about this issue of unconscionable conduct and the role of the ACCC, I do want to express my concern that we have ended up with a situation for retail tenants which is less than optimal. Given the lousy treatment which they have received over the years, it does seem to me that they deserve something better than that.
As with anything new, time will tell in the operation of ASIC. For our part, we will remain vigilant over the rights of the consumers in financial services, and we will be keen to see that ASIC fulfils its charter and remains flexible and active in the face of rapidly changing financial service products. I indicate that the opposition will not oppose this bill.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Southcott, Andrew, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—The Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998  amends the terminology in various acts to make them consistent with the amended legislation governing financial systems. For example, it changes the term `bank' to `approved deposit taking institution', and it also changes the ISC to ASIC in various acts. The bill also gives the Australian Securities and Investments Commission the function of consumer protection in respect of financial services and takes it away from the ACCC. This bill replicates the consumer protection provisions of part IVA, part V and part VI of the Trade Practices Act in the Australian Securities Commission Act, which will be the governing act for ASIC.
ASIC will be limited in its consumer protection role to conduct in respect of financial services. In the bill, there are nine subdivisions which deal variously with the definition of financial services and financial products. Subdivision C deals with unconscionable conduct for corporations and financial services for personal, domestic and household use; subdivision D deals with consumer protection; subdivision E deals with conditions and warrantees; and subdivision F deals with enforcement and remedies.
It is worth noting that, after most of the earlier bills relating to the implementation of the recommendations of what has become known as the Wallis committee passed through the Senate yesterday, the Australian Financial Review today reported that Ms Lynn Ralph, the chief executive of the Investment and Financial Services Association, said:
We think the new bodies will give the industry the regulatory framework that it needs to move forward into the new millennium.
In the regulation of market conduct and disclosure in the financial system, the com 
 plex nature of financial products needs to be taken into account. Market failure, such as barriers to entry, information imbalances and externalities, can arise from two sources: firstly, unfair or fraudulent conduct in the market and, secondly, inadequate disclosure of information. Financial regulation composes both market integrity regulation and consumer protection. At present, market integrity and consumer regulation have been shared between the ISC, the ASC, the ACCC and the Australian Payment Systems Council.
The problems with the current system are, firstly, that there are gaps, overlaps and unevenness in the regulatory intensity, style and cost in existing Commonwealth conduct and disclosure regulation due to inconsistencies. Secondly, there is duplication between conduct and disclosure regulation and between the financial regulators—like the ASC, the ISC and so on—and the ACCC.
The Wallis inquiry looked at several alternative models. They looked at a dual regulatory model, a co-regulatory model—like we have now—and a single regulatory model. A functional approach to financial regulation is better. One of the problems we have at the moment is that, if you have a public unit trust or an investment linked life policy—two investments which can be functionally fairly similar—there are different disclosure rules and different financial regulators for each of those. The regulations for security brokers and life insurance agents, who can often be offering similar products, are also different.
The Wallis inquiry recognised that forces shaping the financial markets mean that regulators must be flexible. Their conclusion was that several specialised regulators would be less responsive to the changes we are likely to see in the new millennium. The previous speaker, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), mentioned the concern sometimes stated that if you just have a specialist regulator you may develop regulatory capture. It was the conclusion of the inquiry that that concern of regulatory capture was overstated. The inquiry felt that the ACCC and ASIC need to avoid any regulatory duplication, which would lead to increased compliance costs, uncertainty and 
 inconsistency. Recommendation 3 of the Wallis inquiry states that consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act should be included in the legislation for what was then called the CFSC but is now called ASIC.
Regarding the Australian financial system and the inquiry, I think we recognise that a strong, stable and vibrant financial system is a primary prerequisite for a modern economy and for economic growth. It can deliver many advantages to specific users and to the economy generally. Advantages for consumers can include things like increased choice and less costly financial services and products. For the economy, there is a reduction in financial system distortions, which allows resources to be shifted to their most efficient use and enhances Australia's competitiveness.
The financial system's estimated value in employment is $40 billion, with over 300,000 people working in it. It also provides Australia with much needed service exports. As I have said, the current financial system has a regulatory structure which is inconsistent in the way in which it deals with banks, credit unions and building societies. It is inefficient, and it is not conducive to competition in the financial system.
The government commissioned the financial system inquiry, the Wallis report, because of the importance of the financial system to the economy and the significant and rapid changes occurring in the Australian financial system. The changes include technological innovation, globalisation, changing business strategy and consumer needs. These changes are affecting all Australians, both consumers and businesses.
The Wallis report analysed the forces that are driving economic change and made recommendations on key issues in regulatory reform. Those recommendations were aimed at creating effective, responsive, competitive and flexible regulatory arrangements. Stemming from the report, the government has already introduced a number of bills which have passed the Senate. These are substantial reforms that aim to make Australia a world financial centre and the No. 2 financial centre in the Asia-Pacific.
By providing a modern, efficient and effective financial system, Australia is in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities that are currently presented to us and to become a leader in the delivery of financial services. We have a stable political, economic and legal system, a highly educated work force and, thanks to the present government, good economic fundamentals such as low inflation, low interest rates and a high level of direct share ownership. These reforms will heighten the stability in Australia's financial sector, which is especially important given the current Asian currency and financial system crisis.
The regulatory reforms will provide an environment that is conducive to a stronger economic performance and offers financial stability, prudence, integrity and fairness. The report stated that even a 10 per cent improvement in efficiency would translate into cost savings for the economy in excess of $4 billion per annum. By making Australia open for business and a regional financial capital, we can actually create jobs.
The Wallis report also indicts the current taxation system. The report states:
The taxation system at present does not appear fully conducive to attaining international competitiveness and other financial system goals.
It goes on to say:
For example, taxation provisions, including income tax provisions and stamp duties, inhibit structural reorganisation and corporate entities.
This is another source that indicates the current tax system is not working. It is not working for families, it is not working for Australian exports and it is not working for the Australian financial system. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—As has been indicated by my colleague the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), the opposition will not be opposing any aspect of the financial sector reform legislation which we are debating today. I will not detain the House too long, save to make one or two comments about the way in which the proposals that have come forward here will play a very real role in the Australian economy in the future. I dare say, though, that it will not 
 be the last time we debate with a government in this place changes that will be necessary as changes occur in the financial structure of the Australian economy.
If one thing is certain as we rapidly approach the next millennium, it is that, with technological changes, with the globalisation that has occurred in the way in which financial services and financial service transactions take place around the world, there will be a new approach to not only the regulatory system that applies in Australia but also the supervisory way in which we deal with the sorts of issues of security that will emerge as being of concern to many people.
The reason I say that, of course, is that the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) in his comments alluded to the Asian economic crisis, the Asian currency crisis, and the implications that that has for Australia. There is no doubt that some 12 months ago, when the first hint that there were problems in our region started to emerge, it really did centre on currency; it centred on nothing else. At the time the government was saying, `There's nothing to worry about. Australia's been nicely insulated for any of the problems of our local region. We're the strongest economy in the entire region, and we can withstand anything. At the moment it is only currency and there is not much else to worry about.' As time has gone on, of course, we have seen that it is anything but just a currency crisis.
The revelation last week that Japan is officially in recession was enough to send shock waves not only through our own region but also right around the world. The repercussions that occurred in the stock markets around the world and the repercussions that subsequently occurred with currencies and the valuation of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis many of our other trading partners saw some enormous repositioning of the way in which the Australian economy was viewed by others, and the way in which I think the government has started to view its own handling and the fundamentals the member for Boothby referred to.
The simple fact is that when an economy like Japan goes into recession, when it has 
 been dangerously hovering with very poor growth rates for a period of time now, that must send to its major trading partner—that is, Australia—a clear message. The message has to be that if the second largest economy in the world, second only to the United States, can have such a fundamental problem imposed on it then there are some lessons that need to be learned and some ramifications for Australia.
In the case of Japan, we are talking about a financial system in that country which is basically archaic. It is in need of absolute and total reform. I have no doubt that some of the measures the Prime Minister announced yesterday—after, yet again, further hasty consultations with the President of the United States—will go some way to repairing that. But the simple fact is that an economy like Japan has effectively been isolated and insular when it comes to financial services.
Allowing banks from other countries, for example, to get in to compete against Japanese banks has been a no-no. In fact, many of the those Japanese banks themselves are starting to feel the sort of disease that swept through many of the Australian banks in the late 1980s. They have been swept away by huge volumes of loans which cannot be repaid. Bad debts have accumulated because of many failed Japanese business enterprises. In years gone by that would have been unheard of.
In years gone by the Japanese economy would have been viewed as strong enough to withstand any of those sorts of difficulties and to rebound and to lead by example in our region. That has not been the case. As a consequence, I think the World Bank, the IMF and other monetary authorities around the world that have been making comments about some of the other economies, like the Indonesias, the Thailands and those sorts of places, are now saying that in the case of Japan we need to give some clear thought and direction to the way in which they are going to reform their own financial system because it is going to have an enormous impact on the local region.
We are concerned about this legislation, though, ensuring that adequate consumer 
 protection is incorporated within the changes being proposed. I think there is nothing clearer as to why this is necessary when you see examples in our region and examples in other locations around the world of similar economies where banking systems were seen to be strong and consumers were bitten and hurt by poor decisions that were occasioned by the financial system of the time. The United States again proves to be an example of this.
In the 1980s, when the S&Ls were around, the savings and loans operation where mum and dad banks, very small operations, could start up and offer loans to people for a song almost, they got themselves into all sorts of difficulties, yet in the United States the government had to come to their rescue because of the depositor protection system which operates there. Thank goodness that out of the Wallis inquiry this government, indeed any government, decided against pursuing that as an option for Australia.
I could think of nothing worse than to have some government inspired, government funded—at the end of the day, taxpayer funded—proposition that we have deposit protection funds in place so that somebody knowingly could go into some sort of crook business deal and get left holding the can and the bank could then apply to the Commonwealth government to have that money reimbursed to give back to those people. Where would be the incentive for ordinary people to use a bit of prudence when looking for protection for their own money?
—They could offer a two per cent borrowing rate.
—As my friend and colleague the member for Dobell suggests, it sounds very much like the sort of two per cent borrowing rate nonsense that some people are talking about. Perhaps when all else fails they could simply print more money. I can just see the printing press in the electorate office of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) working overtime as we speak.
Access to services is another important element of this debate when we are talking about the way in which financial sector reform is implemented in Australia. One of 
 the enduring qualities of the way in which Australia has operated as a financial services centre for the Asia-Pacific region has been a recognition by those foreign banks, for example, that come and locate here that the customer base they have was such that they could very nicely niche market. In days gone by when the original 15 licences were issued for foreign banks to come here it was always going to be on the bank to establish a branch network and, as a consequence, they would compete against the existing major Australian banks, regional banks and so on.
As we have seen over time, that has not happened. It has not happened for a number of reasons. The first is that the big four decided they would get fairly aggressive in the marketplace. As a consequence, with a population of only 18 million people, those foreign banks decided that it was not worth their while to establish a branch network which could compete against the existing banking structure, and fair enough. In more recent times, with the elimination of the restrictions on foreign bank licences, we have seen more banks come here and, as a consequence, they have added a dimension of competition in niche markets, particularly in business lending and so on. In terms of housing finance and other markets for small business and so on, we find that as a direct result of competitive elements amongst the existing banks in Australia there are some fairly reasonable deals on offer at the minute.
One of the issues I have been addressing as I have been travelling around talking to small businesses in Australia at the minute—and it is an issue that one of the parliamentary committees on which I sit has examined in recent times—is the way in which the margin for lending for small business has started to come down. In fact, the Reserve Bank of Australia figures have indicated that that is the case. Whilst there still is a margin, because small businesses are often those most susceptible to not working out and, as a consequence, the risk factor has to be added in, that margin is starting to get a little smaller.
I think that would be something all small businesses would welcome, and it is certainly 
 a reflection of the way in which the financial system in Australia has been opened up to competition. As I said a little earlier in a contribution in respect of some other similarly related bills, that is not just as a result of the reforms coming out of Stan Wallis's committee's report in the last two years but as an ongoing result of financial sector reform that has occurred since 1983 in Australia, because since that time there has been enormous change.
One of the negative issues associated with this is the question of access to services with the current drive to maintain profit levels and dividends to shareholders with the banks. At the end of the day, who can blame the banks? They really are beholden to their shareholders and they do not believe that there is any community service obligation on them when it comes to providing services to rural and remote areas. One of the ongoing issues is whether the banks should be compelled in some way or cajoled into staying in many rural and remote areas of Australia when the rest of business is shutting down.
I have mentioned this issue in this place previously. A parliamentary committee of inquiry is presently examining ways alternative sources of providing banking services might be available to rural and remote Australia—things like the local pharmacy offering a limited range of banking services, perhaps even the extension of credit unions or building societies which are prepared to stay in the town when a bank perhaps closes down and perhaps having mobile outreaches where the banks get together in the same way as one-stop shops do for the provision of services and information to, say, small businesses. We could have a mobile outreach program where the banks fund somebody to travel around to these rural and remote areas to provide appropriate advice. All of that is reasonable, and all of that has to take into consideration modern technology.
I said earlier today that unfortunately we all are a little resistant to change, we do not like to see change when it is occurring because we are a little frightened of it, but when it comes to the provision of banking services time moves on and home computers, people having 
 greater access to the Internet, banking services being placed online through home computers and so on, telephone banking and holes in the wall in every regional shopping centre around Australia are providing alternatives to the way in which people have traditionally had banking services provided to them. I think this whole issue is going to be of great interest to people in the future.
We saw in the Queensland election the populist views of One Nation. One of the issues raised was that people were concerned about the elimination of services in regional and rural Queensland. They are—and they are concerned about it in regional and rural Australia generally. In the Illawarra region they are concerned that Medicare offices have been shut down, they are concerned that the immigration office was shut down, they are concerned about the range of other services in parts of Australia where the Taxation Office has gone and so on; and when they see that the banks are also shutting down they complain loudly about that. I think it is an issue for government that we are going to have to address, and I know that the opposition is looking very carefully at this particular issue.
One of the two final matters I quickly want to touch on is the issue of consumer protection and the fact that unconscionable provisions have been included here—unconscionable conduct, borrowing directly from fair trading—and my friend the member for Wills made some comments on that. The fact of the matter is that this definition of unconscionability is still being used. It is a much more difficult test than unfairness. My friend was talking a little earlier about its applicability to retail tenancy matters because the changes to the Trade Practices Act, which come into effect on 1 July and apply in a small business sense, are a direct lift from the consumer protection provisions in the Trade Practices Act.
It is important for people to realise that unconscionability is a very difficult test to prove; unfairness, on the other hand, is not. There is no case law on unconscionability in small business. I do not know if there is any when it comes to consumer complaints. Unconscionability in some way implies that 
 there was a very conscious decision taken by somebody to defraud or to delude or to, in some way, get an advantage over some other person in a commercial relationship. It is very hard to prove. Unfairness, on the other hand, is easier and, in my view, is something which needs to be revisited by government.
The final issue is the question of taxation reform, which was mentioned by the member for Boothby. You would have to laugh when you talk about the banks, taxation reform and Wallis all in the same breath. Let's face it: Mr Wallis, as the chairman of the banking inquiry which has caused many of these amendments to come forward, was concerned about ensuring, from his perspective, a whole new approach to financial services provision in Australia. In my view, many of his recommendations were right and, as I said to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) a little earlier, I think the government will be revisiting a few of those others, particularly their four-pillar policy, which I think at some stage will be reviewed downwards.
But this same Mr Wallis—the head of the Business Council of Australia and the same person who is funding the advertisements on taxation reform being run at the minute—is trying to pass the burden away from business, reducing big business costs and passing it on to ordinary consumers. Not only that but the banks themselves are out there in the car advocating these changes, and they are also advocating that the GST does not apply to banking services.
—As long as they're exempt.
—As long as the banks are exempt from this form of reform they are all for it.
—I bet the veterans aren't exempted.
—I think people have to be a touch wary when the banks think the greatest thing since sliced bread is for a GST to be imposed on everybody, provided of course they get an exemption, and when this is being driven by the man who did the inquiry into the banking system and who is also helping to fund the ads on TV which suggest that this 
 is the best form of reform of the taxation system.
This legislation is not contentious. It is certainly welcome. This legislation draws together elements of the 1997 financial system inquiry which was chaired by Stan Wallis. I have said in this place before, and I will say it again, that I thought he did a first rate job as the chairman of that committee. We cannot agree with him on his most recent statements in respect of taxation reform. But isn't that great? That is what makes democracy in this country. On the other hand, the Treasurer of Australia—and hopefully it will be the Treasurer on this side of the parliament—will be coming back to deal with a range of these issues in the not too distant future.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—The Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill is, as the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), said, non-controversial and is generally accepted by all across the House. In opening my comments I want to put on the record the issue of our finance system and how we as a nation take it for granted. When the banking system was deregulated during the 1980s, we became aware of some of the excesses that can come into a banking system if it gets out of control.
Those situations you hear of in international financial systems which run amok and the human misery that is brought upon the populations of those countries really bring it home that if you do not have proper prudential care and proper legislative strength in your financial system you can very quickly get into serious trouble as far as your economy goes and bring misery to your people. So I remind the House that we do take our finance system for granted. With our early adventure of deregulation with high interest rates, excess borrowings and the pressure it put on many Australians, we have matured. This is part of that maturation process. We do welcome it because our country is built on the solid rock of a strong financial system.
The bill further implements the government's reform agenda in the financial system. The 11 bills introduced in the parlia 
 ment on 26 March represent the first stage of implementation. The two new regulators, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities Investment Commission, will commence on 1 July 1998 or as soon as possible thereafter. The reforms in the bill reflect the changed regulatory arrangements for financial institutions under APRA's supervision. There are a whole range of consequential matters which are obviously very detailed. My compliments go to the legislative drafting people who must spend many hours poring over the various parts of the legislation and the various consequences to make sure it stands up in the proper legislative sense.
In terms of the financial implications for the government, there is no financial impact. I understand that the regulation impact on business is very low. We will ensure that the amendments to the Banking Act 1959 are mirrored and reinforced by other Commonwealth legislation so that consumers may benefit from increased choice, improved quality and lower cost products and services in the medium term.
I now turn to the issue of banking in the bush which has been touched on by previous speakers. I started life as a bank clerk in a bank which has been taken over by one of the big three or four that we currently have in this country. But, nevertheless, in the short time that I worked in the banking industry, it was interesting. It was quite a pleasant industry to be in. There was service delivery and customer contact. I quite enjoyed the time I was in the bank. I headed off to another occupation, but, nevertheless, I always look back on my days in the banking industry with some fondness and pleasant memories.
As a member of parliament representing one of the largest electorates in the country, services in the bush are a real issue for us. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration and its chair, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), have a pretty big job ahead of them in looking at the alternative means of providing banking and like services in regional and remote Australia. I look forward to that report.
The one thing you cannot stop is technological progress. Whatever decisions the banks make about where they see their profitability and their service to their customers, there is the ever forward march of technology, and the capacity of this technology is ever remarkable. I was somewhat discouraged by the newly deregulated banking system in the late 1980s to the point that I moved to the credit union approach to banking, which I found quite satisfactory. But, whichever system you are in, whether it is corporate or commercial banking, the credit union or CreditCare, which is another area of the finance service industry giving service to smaller communities around Australia, you cannot get away from the fact that this technology is going to continue to offer a range of services in efficiency, effectiveness, convenience, whatever, that would have been unheard of in the days when I was a bank clerk 30 years ago. That is the challenge in front of us. I am sure that the banks are not deliberately looking to be difficult or to not provide a service to people particularly in smaller communities, but the fact that we do have such a large range of options in front of us in terms of banking services is something that will ever be impacted on by the technology available.
The Wallis report has been well covered. I understand that we will allow new financial institutions to establish themselves locally, including local or regional credit union-style institutions, and I welcome that. I think the credit unions have a role to play, particularly in regional Australia. When the report was brought down last year, I thought it was quite well accepted in the community. To my knowledge, the credit union movement regarded the report quite well.
I think I have covered pretty well all the provisions and implications of the bill. Too often we use the word `competition' and it becomes just jargon. The Wallis inquiry did note that if only a 10 per cent improvement were achieved in the financial sector, the result would be savings in excess of $4 billion a year. Those are the dimensions of an efficient and effective financial sector in Australia. That $4 billion represents invest 
 ment for other employment opportunities, dividends for our retirees and infrastructure in our country.
The purpose of the legislation is to keep abreast of the changes in the financial industry, and I welcome them. It can be a little scary to look at the potential for change in front of us but, as I said earlier, this onward march of technology, with the international implications, will offer many more opportunities for Australia than we could ever have thought of a decade or so ago. I think of one opportunity in Port Augusta where a new service—the electronic trading service—will offer a whole range of capacity in a financial and traded goods sense, internationally, which that community is embracing with great enthusiasm. That is another example of how this industry is so dynamic and constantly changing, to the nation's advantage. This is a non-controversial bill and I wish it well.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Smith, Tony, MP",IND,1998-06-23,"—Having been here from the moment the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made his second reading speech, it has been interesting to listen to the various terms and comments that have been used in this debate on the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 . They are terms that people in the electorate, I think, are very frightened of. I speak of `globalisation', `technological change', `competition policy' and the acronyms `ASIC' and `ACCC'—all of those things that do not mean too much to ordinary people except that they are frightened of them. I guarantee that if you ask members of this parliament what they think `globalisation' means you will probably get 149 different answers. Some would not answer the question at all. I might be one of those who would probably refuse to answer on the grounds that I am not quite sure what it means.
However, the fact of the matter is that we do have a changing society, a changing economy. When one considers the comments of the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) about his time in the bank 30 years ago, one realises it is a very different environment now. The banks of 30 years ago had a face-to-face aspect, friendly bank tellers and easy access. They took pride in dealing with their custom 
 ers, they had absolutely assiduous banking policies and they ensured that your money was carefully looked after and that you received an interest rate that was always modest. There was never a worry or a care about those banks running to the wall. That is testament to a banking system that was built, as I think the member for Grey said, on a solid rock.
It is a very different scenario these days. I think it is fair to say that, if you asked the average person what they thought of banks today, you would get answers that were none too kind. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, would know only too well that banks seem to have forgotten that they are there to serve customers. Now the banks seem to focus on the fact that they are there to serve themselves first and foremost. Consequently, banking deregulation has somehow led, it is said, to a better environment, to the saving of more money and to the system becoming more competitive.
But how do you say that to the pensioner who comes to see you and says, `I had an account with $500 in it. I had forgotten about this account. The book had been sitting in the cupboard for a few years. Anyway, I saw it the other day and I thought that was good and I would put $10 in the account'? What happened when he took the book into the bank? The bank said, `Thanks very much. We'll give you about $3 worth of interest and we'll take $10 for your not depositing money in the account for three years.' The penalty of $10 was for not depositing money in the bank for three years. As I reflected on that story I said, `I'm sure that legally the bank cannot do that to you, because it would have to get you to agree to the changes that it was making in its policies before it could impose the levy.' That is a matter that, for the sake of principle—even for only $10—I will be pursuing further.
It is that sort of environment that is getting people very upset. If that is globalisation and technological change people do not want a bar of it. People want to see that a bank that is using their money—even that little $500 was being used for three or four years—gives some reward for doing so. Whoever heard of 
 the notion of being charged for having money in the bank and not withdrawing it or making a deposit for three years?
So when we hear the member for Grey—and I respect him greatly—comment that we cannot stop technological progress, we have to ask whether that is an oxymoron. Is this progress? Progress is getting into a position where you want to be. Sometimes we should reflect on the terminology of these things. When Mr Wallis says that a bare 10 per cent improvement will lead to a saving of $4 billion, by whom will the saving be made? Will it mean that that $10 will not be abstracted from the account of the pensioner any more if we make that saving? I guarantee it will not.
The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) commented about the closing of banks `even in Illawarra'. I will refer to one that closed in an area that I have inherited with the change in boundaries—in a little town called Dayboro in the more rural part of the new electorate of Dickson. In the outer parts of Dayboro, there are pineapple growers, some dairy farmers, banana growers, other small crop growers, and small business people who serve those industries still left there—all of whom really appreciated having that bank and the fact that it was there.
What has happened? When we ask why these banks have closed down—as we should do—we should expect an answer. Is it because we have to accept that banks are also going through this economic rationalism notion? And what does that mean? Does that mean that beforehand—before the 1980s, before the liberalisation, the deregulation, et cetera—these banks really did not make much money? In fact, they ran at a loss but they were providing a service. But there was always an upside to providing that service, because the rest of the family, who might move to the city or might do something else, would be using that bank, based on the reputation it had gained by being in that town servicing—and doing the right thing by—the people who have lived there.
Banks, in a sense, have become myopic about these things, in my view. When you ask yourself where we are going as an Australian 
 community, with the little bank closing down in the little country town, you then have to ask—and the member for Cunningham reflected on this—how we can get them to stay there. It is an interesting and important question to be asked: how can we get them to stay there? Can we impose on their goodwill, or can we persuade them? Can we argue that it is in their best interest to stay there? In a commercial sense it is. It is really penny-pinching to close down a one-person bank in Dayboro or in the Illawarra or somewhere else—banks that are serving a little discrete community but doing such an important job for the overall notion of decentralisation that is so dramatically needing to be held together. That is not desiring something we should not have; that is desiring something we have to have to be an effective and viable society.
I noted also some comments by the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) about Mr Wallis's comments on the tax system. The tax system certainly does need reform. There are very few who disagree with that notion. But we also need to look at the other end—as to why it needs reform. The answer cannot be `It needs reform because it needs reform.' We always have to look at the expenditure side of that issue. Did the tax system evolve because expenditure just kept blowing out and out? The Income Tax Assessment Act also expanded exponentially from a stage where, when I did tax law at university, you could carry it around quite simply in your travel bag but now you need a trolley to carry it around.
—Must have been a long time ago.
—Not all that long ago, actually; it was 1980, in fact. In any event, we do need to ask those questions. We hear about the situation in Asia and particularly in Japan. The recession was mentioned by the member for Cunningham, although some have described it as a depression. The US has now temporarily come in to stem the tide, as it were. But these matters are all ultimately of great concern to people in government who have to watch these things. Ultimately, there is a trickle-down effect. Is that trickle-down effect in some way linked to the fact that we are linked so strongly to the global economy? 
 Is that another area that we need to be concerned about, that we need to ask questions about? Rather than glibly roll these terms off the tongue, do we need to ask why? `Should we not ask why?' is really the question.
It is important, as the Treasurer mentioned, that the parliamentary committee is going to have power to look into ASIC. That is a very good initiative to be carried out by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, provided of course that the government pays heed to the committee's work. That is important. It is no good having a committee to just basically window-dress; the committee's report needs to be considered.
Overall, some challenging and interesting matters have been raised by the various speakers. I say to all concerned that we should always consider whether we are, in fact, making progress with these changes. We are assured that we are, but is it real progress in the sense that we are benefiting the ordinary people, the average person? I thank the House for its time and commend these remarks to the House.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—in reply—Firstly, I would like to note that, when drafting this legislation, an existing anomaly in the Trade Practices Act was carried into the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 . It is not a defect or error in the drafting of the bill but rather reflects the fact that the amendments mirror the Trade Practices Act. Subdivision E, in particular section 12ED of the amendments, will imply into contracts for the supply of financial services a warranty that the services will be rendered with due care and skill.
If the consumer makes known any particular purpose for which the services are required, there is an implied warranty that the services will be reasonably fit for that purpose. It is not technically possible to breach this provision in a way that leads to criminal sanctions. The provision simply implies a contractual warranty. The same situation arises under the Trade Practices Act.
The government has noted concerns that have been raised about the fact that the bill 
 appears to attach criminal sanctions to breaches of implied warranties. This is not in fact the case, and the bill will have no effect on the rights of parties to contracts into which certain terms are implied by the bill. To make the position absolutely clear the government had intended to clarify the operation of the bill on this question by way of a chairman's amendment, but this has not been possible. The government intends to address this anomaly in the Corporate Law Economic Reform Bill which is proposed to be introduced into the House next week. In the meantime, this anomaly will not affect the technical operation of the provisions.
I take this opportunity to summarise the debate to say that this is major reform of the Australian financial system. This bill puts in place a regulatory system for Australia which will be leading edge in the world. This is something that is being watched very carefully internationally and it gets new prudential regulation, particularly—(Quorum formed) I thank the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) for calling a quorum so that people would come into the House to hear the conclusion of this debate. This bill brings to a conclusion substantial reform of the Australian financial system. It puts in place world-class regulation. It puts Australia at the forefront of regulation. It will cut costs and it will ensure that the Australian financial system takes us forward into the next century.
I acknowledge the support that the opposition has given in relation to this. I pay tribute to the officials who have worked hard to bring this about. This is important regulation and it will ensure that the Australian financial system is governed in a prudential, fair and stable way. One of the lessons that we have learned from the Asian financial crisis is the importance of having a stable, well-regulated financial system, and this bill will ensure that Australia has such a system into the next century.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—In drawing this debate on the second reading to a close, I wish to thank honourable members who have spoken on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1997. This bill, combined with our choice of funds legislation, will deliver a package of genuine superannuation reforms. Superannuation will be easier for employers to administer because they will have only one set of federal obligations to meet.
Complying with many awards in the one workplace and complying with the superannuation requirement of those awards in the one workplace can build complexity and administrative costs for employers. Under the superannuation guarantee legislation that this House has passed, the Australian Taxation Office will now ensure that the administration of superannuation for all employees is done with clarity and fairness. The removal of superannuation provisions from awards will remove a layer of complex detail and relieve employers of the burden of complying with an 
 extra set of obligations which have done nothing more than add to the complexity of superannuation administration.
This will be of real benefit to employers in the federal industrial relations system. The government welcomes the extension of this benefit to employers who are required to meet state award obligations in relation to superannuation. We will continue to work with the states and actively pursue a greater harmonisation of federal and state industrial relations legislation. The removal of superannuation from state awards would be a welcome initiative. Were it done, it would remove yet another layer of administrative cost from employers.
After all, we are living in a day of intense competition, with Australia and its workplaces up against Japan and its workplaces and Europe and its workplaces. In these days of competition, anything of a sensible nature that can remove layers of administration is beneficial not only to the Australian employer but ultimately to the number of employees that can be put on by Australian firms. It allows the Australian employer a sense of certainty and a cost reduction that makes them more competitive and gives them a willingness to employ more people. In that way, it advances the wellbeing of all Australians, be they employers or employees. We look forward to the day when state governments follow the example of the Victorian government and remove industrial law as a matter of competition or extra administrative cost between governments.
The proposal to exclude superannuation from awards is not new. I remind honourable members that when the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Bill 1996 was originally introduced in May 1996, the allowable award matters did not include superannuation. This reflected the government's view that superannuation is most appropriately provided for through the superannuation guarantee legislation and through agreements at the workplace or enterprise level. Superannuation was added to the allowable matters in the period of negotiations that went on whilst the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Bill was being negotiated through the House 
 of Representatives and, particularly, the Senate.
Superannuation was added to the allowable matters by way of a Senate amendment moved by the government and the Australian Democrats. It was always intended by both the government and the Democrats that this would be only a temporary measure and that superannuation would be removed from the allowable matters as part of the choice of funds legislative package. That is in place. In addition to complementing the government's choice of funds legislation, this bill will also enhance the process of simplifying awards.
The opposition has chosen to overlook the benefits of our proposed reforms. It has made extravagant and, I am sorry to report, misleading claims about the effects of the bill. For example, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) chose to quote an incorrect newspaper article suggesting that 50,000 employees in South Australia would lose their superannuation entitlement. It was absolute nonsense. She should have checked that information before using it in the House. There are 50,000 Commonwealth employees in total in South Australia. The article made the sweeping assumption that every Commonwealth employee would lose their superannuation and be worse off. Nothing could be further from the truth. The superannuation guarantee proposals protect Australian workers. Be they in the Australian Commonwealth Public Service or working under federal awards, workers are protected by the superannuation guarantee legislation.
The untrue claim made by the member for Jagajaga was both irresponsible and unhelpful to the debate. It overlooked the extensive superannuation entitlements provided in the superannuation guarantee legislation and in workplace and enterprise agreements. But reliance on incorrect and misleading assertion has, I am afraid, typified the approach taken by the opposition on award simplification. I regret to say that the opposition has engaged in scaremongering campaigns, claiming that award simplification amounts to award stripping. The key decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission about the simplification of the hospitality and metal 
 industry awards demonstrate the truth of the matter. If members of the opposition present had followed those cases, they would be aware that their claims are without foundation.
—No-one in Australia believes you, Alan.
—I do not know; with regard to the metals industry and the asbestos provisions, the honourable member should examine what the award says about the protection of workers from asbestosis. He should come into this place and tell me that he agrees the award is a better way of doing things. I do not believe that is the case. I believe that the occupational health and safety provisions that we live under are far more stringent than most awards, and the honourable member knows that. He knows that that applied in the metal industries award. He should welcome this approach because it is not award stripping. It is a simplification that allows a better process for all concerned.
Award simplification is not about stripping; it is about making awards less prescriptive and detailed. It removes obsolete clauses, providing more flexible working arrangements and making awards more user friendly and easier to understand. For goodness sake, in this day and age, some awards state that the employer shall provide boiling water. We are not living out in the sticks; we are living in a modern environment where people drink cappuccinos at morning teatime and lunchtime. Some awards include primitive things like that, and to say that that represents the stripping of awards is just ridiculous.
The opposition have chosen also to overlook the fact that unions rely largely on the superannuation guarantee legislation rather than on awards. For all their claims about the importance of award superannuation, the reality is that unions simply have not bothered to keep their awards up to date. In 1994, the superannuation test case decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission provided that awards could include the superannuation guarantee level of contributions. But four years later, very few awards have been varied in that regard.
The opportunity was given by the court, but few unions took up the opportunity to include these factors in awards. If it is a matter of such high contention or importance, you would have thought that 100 per cent of the union movement, urged on by the ACTU, would have grabbed the opportunity of including, within all of their awards, the very processes that the opposition says are so important. But that is not the case. The majority of awards have not been amended. The vast majority of awards provide for three per cent contributions, but the superannuation guarantee stands at six per cent, going up to seven per cent on 1 July. So much for being important; so much for keeping things up to date. It is a very reasonable approach on the part of the government.
It is clear that unions have not supported these superannuation award provisions and rely on the superannuation guarantee to establish minimum contributions. Again, it is the superannuation guarantee, not awards, that established the minimum superannuation entitlement for the vast majority of workers in the federal jurisdiction. So, again, we have Commonwealth law applying to the federal jurisdiction being taken note of. That is the very thing that people rely upon.
These workers no longer need award superannuation, as the superannuation guarantee does the work previously done by awards, and this will be all the more so with the introduction of choice of fund. That is self-evident. With choice of fund, you must rely on something that overarches the whole system of superannuation. I say to members of the opposition: can you imagine the complexity as people move from job to job and from industry to industry and maintain the right of choice in superannuation fund? Can you imagine the complexity and impossibility of tracking their accounts and effectively keeping a record of their entitlements?
This government wants to make sure that there is flexibility for employees so that, as they change their position and type of industry, their superannuation follows along with them; in fact, they come to the end of their working life with a worthwhile provision. When the opposition was in government, this 
 did not occur to them. All they wanted to do was run a system and make sure that the super funds benefited by union involvement. You thought of the structures; you did not think of the people.
What this government has done consistently is to think of the people in the system and the impact of superannuation on them. As we move to choice, portability and the way in which the superannuation entitlements are retained by the individual as they move from place to place, from job to job, from industry to industry, and previously from award to award, the complexity is just compounded.
This simplification process removes that complexity, removes the need for administrative costs and will remove, ultimately, the complexity that choice will offer some employers and some employees to begin with, but which will ultimately move to a system of preservation and the reserve of funds for people in their retirement.
It is worth bearing in mind the origins of the superannuation guarantee. The unions had made an application to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to increase the level of award superannuation. That application was unsuccessful. In the face of the rejection of the union's application, the then government introduced the superannuation guarantee legislation. In other words, it was more than happy to override or sidestep awards at that time. But what it did not have the courage to do was to deal with the mess created by letting award superannuation continue alongside the superannuation guarantee legislation, despite all the inherent problems associated with a dual regime.
The previous government was prepared to allow that to go on, with complexity, mess and a lack of understanding, settling for a process of negotiation with the ACTU under the accord system and writing that into legislation rather than dealing with the situation fully and properly. The opposition should recognise the mess that it created and support this legislation as a sensible approach to simplifying the complex layers of regulation that currently surround superannuation. You would make a major contribution, you could justifiably claim that you have contributed 
 further to the reform of conditions for employees in Australia and, at the same time, you would be making the statement that you have simplified the processes of superannuation.
As foreshadowed by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), the government will be moving amendments to preserve the existing notional earnings bases. These amendments will ensure that, once superannuation is removed from awards, employers will be able to continue to apply the notional earnings bases of employees, determined by reference to federal industrial awards. Continuity and the provision of a base for the calculation is part of this process. The continuity process is there, and so the calculations can be made without fear or risk.
The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 will continue to operate in respect of an employer and employee as it would have operated if superannuation had not been removed as an allowable matter and the terms of the award had not been varied. This means that there will be no change to the current earnings bases arrangements for employers and employees. The bill, as amended, will simplify superannuation regulations for employers in the federal industrial relations system by removing an unnecessary layer of regulation, and this is what the whole process of award simplification and flexibility is about.
This is what we said we would do prior to the election. This is just one small part of it—a part agreed to by the Democrats, a part now being dealt with by the House and a part that has inherent in it a simplification that will relieve employers of oppressive record keeping and administration, and the link with choice gives employees a much better chance to achieve their goals. The bill is about simplifying administrative arrangements and providing for an efficient and effective regulation of superannuation through a single set of legislative requirements. I want to thank those members who have participated in the debate, and I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That the bill be now read a second time. 
",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Gold Card) Bill 1998  extends the gold card to veterans aged 70 and over who faced danger from hostile forces of the enemy whilst serving in the Australian Defence Force during World War II. As shadow minister for veterans' affairs, I indicate from the outset that the opposition fully supports this initiative.
The gold card is officially known as the Repatriation Health Card—For All Conditions. It provides entitled veterans with taxpayer funded access to a range of essential health services, including dental care, private patient hospital treatment, optical care, physiotherapy, podiatry and domiciliary nursing care. Access to the card is not means tested and, unlike the white card, assistance is not restricted to an illness or incapacity that is accepted as being war service related. The 
 Department of Veterans' Affairs is also responsible for paying the cost of doctor consultations and pharmaceutical benefits for entitled cardholders—costs which would otherwise be met by Medicare and the PBS respectively.
The key aspect of the bill is that it confers automatic access to the card to those who meet the service and age requirements. In this respect, it mirrors the arrangements that apply to three other groups of veterans who enjoy full treatment benefits as a result of earlier Labor decisions. These groups are: surviving World War I veterans, introduced by Labor in 1973; ex-prisoners of war, introduced by Labor in 1974; and ex-servicewomen, mainly nurses, who incurred danger in World War II, introduced by Labor in 1987.
I mention in passing that the special measure for ex-servicewomen occurred because an earlier government initiated inquiry had clearly demonstrated that they had been paid less than men during their war service and had subsequently been entitled to less repatriation assistance on their return from the war front. It was thus very much seen as a form of positive discrimination—something that is at the core of our highly regarded repatriation system. I would also stress that, despite sporadic criticisms of this decision by some individual veterans, the RSL and other ex-service organisations agreed to the 1987 decision in favour of ex-servicewomen. In addition to these three groups of veterans, the card is also automatically available to war widows.
There is no doubt that the veteran community hold in very high regard the benefits attached to the gold card. They clearly see it as providing them with a degree of security—which it does, at least in terms of the specific benefits that are attached to the card. Equally, an examination of the government's costings confirms that cardholders quite rightly receive considerably more financial assistance than other older Australians do. It appears that the average annual cost to DVA is approximately $4,000 per veteran. Whilst no breakdown is publicly available regarding the cost of individual elements, it is reasonable to assume 
 that the two key benefits are access to dental care and to private patient hospital care.
Other veterans, apart from the groups that I have mentioned, are generally only eligible for the card if they have an accepted war caused disability payable at the 100 per cent rate or above, or at the 50 per cent rate or above whilst also receiving a service pension. These other veterans thus have to demonstrate a relatively high level of physical or psychiatric illness that is directly related to their war service.
The ex-service community, and particularly the RSL, have warmly welcomed the gold card extension to eligible World War II veterans. They have been lobbying both the coalition and the opposition on the matter for quite some time. I have given them a firm commitment that a Beazley Labor government would honour the promise. In welcoming the announcement, I have reminded veterans and war widows what the gold card does not protect them from. It does not protect them from the coalition's proposed goods and services tax. Only a Labor government will do that. It does not protect them from the harsh and inequitable nursing home entry charges imposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), because the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) has failed to have them exempted from this impost. His contribution to that very important debate for older Australia was simply to remind them that those that are ex-prisoners will not lose a benefit they possessed under previous governments.
Nor does a gold card protect veterans from the coalition's series of cuts to pharmaceutical benefits for older Australians, or its cuts to legal aid funding, which is leading to tighter and tighter merits tests and lump sum stage limits being imposed by state legal aid offices. Legal aid services are being reduced at the behest of the federal government and these people are losing the right to fight their cases against the department in a context in which there have been no reductions whatsoever in the amount of money the government is allocating to its fight against these veterans in the system.
I turn now to the specific provisions of the bill. In doing so I stress three fundamental points. The first is that some 135,000 World War II veterans already have a gold card under existing arrangements. The second is that the announced extension to an additional 50,000 veterans does not come into effect until 1 January next year. The third is that, despite media reporting to the contrary, not all Australian World War II veterans will now qualify. To qualify, veterans must in fact meet all of the following requirements: they must have served in the Australian Defence Force rather than in the forces of British or Allied countries; their service must have been somewhere within the applicable period of hostilities, namely, from 3 September 1939 to 29 October 1945; they must also have incurred actual danger from hostile forces of the enemy; and they must be no less than 70 years of age.
Because it is almost 53 years since hostilities ceased, it is most unlikely that many veterans will be excluded due to the age requirement. Without being critical, the effect of the other three requirements will have quite a marked impact. Some 100,000 surviving World War II veterans do not meet the first requirement—of having served in Australian forces. These veterans and mariners served in the forces of British and allied countries, and later migrated to Australia—some of them very soon after the war. Obviously, many of them have paid taxes in the interim. This is not an opposition estimate; the department gave it to Labor senators in recent estimates committee hearings on the budget.
These veterans are of course very keen to also obtain access to the gold card. However, like most comparable countries, Australian governments have traditionally taken the view that responsibility for the provision of war disability pensions and associated health treatment benefits broadly rests with the country in whose forces the veteran served. This is because such assistance is a form of repatriation compensation, the liability for which is not extinguished merely because a veteran migrates elsewhere and becomes an Australian taxpayer and pensioner. Obviously, 
 there is concern about the dereliction of duty by a significant number of allied powers.
Whilst I am sympathetic to the frustration felt by allied veterans, our dilemma is that European World War II allies are not pulling their weight in looking after veterans who have subsequently migrated to Australia. In fact, according to the minister's answer to a question on notice I asked last October, only about 5,500 British veterans living in Australia currently receive a British war pension. Only a relative handful receive a pension from Canada, the former Czechoslovakia, Malta, New Zealand and Poland. To place these figures in context, almost 26,000 British and allied veterans from no less than 29 separate countries receive an Australian service pension as a form of means-tested income support.
Our dilemma therefore is clear. If Australian taxpayers grant the gold card to the 90,000 or more British and allied veterans who receive no ongoing war service compensation assistance from the country in whose forces they served, we are essentially letting the UK, Netherlands, Polish, Greek, New Zealand, Maltese, South Korean and United States governments off the hook.
In saying this I am not suggesting that the matter should forever rest. It is notable that in the voluminous material produced by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and in his several trips overseas to visit commemorative sites, I do not recall him once publicly advocating that these allied countries should take any action to assist their veterans living in Australia. It was equally notable that he completely skirted around the matter in his very brief second reading speech. I trust he will not ignore the matter when he replies to this debate.
The second requirement the bill imposes is that a veteran must have served at some time between 3 September 1939 and 29 October 1945. This is the accepted period of World War II hostilities for service pension purposes and is not in itself in dispute. It thus means that veterans who served in subsequent bomb and mine clearance work in the South Pacific, and in the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces—BCOF—in Japan, are not considered 
 World War II veterans, unless they also served before 29 October 1945. In the case of the relatively substantial number of BCOF veterans, this is clearly a conscious decision by the government. I suspect, however, that the smaller number of bomb and mine clearance veterans may have been overlooked or could not be neatly accommodated. I would be interested in some explanation of the coalition's thinking on this aspect.
The third and very significant requirement is that veterans must also have incurred actual danger from hostile forces of the enemy. Effectively, this requirement means that the eligible period of hostilities varies from location to location and would generally not apply at all to someone who spent the war in, say, Melbourne. The incurred danger test for the gold card is that which already applies to the service
pension. The Department of Veterans' Affairs would therefore employ its extensive background to determine applicable theatres of war for World War II—service in Darwin being a clear case in point. Of itself, the gold card decision should not require a fundamental re-examination of the relevant
guidelines. I do note however that individual veterans are not necessarily fully conversant with these and, in seeking applications for the card, it would be helpful to publish a summary of them.
I understand, from government estimates, that there are in fact some 93,000 veterans who enlisted during World War II but did not serve in a war zone and thus fail the `incurred danger' test. All of these no doubt fully intended to fight for their country, if called upon to do so. However, a repatriation system can work only on the basis of the service that people actually provided rather than on the fact that they were willing to serve if called upon to do so. Otherwise, the entire ADF would have to gain repatriation benefits every time a particular unit saw operational service. This would be impossible to justify.
Having canvassed in some detail the position of World War II veterans, I turn now to veterans of other conflicts who have also approached the opposition about access to the gold card. Most prominent amongst these are 
 our Korean War veterans. Some 17,000 Australians fought in the Korean War. According to the act, the period of hostilities stretch from 27 June 1950 to 19 April 1956. Beyond that, we appear to know little about how many have died, how many are still alive and how many already receive the gold card. In passing, I note that this is but another example of the difficulty we all experience in obtaining hard data from DVA. I am not saying it is easy, because a significant number of these people served in a number of conflicts, there were transfers, et cetera. However, it is essentially difficult to make estimates in regard to costs et cetera, and that has been shown in some aspects where the government has had to come back a year later  and revise its estimates with regard to the cost of some benefits.
At recent Senate estimates hearings, the department conceded that many of these Korean veterans are of a `World War II equivalent age'. Perhaps there is little, then, to distinguish these veterans from World War II veterans, and it is argued that many suffer from broadly similar health problems. Unfortunately, until the results of the current DVA mortality study are known, there is no accurate data on how many of them are still alive and are aged 70 years and over.
At a personal level, I have frequently stated that I have particular sympathy for their situation. Whilst not wishing to commit the opposition, I do not see any particular logic, other than precedence, in requiring them to wait 53 or 54 years after war's end to get the gold card. As well as the proximity between the two wars, their case is strengthened by suggestions that Australians who fought in Korea were older career servicemen compared with their World War II counterparts.
Sections of the Vietnam veteran community have also been campaigning for access to the gold card. From the mortality and health studies commissioned by Labor, we know that their health status is generally poorer than that of men of a similar age. Their death rate, particularly from particular forms of cancer and from suicide, is clearly above the average. It is a sobering statistic that almost seven times as many Vietnam veterans have died 
 since their return to Australia as were killed in action during the war itself. In this context, the Vietnam veteran community has a particular call on health and support services for veterans. Even setting aside the very real issue of cost, it is by no means clear, however, that changing the eligibility requirements for the gold card is the way to go.
In conclusion, I reiterate that the opposition fully supports the bill. There is a need to set clear priorities, as not every veteran group can realistically get access to the gold card. Nevertheless, I seek the minister's responses to the issues that I have raised, and I remind veterans that having a gold card will not protect them from the coalition's other attacks on older Australians.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—I notice that the honourable member preceding me, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), is incapable of going through a speech without bringing in negative issues and running down what is essentially an extremely good bill—the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Gold Card) Bill 1998 —and one that was brought in by the coalition government and not by the Labor government. In relation to some of the issues that the member raised—wandering, as he did, from the bill—I remind him that it was his government that ran down the nursing homes and left the frail and elderly in homes without fire escapes, heating or cooling. We gained the legacy of what you people left behind.
It gives me great pleasure today to speak on this bill because it is something that I have fought for, as have many of my colleagues, and that is the extension of the gold card to more veterans than were eligible under the previous government. On this occasion I will refer to the parliamentary Bills Digest, because I do not think I can summarise better than it has what the gold card will give to veterans around Australia and in particular in my electorate where I have an elderly population and a very high number of veterans. The gold card will give the equivalent of top range cover in a private health fund. The Bills Digest says:
The benefits include treatment as a private patient in a public or private hospital, choice of doctor, 
 pharmaceuticals at the concessional rate, optical care, physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry and chiropractic services. The benefits are for all medical conditions, irrespective of whether the conditions resulted from war service. The Gold Card also entitles veterans to transport to and from their medical treatment.
It is generous, but it is something that we owe the people who fought for Australia in the Second World War. Over one million young Australians volunteered to fight and were enlisted and, of those, almost 40,000 died. The rest came back with psychological and physical scarring. They had paid that price for this country. They had been prepared to lay down their lives and they gave many years of their lives fighting for their country. We are indebted to them for what they gave us.
The obligation that we have has also been mentioned in the Bills Digest. It refers to the report of the Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System. It gives the basic principles which have governed repatriation legislation in Australia. These include:
Australia is indebted to those who served it in term of war by enlisting in the Armed Forces, thereby endangering their lives and health and probably suffering economic loss. As a consequence, the nation has a duty to ensure that those who have served, together with their dependants, are  properly cared for.
Those who have served overseas or in a proclaimed theatre of war, are likely to have encountered greater danger and/or more arduous service than those who had home service and, accordingly, they should have more extensive cover.
Compensation and other benefits should be available as a matter of right and not as a welfare hand-out, and in cases of doubt, the doubt should be resolved in favour of those claiming to be entitled.
I could not put any better than that—the debt that we owe our veterans, who are now in their 70s. I think the average age of veterans is now 76—which, coincidentally, is the exact age of my father. In widening the eligibility for the gold card, we have earned the applause of the RSL which has said:
Veterans of World War I received an automatic entitlement to the Gold Card 55 years after the end of the war. It is now timely and fair that our veterans of the Second World War be similarly recognised for their outstanding commitment and sacrifice to Australia . . .  

Again, I can do no more than endorse those words. I would like to acknowledge the efforts that were put in by my own RSLs in an effort to gain the gold card for their members. Specifically, I would like to mention the Keswick and Richmond RSL, and their president, Les Portlock, who continues to work very hard on behalf of veterans not only in his own club but in the western suburbs of Adelaide. I also mention Mr Wray Lee, President of the Edwardstown RSL; Mr Andrew Lush, President of the Glenelg RSL; Mr Doug Spargo, President of the Hayhurst RSL; and Mr Herman Rijpstra, President of the Henley and Grange RSL. In mentioning the Henley and Grange RSL, I would like to pay a tribute to Kay Mosely for the work she does for that organisation.
I also pay tribute to the President of the Hilton RSL, Colin Saint, and its previous President, Jack Brown; the Lockleys RSL President, Mr John Auld; the President of the Glenelg RSL, Mr H.R. Jones; the President of the Plympton RSL, Mr Tom Davies; and Murray Lawson, who was previously the President of the North Glenelg RSL. These presidents have worked hard on behalf of their members to achieve this benefit for them. I salute these men, who are in their 70s, for continuing to work for the community and for veterans. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—As has been indicated, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Gold Card) Bill 1998  extends full repatriation health care benefits, including repatriation health card conditions, to Australia's World War II veterans aged 70 years or over with qualifying service from that conflict. It does so on certain conditions. As has been outlined, the veterans who will gain the benefit of the proposed extension of the gold card are those already receiving a service pension on the basis of their World War II service but who have not previously been entitled to the gold card and who are aged 70 years or over. They will have the gold card sent to them automatically. According to the Portfolio Budget Statement, Budget Related Paper No. 1.3B, the department is also aware from its records of other veterans 
 who, whilst receiving a DVA pension but not a service pension, may qualify under the new arrangements. There is a third category for veterans who believe that they are eligible and meet the criteria, and they will have the opportunity to apply to the department.
A study of the number of veterans' affairs beneficiaries by electorate indicates that only three electorates represented in this place have fewer numbers of DVA beneficiaries than the electorate of Scullin. It intrigued me that, upon the announcement of this proposal, I had a number of people approach me with some criticism of the actions. The basis of the criticism comes from two quarters. One is veterans from other conflicts, mainly Korea and Malaya, who, because they are aged 70, believe that they have been discriminated against by this decision. The other category is Allied servicemen, especially Commonwealth servicemen. I would like to touch briefly on those two groups of people in the context of this debate.
As was outlined by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), the Australian Labor Party can come to this debate with a certain amount of pride in that, back in 1973, it was a Labor government that extended free medical care to all Boer War and World War I beneficiaries. In 1974, free universal medical treatment was extended to all Australian ex-prisoners of war. In 1987, another Labor government extended full medical treatment entitlements to World War II ex-servicewomen.
It is also worthy of note that one of the contexts that this debate should take place in is that of the Australian repatriation system being a generous system. It is quite appropriate. It is not something that I have any quibble with. In comparison with other such schemes, this is a very comprehensive one.
Certain questions have to be asked about the decision by the Howard government to extend the gold card to this wider group of veterans. First of all, it has been said that it only applies to World War II veterans over 70 year of age on the basis that it occurs at a similar time after the end of the hostilities as was the case of the extension in 1973 to World War I veterans. In 1973, there had 
 been a 55-year period after the First World War. In this case, it is a 53- or 54-year period. If that had been the case—I hope that people do not think I am being pedantic about this point—there would be something magic about the 55-year period. This might then be considered in next year's budget or in the one the year after. Next year's budget or the one the year after will not be given before the next election.
There is then the injection into this proposal of the age category of 70. For all intents and purposes, this covers most veterans who would have seen active hostile service in the Second World War. I am not sure what is magical about this age factor. If something can be argued about the age factor, one would have thought that it would become the determinant and should be applied across the board to all veterans, whether they were in the Second World War or Korea and later conflicts. I hope that at the round-up of this debate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) applies himself to answering the logic of it. If age 70 is good enough for Second World War veterans, why would age 70 not be good enough for veterans who saw service in conflicts after the Second World War? As I said, this is something that Korean veterans in particular have raised.
The other group of veterans I mentioned are Commonwealth and Allied veterans who are victims in that the repatriation and veterans' affairs systems from the countries they saw service with are not as generous. But a good case is starting to be put by those veterans that, because of the length of time they have, in most cases, lived in Australia, they are also deserving of equivalent treatment eligibilities as Australian servicemen. The honourable member for Reid has put the position that the opposition holds on these cases. I understand it. I understand that in these type of things we are not dealing with a bottomless pit of resources. I understand his concern that, if the eligibilities were widened too far, to maintain that broadening of the eligibility there would have to be a lesser level of benefit granted to all.
I think this is something that we must look at, on behalf of veterans such as the returned 
 British serviceman who came to see me, who was one of those who was evacuated at Dunkirk. He put the case to me that, as a postwar immigrant to Australia, he has now lived a much greater portion of his life in Australia than in Britain. He feels that, as an Australian, he is being discriminated against. Even before the announcement by the government of the extension of the gold card, I had been approached by Maltese ex-service people who had said that they felt that, because there was this discrepancy in the way in which their disability pension was looked upon for treatment in Australia, their contribution as postwar migrants to Australia was not being fully recognised.
The government—and, on behalf of the government, the minister—should look at these issues and take them as being very serious, because those people who find themselves in the circumstances that I have outlined do feel aggrieved about their treatment.
I turn to the argument about whether we should be pushing for overseas governments to pick up what could be quite rightly seen as their obligation. That was the position put on behalf of the opposition by the honourable member for Reid. That, of course, has validity. But I think we have to be realists when we compare the systems that we are dealing with here. There are large discrepancies regarding a whole range of services that are provided to Australian veterans and beneficiaries through the Australian veterans' affairs system, which is the envy of the world.
I hope that we live in enlightened times and we are able to find our way clear to have those types of extensions. For instance, it was only during the 1970s that service pensions were extended to both British Commonwealth veterans and other Allied forces veterans. We did not necessarily wait for other governments to take action on those points.
Another issue that I would like to take the opportunity to raise as an associated matter to this bill, in the context that this bill will extend health care benefits to a wider population of veterans, relates to some concerns that a number of veterans have expressed to me about their access to hospitals. Indeed, often when these concerns are expressed to me they 
 are put in the manner of, `Wasn't money handed over by the Keating Labor government at the time that the repatriation hospitals were handed to the states or, in some states, handed to private concerns? In the case of Victoria, as this money went to the state government, shouldn't the access that eligible veterans have be guaranteed?' Some express disquiet that they are put on waiting lists for the treatment for which they have disabilities. I think that is of concern.
Another particular concern—and I note the presence in the chamber of the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin)—is that the Repatriation Hospital, Heidelberg, that was handed over to the state system was subsequently amalgamated with the Austin Hospital. There was a great deal of sense in this, in that both the Austin and Heidelberg Repat are along the Bell Street corridor. As part of the package and the deal put together by the Commonwealth government and the state government at the time of the handover of the Heidelberg Repat, the future of another institution along the Bell Street corridor was considered, and that was the Preston and Northcote Community Hospital. The Preston and Northcote Community Hospital has now been replaced by the Northern Hospital, Epping.
Advantage was taken of the amalgamation into the state system of the repatriation hospital to rationalise the way in which hospital services were to be delivered to the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The Northern Hospital, Epping, lagged a little but was finally opened earlier this year. That was greeted with some joy by the local community that I represent. That joy has been a bit dampened as that institution already faces, two or three months after its opening, having to find savings of six per cent to operate for the next financial year.
I want to return to the Austin Repat. Both the Austin, on its own, and the Repatriation Hospital, Heidelberg, were fine institutions, well respected, and were great examples in their different ways of the way in which public hospitals contribute to medical training and the way in which public hospitals contribute to particular specialities. There was some 
 concern when the two institutions were amalgamated, but that was accepted by the local community, by the returned service community and by veterans who saw that they still had access to high quality hospital care. Since that amalgamation, things have slowly turned a little sour and the new institution is not necessarily overwhelmingly and universally accepted.
I can remember having a discussion with Bruce Ruxton, the Victorian President of the RSL, and a good mate of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). I do not necessarily have as good a relationship with Bruce Ruxton. I think that he thinks that I misunderstand a little bit when it comes to the way in which he acts. I have said on other occasions—
—There are mates, and mates.
—There are mates, and mates. We will leave it at that. But the thing that I do accept about Bruce Ruxton, putting aside some of his political views, is that he, as President of the RSL, has been a fearless fighter for the rights of the ex-service community in Victoria. I think that a lot of the work that the Victorian RSL does, on behalf of those that it represents, goes without the recognition that it should get.
I know that he expressed particular concerns in the early days about the access that veterans were having to Heidelberg. I think that, to a certain extent, some of those matters were ironed out because a consultative process was gone through. But, now that we have this problem of veterans finding themselves on waiting lists for treatment throughout the state, there is great concern.
The final great concern about the future of the Austin and Repatriation Hospital is that it has been taken out of the north-eastern health network of Victoria. It is now a stand-alone institution. The rest of that network went and joined the north-western network, but the Austin Repat was put as a stand-alone institution. Why was it put as a stand-alone institution? It was put as a stand-alone institution because that was the first step in the sale of that hospital to private concern, and now it 
 has been confirmed by the state government's announcement that that is the case.
In the context of this debate, I believe that in respect of measures such as this—the extension of the gold card—which widen the eligibility, especially for those who are going to get the extension in the state of Victoria, it has to be noted that, in the calculations that have been made about the cost of this, there is an impact on other parts of government health systems not only at the Commonwealth level but, as I understand it, flowing through, of course, to the state system.
What is the Commonwealth's position now that the repatriation element of the hospital that is known as Austin Repat will be lost through private sale? What are the guarantees about the specialities that continue there that have a focus on the veteran community? What is the guarantee that the expertise over the long history of the repatriation hospital Heidelberg, and before that when it was one of the army hospitals, will not be completely lost?
This is something that Minister Scott has been silent on in the past, but I hope that he really does take this as a serious concern that many of us have on behalf of the veteran population, especially in the northern suburbs. There are other issues about the sale of Austin Repat that are cause for wider concern—for example, the way in which it will interface with the wider community. But that is, of course, a debate for another day.
As the honourable member for Reid outlined, the opposition supports this proposal. Indeed, the honourable member for Reid took to the shadow cabinet and got its approval for a proposition along the lines of what is being put into this piece of legislation. I hope that we are not seen, as a previous speaker said, as totally bringing negativity into what we agree is a measure that has a deal of merit.
The questions that we raise are about the way in which the eligibility and the implementation have been decided. As I said, if the age of 70 has some meaning, why don't we expand the eligibility to all veterans over the age of 70? In the case of Commonwealth and Allied veterans—and I especially put a plug in for Commonwealth veterans—I hope the 
 government will have a look at the way in which we can indicate to those migrant veterans who contributed to Australian society that we recognise that we also should look at their eligibility for the wider type of benefits that the Australian veterans affairs system makes available to Australian veterans.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,1998-06-23,"—One of the privileges of being a local member is the opportunity to work with representatives from many organisations in the local community and from a broad cross-section of the community. I have especially enjoyed the privilege of working with local veterans organisations in my electorate of Macquarie and being able to share with them their sense of immense pride, quite rightly, in the service that they gave to this country in times past. It has also been a privilege to share with them at Anzac Day services their experience of the reminder of the losses and the sacrifices that they made, to focus on those conflicts that Australia has been involved in and to absorb the sense of emotion, atmosphere and gratitude that the community has for the contribution they made to this country.
No-one would deny the debt of gratitude that we owe to the many men and women who willingly laid their lives on the line for this country, many whose lives would never be the same. Of the close to two million people who, over this century, have served in a number of conflicts overseas, some 102,000 paid the supreme sacrifice. Obviously, there is nothing that can be done to compensate for those 102,000, but we as a nation have an immense responsibility to recognise and to provide compensation for those who did return and assistance for the families of those who did not.
Clearly, help with health care is one of these primary areas of responsibility and priorities that we need to address. We have seen the very proud role of the repatriation department over the years in providing security in health for those in our veteran community who have suffered and experienced ill health over those years. This legislation, the provision of the gold card, is aimed at extending the benefits to those who faced danger in World War II.
During World War II, 993,000 Australians—926,900 men and 66,100 women—confronted hostile enemy forces as part of the Australian forces. Of those, 39,366 never returned and 66,553 were wounded. Many—perhaps most, in fact—later suffered a range of conditions and illnesses as a result of their service.
The provision of the gold card is tangible evidence of the Commonwealth's recognition of its responsibility to returned servicemen and servicewomen. Some 257,000 veterans and their dependants already receive the gold card. These include: all veterans and nurses from World War I, all prisoners of war, all female World War II veterans, all veterans with a 100 per cent or more disability pension and a number of other veterans on a part-pension. It also includes war widows, widowers and their dependent children—including 135,000 World War II veterans. In addition to this, a number receive the white health card—that is, free health treatment for war caused disabilities and conditions.
This legislation provides for an extra 50,000 World War II veterans to access the gold health card. In my electorate of Macquarie, this will include over 260 veterans. The extension of the gold health card will provide care equivalent to the top range of private health cover, including private patient hospital treatment, choice of doctor, concessional rate pharmaceuticals, optical care, physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry and chiropractic services. These benefits will apply whether the conditions resulted from war service or not. The gold card also entitles veterans to transport to and from their medical treatment. Those over 70 on 1 January next year—the starting date for the provision of these benefits—and those who meet the service criteria, that is, those who were involved in operations against the enemy and who incurred danger from hostile enemy forces, will benefit. 
The cost of this program is around $500 million over the next four years. This is a totally appropriate and tangible indication of our national indebtedness to those who served Australia in time of war, those who risked all for the sake of their country and those who no doubt suffered significant financial loss as 
 well as the loss of their health and separation from their loved ones.
This legislation is further evidence of the Howard government's commitment to our veterans community. Allow me to remind the House of many of the other initiatives of this government to support our veterans community. In the area of health, there is the provision of $600 million over the next four years to move to direct purchasing of health care services for entitled veterans—this will increase the Commonwealth's flexibility to negotiate high quality health care for veterans—a medication management and awareness program to make sure veterans get the maximum benefit from their medication; measures to improve health services for veterans in rural and remote areas; the review and extension of treatment support programs following the results of the Vietnam veterans health study; the funding of research into the role of herbicides in causing birth defects; and the community care seeding grants. These grants have benefited a number of veterans in my electorate of Macquarie: for instance, a $1,500 grant for the Blue Mountains ex-servicewomen's organisation to help them purchase office equipment to assist their work with the veterans community and a $20,000 grant to equip a spa facility in the palliative care unit to be built at Springwood hospital.
As well as the area of health, there have been other areas where this government has shown a very clear commitment to the welfare of our veterans community. In the area of pensions and benefits, for instance, there is the benchmarking of war widows' pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings; 150,000 recipients will benefit from the rising living standards the rest of the community experiences. As average weekly earnings generally rise faster than inflation, so our war widows will experience a real rise in the value of the war widows' pension—a rise in their living standards. In the last quarter this was a fortnightly rise of $6.80 for singles and $5.70 each for couples.
The pension bonus scheme provides a cumulative bonus of 9.4 per cent per annum for each extra year of work beyond pensionable age up to a maximum of five years. A 
 cut in the interest rate on defence service loans is now reduced to 1.5 per cent below the average market rates and capped at 6.85 per cent. There will also be measures to facilitate the payment of pensions.
Thirdly, there is a range of other initiatives under the Their Service—Our Heritage program: for instance, community seeding grants to assist veterans' groups who are catering for the specific needs of their respective communities and the regional war memorial program, which has so far assisted 800 communities with local commemorative activities. My community has also benefited from these measures: for instance, grants to the Blue Mountains Vietnam Veterans and Associated Forces, the Springwood RSL, the Kurrajong Colo RSL and the Katoomba RSL.
Fourthly, greater recognition will be given to Korean war veterans: for instance, the commencement of work on a nominal roll of Korean veterans is a first step into a major study of the mortality of Korean veterans which should lead to policy improvements to benefit them and the development of a program of commemorative activities related to the Korean War. Fifthly, there is increased funding under the Office of Australian War Graves to assist in the refurbishment of war cemeteries, including $70,000 for a war cemetery at Richmond in my electorate.
These are all appropriate and tangible measures to recognise the contribution and the sacrifice that our veterans community has made to and for Australia. The Howard government has demonstrated in all of these areas a very real commitment to the needs of the veterans community. The gold card legislation, which will provide access to the gold card for another 50,000 World War II veterans, is a very positive initiative and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1998-06-23,"—I rise to speak for the veterans community in my electorate. In doing so, I think it is fair to say that the response in my electorate to the announcement of the extension of the veterans' card entitlement has been mixed. That is not because of any action I have taken as the local federal member for Batman; if anything, because of the large 
 veterans community in my electorate, I have been eager to promote these changes and extensions both through my newsletter and through the local RSL clubs, with whom I have a good working relationship.
It is also interesting to note that, following the government's announcement, the demand for information has been huge. I have gone out of my way to actually make available to veterans in my electorate the information kit that was supplied by the government concerning this decision. However, I have also been careful to explain to the veterans community that these extensions are useful only if the level of benefits enjoyed by the current card holders is maintained. That is an important point. You cannot take with one hand and give with the other.
I remind the House that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised the veterans community that he would err on the side of generosity in support of our veterans. I would also remind the House that the Prime Minister's mean-spirited policies have actually resulted in a slow decline in the standard of services available to veterans. The veterans in my electorate have reminded me that, as a result of a number of decisions taken by this government, they now feel a sense of insecurity in their lives. Unfortunately, they have a right to feel insecure and forgotten by this government because the Prime Minister has, for example, imposed massive extra charges on aged care services, reduced veterans' entitlements to pharmaceutical benefits, procrastinated on mortgage rates for war service loans, reduced veterans' access to legal aid and, finally, drastically reduced staff numbers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs.
The two big gripes from veterans in my electorate are, firstly, the fact that they feel betrayed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who has failed to have veterans and war widows exempted from the annual entry charge of $4,380 to nursing homes and, secondly, the increasing cost to veterans of pharmaceutical benefits because of the repeated cuts to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme imposed by this government. The government should not think that veter 
 ans and their families will easily forget the fact that their benefits are being cut back just because some of them are to now get a gold card. Whilst it is true that the veterans community in my electorate has generally welcomed the extension of the gold card, many of my constituents have canvassed with me the fact that there are anomalies in the extension—anomalies that the government would like brushed under the carpet.
Just last week, a couple of old veterans came into my electorate office with a copy of the nice glossy brochure produced by Veterans' Affairs and they explained to my staff that the system was not working for them. It was not producing the goods that they thought the government had delivered on budget night. They were quite upset, for example, at the unusual decision to introduce an age cut-off. It took my staff quite some time to calm them down and explain that it was not our officers' fault but a problem created by the Prime Minister and his Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The minister can rest assured that, whenever I meet my veteran constituents—who are a very large group in my electorate—I will sheet home the blame to this government. I will explain how you have not stood up for veterans in a whole raft of areas, allowing their benefit rights to erode and erode.
Under these changes, veterans of World War II who are under the age of 70 on 1 January 1999 will not be entitled to the gold card until their 70th birthday. Given that it is almost 54 years since the end of World War II, only those servicemen who enlisted at a very young age will miss out. The 68 year old in my electorate office was more than a bit miffed that his old mate who was 71 was getting the gold card, when he, who had done the same time and seen the same horrors of war, was not getting the gold card. I would remind the House that, when free medical treatment was provided to World War I veterans by the Whitlam government in 1973, no age barrier was imposed. Similarly, in 1988 under the Hawke government, the gold card was provided to female veterans of World War II without an age limit.
Other anomalies in the extension of the gold card which I suspect will create problems for the government are, firstly, that the veterans who enlisted during World War II and who served within Australia were deemed not in danger from hostile forces, but they later served in Korea. These people may now be aged 70-plus. They certainly met hostile forces in Korea, but they will not be eligible for the gold card under these arrangements. Secondly, allied and Commonwealth veterans who served with a Commonwealth or allied force during World War II will not be eligible unless they actually lived in Australia before enlisting in Commonwealth or allied forces.
The benefit rights of Australian war veterans were established thanks to the Toose inquiry into the repatriation system—which gave its report to Gough Whitlam's Minister for Repatriation and Compensation, Senator Wheeldon, in 1975. I believe some very important principles were established by Justice Toose. More importantly, I believe those principles are relevant today.	In that context, as the Toose report suggested, I believe that, firstly, Australia is indebted to those who served in times of war, endangering their lives and health and probably suffering economic loss. Secondly, Australia therefore has a duty to ensure that those who served, along with their families, are properly cared for. Thirdly, those who served overseas or in a proclaimed theatre of war are likely to have encountered greater danger and/or more arduous service than those who had home service and, accordingly, should have a more extensive cover. Finally, compensation and other benefits should be available as a matter of right, not as a matter of a welfare handout, and in cases of doubt the doubt should be resolved in favour of those claiming to be entitled.
On that basis, I suggest to the House this evening that as the community's memories of the horrors of World War II fade, we should not use this as a convenient excuse to forget our obligations to our veterans and their families. As our veteran community ages, the principles established more than 20 years ago by Justice Toose are ones we should seek to maintain. They are, in essence, that Australia 
 should remain proud of the sacrifices made by our veterans and their families, and we must always remain indebted for the services they provided to the Australian community.
On that note, I suggest in conclusion that we should accept the social obligation we have to our veterans and, on the basis of the decisions of the government to date, in accord with the issues raised by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) this evening, we should seek to go out of our way to ensure that over time we extend the benefits to those who have missed out as a result of the government's decisions embodied in the veterans' entitlements legislation before the House.

"Zammit, Paul, MP",IND,1998-06-23,"—Yesterday was the first day back after the two-week parliamentary recess, and the government is in a state of paralysis following the Queensland state election results, displaying confusion, lack of direction and fear of the unknown.
Question time yesterday came to an abrupt end half an hour or so before the usual time. The government ran out of business last night at 9.15 p.m. and the House was adjourned ahead of the standard 11 p.m. finish. Tonight we again adjourn early—that is, at 10 p.m.—because the government has again run out of business. Why are we here in the national parliament, other than to debate issues of concern to our fellow Australians? Why are we here as legislators, paid a not inconsiderable sum of money—in excess of $100,000 per annum—plus a very generous superannuation scheme, plus a plush office suite at Parliament House, including an en suite, plus another plush office, staff and other top-rate facilities in our electorates, other than to raise issues of the day, enter into debate, listen to what we each have to say and at the end of 
 the day agree or disagree with each other as the case may be?
Today will be remembered as a day of shame for the coalition in government. Despite the fact that we are going home early tonight because the government has run out of business, my private member's bill to debate the issue of flight paths over Sydney, which will affect one million residents, was blocked from coming forward today by the coalition. The promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) prior to the election when he said that he would raise the standard of the parliament was obviously another one of his so-called non-core promises. The people of Australia have now put all politicians on notice that broken promises will no longer be tolerated.
However, my greatest disappointment today was with my former coalition colleagues from the Liberal and National parties. I felt a degree of sadness to see them vote, as dictated by the party leaders, that I `be not further heard'. What reason will they give to their electors, who are Australians like the rest of us, people who pay their taxes so we as legislators can represent them in the national parliament, for not allowing me to bring forward a bill for debate? After all, we are not drowning in a sea of bills for debate; in fact, we are going home early because we have nothing to do.
I remind my former colleagues that the eyes of Australia are upon you. Demand to know why you are being dictated to by the party hierarchy to vote to stop another elected federal member of parliament from speaking in the parliament, especially when the government has run out of business. The answer can only be that the government, of which they are a part, is frightened of debating the issue. And as that can be the only reason, what are they doing supporting a government policy that cannot stand up to scrutiny?
My Sydney Airports Bill 1998 is even more important now than it was when I gave my first reading speech in the national parliament some eight weeks ago, because the Prime Minister has now publicly admitted for the first time that his government cannot meet its aircraft noise sharing promises and wants to 
 back away from targets set in the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport.
Since the introduction of my bill, I have received wide support from aircraft noise affected communities for it. I will quote some examples. The first is from Save Our Skies (SOS), which represents residents in the inner west. They said:
Thumbs up for Zammit's Airport Plan . . . Mr Zammit's Airports Bill is what Sydney residents need and deserve. It is one of the few rational and fair proposals concerning Sydney Airport's noise problems to surface in a long time. SOS fully supports the Zammit Bill.
The second quote comes from the North-West Residents Airport Group (NWRAG). They wrote:
Dear Mr Zammit—this letter is to express the support of the North West Residents Airport Group for your initiative in Parliament yesterday in putting forward the Sydney Airports Bill 1998.
The final quote is from the Eastern Coalition of Airports Groups (ECAG)—that is, from the eastern suburbs of Sydney. They stated:
Eastern Suburbs supports Zammit's Private Member's Bill to establish the Sydney Airports Commission.
What will coalition members say to their electorates when they return at the end of the week? What will they say they have achieved to justify their continued role as a federal parliamentarian? Will they conveniently forget to say that they were party to stopping another parliamentarian from debating an issue that affects one million Sydney residents, even though the parliament was running out of business?
Coalition members should examine their consciences, and I urge them to do so. It is a great honour to be elected to parliament. Coalition members who voted today that I be not further heard, that the Independent member for Calare, Mr Andren, be not further heard and that my Sydney Airports Bill 1998 not be debated have, I would suggest, little of which to be proud.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Parliamentary Debate</title>,Adjournment,23,1
