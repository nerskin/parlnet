Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (09:01):  I rise today to remember Gough Whitlam, an Australian giant. I was born the year Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister. I was only three when he was dismissed so I do not remember his prime ministership, but I grew up surrounded by his legacy. I grew up around the corner from where Gough and Margaret lived in Albert Street, Cabramatta. The year I started kindergarten at Cabramatta Public School, Gough opened the extensions that his government had funded. The same man who poured sand into the hands of Vincent Lingiari helped pour the concrete that built Cabramatta Public School. Margaret helped out in the canteen. She also helped run the local pool where I learnt to swim. When I was not at school or not swimming, I was usually at the Whitlam Library on Railway Parade. 


I am the first person in my family to finish school and the first to go on to university. In the Australia that existed before Gough, people like my mum and dad did not even think about going to university; you did your intermediate certificate and went off and got a trade or went to secretarial college. All of that changed with Whitlam. Australia changed. My mum tells me it was like switching from black-and-white TV to colour TV. 


Gough's legacy surrounds all of us, from the national anthem to Medicare. It is hard to imagine Australia now without things like Medicare or multiculturalism, sewered western suburbs or trade with China. All of that started with Whitlam. In that sense, we are all Whitlam's children. 


He was not perfect—far from it. He made a number of mistakes. But most of the things that he fought for were fundamentally right. The proof of that is that they have endured and that they are now largely bipartisan. It was not always that way. It is easy today to think of things like Medicare as a given, but they did not just happen through some form of political osmosis. They happened because of Gough, because of his persistence and perseverance. As Whitlam said in his 1985 John Curtin Memorial Lecture:


The most successful of my Government's reforms were the ones which were most strongly condemned at their inception, the ones which the Labor Party had to fight longest and hardest to muster first public and then parliamentary support.


There is a lesson for us in this. As Gough said in the same speech:


Persistence, patience, perseverance—these are the watchwords for Australian reformers as they take up their daunting task.


The last time I saw Gough was a few years ago, back in Cabramatta at the side of the old Cabramatta pool where Margaret used to teach. Concrete cancer had eaten away at the old pool and Gough was opening up the new Cabravale Leisure Centre. We started talking and Gough told me about his great regret. When he was in his 80s, Gough was advised to get surgery on his knees but he put it off. He told me that he did not have the courage to do it and he now regretted it, because he was stuck in a wheelchair. It is kind of funny because courage is not something that Gough Whitlam often lacked, and we are all beneficiaries of that. 


In the 12th of his Philippics speeches, Cicero said:


The life given us, by nature is short; but the memory of a well-spent life is eternal.


I think that is an appropriate epitaph for a man who would have been as at home in the Roman Senate as he was in the streets of Western Sydney. Gough is gone, but the memory of his well-spent life lives on in the things he built, in the lives he changed and in the legacy he has left. He remade Australia, he extended our imagination and he left us a better country and a better people. After such a long and important life, well may we say: rest in peace.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (09:06):  Gough Whitlam is associated in the public mind with many localities in Australia. Perhaps three that stand out are Cronulla, Cabramatta and Canberra. But this highly educated and erudite Australian had an association which may not be as well known but which I want to reflect on today, which is his association with the Upper North Shore, an area falling within my electorate of Bradfield. I want to speak in particular of his association with the prominent boys' school Knox Grammar School at Wahroonga.


Some early years of Gough Whitlam's life were spent in Sydney and, particularly, his family lived at Turramurra for a period. His father enrolled him at Knox Grammar School in 1925. That was relatively early in the life of the school. In fact, he was No. 93 on the school roll. He was in year 6 the year he was enrolled and he was dux of the upper preparatory school. In 1927, he was equal second in general excellence in form 3. 


He then left Knox in 1927 when his family moved to Canberra. He returned to Knox grammar in 1974, of course when he was Prime Minister, to be the guest of honour at the school speech night; a very significant speech night for the school, because it was the school's 50th anniversary. As he was speaking, he quipped, 'This would be my largest audience here deep in Bradfield.' One of the old boys recollected in some recollections assembled by the old boy's association recently following Gough's death:


In the assembly Hall I clearly remember the remark that ""this would be my largest audience here deep in Bradfield"". I didn't immediately understand it as I had little knowledge of the federal electorates at that stage. It certainly elicited a strong and humorous reaction from our parents and friends.


The fine education that Gough received during his period at Knox grammar together with, of course, the education that he received at other institutions clearly served him well. I want to conclude by quoting what the present headmaster of Knox, Mr John Weeks, had to say in his column in the school's newsletter recently:


This week, we were saddened by the death of Gough Whitlam, a great Knox Old Boy who made many significant contributions to our country. Our flags were flown at half-mast in honour of Mr Whitlam.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (09:09):  I am honoured to join my many parliamentary colleagues to pay tribute to the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam QC, AC. Gough's passing has led us all to reflect on his leadership and the outcomes of his time as Prime Minister of this country. It has taken many of us on a nostalgic journey back to our collective past. For me, that nostalgia is for my childhood; the dismissal of the Whitlam government is my first political memory. I rang a close friend on the morning of his passing. She felt his passing marked the last shreds of her childhood, now gone. 


Under Gough Whitlam, politics entered popular culture. The 'It's time' slogan and television advertisement broke new ground. The song rang out from televisions across the nation and it still echoes down the years. I cannot see a man in a skivvy and not hum it. I cannot hear it and not visualise a man in a skivvy. That advertisement marked a change of course for this country. 


As so many have said, Australia became a kinder, prouder, more outward looking nation, a nation that embraced its own stories and shared them with the world. We became more inclusive, as attested to by many in this chamber. Gough embraced our migrant community and our Indigenous community in a national hug that changed the way we relate to one another. 


His passing sent the nation on a nostalgic journey, but it has done more than that: it has awoken us. Through the recounting of his great contribution in progressing his nation, we recognise that some battles that we thought were already won—for fairness, for inclusion, for a generous, aspirational society—are recurrent battles that must be fought and won over and over again. His passing is therefore a timely reminder of what was hard fought and that what we have taken for granted can so easily be swept away. In a very special way, in his passing, Gough served his country and his party: he reminded us of who we are and what we strive to become.


Like many at the memorial service and at home, I was moved by the tributes to Gough and struck by the list of his achievements in government in just three short years. Like others, I laughed at Noel Pearson's allegory, using that classic Monty Python line to sum up the enormity of Gough's legacy: 'What did the Romans ever do for us anyway?'


To me, one of the most important things he did was to reunite of after the sectarian schism rent by World War I. Under Gough, we reverted to an egalitarian, creative Australia, aspiring to do what was right, what was fair, rather than what we could get for ourselves. I watched keenly an interview with Barry Jones on the day Gough passed. Barry summed it up with 'I feel orphaned'. He added: 'He shaped my thinking.' He cited the opening to Gough's speeches, 'men and women of Australia', as critical to the inclusive agenda. This small measure, repeated in many speeches, signalled a shift in what was a patriarchal society.


To me, his educational reforms were his greatest achievements, and I will spend what speaking time I have left on these. One of his first acts was to commission from the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission a report prescribing a framework for equitable education. That was in May 1973. I look back now and see Gough's Gonski reforms. Under his government, spending on state government schools increased by 677 per cent and spending on non-government schools in the states increased to 117 per cent. The Whitlam government introduced direct Commonwealth funding, or state aid, for non-government schools. This put an end to a long-running political debate which was one product of the virulent sectarianism that had divided Australian society for decades—Gough's first steps towards building a sector-blind school funding model. And, as many have spoken about, from 1 January 1974, the Whitlam government abolished tuition fees for students at universities and technical colleges. Like many in this chamber, I was a recipient of that vision. It was genius policy. It broke a nexus. It wrote a new social contract.


Vale Gough Whitlam, the mountain ash of Australian politics, a great prime minister—great in stature both literally and figuratively, great in intellect, a great orator, a great reformer. Like thousands of others, I am lucky to have lived under the canopy of his government and his vision.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (09:14):  Gough Whitlam's famous 'It's time' speech, beginning with 'Men and women of Australia' was made in the Blacktown Civic Centre on 13 November 1972. It would have been three days shy of my first birthday. I would have been at home at Frederick Street, up the road from the Blacktown Civic Centre, just off Sunnyholt Road, which winds up through Campbell Street and Flushcombe Road, to that great Bowman Hall. Even today we refer to Bowman Hall as Gough Whitlam's shrine. At every event I have been to there—and there have been hundreds, including citizenship ceremonies and various community events—I am always reminded that this is Gough Whitlam's shrine. When I mention this to various community groups, who otherwise would not know much about Australia, everyone would always know that this is where Gough Whitlam made that speech.


Gough was so generous with his time in coming back to Blacktown, to the place of that great speech. Around 10 years ago he attended the opening of an art exhibition inspired by the dismissal, held at the Blacktown Arts Centre, just up the road from Bowman Hall. Again, the crowds who were there to see him, to pay tribute to him and to honour him never failed.


Only a couple of months ago Blacktown Arts Centre put on a local history exhibition. It was a project that involved locals talking, sharing photos and reminiscing about those two famous speeches that were made in Blacktown Civic Centre. Gough's eldest son, Antony, gave the speech at this particular opening. Everyone commented how fabulous Antony was. It reminds me of Gough's memorial and how well Antony spoke. He would have been so proud of his such accomplished children.


I want to focus on Blacktown, because this is an area that typifies Western Sydney and the new growth areas that Gough was so keen to make sure got their fair share. He set up a new ministry of urban affairs. His interest in city planning, his focus on local government, his passion for public libraries, his commitment to improving the quality of life of people living in the new suburbs of Sydney, with community centres and parklands, was absolutely unmatched.


When I was growing up, down the road was a magical new suburb called Kings Langley. I would look over the other side of Vardys Road and see this place that had brick houses. In 1973 Gough Whitlam actually opened an exhibition of new homes at this suburb of Kings Langley, again a testament to his focus on urban policy and housing as key ways of improving people's quality of life. I want to quote from some of Gough Whitlam's comments at the opening of the Master Builders' Association centenary parade of homes, and presentation of the Pearce Reserve, which is still there in Kings Langley today, to the municipality of Blacktown at Kings Langley, on Friday, 14 September 1973. He said:


The Australian people have been waiting a long time for a fair deal in housing. I hope you will forgive me if I recall some words I used 20 years ago, in my first speech in the national parliament. I said then: 'No one thinks that 20 years ago the people of Australia were adequately housed; and nobody thinks that they are adequately housed now.'


So he invoked his first speech in talking about how important it was to have a proper housing policy in this country.


I will take a few more quotes here, because they are still pertinent today:


Twenty years later, those words are still true. It is shameful that in 1973, the people of Australia are still not adequately housed. It is shameful that in a nation with abundant space, considerable wealth, a modest population, and a general commitment to the ideals of social welfare, thousands of Australian families are badly housed and unable to afford this fundamental amenity of a decent life.


How true, unfortunately, are those words even today.


I want to share two other memories and some of the legacy of Gough Whitlam. The first is his love of antiquity. I share this passion—I named my child Octavia. One of Gough's passions was the rightful return of the Parthenon Marbles. Reunification websites were abuzz with tributes to Gough Whitlam following his death, and rightly so. Some of Gough's words on this topic:


The Parthenon sculptures are unarguably among the world's most important surviving art works. The new Acropolis  Museum gives the British Museum the opportunity of righting one of history's great wrongs.


I think it is absolutely important for all countries of the world to recognise and to reaffirm the reunification of the Parthenon Marbles.


The last point I want to make, as a former competition and regulation lawyer, is to commend Gough for his vision in reforming trade practices law in this country. Even in his Blacktown speech you can see his commitment very detailed in the context policies in these areas. I quote:


In the areas of economic law reform, we will legislate for a nationwide Companies Act; a Securities and Exchange Commission; an effective Restrictive Trade Practices Act and a modern version of the Australian Industries Preservation Act.


This represented a significant policy shift from the 1965 act. The policy approach was a combination of US anti-trust as well as public interest tests, as appropriate to Australia. There have been many reviews of competition laws since that time, as there should be. But, generally, Australia has had good stable competition law, so much so that many countries around the world have modelled their own laws on ours.


I want to end by commenting on Gough's wife, Margaret. Theirs was truly one of the great political partnerships. How fitting it was that the final hymn at Gough's memorial was Jerusalem, also the final hymn at Margaret's service. It was an honour to be present at Gough's memorial a few weeks ago. Gough changed Australia, but more importantly for me he changed Western Sydney for the better.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (09:21):  Gough Whitlam is a true legend of our times, a Labor hero and a giant in our nation's political history. He believed so strongly in the power of governments to improve people's lives. Central to this belief was a strong agenda based on equity, social justice, and reforms that reflected a changing society. With that goal, he spent his entire political life striving to improve the lives of Australians. In doing so he redefined our nation and changed the life of a generation, and also changed the lives of generations beyond. He changed our country for the better into a more modern multicultural nation with so many more opportunities.


I was privileged to meet Gough Whitlam on a number of occasions and was always in awe of his incredible legacy. It is a legacy that many people of my generation were beneficiaries of, particularly, access to free university education, access to universal health care and the introduction of equal pay for women. Many people of my generation, particularly women, have had so many opportunities due to the vision, determination and courage of Gough Whitlam.


In leading the Australian Labor Party back into government, Gough Whitlam wasted no time in implementing the most ambitious government agenda in Australian history. In three short years, his government did so much including: introducing universal health care, through Medibank, the precursor to Medicare; the introduction of a free university education, which meant that it was a student's merit rather than their wealth that determined their ability to access higher education; he also increased funding to all schools and introduced needs-based funding; he increased age pensions; he introduced indigenous land rights; Gough withdrew Australian troops from Vietnam and ended conscription; he abolished the death penalty; he introduced the one vote, one value system to democratize the electoral system; he introduced the Racial Discrimination Act; and he established diplomatic relations with China


Many of Gough's policies significantly improved the lives of women. He fought for equal pay for women; introduced the single mother's benefit; funded support services for women; instituted no-fault divorce; established the Family Court of Australia; and he appointed the first ever Women's Adviser to the Prime Minister. Importantly, the Whitlam government also funded and supported community based organisations that provided specialist health and welfare services for women. These included support for women's health centres, refuges and crisis centres.


As well as his massive social justice reforms, Gough was also an incredible pioneer of environmental protection. The Whitlam government was the first to make protection of our natural world a key part of Labor's values. He ratified the World Heritage Convention, which gave the federal government a powerful tool to defend sites such as the Franklin River, in 1983. He also protected the Great Barrier Reef from oil drilling and created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.


Since Gough's passing, we have heard so many stories about how his life and legacy touched the lives of so many. He inspired us all in different ways and will continue to inspire us. He meant so much to so many, which is why his dismissal was so devastating at the time. I was eight years old, and my recollection is of my mother and I going to a very large demonstration outside the Liberal Party headquarters in Brisbane city. I can certainly recall the massive sense that an injustice had occurred—that the Prime Minister had been unfairly sacked.


Gough fought the good fight, and Labor will continue that fight in his honour. We will always fight to protect his legacy and continue the struggle for social justice in Australia. We have so much to thank Gough for, and naturally our thoughts and sympathies are with his family at this time, a family that has given so much to this nation. We especially remember Margaret, a remarkable and wonderful woman in her own right. 


Gough Whitlam was a truly visionary prime minister who changed our country and improved our lives, and he will always be remembered. Thank you, Gough Whitlam, for an outstanding contribution to our nation. Because of your life and legacy, Australia is a much better country. Rest in peace.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (09:26):  I pay tribute to Edward Gough Whitlam AC, QC, to his life and his achievements. I pass on my condolences to his family and friends. I pay my respects to him on behalf of my electorate of Blair, which encompasses most of Ipswich and all of the Somerset region in South-East Queensland. I thank him for the recognition of China, for ending conscription, for law reform, for regional development, for funding for the arts and for fairer electoral laws. In his three years in office, he did more than almost all his predecessors put together and those subsequent to him. 


Gough was Labor's leader and, in my electorate, Bill Hayden was our federal member. We revered Gough. We were as proud of him as he was of himself! We idolised him. He made more of an impact on my family and on me individually than any other political leader. I wonder where I would be without free university education; and, having practised as a family lawyer for more than 20 years before I came to this place, I wonder what life would have been like in legal practice under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959. 


My parents and their parents before them were denied the opportunity to go to high school. Because my two brothers and I went to university, we achieved. It was because of the Whitlam Labor government, which gave us that opportunity, that we did so. Without Gough and his Labor government, none of that would have happened. 


I remember the pride that my parents felt when they went to our local church on Sunday, 3 December 1972, the day after the election of the first federal Labor government in 23 years. I remember the relief my anti-Vietnam-War mother, Joy, felt when Gough ended conscription, ensuring her three sons would not be forced to go to a war which had already been raging for decades. I remember putting up a sign, a handmade poster, in my bedroom window during the 1974 election campaign which read: 'Gough's going great—give Gough a go.' My love of alliteration was obvious early on! 


I recall coming home and discussing with barely concealed anger the sacking of the Whitlam Labor government in what I thought was a coup at the time by the Governor-General. I recall my father, Al, shedding tears when the results of the 1977 election disaster were clear to all of us on the Labor side of politics. Gough's political career was over. 


Like many on this side of the chamber, I am fortunate to have spoken with Gough on numerous occasions, during party functions and conferences. Always he would refer to you and to people generally as 'comrade'. I thank him, simply and without emotion, for what he did for me. But today I feel the sadness of loss and what his life meant to me. Respected Queensland Times journalist Joel Gould wrote:


The nation lost a great man and Ipswich lost a dear friend.


Gough's urban and regional development policies proved a boost for Ipswich. By opening up direct funding to local councils under the Constitution, Gough was able to fund cities and regions more effectively. That funding saw almost all of Ipswich sewered. In 1972, when he came to power, Ipswich was only 50 per cent sewered. The Whitlam Labor government's assistance following the 1974 floods, which devastated Ipswich and Brisbane, including my parents' home in which I lived at the time, helped us to rebuild our community infrastructure, such as roads, and a host of other flood measures also assisted us greatly.


On 19 July 1975, Gough opened the Ipswich Civic Centre, built with federal funds. It is still an important resource in our region for our arts, cultural, civic and community events. I am pleased to have got funding in the last government to upgrade the civic centre. I recall Gough returning to the Ipswich Civic Centre for a fundraiser many years later. He was honoured and he was glorious in his element. His long speech that night was Castro-like in length. Barely any aspect of federation government and governance was left out, including a long dissertation on rail gauges, much to the mortification of my wife, Carolyn, at the time.


Following the 1975 double dissolution election, Queensland Labor was left with just one seat, Oxley, which comprised most of the current seat of Blair. Through Bill Hayden, Gough remained a great friend and a great presence in the region. I spoke to Bill Hayden about what I would say today. I am happy to repeat on the public record in the House and in Hansard what Bill said on the public record. Bill referred to Gough as 'the great man of my life' and said, 'If I achieved anything, he made me.' He said:


Everything about him was big; not just physically but the openness and generosity of his nature, the warm enthusiasm with which he could embrace new ideas and encourage others to pursue fresh thinking, the breadth and depth of his interests, the colourful range of singeing expletives he held in reserve for times of tension. But if you were doing your job he was no meddler.


To the extent I made any achievement in public life I owe a big debt to the lessons I learnt practically from Gough. A great Australian, a former colleague, now sadly departed.


I grew up politically handing out how-to-vote cards for Bill Hayden and campaigning for the former state member for Ipswich David Hamill. These men, along with former Ipswich mayor Des Freeman, are my political heroes. But Gough Whitlam stood above them all. On behalf of my family and my electorate, Gough, thanks for your contribution, your life and your example and for your beloved Margaret and her work. You will never be forgotten. Rest in peace, comrade.

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (09:32):  I rise to express on behalf of the people of Charlton my sincere condolences regarding the passing of Edward Gough Whitlam AC, QC. Gough was a giant of the Labor Party and the nation as a whole, and we will not see his like again. The contributions to this debate from both Labor and coalition members have been heartfelt and generous. I would like to associate myself with all of them. Instead of trying to encapsulate all of the contributions Gough made to this country, I would like to touch on two of them that impacted on my family deeply: firstly, his reforms to welfare and, secondly, his democratisation of the Australian Labor Party.


Gough and ministers like Bill Hayden removed the stigma associated with welfare. My mother was a single mothers campaigner in the late 1960s. When she had my older brother, she was pilloried by the Catholic Church. This inspired her to seek justice for single mothers. It was only when Labor won in 1972 and implemented the single mothers benefit that that justice began to be achieved. I can barely imagine how hard it was for single mothers in the late 1960s and 1970s, stigmatised by the more conservative elements of society, often dependent upon the charity and support of family and friends. Then came along a reformist, progressive government that said: 'We understand your challenges. We will help surmount the obstacles placed before lone parents—lone parents who are often in this situation through no fault of their own.' This changed lives. This improved lives. This improved society, and my family was a direct beneficiary of this.


Party reform was also one of Gough's earliest triumphs and one of his most difficult achievements. Gough understood that the party must be reformed if we were to present a viable alternative. He attacked the culture of defeat that had led to Labor's repeated failure to win power. He took on entrenched interests and had the courage to take on hostile conferences. Gough appeared before the 1967 Victorian state conference and stared down some of the toughest and most formidable political activists. He stated:


We construct a philosophy of failure, which finds in defeat a form of justification and a proof of the purity of our principles. Certainly the impotent are pure.


… This Party was not conceived in failure, brought forth by failure or consecrated to failure … let us have none of this nonsense that defeat is in some way more moral than victory …


He then went on to say:


… I did not seek and do not want the leadership of Australia's largest pressure group. I propose to follow the traditions of those of our leaders who have seen the role of our Party as striving to achieve, and achieving the national government of Australia …


I highlight this because this is Labor's core philosophy. We fail our supporters, we fail the millions of low-income and middle-income Australians if we do not seek to achieve power. Only in government can we implement the reforms necessary to improve the lives of all Australians.


You do not establish Medicare and accessible higher education, end conscription, reform welfare and establish the Racial Discrimination Act from opposition. This is a lesson that is relevant today as we see various minor political parties attempt to appropriate Gough's legacy, in direct contradiction to his life. One of Gough's central fights was to reject their myopic commitment to purity at the cost of effectiveness. To repeat it: only the impotent are pure.


The party reforms Gough won were centralised on democratising the various state branches of the party. It is forgotten that Gough drove intervention in not just Victoria but New South Wales as well, where an independent inquiry had found stacking, bias, rorted preselections and widespread abuse of rules by the ruling head office faction. This drove the adoption of proportional representation. Without proportional representation we would not have seen generations of political titans make a contribution to this parliament. Without Gough and the intervention we would not have Senators Bruce Childs and John Faulkner or the current Member for Grayndler.


Interestingly, in the context of current debates around party reform, I should note that Gough was on the record as calling for national conference delegates to be selected by branch members at the Federal Electorate Council level and by the membership of affiliated trade unions, not state conferences—a worthy and important reform. I spend considerable time on this because without reforming the party we could not have the platform to take to the people nor could the people have confidence in our ability to govern.


In my remaining time I would like to correct the record as to the economic performance of the Whitlam government. While I do not deny that mistakes were made, I remind people that this period was dominated by the oil shocks, which presented a massive challenge to governments around the world, and not many performed well. I will also remind people that in three years of government, the Whitlam government recorded budget surpluses of 0.7 per cent of GDP, then 1.9 per cent and then 0.3 per cent of GDP, in 1974-75. In fact the 1973-74 surplus is the fourth highest on record.


In conclusion, not many people in this place can say they have fundamentally changed Australia for the better. But without doubt Gough can. He will live long in our memory for this and the various causes he strove for. My condolences and the condolences of the people of Charlton go to the Whitlam family and their friends.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (09:37):  It is a great privilege to be able to speak in this debate and to honour a person who I believe was one of the greatest Prime Ministers Australia has had, if not the greatest. Gough Whitlam was a truly great Australian—a leader, a man of vision and ideas, and an inspiration to generations of Australian. It has been said by many who have paid tribute to Gough that there was Australia before Whitlam and Australia after Whitlam. He transformed the face of Australia. He made it a better place. He made Australians proud to be Australian. He took Australia into the 20th century. Prior to that we were languishing in a bygone age.


In my first speech I said:


Good government is inclusive. It is about developing a sense of community so that every person in that community is able to benefit from the resources, wealth and services of the country. The Whitlam government sought to do this. It was a government that had vision—the vision to share the wealth of the country with all Australians, to create a just society where everyone in the community had an equal opportunity to succeed.


And equal opportunity was something that did not exist before the Whitlam government.


One of its greatest reforms was the change to tertiary education, a change that made university education accessible and affordable for everyone, not just a few privileged Australians. When I left school I chose not to go to university. At that time I had a scholarship to go to teachers college, but at that particular time in Australia you could go to university only if you had very wealthy parents or if you actually managed to gain a scholarship. I chose not to go and not to become a teacher at that time. Instead, I worked. When I went to work I did not receive the same wage as a male from the same year I was in at school who had the same job and worked in the same workplace, simply because women at that time did not receive equal pay. Gough Whitlam changed that. He made it possible for somebody like me to go to university at a later time. He created an opportunity that enabled me to study and enabled me to get a very good job, and from that very good job become a representative of the people in this parliament.


He also changed the situation so that when my daughter started work she received equal pay with the males who were in her class at school. Gough created that equal opportunity in education and in the workplace. It was a change that created opportunity for many Australians, myself included.


It was the drive and passion of Gough Whitlam that made the Whitlam government the great reforming government it was. The first time I cast a vote, I voted for the Whitlam government. I remember the elation when Gough Whitlam led Labor to victory, in 1972, and I remember my absolute despair when Kerr sacked Gough, in 1975. It was that one act that motivated me to join the Labor Party. I was committed to the belief that my vote counted and that when I voted for a government it was my vote, the vote of all Australians, that determined who was the government of the country, not a Governor-General. It drove me to be politically active, as did his vision, his charisma and his absolute commitment to making Australia a different country, a place that we could all be proud of.


I owe so much to Gough Whitlam, as do so many people in Australia. I have been contacted by many of my constituents, wishing to express their sadness and their appreciation for what Gough Whitlam did for Australia. There are very few people whom we could say have transformed a nation, and that is exactly what Gough did. He transformed the nation and created opportunities for all Australians. He was committed to fairness, equity and social justice. I thank him, the people of Shortland thank him, and I know the people of Australia thank him for his contribution to our nation.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (09:43):  I rise today to pay tribute to the life and work of the Honourable Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC, our 21st Prime Minister, and to extend my condolences on behalf of the people of Newcastle to his family: Catherine, Nicholas, Tony, Stephen, their partners and their families.


Australia has known few visionaries as great as Gough Whitlam, and fewer still who left such a remarkable legacy for generations to come. I concur wholeheartedly with the comments made in this House by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Member for Sydney, when she noted just how fitting it was that Gough Whitlam was Australia's 21st Prime Minister, because it was with Gough as Prime Minister that Australia finally came of age. It was Gough who averted Australia's gaze upwards and outwards. He encouraged us all to think big, to step out from the dark shadows of colonialism, and to forge a modern, independent, optimistic and ambitious nation instead.


His three years as Prime Minister were three of the most transformative years in our nation's history. He was a revolutionary without violence. Politics and persuasion were his weapons; social justice and equity his guiding principles. He introduced a national universal public health system; opened the doors of higher education to all; abolished the death penalty; established legal aid; increased pensions; protected the Great Barrier Reef; created a national art gallery; and redressed Australia's dismal history of race relations, while also getting rid of the old imperial honours system and giving our nation a new national anthem, Advance Australia Fair. He also lowered the voting age to 18 and gave Australia its first ever youth radio network, Double J. And, as the member for Grayndler noted, Gough is the only Prime Minister to have a rock band named after him.


A staunch critic of entrenched privilege, Gough made Australia a more equal, tolerant and free society. He was a true social reformist and, after 23 years of conservative rule, he knew there was no time to waste. Gough Whitlam had had decades in opposition to prepare for government, so when he was elected in 1972 he hit the ground running, appointing himself and deputy Lance Barnard to all cabinet positions for the first two weeks in his government. Whitlam ended conscription, recognised communist China, applied sanctions against South Africa and embarked on an ambitious program of support for the arts. 


As his cabinet expanded, so too did the reform agenda. It was, for example, the Whitlam government that established the Commonwealth's first commission of inquiry into poverty. With Professor Robert Henderson at the helm, this inquiry fundamentally changed the way in which Australia was to think about the poor. For the first time ever, poverty in Australia was not seen as a personal attribute or failing, but rather as a direct consequence of the structure of our society. Perhaps even more importantly, this inquiry gave voice to those who were traditionally marginalised in the national debate. 


It was the Whitlam government that first understood the importance of our national estate museums and collections for the national consciousness. It was Whitlam who established the National Gallery of Australia and made the bold decision to purchase Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles at the cost of $1.3 million in 1973—then a world record for contemporary American painting. Although the work was reviled at the time as the work of 'barefoot drunks', Gough's decision has stood the test of time. In retrospect, it was, of course, one of the nation's most savvy art purchases. Worth some $300 million, Blue Poles is now the pride of the NGA's collection.


As a young anthropologist working in Aboriginal Australia both before and after the High Court's Wik and Mabo decisions, I knew firsthand of the ongoing significance of Gough's determination to abolish the White Australia policy and introduce the Racial Discrimination Act, which established the right of all Australians to equal treatment under the law regardless of race or ethnicity. 


It was this act that was to have the most profound effect on our common law for decades to come—because it paved the way for the Mabo and Wik decisions—and the lived experience of Indigenous people throughout Australia. Likewise, his establishment of a department of Aboriginal affairs and the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission were amongst some of his most remarkable and lasting reforms.


But it is Gough Whitlam's unswerving commitment to gender equality and the difference this has made for generations of Australian women that I would like to focus on now. The Whitlam government came to office at a time of immense social change. There was the large increase in the participation of women in the workforce. Whitlam's government instituted reforms to ensure that social legislation and institutions kept pace with social change and community values. 


One of Gough's first acts as Prime Minister was to reopen the national wage and equal pay cases at the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This led to the decision that Australian women undertaking work similar to that undertaken by men should be paid an equal wage. Half a million female workers became eligible for full pay for the first time and women's wages rose by one-third. The commission also extended the adult minimum wage to include women workers for the first time after Whitlam passed legislation to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.


Maternity leave was also introduced for Commonwealth government employees. The legislation provided for 52 weeks of leave for mothers, 12 of which were on full pay, and it outlawed discrimination against Commonwealth employees because of their pregnancy and legislated instead to provide rights relating to the preservation of employment and status.


In 1973, Gough appointed Australia's first women's adviser, Elizabeth Reid. She established the basis for significant feminist programs and secured Commonwealth underwriting of the delivery of a range of new women's services, including women's refuges, rape crisis centres, equal opportunity policies in education, training and employment, and housing programs. Ms Reid has said of the time:


We talked in factories, in housing centres, on farms, in schools, at women's meetings, in dairies, in gaols, in universities—in short wherever women were. I was deluged with letters invariably beginning 'thank god, at last there is someone to whom I can talk to, someone who might listen and understand'.


Through this leadership, the first women's refuges opened their doors to those in need, including the Working Women's Centre, now the Hunter Women's Centre, in my electorate of Newcastle.


Gough's actions also helped enable women to be in charge of their bodies as well as their lives. Within 10 days of taking office, he removed the 27½ per cent luxury tax on all contraceptives and put the pill on the national health scheme list. These two measures reduced the price of the contraceptive pill to $1 a month—giving Australian women access to safe, reliable and affordable contraception. He established the single mothers benefit, which drastically reduced the risk of women living in poverty, he passed a number of laws banning sexual discrimination and his leadership saw the end to adversarial divorce.


Many have argued that the passage of the no-fault divorce laws are Gough's greatest contribution to the reduction of social misery. Prior to these reforms, a marriage could only be dissolved if one party could prove that the other was at fault in the breakdown of the marriage. 'Matrimonial offences' such as adultery, cruelty or 'desertion' had to be proved before divorce could be allowed. The indignity of this process was compounded by its very public nature. Divorce proceedings were prime fodder for gossip columns in newspapers and the financial cost of this fault based process was prohibitive to many. According to Gough: 'The only test of a marriage is whether both parties agree to maintain it.'


It is perhaps hard for many Australians to imagine what life under the previous archaic divorce laws was like, but the stories of our mothers and grandmothers are stark reminders of the need for these law reforms. Today, we take many of these reforms for granted and severely underestimate the level of opposition they faced at the time. To his great credit, however, Gough never blinked when it came to controversy. He never shied from prosecuting the case for change. Guided by the principles of social equity and justice, he was determined to drive these reforms, changing the lives of Australian people for the better. And for that we remain forever grateful.


Vale, Gough Whitlam. Your legacy for the men and women of Australia lives on.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (09:53):  I am proud to offer a tribute on behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith to the life of Edward Gough Whitlam and the profound effect that he had on Australia, particularly those in my community. Gough Whitlam changed the way Australians saw themselves and, indeed, the way the rest of the world saw Australia. He inspired Australians. He gave us a new confidence, a renewed spirit and an optimism about the future that we previously never had.


The famous Australian artist Arthur Boyd once said that when the Whitlam government returned to power he felt proud to call himself Australian again. The fact is, all Australians again felt proud to call themselves Australian as a result of the Whitlam government. Gough Whitlam saw politics as a noble profession and an honourable one, and he saw the role of leadership in politics as fundamental to progress and making a difference to the lives of Australians and indeed the attitudes and the confidence that Australians had about themselves and their nation. He changed Australian lives in so many ways: the introduction of universal health care; in education, introducing needs based funding for schools; free tertiary education; having the first adviser on women in his government; equal pay for women; no-fault divorce; income support for single mums; land rights for Aboriginal Australians; the introduction of an Aboriginal Legal Service; protection of the Great Barrier Reef; and the introduction of the Australia Council for the Arts. He even gave our nation its national anthem.


For me, the leadership and the foresight of Gough Whitlam is summed up by the very controversial purchase of Blue Poles, the famous artwork by United States artist Jackson Pollock in 1973. At the time, Gough Whitlam was hounded by the conservative politicians and the conservative media in this country about the purchase. The head of the Australian National Gallery was concerned about the purchase. He wrote to Gough Whitlam and said, 'I'm wondering whether we should be a little bit more conservative about this purchase.' Gough Whitlam quickly wrote back to him and said, 'Purchase the artwork and disclose the price to the Australian people.' And that is what he did: $1.3 million for the purchase of that artwork.


As I said, Gough Whitlam was hounded by the conservative forces in this country. But that did not deter him. Gough Whitlam published a photo of Blue Poles on his Christmas cards that year, so proud was he of what he was doing for Australia. That particular artwork, which hangs in the National Gallery of Australia, is now worth over $100 million, and the United States government is actually quite disappointed that they allowed such an iconic artwork to be purchased by a foreign government for such as low price. I think it is a great symbol of the value Gough Whitlam added to Australia. Not only did he add value to this artwork—a great asset for the Australian people—but he also added value to Australia in so many ways: in our economy, by reducing tariffs; in social services, through Medicare; through land rights and the like; and through support for Australia's position throughout the world.


In international relations, he is often well known for re-establishing relations with China and establishing a strong relationship with Indonesia. He was a master of international diplomacy and saw Australia expanding its sphere of influence throughout Asia and the Pacific Islands. He was also a staunch supporter of decolonisation. When he was elected, Gough turned his attention to Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea benefited tremendously from the election of the Whitlam government. In 1973 he granted PNG self-government and delivered independence two years later. Papua New Guinea's first Prime Minister, Sir Michael Somare, recalled Gough Whitlam when he spoke recently about the incredible impact Gough Whitlam had on him and his country:


He said to me one day, 'when Labor's opportunity comes, we'll make sure we will push for self governing and independence for Papua New Guinea'. And of course, it happened.


He pushed other Australians and said to them, 'Give an opportunity to the Indigenous of their country and they will achieve what they want.'


The current Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Peter O'Neill, also paid tribute to Gough Whitlam recently when he said:


Gough Whitlam's Prime Ministership was almost synonymous with Papua New Guinea's transition to independence and the people of our nation express our gratitude.


Gough was also a great friend of wider Pacific nations, in particular fighting to end atmospheric nuclear testing in the region. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when the French government conducted nuclear tests in French Polynesia, with the fallout spreading throughout the region, Gough Whitlam strongly opposed those actions because of the impact it was having on human health and the fact that it violated a resolution of the United National General Assembly. Gough was a big believer in the foresight and effect of the United Nations in terms of peace and stability throughout the world. On 9 May 1973, the Australian and New Zealand governments took France to the International Court of Justice, seeking an injunction against further testing. On 22 June, that injunction was granted.


Gough Whitlam's influence has been felt far and wide, the hallmark of a true leader who has left a remarkable legacy not only here in Australia but around the world. On behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith, I offer my condolences to the Whitlam family. May he rest in peace.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:01):  If it was not for Gough Whitlam, I do not believe I would be standing here today representing the people of Canberra. As I said in my first speech, Gough Whitlam's reforms to secondary and tertiary education allowed my sisters and me to escape a cycle of disadvantage—to break the tradition of three generations of single mothers who were denied choice, options and equality of opportunity due to their lack of education and the resulting poverty. In 1969, Gough said:


Poverty is a national waste as well as individual waste. We are all diminished when any of us are denied proper education. The nation is the poorer—a poorer economy, a poorer civilisation, because of this human and national waste.


Education is the great transformer—'the great instrument for the promotion of equality'—and my and my sisters' education gave us the foundation to think big and to dream big. It liberated us from potentially timid lives. And there are thousands and thousands more like us, particularly those who went to state and systemic Catholic schools.


I was nine when Gough was elected. He was dismissed in my last year of primary school and his legacy was the backdrop of my secondary education. My teachers were rabid Whitlamites, and the passion that surrounded the discussion of his government and the Dismissal in the classroom aroused an enduring love of politics and public policy.


Gough believed: 'Of all the objectives of my government, none had a higher priority than the encouragement of the arts—the preservation and enrichment of our cultural heritage. Our other objectives are all means to an end. The enjoyment of the arts is an end in itself.' Gough painted a vivid policy canvas 'to promote a standard of excellence in the arts' and, most importantly, 'help establish and express an Australian identity through the arts'. His bankrolling of Australian culture, and the resulting 'unparalleled burst of creativity in this nation', meant that for the first time we studied Australian history, Australian literature, Australian film, Australian art and Australian politics. For the first time, we were reading works that told our story, with our own subtexts, in our own language. For the first time, we were watching films that reflected our landscape and echoed our sounds, and that studied our vivid and all too forensic light, not the subdued and golden hews of the Northern Hemisphere.


Gough invoked a pride in our own narrative and outlook, and gave us the confidence to believe we were no longer just second-rate Europeans. Given Australia's achievements in every facet of creative life over the last 40 years, it is really hard to imagine how liberating it felt at the time. But it was a coming of age for our country and an end, finally, of the cultural cringe.


As a young woman with aspirations, Gough helped tend the flower of the women's movement in the seventies and provided the infrastructure for me and thousands and thousands of other women to achieve our potential. One day in my English class, my teacher asked us: what had been the most important liberator of women in history?


She then wrote two words on the blackboard: 'the pill'. That is because, until Gough, oral contraception was only available to the wealthy. By getting rid of the sales tax on the pill and making it available through the PBS, he gave women easily accessible and affordable control over their own fertility, which is the absolute fundamental to female empowerment.


Some regard the Whitlam government as anti Defence, but I suggest he did more to underwrite the defence of Australia and defence policy than many hawks. Gough regarded conscription as: 


… an impediment to achieving the forces Australia needs. It is an alibi for failing to give proper conditions to regular soldiers … By abolishing it, Australia will achieve a better army, a better-paid army—and a better, united society.


In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, when we could have so easily turned away from the US, he held on to the US alliance and helped give birth to an understanding that Australia could defend itself. He created a bipartisan consensus on defence policy, which endures today, a belief that we can create an independent capability for our own defence, an action that reinforces rather than weakens the US alliance.


He initiated large-scale cooperation with Indonesia. He launched the Department of Defence. He amalgamated five departments. He gave birth to the term 'Australian Defence Force' and was part of the movement to establish the Australian Defence Force Academy. He appointed a military ombudsman and created a new charter for the Citizen Military Forces. He 'moved steadily and firmly' towards the aim that Australia should have the defence forces she needs: 'finely equipped, highly professional, highly mobile and highly respected'.


That respect also extended to the Public Service, which he radically transformed through equal pay, through maternity leave, through annual leave and through decent pay and conditions.


Gough came from a privileged background. His father was the Deputy Crown Solicitor, and he attended Telopea Park School and Canberra Grammar. In fact, he is the only Prime Minister to have grown up here in our great national capital. But he used his privilege to eliminate inequalities that were 'riveted on a child for a lifetime'.


He unleashed a confidence among Australians about their nation, about their place in their world, about what they could achieve, which I believe had been denied them since Federation. He reimagined and redefined us locally, nationally and internationally.


Since his passing, I have received many heartfelt messages from Canberrans and friends on his legacy. One of my oldest high school friends wrote:


Thanks to him, my sister was able to study medicine, my mother got a degree in psychology, I got my own degree, my son has been able to get medical attention from the day he was born due to a public healthcare system ... the list goes on.


Had we continued to live in America I wonder where we would be. When my parents came to Australia in 1971 and Gough came to power, they thought they had reached Nirvana!


As I am a member of parliament, his death has made me pause to reflect on why I am here. When hearing the news of his passing, my mum left a teary message on my phone saying I had to remember his legacy and to use my time in this place to make a difference, to improve people's lives, as Gough did.


Despite the turbulence of his government, his life has encouraged us to challenge people, to inspire people and—as the member for Wentworth so eloquently put it—to not let the petty hatreds consume us. Most of all, he encouraged us to be ambitious about what we can achieve in life. And for so, so many of us, he gave us the foundations to be optimistic as Australians, to be confident as Australians, to think big, to dream big. Thank you, Gough. Vale.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:09):  It is indeed a privilege to be able to stand here and speak about Gough Whitlam. I begin by extending my condolences to his family members and his close personal friends, by whom his passing will be felt the most and for whom the loss will be the greatest.


I met Gough and Margaret Whitlam on several occasions, but I do not claim to have had a close personal friendship with them. But, as an ALP campaigner at the time, I well remember Gough's rise to the top, his period as Prime Minister and leader of the ALP and his departure from parliament. I also knew well many of the South Australian members of parliament that served with Gough in parliament during the Whitlam years. I refer particularly to people like Clyde and Don Cameron, Ralph Jacobi, Chris Hurford, Jim Cavanagh, Reg Bishop and the great Mick Young. 


With the exception of a few intellectual lightweights, there has been universal acclamation that Gough Whitlam was an exceptional character. Indeed, that so much has been said about him since his death speaks for itself. No other Australian political character in my own lifetime has inspired so many or evoked so much passion by both admirers and detractors. Even those who speak negatively of him begrudgingly acknowledge his dominant presence. He was an extraordinary man. He was one of a kind—a unique individual. Everything about him was extraordinary—his persona, his intellect, his wit, his achievements, his rise to fame, his failures and his demise were all extraordinary features of Gough Whitlam. Just as extraordinary is that such an exceptional person, whom today the nation widely acknowledges, was so convincingly rejected by the Australian people in 1975. 


Gough was ahead of his time. His vision was not readily accepted at the time, and it was only after changes were bedded down that the wider community saw the value of Labor's reforms. They have withstood the test of time. His sacking, conceived by the two highest non-political officers in the land, the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Governor-General of the day, was the greatest political miscarriage of justice I can point to. It was also the greatest test of the Governor-General's powers and the Australian Constitution that Australia had ever been confronted with, and the first and only time that an Australian Prime Minister was removed from office by a Governor-General.


The diverse array of Whitlam's front bench, a double dissolution, breaking of convention and appointment by the Queensland Bjelke-Petersen government of Albert Field to the Senate all add to the extraordinary turbulence of the Whitlam government era. But it was also the greatest reforming government Australia had ever seen. For myself as a South Australian, the election of the Whitlam federal government after 23 years of a Liberal government, followed closely after the re-election of the Dunstan Labor government after 28 years of Liberals in South Australia, was a great time. Whilst they were very different in character and stature, politically Don Dunstan and Gough Whitlam had very much in common. Both were well educated intellectuals. Both were brilliant lawyers and had been appointed QCs. Both had been elected to parliament in the early 1950s. Both came from relatively well-to-do families and neither came from a union background. Importantly, and sometimes together, they changed Australia. 


Between 1972 and 1975, over 500 bills were passed by the Whitlam government. It was an extraordinary achievement, given that there was an election in between, in 1974, and that so much of the legislation was anything but routine changes of law. Ending conscription, consumer protection, Indigenous issues, the arts, the environment, multiculturalism, human rights, foreign affairs, equality, abolishing High Court appeals to the Privy Council, education and health care were all placed on Gough Whitlam and Don Dunstan's agenda, and the reform process began. For South Australians, the reforms were simultaneously being enshrined into both state and federal laws. It was, indeed, a time of great change. National ALP secretary Mick Young, who was based in South Australia, was a common link between Gough and Don during this critical period. 


There has been some conjecture about who abolished the White Australia policy, with some crediting former Prime Minister Harold Holt and others Gough Whitlam. My understanding is that both can take credit for it, with the process commencing under Holt and being sealed by Whitlam. It was also Gough Whitlam, jointly with Don Dunstan, who in the mid-1960s moved to abolish the White Australia policy from Labor's platform. It was under Gough Whitlam that Labor brought in the Racial Discrimination Act, acknowledged Australia as a multicultural nation and promoted equality amongst all peoples.


Following the Whitlam government's defeat, from 1976 to 1981 I was employed by Senator Jim Cavanagh. Senator Cavanagh had served as a minister throughout the Whitlam government era in what I believe was his most significant role, Minister for Indigenous Affairs. He was the minister who oversaw the original draft of the Northern Territory land rights legislation which—although it was subsequently passed under the Fraser government because of the termination of the Whitlam government—was indeed a Labor initiative. One of my first tasks with Senator Cavanagh was to identify any differences between Labor's legislation and the Fraser government's redrafted bills. There was very little difference that I could spot. The land rights legislation was a major breakthrough in having the Indigenous people's connection with their land finally recognised. 


When Jim Cavanagh passed away in 1990, Gough Whitlam attended and spoke at his funeral held at the Port Adelaide town hall, as he had done with so many of his other former cabinet colleagues. He valued all of his former government colleagues. 


There is often a tendency to embellish a person's life when speaking about them after their death. But Gough Whitlam's life needs no embellishment. By all measures Gough was an exceptional person. As more years pass, his achievements become clearer. His determination is vindicated and in turn Gough becomes legendary. It was the Whitlam government that opened up Australia to the world and the world to Australia. It was under the Whitlam government that Australia came of age as an independent free-thinking nation that could stand on its own two feet.


It was under the Whitlam government that Australia took control of its destiny, and Australia did that without breaking away from the Commonwealth or becoming a republic. Whilst today we take such matters for granted, that was not the case in the 1970s when community attitudes were very different. Whitlam's reforms took courage, determination and persuasiveness. Gough Whitlam was not driven by what was popular but by what was right, convinced that in time all Australians would see the righteousness of his direction. And indeed his reforms have withstood the test of time. Whilst many may try to emulate him or match his political stature, I doubt that Australia will ever again have a political leader of the ilk of Gough Whitlam. 


In a service befitting his legendary status, Gough was farewelled by a crowd of thousands at the Sydney Town Hall memorial service. I felt privileged to have been there and to have lived through the Whitlam government era. The service brought to a close the Whitlam era, but his reforms endure and Gough Whitlam will long be remembered. I thank Gough Whitlam for his contribution to Australian life.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (10:17):  I remember, when I was around seven or eight, sitting at home in our housing commission house being full of Melbournian pride. I recall saying to my sister: 'Aren't we lucky! We are living in Melbourne, and Melbourne is the capital of Victoria, and Victoria is the best state in Australia, and Australia is the best country in the world!' My older sister looked at me and said: 'We are a pissant, insignificant nation that is led around by the nose by America, and we are the laughing stock of the world.' I did not realise until 1973 just how profound the black cloud that had descended upon me as a result of that conversation was. 


I remember very clearly a moment in February 1973. It was a Saturday morning. By this stage I had moved to what was truly the best state in Australia. I was going into my Saturday morning job. I hopped off the bus. It was a beautiful sunny day, and there was the Perth Town Hall in all its glory. Suddenly I felt this black cloud lift. I felt so proud to be an Australian. I felt that we were now truly a nation that we could be proud of, a nation embarking on an independent foreign policy, a nation that was accepting the proper rights of Aboriginal people, a nation that was allowing women freedom, and a nation that was focusing on great social justice issues such as education. It was a magic moment. And for that I will always deeply thank Gough Whitlam and the work that he did, particularly in that first 100 days that led to this great energy. 


The Whitlam years were really transformative. For my generation, just ending conscription and our involvement in the Vietnam War had immediate impact on family and friends. There were two issues that I was engaged in politically as a teenager: opposition to the Vietnam War and land rights for Indigenous people. Gough embraced both of those issues. For my generation, many of my cohort, my friends, had fought conscription. My partner had been jailed for refusing to register for national service as had many of my friends. Many of them had spent a number of years on the run semi in-hiding to avoid being jailed for refusing to register for national service because of their extreme objection to being involved in the Vietnam War. It was really energising to be part of an Australia that thought for itself. 


There was definitely, as Paul Keating said, a 'before Whitlam' and an 'after Whitlam' Zeitgeist. That is not to deny that under Holt and Gorton some modernising had commenced. But it was a crack in the wall. What happened with Gough and his government was that the windows of this country were opened and the energising breezes of modernisation swept throughout the land. It has been extraordinary to be reminded, since his death, of the reach of his government. The number of areas that were changed and changed very profoundly, the areas of policy that he penetrated within his time, has been truly amazing. 


I just want to focus on two areas that perhaps have not had as much attention as they should. As someone who was reared in the Irish Catholic tradition, I had been part of a sector of society that had seen Labor's objection to state aid to Catholic schools as sectarian. Whitlam and his government cut through magnificently that Gordian knot, by changing the whole debate to one of equity of funding for schools. No longer was the debate around whether it was government or non-government; it was a debate around equity. He accepted and took on and embraced responsibility for ensuring that both government and non-government schools were funded adequately, to ensure that there was real equality of opportunity across the country. He recognised that the issue was not Catholic versus non-Catholic; it was about accessing education and creating opportunities for Australians. Although we had free and compulsory primary and secondary education, the product on offer was very uneven. 


Much of the debate and remembrance of Gough has focused on the role the Whitlam government had in making tertiary education widely accessible, but I would put it that it was indeed the work that was done in lifting the standards of primary and secondary schooling throughout the country that has been the more profound education legacy, and one that Mr Whitlam himself put as one of his central and core achievements. 


I want to also reflect on the role he played in modernising our intelligence agencies. I think it is very important to reflect on this at this time, when we are expanding the powers of our intelligence agencies to deal with external threats. I think it is important for us to learn some of these important lessons, of which Gough was aware, about the capacity of such agencies to develop a culture that confuses legitimate dissent with subversion. Gough had a very detailed knowledge of the intelligence services, and it is extraordinary to think now that at the time there was not even official recognition that a number of these services, such as ASIS and Defence Signals, existed. It is clear that these organisations had developed an obsession with anti-communism and had indeed focused far too much of their attention on activities that were a legitimate part of the Australian political landscape and failed in fact to look at some of the real threats that were presenting themselves to the Australian community. The establishment of the Hope royal commission has led to some very significant and lasting changes in the Australian intelligence community and a lot more transparency about the nature of the work that is undertaken and has started the process of providing real and important parliamentary oversight of those activities.


Again, listening to the debate, just here today, the contributions that have been made remind us of the breadth and reach of the change. I remember well the dismissal. I remember being out there on that night handing out flyers to people at the Perth railway station, telling them about the dismissal—because in those days, before email and other electronic media, a lot of people coming out of work at five o'clock at night certainly had been unaware of this tumultuous change that had occurred. But I agree with Noel Pearson and the magnificent comments he made in his eulogy to Gough—that we should not lament that he had only three years, because these were three years of crowded hours. It was certainly not an age without a name. It was a massive achievement, and it was indeed the pace of change that was itself transformative. It was very much the montage of revolution that occurred that enabled—that really fed and created—the energy that has underpinned Australian life ever since.


I have been very proud to be part of the Labor family, and I thank Tony Whitlam in particular for his very inspiring words about the importance of the Labor Party in continuing the very great legacy of Gough. And, like the member for Canberra, I have found that the whole experience of reliving those Whitlam years has given me an increased focus on the importance of the work we do here and the importance of continuing with a modern Labor Party and fighting for those Labor values.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (10:29):  It is a great pleasure to follow those beautifully crafted words from the member for Perth and obviously a great pleasure and privilege to speak on this condolence motion. I want to thank the government for agreeing to this motion being debated in this chamber, and I also want to acknowledge the very fine words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in leading off this debate.


It is very hard to sum up the life and legacy of anyone in five minutes, let alone someone who managed to cram as much activity and purpose into their 98 years as Gough Whitlam did. In the short time I have I would like to reflect on Gough's legacy in the area of environmental protection, because it was a very significant legacy. Gough Whitlam came to power with a very ambitious platform in this policy area, as he did in so many others. After a short stint in the environment portfolio during the famous duumvirate with Lance Barnard, he appointed the very energetic Moss Cass, who held the environment portfolio in the Whitlam government for two and a half of the three years. The Commonwealth role in environmental protection then was a relatively blank slate. In Australia and other developed nations, particularly the United States, the environment was only then just beginning to emerge as a significant political issue. The previous government had only appointed a minister to the portfolio in the last year or two of its 23 years, and had not managed yet to really craft much of an agenda.


Gough Whitlam's approach to this area, though, was consistent with all of the other policies he focused on. Firstly, he again was ahead of his time in grasping the importance of progressive change in this area. As one example, in his 1974 campaign speech Gough Whitlam said:


Labor believes the polluter should pay, not future generations of Australians.


Which is a debate that we know only too well remains unresolved today.


He also boldly promoted the role of the Commonwealth, or the Australian government, in protecting our beautiful natural environment. As he did in so many other policy areas, Gough unashamedly employed and deployed every provision he could find in the Australian Constitution to support his goals. Gough strenuously opposed the Bjelke-Petersen government's plan to drill for oil in the Great Barrier Reef, for example. He took the then unprecedented step of passing a Commonwealth law to override the Queensland government in the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. The conservative state, not just Queensland but a number of others, took Gough to the High Court, claiming that it was up to the Queensland government to decide whether or not to drill in one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Gough's government argued that one of his favourite provisions of the Constitution, the external affairs power in section 51(39), gave the Commonwealth power beyond the low-water mark to enact legislation of that type, and the High Court agreed. On that foundation Gough built the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and legislated to create the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which remains in place today.


Gough also used the external affairs power to sign Australia onto the World Heritage Convention, Australia being one of the first countries to do so. On that basis we have seen in the last four and a bit decades the listing of so many precious areas onto the world heritage list, a decision ultimately that was validated again by the High Court, memorably in the Franklin Dam case. Gough ratified a number of other conventions to drive better domestic environmental protection. I do not have the opportunity to list them, but notably the Ramsar convention, which protects wetlands and associated biodiversity.


The role of the Australian government in protecting Australia's environmental assets that have world heritage values is a great Whitlam legacy, a legacy that the Labor Party today seeks to extend and protect in opposing the current government's attempts to hand back the protection powers over world heritage properties to the states and territories.


Gough also used the fiscal reach of the Australian government to introduce laws requiring environmental impact assessments, for the first time, of developments that involved Commonwealth land or Commonwealth funds. He also established the National Parks and Wildlife Service, a highlight among so many examples over so many decades of Labor's strong connection and support for our national park system. He also established the Australian Heritage Commission, recognising that our wonderful heritage does not only extend to our beautiful natural environment.


As the years passed the focus of environmental politics obviously shifts. The challenges of climate change and water scarcity, for example, were not much discussed in the time in which Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister. But the framework that Gough established for this parliament to play a leading role in nurturing and protecting our beautiful natural environment remains as relevant today as it was when Gough first prosecuted that argument.


Vale Edward Gough Whitlam. He was a true pioneer.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:34):  We in this House today and for many days pay tribute to and remember the Labor warrior and true reformist, Gough Whitlam. So much can be said about Australia's 21st Prime Minister: his service to the Labor Party; his commitment to the community of Werriwa where he was the former federal member; his dedication to reforming and shaping Australia into the dynamic, egalitarian society we enjoy today; and his devotion as a loving husband and father. But I would like to focus on one of Gough's greatest achievements in particular, a subject close to my heart: education. 


Education affects as all. It shapes our way of life, and I am privileged to have the role of shadow minister for education. Gough saw education for what it was and is: a great transformer; the single greatest opportunity to improving the quality of life and standard of living for every Australian; and the best possible mechanism for improving and strengthening our economy.


In coming to government in 1972, Gough set about transforming Australia's education system into a far more equitable and affordable endeavour for all Australians. He abolished the 'morally unjust and socially wasteful' dichotomy of opportunity afforded to private school students versus government school students, arguing that 'no democratic government can accept this disparity'.


Gough threw open the doors to Australia's higher education system, offering students of all backgrounds a free and affordable university education for the first time in our history. This proved to be a profound reform; a hallmark of Gough's brief but momentous time in office. Gough could not know back then that this reform would continue to echo around this place some 40 years later, highlighted now by the current government's proposed higher education reform package.


Education was a personal passion of Gough's. In fact, in his 1969 campaign launch, Gough argued:


When government makes opportunities for any of the citizens, it makes them for all the citizens. We are all diminished as citizens when any of us are poor. … The nation is the poorer—a poorer economy, a poorer civilisation, because of this human and national waste


I think this is something that the government should consider while it is pursuing some very radical, unfair and distasteful reforms.


Gough used this sense of universal education and social justice to unleash many educational reforms, including the abolition of university fees, the granting of state aid to independent schools, lifting the funding to public schools and the creation of the Australian Schools Commission.


Under Gough's leadership, government spending on non-government schools increased by 117 per cent, while spending on government schools increased by 677 per cent. This funding injection tipped the establishment on its head and went a long way to eradicating the inequity in public school funding.


Gough's reforms in education were big, broad and visionary. Following a long stint in opposition, Gough knew what needed to be done to transform Australia's education system into a fairer, more equitable institution that benefited and served the wider Australian community, not just the fortunate few.


It is fair to say that, if it were not for Gough Whitlam and his visionary education reforms, particularly in higher education, many in this place today would not have a university degree. Many would not have been afforded the opportunity to go university or even finish school. We in this place and right across this country owe Gough a debt we can never repay. The opportunity to gain an education is the first step in gaining meaningful employment, social mobility and financial freedom. 


What people may not know is that Gough was also the champion of Australia's modern dental school plan, which originated in my electorate of Kingston—this is getting off the topic of education but something that is probably little known. This information came from the former member for Kingston, Richie Gun, who took the then shadow minister for health, Bill Hayden, on a tour of a Christie's Beach dental clinic in 1969. The clinic was trialling a first of its kind: a dental service, that was local, could be easily accessed and was affordable. So impressive were the results of this state health department trial, it was quickly introduced into the Labor Party platform in 1971 in order to extend the program nation-wide. Gough gave this policy his full support and went about introducing a national dental service as a matter of urgency after having won office in 1972. Gough was a driver of change in Australia. This small policy was just one of the many policies that not only made my electorate of Kingston a better place to live but also made this country a better place to live.


We need to take this opportunity to say thank you, Gough, for what you did for this country. People would argue that taking this country from where it was to where needed to be was a massive step. It required momentum, it required passion and it required drive and they were things that Gough Whitlam certainly had.


Gough was a great man, a great reformer, a great Labor leader and a great Prime Minister. I think we can all continue to fight for his principles and his beliefs. We can all continue to mark his legacy in a way that is fitting for the modern Labor Party. He will be missed.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (10:41):  I am one of the younger members of the House but I am also living proof of Gough and his legacy of his time in parliament. I thought it was important to contribute to this condolence motion, not necessarily on my own reflections of the great man but of the reflections of many of the Labor branch members and stalwarts in my electorate.


There is no more fitting person's recollections to place on the record first than those of David Kennedy, a federal member for Bendigo from 1969 to 1972. David developed a strong, close, personal friendship with Mr Whitlam and recalls that he was an inspiration. In David's words, Mr Whitlam was a larrikin of parliament. He said that Mr Whitlam bowled us all over just because he kept cracking jokes, that Mr Whitlam was full of life and that he wanted others to enjoy life. David remembers warmly the nickname that Gough Whitlam had for him—Nap, short for Napoleon. People in Bendigo were not surprised by this nickname.


David also said that Gough inspired a generation of people in Victoria. He was a great champion of liberty, equality and fraternity. For a lot of Labor supporters, the passing of Gough was a really personal thing. David said, 'We admired him, we cherished him and we loved him. He stood for all we believed in.' Finally David said, 'To lose him is to lose a sense of self.' David's words and thoughts and warmth are echoed by many Labor Party life members from my electorate. They remind us how important Gough was to Labor in Central Victoria.


Labor party life member Elaine McNamara said that Whitlam symbolised everything that was good and caring in the Labor Party. Elaine said she joined the party as soon as she could at age 18 and got to meet Gough Whitlam whenever he visited Bendigo. 'He was a well respected person,' she said, 'when he came to Bendigo, and he did so quite a lot. In person he was very quietly spoken at times but he always had a strong presence about him.' Elaine said, 'Margaret and Gough were a very gentle couple. But then in his role as Prime Minister, he became dogmatic, and you really felt like you had a fighter, someone standing up and fighting for you in your corner.'


Elaine fondly remembers attending rallies and political meetings with her grandfather and how she used to be on the back of a truck at Trades Hall and would ring the bell to call the members to order. She remembers many of the speeches that Gough made at Trades Hall during his visits there. Elaine's fondest memory of Gough was when, as Labor leader, on his way to Bendigo, he stopped in at Castlemaine to buy some Castlemaine Rock for her young son. Elaine says that whenever she thinks of Gough, she now thinks of Castlemaine Rock. This is the warmth of the man that we have lost. Elaine said that it would be the first year in a long time that she would not be sending Gough Whitlam a Christmas card—another symbol of how close he was to so many in the Bendigo electorate.


Another life member of the Bendigo branch, Elaine Walsh, who joined the party in 1962, said it had been such a privilege to volunteer and be involved in the labour movement under such a leader as Gough Whitlam. Elaine said: 'I'm proud to have been there at the time that he was elected. Gough did in three years what other governments could not do in 10 years,' and that was probably because he knew he could and he had the guts to do it.  Ms Walsh said the party had changed a lot since Whitlam's time in office, but she said that it was his actions in government that helped define the debate for Labor and the community for many generations to come.


Eric Dearricott's life membership of the Bendigo branch comes up next year. Eric said that he was inspired to join the Labor Party after Whitlam's dismissal from government in 1975. Mr Dearricott refers to that time as being exciting and engaging. As a young teacher, he and his wife, Margaret, thought it was their duty to get involved, to join a movement, to stand up not only for the rights of their generation but for the rights of many generations. Eric said that he was influenced by Whitlam's policies and foresight. He said, 'When I think about Gough Whitlam and Labor and the period of the late sixties through to the late seventies, I think about the principles that they stood for.' 


There is an entire generation of people who joined the Labor Party and got actively involved in Labor and in the community because of Gough Whitlam. Other branch members joined the Labor Party and got actively involved because they were opposed to the war in Vietnam. Paul and Mary Reid often reflect that they joined the Labor Party and got actively involved because of Labor's stance against our involvement in the Vietnam War. Those are the principles that Eric, Mary and Paul refer to when they talk about why they joined the Labor Party. Decades on, that is still their motivation for continuing to be actively involved in the labour movement. It was Whitlam's vision for education, his recognition of China and his work for women and health care are just some of the many policies that Eric continues to admire and be empowered by today. Eric said, 'In my lifetime he is certainly the most inspiring leader that I have known.' These are the words of some of the many people actively involved in Labor then and today, and I wish to place on the Hansard record their thoughts and reflections on the passing of Gough Whitlam. 


Gough Whitlam in government created change that would continue for generations. He created change in his lifetime, in our lifetime, and his reforms and leadership continue to create real and lasting change both in the community and in the Labor Party. Just reflect on the change that he made to the great Australian Labor Party. Gough was a giant of the Labor Party and a great leader of our nation. It is very fair to say that he loved the Labor Party. In 1964 Gough made a speech to the Labor Party at the Trades Hall in Melbourne. He said he could not deliver the speech because there were two Labor parties: the men, delegates and candidates; and the women making the tea and preparing the meals out the back, then and today known as the Labor ladies. Gough declared then that we could not deserve to be called the Labor Party until we were one Labor Party, and until we were one Labor Party we did not deserve to govern. So the women stopped making tea and no longer were consigned to the back room, and so began the modern making of Labor.


We are a modern Labor Party and well on our way to achieving Gough's goals. Within Gough's lifetime, we have achieved another milestone. Almost 50 years since Gough made these remarks at the Victorian Trades Hall in Melbourne, at the last federal election in the state of Victoria three Labor women, new women, were elected to enter this parliament, and three Labor men, new men, were elected to enter this parliament to join the Labor ranks: Jo Ryan, in Lalor, Tim Watts, in Gellibrand; Clare O'Neil, in Hotham; Andrew Giles, in Scullin; David Feeney, in Batman; and me, in Bendigo—another example of how, within Gough's lifetime, he changed the modern Labor Party.


Change that Gough created will continue on for generations, and some of the achievements that I would like to mention profoundly changed our community to make it a stronger and more inclusive community. We have mentioned the opposition to Australia's involvement in Vietnam, and many reasons why a generation of young people stood up and demanded to be heard.


His social welfare reforms included supporting the mother's benefit and welfare payments to homeless people. Before 1973, only widows were entitled to pension payments, so other women who were raising children on their own were faced with impossible choices. Recently, when I caught up with the Eaglehawk community committee of management, they were talking about Gough Whitlam, and one brave great-grandmother told me her story about how Gough supported her raising five children when she was a single mother. She was in a violent relationship and had to leave for the sake of her children's safety, and it was impossible, before Gough, to survive, but with his reforms he made it possible. Today she is grateful for the generosity, the vision and the compassion that this great man had.


Equal pay for women is another example of what legacy Gough has left us with. One of the first acts of the Gough Whitlam government was to reopen the national wage and equity pay case at the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission. In 1972, the equal pay case meant that Australian women doing similar work to that of men should be paid an equal wage, and two years later the commission extended the adult minimum wage to women workers for the first time. It is hard for my generation to believe that it was not until 1974—that women working as cleaners, women working in hotels, the many, many women on minimum wage, did not receive equal pay until that period.


These are some of the lasting legacies of a great man, a Labor man. These are some of the policy areas that continue to be fundamental to today's debate. He changed the debate in this country for many decades and continues to inspire not just generations of Labor people but generations and generations of a nation, challenging us to be bold, to live up to what we believe in, to be bold to take the debate out there. The Hon. Gough Whitlam is a Labor legend who in death, as in life, will continue to inspire a nation for many generations to come. May he rest in peace.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (10:54):  I rise to join my colleagues and express my sincerest condolences on the death of Edward Gough Whitlam, the 21st Prime Minister of Australia. Gough Whitlam was a political titan, a crash-or-crash-through politician, a leader of conviction. If we were to ask ourselves the eternal question, 'Does history make people, or do people make history?' I dare say Gough would be among the very few in the latter category.


And yet his character was forged by history and his times. Though from a comfortable background, he was born during World War I, in his teens during the Great Depression, a bomber navigator in his 20s, and an MP and father in his 30s. He was among, indeed from, the great generation. Before even emerging upon the national stage, he had already seen human misery on a grand scale, faced death many times and even contemplated the existential threat to modern democracy throughout the world. With this experience, is it any wonder that he was a man in a hurry, with an ambition that was so grand, matched by a determination so fierce? It culminated on 13 November 1972 at Labor's campaign launch. 'Men and women of Australia,' he proclaimed, at once changing the political lexicon of his times. He went on to say:


The decision we will make for our country on 2 December is a choice between … the habits and fears of the past, and the demands and opportunities of the future. There are moments in history when the whole fate and future of nations can be decided by a single decision. For Australia, this is such a time.


Such rhetoric rarely rings with such truth.


After 23 years in exile, caused as much by division and defection than by anything the conservatives did, the Labor Party, led by this magnificent leader, was not there to govern for governing's sake. In no particular order, the Whitlam government ended conscription, released conscientious objectors from our jails, introduced universal health care, created no-fault divorce, created the Family Court of Australia, reduced tariffs, abolished appeals to the Privy Council, abolished prohibitive university fees, cut the voting age to 18 years, funded our fledgling film industry, enacted Aboriginal land rights and the Racial Discrimination Act, recognised China, ended our involvement in the Vietnam War, repealed the death penalty, instituted legal aid, abolished knights and dames—which a future Labor government will do again—ratified the World Heritage convention, removed sales tax on the pill, reopened the equal pay case, embedded the Australia Council for the Arts, paid single mothers a pension, established the Australian Law Reform Commission, sung a new national anthem and so much more. His was a government not for the faint-hearted but for the big-hearted and the high-minded.


In the brief time I have left, I also feel compelled to address the charge of economic illiteracy or indifference. There were flaws with this government, without a doubt; there were mistakes and scandals. But let us not conclude that the absurdity of dealing with Khemlani or the titillation of Morosi and Cairns's relationship has anything to do with the economic policy record of the Whitlam era. That was trivia. That was ephemera. That was irrelevant. That sold newspapers, but it did not tell of the 1970s economic policy or experiences.


You do not judge an economic record according to those who seek to justify Whitlam's dismissal or conservative politicians or even Labor's successors. You judge the economy on how the economy was, not on how vested interests said it was. You judge it on the facts. You judge it on the results. By the early 1970s, a consensus of macroeconomists formed regarding inflation and unemployment. It was contended—and, as I say, it was a universally held view—that they are inversely related. When one goes up, the other goes down. That orthodoxy of economic policy, however, did not apply to the oil price shocks of the 1970s and virtually no economist or government anticipated such a shock happening. The shocks increased both inflation and unemployment simultaneously—not a shock unique to Australia but a global phenomenon. No-one had any good ideas on what to do to fix it.


Consider inflation between 1972 and 1975 in a series of countries. Inflation in the G7 countries increased from 4.5 per cent to 11 per cent; in Europe it increased from seven per cent to 14 per cent; in the United States it increased from three per cent to nine per cent; the United Kingdom's inflation increase was from seven per cent to 24 per cent; in Australia it went from six per cent to 15 per cent, well within the median range of inflation increases at the time. Unemployment all over, as in Australia, doubled. As for growth, Australia did relatively well, falling from 2.6 per cent in 1972 to one per cent in 1974, and by 1975 it was back to 2.6 per cent. Therefore, it is not right to say that somehow the Whitlam government's record was anything other than consistent with what was happening throughout the world as a result of the oil shocks of the seventies.


Stagflation was not solved by other countries, with the exception of Scandinavian countries at the time, and not by the political beneficiaries of Whitlam's sacking and subsequent election loss—and not by the Thatcher and Fraser governments that implemented draconian contractionary fiscal and monetary policy. Let's remember: Treasurer Howard left the Hawke and Keating governments with 11 per cent inflation and 10 per cent unemployment to deal with—and, with the trade union movement partners in an Accord, deal with it they did. So let me repeat the simple clear message which the actual microeconomic outcomes in the Whitlam years reveal. Economic policy was conducted about as well—or as badly, if you like—as in every other country dealing with the oil shocks.


On a personal note, his impact upon me and indeed upon my Irish migrant parents was immense. He was a man of the future, an advocate for independence and a tireless supporter for equal opportunity. His election and achievements made it much more likely for factory workers' kids like me and others that I knew not only to aspire to university but also to go to university. Indeed, I am one of those beneficiaries, to be the first in my family to go to universities along with my siblings, He made it clear that serving the public was a noble profession and something that we should all think about, and we should all thank him in this place. 


His tragic, unconstitutional tearing down as our Prime Minister turned many Labor voting families, like mine, into lifelong Labor Party members and activists. Vale Edward Gough Whitlam.

"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (11:03):  I rise in continuation on my contribution to the debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. For example, each bank guarantee requires a separate actuarial report with different requirements set by each jurisdiction, and there are numerous differences between jurisdictions in taking out a reinsurance policy. In their submission to the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry, Pacific National claimed that national based insurance potentially represented a saving of between 50 per cent and 70 per cent on recurrent financial costs alone. Productivity and savings would also be realised through the capacity for an employer to standardise, centralise and streamline claims management functions.


Each jurisdictional scheme requires self-insurers to demonstrate adequate procedures for managing workers compensation claims. Self-insurers are required to demonstrate that they employ qualified staff and engage certified scheme service providers. This is to ensure that employees of self-insurers have their claims managed in a professional manner in accordance with the different scheme benefit structures. Most jurisdictions require self-insurers to have claims managers located in that jurisdiction.


A number of self-insurers have noted that this prevents them from operating a centralised claims management centre which would reduce claims management costs. For example, CSR in 2004 estimated that it would save $150,000 per annum if it could have a single claims management centre. Operating under one scheme also means having a uniform set of benefits and rules across all employees, which ensures equality amongst workers. Multistate self-insurers are required to have detailed knowledge of up to eight different claims management and benefit structures. IT systems to manage different payment structures are expensive and time consuming, given the complexities involved in the benefit calculation processes and variations between jurisdictions.


WHS regulations apply to all employers, irrespective of whether or not they self-insure; however added requirements are placed upon self-insurers to demonstrate through audit that they have appropriate WHS management systems. These systems and audit processes differ between the schemes, adding additional costs for multistate employers. Costs associated with complying with various WHS requirements exacerbated with the additional expense of multiple audits and differences between audit requirements. This makes it difficult and costly for multistate employers to develop uniform WHS management systems. For example, Woolworths has different WHS management systems in each jurisdiction due to the difficulty in developing a single WHS management process that meets different jurisdictional requirements. Woolworths estimate a saving of approximately $400,000 per annum if they had a single national WHS management system.


Self-insurers are required to pay an application fee and ongoing levies for each licence These fees and charges include the recovery of self-insurance application administration costs and contributions to WHS functions. For corporations who operate in multiple jurisdictions, there may be unnecessary replication in the payment of some component of these fees and concern with regard to the variance in these fees despite a similar number of employees covered by each licence. Self-Insurers are required to supply data to the regulator. The collection of data imposes costs on multistate self-insurers, because each scheme requires a different data set and software to supply the data; thus preventing self-insurers from operating an integrated computer system to satisfy multistate scheme requirements.


Another significant amendment presented in this bill is the enabling of the SRCC to grant a single licence for self-insurance through the Comcare scheme for a related group of companies. Under current arrangements a corporation cannot apply for a group self-insurance licence under Comcare, so each entity in the group must apply separately for a licence. The introduction of group licences will reduce red tape and cost for employers, as it recognises that groups of interrelated corporations often share return-to-work and work health and safety systems within the group.


A significant barrier preventing harmonisation of workers compensation scheme has been the lack of an integrated national work health and safety framework. In March 2007 occupational health and safety coverage was provided for all Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act licensees. However, with the enactment of the Commonwealth WHS Act 2011 new entrants to the Comcare scheme from 1 January 2012 did not have coverage for WHS purposes. This meant that Comcare self-insurers lost the advantage of truly uniform WHS laws and the reduced compliance costs and administrative efficiency that this brings. This change was introduced in anticipation of national harmonisation of work health and safety laws, which has not occurred in Victoria and Western Australia, resulting in multistate employers continuing to operate under varying schemes.


This bill also seeks to excludes workers compensation claims for injuries that occur during recess breaks away from an employer's premises. Under current arrangements, compensation is payable for injuries occurring during recess breaks even if the employee is not at the place of work when the injury occurs. Under the proposed amendments, injuries occurring when a worker is away from the workplace and is not undertaking work related activities will not be compensated. If workers are undertaking activities associated with their employment, or at the request or direction of the employer during a recess, they will still be covered. Workers who are injured at work even while having a recess or lunch break will remain fully covered.


The bill will also exclude access to workers compensation when a worker engages in a serious and wilful misconduct even if the injury results in death or serious and permanent impairment. As the minister outlined in his second reading speech:


While claims in this category are rare, the Australian public rightly expects that employees should take personal responsibility for their actions. 


It is crucial that any workers compensation scheme is geared towards people acting in a proper and safe manner and does not include a safety net for people who break the rules and put themselves and other employees at risk.


This government will ensure that employers under Comcare will operate under a single workers compensation and WHS scheme. Eligible corporations will have access to Comcare's workers compensation and WHS regime. This will reduce red tape, jurisdictional inconsistency and maximise equity for employees in terms of injury management, compensation and return to work. This will also enable these corporations to achieve an integrated approach to prevention, rehabilitation and return to work. The proposed reforms under this bill will be better for businesses, better for workers and better for the economy.



Eligible multijurisdictional corporations will have the opportunity to realise efficiencies and savings from becoming a self-insurer under a single jurisdiction—hence, capitalising on the ability to invest and expand nationally as a result of coverage under a single regime. The Taylor Fry report in examining the financial arrangements for self-insurers under the Comcare scheme stated there would be:



M
inimal impacts on the state and territory workers
'
 compensation schemes if private
 corporations
 were to join the Comcare scheme as self-insurers.

This was consistent with the 2004 Productivity Commission report. I commend this bill to the House. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (11:11):  I find it very interesting to follow the member for Dobell in this debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I note that she worked for WorkCover prior to becoming elected to parliament. The context of her speech and the direction of her speech was all about reducing costs, about efficiency, about the cost of compliance, about the cutting of red tape, about the cost to employers and the cost to insurers, and there was really no mention about providing support for injured workers. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation was introduced into this country, into the various states in our Commonwealth, to provide cover for workers who are injured at work. While she talked about employees or workers taking personal responsibility for their action, there was no talk about employers taking responsibility for the action that they take.


I think the member for Dobell's contribution really puts this debate in context. We have one side of the House, the side that I sit on, that is really concerned about ensuring that workers are properly protected if they are injured at work, and you have the other side of this parliament that is all about reducing cost to employers and reducing cost to insurers to enable them to make a greater profit at the expense of injured workers. That really puts it in context and it probably goes across the divide when you look at a number of issues. We are about people, we are about workers and we are about seeing that people have proper coverage, whilst the other side of this House is about ensuring that those that employ, or those that are in big business, can actually make a substantial profit.


I see this legislation as another attack on workers by a government that very much has a hidden agenda to undermine workers' rights, to undermine workers' conditions and to undermine workers' protection in the workplace. The government has history in relation to this. Under the Howard government, I was a member of the House committee that did a review into workers compensation laws, and the agenda that the then government had in relation to workers compensation was very obvious.


There has been a gradual whittling away of protection if you look at other jurisdictions. I cannot help but look to New South Wales, which is my home state, where the O'Farrell government introduced the most draconian changes to workers compensation legislation that I have ever seen. I have had worker after worker coming into my office telling me how they have got no coverage now and how they are unable to have that operation that they were scheduled to have because of the timing, as the changes have been put in place retrospectively. Most changes to workers' compensation, in both New South Wales and this jurisdiction, have not been retrospective—the changes take place from the date they are introduced. In New South Wales, they cover everybody that is on workers' compensation. It really shows the agenda of the Liberal and National parties on workers' compensation.


I used to be a rehabilitation counsellor before I came to this parliament, and in that job I worked with injured workers, with insurance companies and with employers. The aim of my job was to get people back into the workforce, preferably with their previous employer, and to have the workplace modified so they could return to their job and, maybe after rehabilitation, go back to full duties. During that time a number of obstacles were put in the path of those workers. Employers were reluctant to take them back into their workplace and insurance companies did not provide the support that they needed. If you provide the maximum of support you have the best opportunity for a good outcome, but walking away from workers leaves them in a situation where they cannot have the optimal outcome.


This government's agenda is very questionable when it comes to anything relating to workers' compensation, wages, workers' rights, workers' pay or workers' conditions. I believe this legislation before the parliament is just another step down the track of this government's antiworker agenda. The bill amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Work Health and Safety Act to expand the eligibility of corporations to self-insure through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme, which will allow companies operating across state borders to self-insure under the scheme. It also removes the need for the minister to declare eligibility to apply for a self-insure licence while maintaining the ability of the minister to issue directions to the Safety and Rehabilitation Commissioner, and it enables corporations currently required to meet workers' compensation obligations under two or more workers' compensation laws of a state to apply to the commission to join the Comcare scheme. It also allows a Commonwealth authority that ceases to be a Commonwealth authority to apply directly to the commission for approval to be a self-insurer. This, along with other changes, enables the commissioner to grant group licences to related corporations. I feel these changes have not been properly thought through and I do not think there will be proper oversight of the changes that will take place.


The government has refused to guarantee that no worker will be worse off. I have shared with the House the New South Wales experience where practically every worker is worse off, and now we have another Liberal-National Party government set to deliver a blow to workers, refusing to say that workers will not be worse off. For those on the other side of this parliament, it is not all about the worker that will be injured in the workplace, it is not all about ensuring that they can get the best possible outcome—rather it is about, as the member for Dobell mentioned, cost-cutting, efficiency, compliance, cutting red tape and reducing costs for employers. A person seriously injured at work will never be able to undertake life as it was—their life is changed forever. One of the most common complaints from those on the other side of the House relates to people who have a back injury. If you are a manual worker who has very limited literacy skills and you injure your back, then not only has your work been taken away from you but you probably have very limited opportunity to find another job and then every other aspect of your life is changed. That is what those on the other side of this House do not get. I do not see anything in this legislation that will assure Australians that workplaces will be as safe as they are now. Nothing that speakers on the other side of this House have said convinces me of that. Rather, I hear about things such as reducing costs, efficiency, compliance and reducing red tape—nothing about ensuring that workplaces throughout Australia are safe, about ensuring that workers are not seriously injured, about ensuring that workers do not lose their lives when they are working on a building site or in a mine. In the electorate that I represent workers in both those sorts of workplaces have lost their lives.


I see this government as bowing to the interests of big business. The government just not does not consider the impact of injury, disability and death. When it does open up the scheme, it will reduce the financial impact in the state systems and it will increase premiums for the remaining businesses in those schemes, adding pressure on workers' entitlements. It will leave sick workers worse off. If we go back to look at what workers compensation is about, it is compensating workers for injury at work. It is doing something to help them adjust to the fact that they went to work, they were seriously injured and they cannot go back to the work they did. They are worse off physically and now this scheme, I believe, will leave sick workers worse off in every aspect of their lives.


This is a really important point: the compliance obligations under Comcare are weaker than in the state systems. Comcare offers lower payments to injured workers, and Comcare's capacity to inspect workplaces and enforce laws will be reduced further as more businesses gain coverage. Comcare has only 44 inspectors nationwide—44 inspectors nationwide that are supposed to ensure that workplaces are safe—whilst each state based scheme has hundreds of inspectors working to ensure that workplaces meet their safety requirements. I find it extremely concerning that there is nothing in this legislation that places any obligation on employers and insurers to ensure that workplaces are made safe. There is no hint that the number of inspectors will be expanded and no hint that this government has any concern for injured workers.


I know the shadow minister has moved an amendment, and I know that the shadow minister is very, very concerned about the issues that I have raised. I note that workers will not be covered during breaks, and I also note that examples have been given of workers that take a break whilst working at a job that takes them outside their workplace, and I do not think that question has been answered. I believe there are a number of questions that this government has not answered. Rather, it is legislating to ensure that its ideological, philosophical hatred of workers and its enslavement to big business are enshrined in legislation rather than trying to put on the table fair legislation that will benefit both workers and employers—and, then, insurers as well. I find I cannot support this legislation. It is bad legislation, and it is typical of this Abbott government. (Time expired)

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (11:26):  I rise today to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill, which seeks to address aspects of the existing legislation which cause multistate corporations undue compliance costs. This government accepted a mandate from the Australian people to build a strong and prosperous economy. The coalition has committed itself to stewarding the wealth of this nation responsibly, wisely and in such a way as to create increased employment, greater benefit and greater security for everyday Australians. In short, the coalition is committed to cleaning up Labor's budget mess—a mess of inefficiencies.


When we are dealing with taxpayers' money it is simply unacceptable to see funds wasted on the impediment of unnecessary regulation and poor management. This amendment bill is not about making life more difficult for employees working for multistate corporations or about complicating workers' guarantee of adequate and fair protection in the case of compensation for injuries sustained. It seeks more responsible management and a simplification of a potentially complicated system of workers compensation. This bill seeks to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 to expand the eligibility of corporations to self-insure through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme.


To really grasp what this bill intends, we need to look back at the recent history with regard to this legislation. Employers operating in multiple states have been required to operate according to different workers compensation schemes and work health and safety regulations in each jurisdiction around Australia. This means red tape for employers and confusion, often, for workers subject to different regulations and benefits from their colleagues, depending on which state or territory they are employed in. This House is aware that certain private sector corporations have in the past been able to self-insure for workers compensation coverage through the Commonwealth Comcare scheme. There has been much to-ing and fro-ing over this particular aspect of the bill, when Productivity Commission inquiries and consultation with local state governments have indicated it could be streamlined to the benefit of businesses and employees alike.


The coalition Howard government responded to Productivity Commission inquiry recommendations by allowing eligible private corporations that operated in multiple states to apply for a self-insurance licence with the Comcare scheme. The intention of this action was that costs might be used more effectively to create new jobs, while simultaneously upholding improved safety standards within the enterprise. A moratorium on new corporations entering the Comcare scheme was imposed in 2007 by Labor, despite evidence from the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into National workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks, which found the compliance costs for multistate employers concerning multiple state workers compensation arrangements were significant. Currently 30 licensed corporations benefit from the reduced costs of having one set of workers compensation arrangements for the national workforce. Among these are former Commonwealth authorities such as Australia Post and Telstra, and private corporations such as Optus, TNT, the National Australia Bank and the John Holland Group. The results speak for themselves. Since joining the Comcare scheme, the work health and safety performance of these companies has almost universal improved in significant proportions. Under the Comcare scheme, companies with reduced bureaucracies are enabled to operate more effectively with their employees in improving work health and safety in their organisations.


Despite the success of Comcare, the previous, Labor government acted to ban multistate companies from joining the scheme. Labor commissioned a review, led by its own Dr Allan Hawke AC, which gave the recommendation to lift this moratorium, given the huge expense and inefficiency of insuring in multiple states and territories. Labor failed to follow its own advice, an oversight largely influenced by pressure from the union bosses. Apparently, neither the employment minister nor the workplace relations minister of the previous government had the wherewithal to fully address the needs of the workforce in this area and ensure the right decisions were made.


It makes sense to place these corporations and employees under one scheme across multiple states so that regulatory costs are kept to a minimum. What might be done with the funds that are spared the black hole of our red-tape-hugging former Labor government? New jobs, improved standards of safety, further economic growth. Accordingly, the coalition government lifted the moratorium in December 2013 in order that multistate employers performing to meet rigorous financial and governance criteria and demonstrating suitable work health and safety performance may apply for a licence to self-insure in the Comcare scheme, as opposed to dealing with multiple schemes. It is good to mention here that this government also intends to allow multistate employers to choose to apply to self-insure for workers compensation arrangement with Comcare to also have one set of work health and safety regulations. Thus the objective of this amendment bill before us today is to assist Australian multistate corporations to operate smarter by expanding their ability to self-insure in a standardised federal scheme, Comcare.


The amendments in the bill before this House are specifically the following: firstly, to remove the requirement that the minister declare eligibility to apply for a self-insurance licence, while maintaining the minister's ability to issue directions to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission—this will streamline the current two-stage approval process by removing the requirement that a corporation must be in competition with a Commonwealth authority or former Commonwealth authority to enter the Comcare scheme—and, secondly, to broaden the range of corporations that are eligible for a licence to self-insure under the scheme. 


The first of these amendments, to remove the requirement for the minister to declare eligibility for a corporation to apply for a self-insurance licence, addresses the current, ponderously slow two-stage process. It requires a declaration of eligibility to be granted by the minister before any assessment can be made by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission according to their criteria. Furthermore, it is expensive. Time is always at a premium when it comes to an effective economy; and, since Labor's previous tenure, money is at a higher premium than ever before. Labor's legacy of national debt is costing us $1 billion in interest per month, a burden taxpayers continue to carry, a burden this government is seeking to remove. This amendment will allow the commission to assess applicants' eligibility for a self-insurance licence in one step, while corporations are still exposed to the same stringent financial and governance requirements currently imposed by the commission. 


This directly enables the two major amendments I have listed, aimed at ensuring a robust approval process unimpeded by red tape. The withdrawal of the requirement that corporations be in competition with a Commonwealth authority to enter the Comcare scheme and the determination to include national employers—that is, those corporations meeting workers compensation obligations under two or more states—among the cohorts of corporations deemed eligible to self-insure under the scheme carry considerable anticipated savings and increased efficiencies. The recommendations enacted in this bill are expected to result in a total reduction in the regulatory burden, for those Australian businesses that transfer to the Comcare scheme, of $33 million per year over the next 10 years.


I should clarify that these amendments maintain the freedom of eligible employers to continue under multilayered workers compensation and work health and safety regimes or to apply for one set of national arrangements as they choose. 


This amendment bill is about refining an essential existing piece of legislation for Australian businesses and employees so that it assists rather than impedes economic growth while maintaining high safety standards. In addition to these amendments, measures towards the better management of corporate groups are being addressed in this bill. Currently, corporations applying to be covered under the Comcare scheme must be assessed individually for eligibility. Business has for some time been seeking the introduction of group licences to the SRC Act. 


The amendment bill provides for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to grant a licence to an eligible group of corporations owned by the same holding company, in line with the state schemes and the commercial reality of modern multicompany corporate structures. This bill recognises that groups of interrelated corporations often share return-to-work and work health and safety systems, and that each entity forming part of a group does not individually need to meet the definition of a 'national employer'. It is better for business, better for workers and, indeed, better for the economy.


Ongoing standards for the protection of workers remain a key concern of this government. As with current licences, it is a condition upon the issuing of a licence that the SRC Commission's standards are met with regard to work health and safety. The commission has the ability to vary or revoke a licence if it is not satisfied that this licence condition is being met.


This government is doing all it can to ensure that Comcare has the capacity to manage the increased responsibility in relation to workers compensation and work health and safety, and that it is financially viable. With Comcare being the single work health and safety regulator in the federal jurisdiction under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, Comcare inspectors and case managers have the authority necessary to represent the government in their actions, and greater flexibility in regulatory approaches. The costs of meeting regulatory responsibilities are resourced within the scheme. Regulatory contributions by licences, reflecting the cost incurred by the performance of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and Comcare, effectively fund self-insurance under the scheme.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill will save on red tape and streamline multistate corporations' compliance with workers compensation schemes by managing one standardised scheme. The bill is about streamlining and refining a national scheme that will work more effectively for multistate corporation employees. Workers moving onto Comcare will benefit from a nationwide workers compensation scheme that delivers the same coverage and benefits for all employees. This means real savings to business that will be more wisely invested in the larger economy and less confusion for multistate corporation employees. The bill is about building a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (11:37):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. I am speaking in opposition to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. Under the Howard government, reforms were introduced which allowed private national employers to opt into the Comcare scheme, a scheme which has its origins in providing workers compensation to employees of federal government agencies and bodies that have been privatised from the federal government. This was a reform which would allow national employers which had no history with the federal government to become a part of the Comcare scheme by virtue of self-insurance, by doing which they took themselves out of the various states schemes that those companies were a part of. It was a controversial step at the time and there were many concerns with it. As a result, when Labor was elected in 2007 a moratorium was put almost immediately on the practice of issuing licences to national employers seeking to self-insure under the Comcare scheme.


This bill seeks in effect to lift that moratorium so that national employers will be able to self-insure in the Comcare scheme. There is a superficial attraction in such a measure, in the idea of a company being able to be part of one workers compensation scheme rather than many, but there are many aspects of this which, beyond that superficial observation, make it clear that this is a deeply retrograde step.


The first point to make is that there is in place a national employer test for companies to pass which would enable them to become a self-insurer under the Comcare scheme. It is at best a minimal test. All you need to do to satisfy the test is operate in more than one state. There is no requirement about a minimum number of employees but there is a requirement that you self-insure. What you see with self-insurance in any of the state schemes is that it is, by and large, confined to those very large companies which have the capacity to engage in self-insurance, but this on the face of it will be open to any company which simply operate in more than one state. That is a minimal test and it is a real deficiency within this bill.


The second point to make is that there are a number of deficiencies within the Comcare scheme itself. To be fair, the workers compensation schemes that you see around Australia vary and are a reflection, I suppose, of the injury profile of those economies as they have developed over decades. The injury profile of the Comcare scheme has largely been about white-collar work—not entirely but largely—so the scheme is around that kind of work. It is good in that context. But Comcare just was not designed for large national employers which have significant amounts of blue-collar work, which may have entirely different kinds of injuries. As a result, there are significant deficiencies within the Comcare scheme which might apply to those people—for example, access to common law and the provisions within the Comcare scheme which provide for the facilitation of people returning to work. Comcare was designed principally as a scheme for the Australian Public Service. What we are now talking about, if this bill is allowed to pass, is this scheme becoming one which would apply potentially across the board with all the diversity that you see within our economy and all the diversity of injury profiles. That has not been thought about. It was not thought about by Howard's government. It is not being thought about by Tony Abbott. The next point—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Griggs
):  Refer to people by their correct title, please.




Mr Husic:
  The Howard government?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  He is the Prime Minister; he is not Tony Abbott.




Mr MARLES:
  By the Abbott government. I apologise, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker. I thank you for picking me up on that. I look forward to that level of detail being applied to everyone who speaks in this debate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  And it certainly will, Member for Corio!




Mr MARLES:
  Good. I appreciate that. The next point that needs to be made is: what will this do in relation to the state schemes? Workers compensation schemes are a form of insurance. They have a whole lot of actuarial research and assumptions underpinning them. They are based on the full spectrum of companies within a particular state or territory participating within those schemes. If we are now giving larger employers which have the capacity to self-insure the option of leaving state schemes and going into Comcare, this has the potential to have a devastating effect on the financial viability of the schemes within each of the states and territories. The only way in which those schemes will be able to deal with the challenge to their financial viability is to increase premiums. That is the only way they can do it. That is going to hit small and medium business. Small and medium enterprises will pay for the decision to allow large national employers to exit the state schemes and to enter the Comcare scheme on a self-insured basis. That is inevitable consequence of what will happen here. None of that has been thought through by this government, which is why so many of the state and territory jurisdictions oppose this measure. It is because they know what this is going to do to their schemes. Small and medium enterprises, I assure you, will also be very clear in the position they take in respect of this, because this means added cost for them.


The final point—and it seems to me that this is the most significant issue about taking this step—is that with state workers compensation schemes we have inspectorates which have hundreds of people in them. There are hundreds of people going out there and looking at whether or not companies are behaving in a safe way. There are strong police on the beat, if I can put it that way, to make sure that our companies and workplaces are operating in a safe manner.


Comcare have 44 inspectors nationally. If we are going to see these national companies go into this scheme, we are essentially going to see companies go into a scheme where there is no cop on the beat. There will effectively be no cop on the beat. The idea that 44 inspectors are going to be responsible for overseeing significant national companies in the Comcare scheme as envisaged by this amendment is politically ridiculous. This is absolutely retrograde in the steps that it is taking. This will mean that we have people entering a scheme which is essentially not policed or, at the very least, it is not set up to police the kind of national companies with the thousands of employers that they will bring coming into this scheme. None of that has been thought about it either. This is simply picking a policy out of the Work Choices Howard era and putting it into the here and now without thinking about any of the repercussions or consequences associated with it.


What concerns me about this in a bigger sense is that it shows such scant regard, in my view, for the critical issue of safety at work. That is ultimately what we are talking about here. Last year, 187 Australians went to work in the morning and did not return home. They lost their lives in a traumatic accident at work. That is 187 too many. That is in itself a human tragedy. But if you look at the other forms of the way in which work impacts upon people's lives and the other ways in which people can contract injury and disease from work, such as muscular skeletal disorders, mental disorders, infectious diseases, respiratory diseases—and I am going to come back to that in a moment—and cardiovascular diseases, when you look at all of that and the way in which work interacts with our lives, the number of people who are injured and lose their lives as a result of work actually measures in the thousands of people each year. They are the statistics that are not recorded. They are the people who are not seen in this debate.


Perhaps the most vivid example of that is those people who have contracted mesothelioma as a result of their work. It is estimated, when it is all said and done, that 60,000 Australians will lose their lives as a result of work related exposure to asbestos. It is the same number of Australians who lost their lives in the First World War. This is tragedy on a gargantuan stale. It is something that we need to be vigilant about and to address each and every day. There is nothing more unfair than a person being harmed at work.


All of us expect that, when we and our loved ones—children, brothers and sisters—go to work each day, we and they will return at the end of that day. That is a fundamental expectation of our working lives. My concern with this piece of legislation is that this will not assist that. In fact, it will take a massive step backwards in seeing that expectation met.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (11:49):  This morning was an opportunity to hear Labor's point of view on this bill, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, which significantly reduces economic burden in the area safety, rehabilitation and compensation. We listened to someone who is arguably the nicest guy in the union movement still give a fairly opaque elaboration of exactly what his opposition is to this bill. We cannot make it any simpler: we are making it easier for corporations around the country that currently have to deal with up to eight different workplace health and safety arrangements such that they will now only have to deal with one. That is such an improvement in the system. It really is incumbent on the other side of this chamber to clearly articulate their concern with that change.


Many of us suspect it is just about how many more union free rides they can get in the state based schemes. That is the suspicion. We are really asking those on the other side of the chamber to crawl out from under the union log and tell us exactly what their concern is with what is an incredibly streamlined and common-sense approach. Within days of the Labor Party being elected to government in 2007, they instantly froze any possibility that a corporation that currently straddles multiple states and territories could apply for a streamlined federal system. The minute we came back into power, we unlocked that because we know it is complete common sense. We owe it to those in the gallery who have travelled from all around the country and are listening to this debate and those listening to the broadcast to tell them exactly why this is not a great idea.


The previous speaker spent half of his contribution to this debate on asbestos and mesothelioma. Of course everyone on both sides of the chamber would hate to see any system where an individual is placed at risk of such a horrible disease. Every injury and death in the workplace is one too many. But, with respect, that is not what this is all about. There may well be 44 people working in Comcare who are responsible for making sure corporations and current members of the system are compliant. But, by definition, the more that join Comcare the more offices they will have. There will be an appropriate number of officers to do the job. By definition, those payers—those people who purchase a licence and self-insure under the Comcare scheme—become part of a larger pool, and therefore you have more people enforcing it. That really is a straw man argument.


But the bigger one really is—and it was just alluded to by the previous speaker—the desire of the union movement to be picking and crawling all over corporations in the guise of being cops on the beat. Now hang on a moment. We have law enforcement agencies all around the country. Last time I checked, it was not the union movement that we have commissioned with the role of crawling all over corporations and calling themselves cops on the beat. No, that is not what they are there for; they are there to look after the interests of a worker. When it comes to corporations who are licence holders under an act like this, there are federal entities responsible for that job. With the greatest respect, it is not up to the union movement to be coming into workplaces without an invitation, kicking tyres and making a nuisance of themselves. I know they got used to it over the last six years, but they are not cops on the beat; they are unions, and that is a very, very different entity. They need to be reminded of that after six years of pretty much doing their own thing without any control at all from a federal government.


We are trying to reduce this regulatory burden. It is absolutely common sense that relatively small corporations that currently have to compete with Comcare in many cases should not face that competitive issue; there should be competitive neutrality. If an entity is currently competing with that Commonwealth provider then under this act they should have the right to be able to apply for a licence.


So, currently, under the SRC Act you can either be a premium payer, which is all of your Commonwealth and ACT entities, or a small number of ADF personnel who are injured in nonoperational service prior to 2004. But, for those that are corporations, we have crawled over this issue a number of times, and even while we had Labor in government we had inquiries recommending that it be open to corporations. So hang on, these are not paid up members of the Liberal Party; these are the highest level thinkers in this space, and I am not just talking about 2011 or 2012. This is going back to 1994, 1995. In the absolute ascendancy of the then Hawke-Keating Labor government was a finding we needed more harmonisation between state arrangements. With credit due to the previous Labor government, there were workplace health and safety model laws that were enacted in 2011, and that was absolutely fine. Unfortunately Victoria, Western Australia and now Queensland are touching on possibly changing these laws, which will mean that entrance to the scheme under licence will have to still retain some form of compliance in their own states.


But this ultimately, for the 43 per cent of entities that are licence holders, needs to be made easier for them to be part of this scheme. Labor's argument that they cannot possibly all be enforced is a spurious one because, as any arrangement builds, so too will the number of enforcement agencies. What we are talking about on labour site access to common law is really just an excuse for the trojan horse of being able to have unions still be able to pick over these corporations and their great fear that once they come out of state based schemes they cannot agitate and they cannot be a constant annoyance to corporations who are fundamentally doing the right thing. If unions have a concern that they are not, there are entities to which these corporations should be reported. That is how it works; that is how the real world works. It does not work with union people trying to find their way into lunch break tearooms, sort of hanging around the coffee table and trying and drum up membership. Financial issues aside, that is not making the workplace a safer place whatsoever.


As early as the mid 1990s, this sort of legislation should have been in evolution and was recommended. We had a 2004 inquiry by the Productivity Commission; we had a Comcare review performed in 2008, including the Taylor-Fry actuarial report; and very briefly and most recently, as I said, there was a review of the SRC Act, performed in 2012-13 and undertaken by Peter Hanks and Allan Hawke, reviewing both the compensation benefit structures and the scheme's performance and in particular governance and financial frameworks. They have consulted those two individuals extensively. You do not have to take one side of parliament's word on this; they have worked with the participants of Comcare scheme and developed these recommendations which clearly say to both sides of this chamber that what we need is a system that allows these new entrants who are choosing to self insure, who are carrying both the risks and benefits and are saying, 'We want to work to reduce within our workplaces the call on workers compensation by having world standards and, in turn, we want our premium to reflect that.'


The great challenge of staying in some of the state based schemes unable to have this say is you are, effectively, paying premiums that cover the transgressions of other corporations and entities. A self-insurer simply says: 'I may be big, I may be small, but I am going to take that risk. I am going to take the actuarial risk, cover my workers and have world-class safety arrangements in place, and we will reap the benefits ultimately by being self-insured and paying lower premiums.' But it is not about lower premiums; it is about lower calls on the SRC system. It is about fewer people requiring workers compensation, because we have world-class safety in our workplaces.


This is a common-sense piece of legislation. It is extraordinary that the other side not only opposes it but really cannot tell you any good reason why they oppose it except, as we suggest, they all just want a few more free lunches for union members. I know that drives them and it drives their preselection, but ultimately this is about corporations and entities that cross state borders being able to pick up the risks and the costs of self-insurance to do that, to remove the need for a minister to be able to determine if you are eligible, to simply be able to apply to the SRCC. This is common-sense, red tape removing legislation and something that not just this side but both sides of the chamber should be supporting.

"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (11:03):  I rise in continuation on my contribution to the debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. For example, each bank guarantee requires a separate actuarial report with different requirements set by each jurisdiction, and there are numerous differences between jurisdictions in taking out a reinsurance policy. In their submission to the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry, Pacific National claimed that national based insurance potentially represented a saving of between 50 per cent and 70 per cent on recurrent financial costs alone. Productivity and savings would also be realised through the capacity for an employer to standardise, centralise and streamline claims management functions.


Each jurisdictional scheme requires self-insurers to demonstrate adequate procedures for managing workers compensation claims. Self-insurers are required to demonstrate that they employ qualified staff and engage certified scheme service providers. This is to ensure that employees of self-insurers have their claims managed in a professional manner in accordance with the different scheme benefit structures. Most jurisdictions require self-insurers to have claims managers located in that jurisdiction.


A number of self-insurers have noted that this prevents them from operating a centralised claims management centre which would reduce claims management costs. For example, CSR in 2004 estimated that it would save $150,000 per annum if it could have a single claims management centre. Operating under one scheme also means having a uniform set of benefits and rules across all employees, which ensures equality amongst workers. Multistate self-insurers are required to have detailed knowledge of up to eight different claims management and benefit structures. IT systems to manage different payment structures are expensive and time consuming, given the complexities involved in the benefit calculation processes and variations between jurisdictions.


WHS regulations apply to all employers, irrespective of whether or not they self-insure; however added requirements are placed upon self-insurers to demonstrate through audit that they have appropriate WHS management systems. These systems and audit processes differ between the schemes, adding additional costs for multistate employers. Costs associated with complying with various WHS requirements exacerbated with the additional expense of multiple audits and differences between audit requirements. This makes it difficult and costly for multistate employers to develop uniform WHS management systems. For example, Woolworths has different WHS management systems in each jurisdiction due to the difficulty in developing a single WHS management process that meets different jurisdictional requirements. Woolworths estimate a saving of approximately $400,000 per annum if they had a single national WHS management system.


Self-insurers are required to pay an application fee and ongoing levies for each licence These fees and charges include the recovery of self-insurance application administration costs and contributions to WHS functions. For corporations who operate in multiple jurisdictions, there may be unnecessary replication in the payment of some component of these fees and concern with regard to the variance in these fees despite a similar number of employees covered by each licence. Self-Insurers are required to supply data to the regulator. The collection of data imposes costs on multistate self-insurers, because each scheme requires a different data set and software to supply the data; thus preventing self-insurers from operating an integrated computer system to satisfy multistate scheme requirements.


Another significant amendment presented in this bill is the enabling of the SRCC to grant a single licence for self-insurance through the Comcare scheme for a related group of companies. Under current arrangements a corporation cannot apply for a group self-insurance licence under Comcare, so each entity in the group must apply separately for a licence. The introduction of group licences will reduce red tape and cost for employers, as it recognises that groups of interrelated corporations often share return-to-work and work health and safety systems within the group.


A significant barrier preventing harmonisation of workers compensation scheme has been the lack of an integrated national work health and safety framework. In March 2007 occupational health and safety coverage was provided for all Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act licensees. However, with the enactment of the Commonwealth WHS Act 2011 new entrants to the Comcare scheme from 1 January 2012 did not have coverage for WHS purposes. This meant that Comcare self-insurers lost the advantage of truly uniform WHS laws and the reduced compliance costs and administrative efficiency that this brings. This change was introduced in anticipation of national harmonisation of work health and safety laws, which has not occurred in Victoria and Western Australia, resulting in multistate employers continuing to operate under varying schemes.


This bill also seeks to excludes workers compensation claims for injuries that occur during recess breaks away from an employer's premises. Under current arrangements, compensation is payable for injuries occurring during recess breaks even if the employee is not at the place of work when the injury occurs. Under the proposed amendments, injuries occurring when a worker is away from the workplace and is not undertaking work related activities will not be compensated. If workers are undertaking activities associated with their employment, or at the request or direction of the employer during a recess, they will still be covered. Workers who are injured at work even while having a recess or lunch break will remain fully covered.


The bill will also exclude access to workers compensation when a worker engages in a serious and wilful misconduct even if the injury results in death or serious and permanent impairment. As the minister outlined in his second reading speech:


While claims in this category are rare, the Australian public rightly expects that employees should take personal responsibility for their actions. 


It is crucial that any workers compensation scheme is geared towards people acting in a proper and safe manner and does not include a safety net for people who break the rules and put themselves and other employees at risk.


This government will ensure that employers under Comcare will operate under a single workers compensation and WHS scheme. Eligible corporations will have access to Comcare's workers compensation and WHS regime. This will reduce red tape, jurisdictional inconsistency and maximise equity for employees in terms of injury management, compensation and return to work. This will also enable these corporations to achieve an integrated approach to prevention, rehabilitation and return to work. The proposed reforms under this bill will be better for businesses, better for workers and better for the economy.



Eligible multijurisdictional corporations will have the opportunity to realise efficiencies and savings from becoming a self-insurer under a single jurisdiction—hence, capitalising on the ability to invest and expand nationally as a result of coverage under a single regime. The Taylor Fry report in examining the financial arrangements for self-insurers under the Comcare scheme stated there would be:



M
inimal impacts on the state and territory workers
'
 compensation schemes if private
 corporations
 were to join the Comcare scheme as self-insurers.

This was consistent with the 2004 Productivity Commission report. I commend this bill to the House. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (11:11):  I find it very interesting to follow the member for Dobell in this debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I note that she worked for WorkCover prior to becoming elected to parliament. The context of her speech and the direction of her speech was all about reducing costs, about efficiency, about the cost of compliance, about the cutting of red tape, about the cost to employers and the cost to insurers, and there was really no mention about providing support for injured workers. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation was introduced into this country, into the various states in our Commonwealth, to provide cover for workers who are injured at work. While she talked about employees or workers taking personal responsibility for their action, there was no talk about employers taking responsibility for the action that they take.


I think the member for Dobell's contribution really puts this debate in context. We have one side of the House, the side that I sit on, that is really concerned about ensuring that workers are properly protected if they are injured at work, and you have the other side of this parliament that is all about reducing cost to employers and reducing cost to insurers to enable them to make a greater profit at the expense of injured workers. That really puts it in context and it probably goes across the divide when you look at a number of issues. We are about people, we are about workers and we are about seeing that people have proper coverage, whilst the other side of this House is about ensuring that those that employ, or those that are in big business, can actually make a substantial profit.


I see this legislation as another attack on workers by a government that very much has a hidden agenda to undermine workers' rights, to undermine workers' conditions and to undermine workers' protection in the workplace. The government has history in relation to this. Under the Howard government, I was a member of the House committee that did a review into workers compensation laws, and the agenda that the then government had in relation to workers compensation was very obvious.


There has been a gradual whittling away of protection if you look at other jurisdictions. I cannot help but look to New South Wales, which is my home state, where the O'Farrell government introduced the most draconian changes to workers compensation legislation that I have ever seen. I have had worker after worker coming into my office telling me how they have got no coverage now and how they are unable to have that operation that they were scheduled to have because of the timing, as the changes have been put in place retrospectively. Most changes to workers' compensation, in both New South Wales and this jurisdiction, have not been retrospective—the changes take place from the date they are introduced. In New South Wales, they cover everybody that is on workers' compensation. It really shows the agenda of the Liberal and National parties on workers' compensation.


I used to be a rehabilitation counsellor before I came to this parliament, and in that job I worked with injured workers, with insurance companies and with employers. The aim of my job was to get people back into the workforce, preferably with their previous employer, and to have the workplace modified so they could return to their job and, maybe after rehabilitation, go back to full duties. During that time a number of obstacles were put in the path of those workers. Employers were reluctant to take them back into their workplace and insurance companies did not provide the support that they needed. If you provide the maximum of support you have the best opportunity for a good outcome, but walking away from workers leaves them in a situation where they cannot have the optimal outcome.


This government's agenda is very questionable when it comes to anything relating to workers' compensation, wages, workers' rights, workers' pay or workers' conditions. I believe this legislation before the parliament is just another step down the track of this government's antiworker agenda. The bill amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Work Health and Safety Act to expand the eligibility of corporations to self-insure through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme, which will allow companies operating across state borders to self-insure under the scheme. It also removes the need for the minister to declare eligibility to apply for a self-insure licence while maintaining the ability of the minister to issue directions to the Safety and Rehabilitation Commissioner, and it enables corporations currently required to meet workers' compensation obligations under two or more workers' compensation laws of a state to apply to the commission to join the Comcare scheme. It also allows a Commonwealth authority that ceases to be a Commonwealth authority to apply directly to the commission for approval to be a self-insurer. This, along with other changes, enables the commissioner to grant group licences to related corporations. I feel these changes have not been properly thought through and I do not think there will be proper oversight of the changes that will take place.


The government has refused to guarantee that no worker will be worse off. I have shared with the House the New South Wales experience where practically every worker is worse off, and now we have another Liberal-National Party government set to deliver a blow to workers, refusing to say that workers will not be worse off. For those on the other side of this parliament, it is not all about the worker that will be injured in the workplace, it is not all about ensuring that they can get the best possible outcome—rather it is about, as the member for Dobell mentioned, cost-cutting, efficiency, compliance, cutting red tape and reducing costs for employers. A person seriously injured at work will never be able to undertake life as it was—their life is changed forever. One of the most common complaints from those on the other side of the House relates to people who have a back injury. If you are a manual worker who has very limited literacy skills and you injure your back, then not only has your work been taken away from you but you probably have very limited opportunity to find another job and then every other aspect of your life is changed. That is what those on the other side of this House do not get. I do not see anything in this legislation that will assure Australians that workplaces will be as safe as they are now. Nothing that speakers on the other side of this House have said convinces me of that. Rather, I hear about things such as reducing costs, efficiency, compliance and reducing red tape—nothing about ensuring that workplaces throughout Australia are safe, about ensuring that workers are not seriously injured, about ensuring that workers do not lose their lives when they are working on a building site or in a mine. In the electorate that I represent workers in both those sorts of workplaces have lost their lives.


I see this government as bowing to the interests of big business. The government just not does not consider the impact of injury, disability and death. When it does open up the scheme, it will reduce the financial impact in the state systems and it will increase premiums for the remaining businesses in those schemes, adding pressure on workers' entitlements. It will leave sick workers worse off. If we go back to look at what workers compensation is about, it is compensating workers for injury at work. It is doing something to help them adjust to the fact that they went to work, they were seriously injured and they cannot go back to the work they did. They are worse off physically and now this scheme, I believe, will leave sick workers worse off in every aspect of their lives.


This is a really important point: the compliance obligations under Comcare are weaker than in the state systems. Comcare offers lower payments to injured workers, and Comcare's capacity to inspect workplaces and enforce laws will be reduced further as more businesses gain coverage. Comcare has only 44 inspectors nationwide—44 inspectors nationwide that are supposed to ensure that workplaces are safe—whilst each state based scheme has hundreds of inspectors working to ensure that workplaces meet their safety requirements. I find it extremely concerning that there is nothing in this legislation that places any obligation on employers and insurers to ensure that workplaces are made safe. There is no hint that the number of inspectors will be expanded and no hint that this government has any concern for injured workers.


I know the shadow minister has moved an amendment, and I know that the shadow minister is very, very concerned about the issues that I have raised. I note that workers will not be covered during breaks, and I also note that examples have been given of workers that take a break whilst working at a job that takes them outside their workplace, and I do not think that question has been answered. I believe there are a number of questions that this government has not answered. Rather, it is legislating to ensure that its ideological, philosophical hatred of workers and its enslavement to big business are enshrined in legislation rather than trying to put on the table fair legislation that will benefit both workers and employers—and, then, insurers as well. I find I cannot support this legislation. It is bad legislation, and it is typical of this Abbott government. (Time expired)

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (11:26):  I rise today to speak on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill, which seeks to address aspects of the existing legislation which cause multistate corporations undue compliance costs. This government accepted a mandate from the Australian people to build a strong and prosperous economy. The coalition has committed itself to stewarding the wealth of this nation responsibly, wisely and in such a way as to create increased employment, greater benefit and greater security for everyday Australians. In short, the coalition is committed to cleaning up Labor's budget mess—a mess of inefficiencies.


When we are dealing with taxpayers' money it is simply unacceptable to see funds wasted on the impediment of unnecessary regulation and poor management. This amendment bill is not about making life more difficult for employees working for multistate corporations or about complicating workers' guarantee of adequate and fair protection in the case of compensation for injuries sustained. It seeks more responsible management and a simplification of a potentially complicated system of workers compensation. This bill seeks to amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 to expand the eligibility of corporations to self-insure through the Commonwealth's Comcare scheme.


To really grasp what this bill intends, we need to look back at the recent history with regard to this legislation. Employers operating in multiple states have been required to operate according to different workers compensation schemes and work health and safety regulations in each jurisdiction around Australia. This means red tape for employers and confusion, often, for workers subject to different regulations and benefits from their colleagues, depending on which state or territory they are employed in. This House is aware that certain private sector corporations have in the past been able to self-insure for workers compensation coverage through the Commonwealth Comcare scheme. There has been much to-ing and fro-ing over this particular aspect of the bill, when Productivity Commission inquiries and consultation with local state governments have indicated it could be streamlined to the benefit of businesses and employees alike.


The coalition Howard government responded to Productivity Commission inquiry recommendations by allowing eligible private corporations that operated in multiple states to apply for a self-insurance licence with the Comcare scheme. The intention of this action was that costs might be used more effectively to create new jobs, while simultaneously upholding improved safety standards within the enterprise. A moratorium on new corporations entering the Comcare scheme was imposed in 2007 by Labor, despite evidence from the 2004 Productivity Commission inquiry into National workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks, which found the compliance costs for multistate employers concerning multiple state workers compensation arrangements were significant. Currently 30 licensed corporations benefit from the reduced costs of having one set of workers compensation arrangements for the national workforce. Among these are former Commonwealth authorities such as Australia Post and Telstra, and private corporations such as Optus, TNT, the National Australia Bank and the John Holland Group. The results speak for themselves. Since joining the Comcare scheme, the work health and safety performance of these companies has almost universal improved in significant proportions. Under the Comcare scheme, companies with reduced bureaucracies are enabled to operate more effectively with their employees in improving work health and safety in their organisations.


Despite the success of Comcare, the previous, Labor government acted to ban multistate companies from joining the scheme. Labor commissioned a review, led by its own Dr Allan Hawke AC, which gave the recommendation to lift this moratorium, given the huge expense and inefficiency of insuring in multiple states and territories. Labor failed to follow its own advice, an oversight largely influenced by pressure from the union bosses. Apparently, neither the employment minister nor the workplace relations minister of the previous government had the wherewithal to fully address the needs of the workforce in this area and ensure the right decisions were made.


It makes sense to place these corporations and employees under one scheme across multiple states so that regulatory costs are kept to a minimum. What might be done with the funds that are spared the black hole of our red-tape-hugging former Labor government? New jobs, improved standards of safety, further economic growth. Accordingly, the coalition government lifted the moratorium in December 2013 in order that multistate employers performing to meet rigorous financial and governance criteria and demonstrating suitable work health and safety performance may apply for a licence to self-insure in the Comcare scheme, as opposed to dealing with multiple schemes. It is good to mention here that this government also intends to allow multistate employers to choose to apply to self-insure for workers compensation arrangement with Comcare to also have one set of work health and safety regulations. Thus the objective of this amendment bill before us today is to assist Australian multistate corporations to operate smarter by expanding their ability to self-insure in a standardised federal scheme, Comcare.


The amendments in the bill before this House are specifically the following: firstly, to remove the requirement that the minister declare eligibility to apply for a self-insurance licence, while maintaining the minister's ability to issue directions to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission—this will streamline the current two-stage approval process by removing the requirement that a corporation must be in competition with a Commonwealth authority or former Commonwealth authority to enter the Comcare scheme—and, secondly, to broaden the range of corporations that are eligible for a licence to self-insure under the scheme. 


The first of these amendments, to remove the requirement for the minister to declare eligibility for a corporation to apply for a self-insurance licence, addresses the current, ponderously slow two-stage process. It requires a declaration of eligibility to be granted by the minister before any assessment can be made by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission according to their criteria. Furthermore, it is expensive. Time is always at a premium when it comes to an effective economy; and, since Labor's previous tenure, money is at a higher premium than ever before. Labor's legacy of national debt is costing us $1 billion in interest per month, a burden taxpayers continue to carry, a burden this government is seeking to remove. This amendment will allow the commission to assess applicants' eligibility for a self-insurance licence in one step, while corporations are still exposed to the same stringent financial and governance requirements currently imposed by the commission. 


This directly enables the two major amendments I have listed, aimed at ensuring a robust approval process unimpeded by red tape. The withdrawal of the requirement that corporations be in competition with a Commonwealth authority to enter the Comcare scheme and the determination to include national employers—that is, those corporations meeting workers compensation obligations under two or more states—among the cohorts of corporations deemed eligible to self-insure under the scheme carry considerable anticipated savings and increased efficiencies. The recommendations enacted in this bill are expected to result in a total reduction in the regulatory burden, for those Australian businesses that transfer to the Comcare scheme, of $33 million per year over the next 10 years.


I should clarify that these amendments maintain the freedom of eligible employers to continue under multilayered workers compensation and work health and safety regimes or to apply for one set of national arrangements as they choose. 


This amendment bill is about refining an essential existing piece of legislation for Australian businesses and employees so that it assists rather than impedes economic growth while maintaining high safety standards. In addition to these amendments, measures towards the better management of corporate groups are being addressed in this bill. Currently, corporations applying to be covered under the Comcare scheme must be assessed individually for eligibility. Business has for some time been seeking the introduction of group licences to the SRC Act. 


The amendment bill provides for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to grant a licence to an eligible group of corporations owned by the same holding company, in line with the state schemes and the commercial reality of modern multicompany corporate structures. This bill recognises that groups of interrelated corporations often share return-to-work and work health and safety systems, and that each entity forming part of a group does not individually need to meet the definition of a 'national employer'. It is better for business, better for workers and, indeed, better for the economy.


Ongoing standards for the protection of workers remain a key concern of this government. As with current licences, it is a condition upon the issuing of a licence that the SRC Commission's standards are met with regard to work health and safety. The commission has the ability to vary or revoke a licence if it is not satisfied that this licence condition is being met.


This government is doing all it can to ensure that Comcare has the capacity to manage the increased responsibility in relation to workers compensation and work health and safety, and that it is financially viable. With Comcare being the single work health and safety regulator in the federal jurisdiction under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, Comcare inspectors and case managers have the authority necessary to represent the government in their actions, and greater flexibility in regulatory approaches. The costs of meeting regulatory responsibilities are resourced within the scheme. Regulatory contributions by licences, reflecting the cost incurred by the performance of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and Comcare, effectively fund self-insurance under the scheme.


The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill will save on red tape and streamline multistate corporations' compliance with workers compensation schemes by managing one standardised scheme. The bill is about streamlining and refining a national scheme that will work more effectively for multistate corporation employees. Workers moving onto Comcare will benefit from a nationwide workers compensation scheme that delivers the same coverage and benefits for all employees. This means real savings to business that will be more wisely invested in the larger economy and less confusion for multistate corporation employees. The bill is about building a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (11:37):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. I am speaking in opposition to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. Under the Howard government, reforms were introduced which allowed private national employers to opt into the Comcare scheme, a scheme which has its origins in providing workers compensation to employees of federal government agencies and bodies that have been privatised from the federal government. This was a reform which would allow national employers which had no history with the federal government to become a part of the Comcare scheme by virtue of self-insurance, by doing which they took themselves out of the various states schemes that those companies were a part of. It was a controversial step at the time and there were many concerns with it. As a result, when Labor was elected in 2007 a moratorium was put almost immediately on the practice of issuing licences to national employers seeking to self-insure under the Comcare scheme.


This bill seeks in effect to lift that moratorium so that national employers will be able to self-insure in the Comcare scheme. There is a superficial attraction in such a measure, in the idea of a company being able to be part of one workers compensation scheme rather than many, but there are many aspects of this which, beyond that superficial observation, make it clear that this is a deeply retrograde step.


The first point to make is that there is in place a national employer test for companies to pass which would enable them to become a self-insurer under the Comcare scheme. It is at best a minimal test. All you need to do to satisfy the test is operate in more than one state. There is no requirement about a minimum number of employees but there is a requirement that you self-insure. What you see with self-insurance in any of the state schemes is that it is, by and large, confined to those very large companies which have the capacity to engage in self-insurance, but this on the face of it will be open to any company which simply operate in more than one state. That is a minimal test and it is a real deficiency within this bill.


The second point to make is that there are a number of deficiencies within the Comcare scheme itself. To be fair, the workers compensation schemes that you see around Australia vary and are a reflection, I suppose, of the injury profile of those economies as they have developed over decades. The injury profile of the Comcare scheme has largely been about white-collar work—not entirely but largely—so the scheme is around that kind of work. It is good in that context. But Comcare just was not designed for large national employers which have significant amounts of blue-collar work, which may have entirely different kinds of injuries. As a result, there are significant deficiencies within the Comcare scheme which might apply to those people—for example, access to common law and the provisions within the Comcare scheme which provide for the facilitation of people returning to work. Comcare was designed principally as a scheme for the Australian Public Service. What we are now talking about, if this bill is allowed to pass, is this scheme becoming one which would apply potentially across the board with all the diversity that you see within our economy and all the diversity of injury profiles. That has not been thought about. It was not thought about by Howard's government. It is not being thought about by Tony Abbott. The next point—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Griggs
):  Refer to people by their correct title, please.




Mr Husic:
  The Howard government?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  He is the Prime Minister; he is not Tony Abbott.




Mr MARLES:
  By the Abbott government. I apologise, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker. I thank you for picking me up on that. I look forward to that level of detail being applied to everyone who speaks in this debate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  And it certainly will, Member for Corio!




Mr MARLES:
  Good. I appreciate that. The next point that needs to be made is: what will this do in relation to the state schemes? Workers compensation schemes are a form of insurance. They have a whole lot of actuarial research and assumptions underpinning them. They are based on the full spectrum of companies within a particular state or territory participating within those schemes. If we are now giving larger employers which have the capacity to self-insure the option of leaving state schemes and going into Comcare, this has the potential to have a devastating effect on the financial viability of the schemes within each of the states and territories. The only way in which those schemes will be able to deal with the challenge to their financial viability is to increase premiums. That is the only way they can do it. That is going to hit small and medium business. Small and medium enterprises will pay for the decision to allow large national employers to exit the state schemes and to enter the Comcare scheme on a self-insured basis. That is inevitable consequence of what will happen here. None of that has been thought through by this government, which is why so many of the state and territory jurisdictions oppose this measure. It is because they know what this is going to do to their schemes. Small and medium enterprises, I assure you, will also be very clear in the position they take in respect of this, because this means added cost for them.


The final point—and it seems to me that this is the most significant issue about taking this step—is that with state workers compensation schemes we have inspectorates which have hundreds of people in them. There are hundreds of people going out there and looking at whether or not companies are behaving in a safe way. There are strong police on the beat, if I can put it that way, to make sure that our companies and workplaces are operating in a safe manner.


Comcare have 44 inspectors nationally. If we are going to see these national companies go into this scheme, we are essentially going to see companies go into a scheme where there is no cop on the beat. There will effectively be no cop on the beat. The idea that 44 inspectors are going to be responsible for overseeing significant national companies in the Comcare scheme as envisaged by this amendment is politically ridiculous. This is absolutely retrograde in the steps that it is taking. This will mean that we have people entering a scheme which is essentially not policed or, at the very least, it is not set up to police the kind of national companies with the thousands of employers that they will bring coming into this scheme. None of that has been thought about it either. This is simply picking a policy out of the Work Choices Howard era and putting it into the here and now without thinking about any of the repercussions or consequences associated with it.


What concerns me about this in a bigger sense is that it shows such scant regard, in my view, for the critical issue of safety at work. That is ultimately what we are talking about here. Last year, 187 Australians went to work in the morning and did not return home. They lost their lives in a traumatic accident at work. That is 187 too many. That is in itself a human tragedy. But if you look at the other forms of the way in which work impacts upon people's lives and the other ways in which people can contract injury and disease from work, such as muscular skeletal disorders, mental disorders, infectious diseases, respiratory diseases—and I am going to come back to that in a moment—and cardiovascular diseases, when you look at all of that and the way in which work interacts with our lives, the number of people who are injured and lose their lives as a result of work actually measures in the thousands of people each year. They are the statistics that are not recorded. They are the people who are not seen in this debate.


Perhaps the most vivid example of that is those people who have contracted mesothelioma as a result of their work. It is estimated, when it is all said and done, that 60,000 Australians will lose their lives as a result of work related exposure to asbestos. It is the same number of Australians who lost their lives in the First World War. This is tragedy on a gargantuan stale. It is something that we need to be vigilant about and to address each and every day. There is nothing more unfair than a person being harmed at work.


All of us expect that, when we and our loved ones—children, brothers and sisters—go to work each day, we and they will return at the end of that day. That is a fundamental expectation of our working lives. My concern with this piece of legislation is that this will not assist that. In fact, it will take a massive step backwards in seeing that expectation met.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (11:49):  This morning was an opportunity to hear Labor's point of view on this bill, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, which significantly reduces economic burden in the area safety, rehabilitation and compensation. We listened to someone who is arguably the nicest guy in the union movement still give a fairly opaque elaboration of exactly what his opposition is to this bill. We cannot make it any simpler: we are making it easier for corporations around the country that currently have to deal with up to eight different workplace health and safety arrangements such that they will now only have to deal with one. That is such an improvement in the system. It really is incumbent on the other side of this chamber to clearly articulate their concern with that change.


Many of us suspect it is just about how many more union free rides they can get in the state based schemes. That is the suspicion. We are really asking those on the other side of the chamber to crawl out from under the union log and tell us exactly what their concern is with what is an incredibly streamlined and common-sense approach. Within days of the Labor Party being elected to government in 2007, they instantly froze any possibility that a corporation that currently straddles multiple states and territories could apply for a streamlined federal system. The minute we came back into power, we unlocked that because we know it is complete common sense. We owe it to those in the gallery who have travelled from all around the country and are listening to this debate and those listening to the broadcast to tell them exactly why this is not a great idea.


The previous speaker spent half of his contribution to this debate on asbestos and mesothelioma. Of course everyone on both sides of the chamber would hate to see any system where an individual is placed at risk of such a horrible disease. Every injury and death in the workplace is one too many. But, with respect, that is not what this is all about. There may well be 44 people working in Comcare who are responsible for making sure corporations and current members of the system are compliant. But, by definition, the more that join Comcare the more offices they will have. There will be an appropriate number of officers to do the job. By definition, those payers—those people who purchase a licence and self-insure under the Comcare scheme—become part of a larger pool, and therefore you have more people enforcing it. That really is a straw man argument.


But the bigger one really is—and it was just alluded to by the previous speaker—the desire of the union movement to be picking and crawling all over corporations in the guise of being cops on the beat. Now hang on a moment. We have law enforcement agencies all around the country. Last time I checked, it was not the union movement that we have commissioned with the role of crawling all over corporations and calling themselves cops on the beat. No, that is not what they are there for; they are there to look after the interests of a worker. When it comes to corporations who are licence holders under an act like this, there are federal entities responsible for that job. With the greatest respect, it is not up to the union movement to be coming into workplaces without an invitation, kicking tyres and making a nuisance of themselves. I know they got used to it over the last six years, but they are not cops on the beat; they are unions, and that is a very, very different entity. They need to be reminded of that after six years of pretty much doing their own thing without any control at all from a federal government.


We are trying to reduce this regulatory burden. It is absolutely common sense that relatively small corporations that currently have to compete with Comcare in many cases should not face that competitive issue; there should be competitive neutrality. If an entity is currently competing with that Commonwealth provider then under this act they should have the right to be able to apply for a licence.


So, currently, under the SRC Act you can either be a premium payer, which is all of your Commonwealth and ACT entities, or a small number of ADF personnel who are injured in nonoperational service prior to 2004. But, for those that are corporations, we have crawled over this issue a number of times, and even while we had Labor in government we had inquiries recommending that it be open to corporations. So hang on, these are not paid up members of the Liberal Party; these are the highest level thinkers in this space, and I am not just talking about 2011 or 2012. This is going back to 1994, 1995. In the absolute ascendancy of the then Hawke-Keating Labor government was a finding we needed more harmonisation between state arrangements. With credit due to the previous Labor government, there were workplace health and safety model laws that were enacted in 2011, and that was absolutely fine. Unfortunately Victoria, Western Australia and now Queensland are touching on possibly changing these laws, which will mean that entrance to the scheme under licence will have to still retain some form of compliance in their own states.


But this ultimately, for the 43 per cent of entities that are licence holders, needs to be made easier for them to be part of this scheme. Labor's argument that they cannot possibly all be enforced is a spurious one because, as any arrangement builds, so too will the number of enforcement agencies. What we are talking about on labour site access to common law is really just an excuse for the trojan horse of being able to have unions still be able to pick over these corporations and their great fear that once they come out of state based schemes they cannot agitate and they cannot be a constant annoyance to corporations who are fundamentally doing the right thing. If unions have a concern that they are not, there are entities to which these corporations should be reported. That is how it works; that is how the real world works. It does not work with union people trying to find their way into lunch break tearooms, sort of hanging around the coffee table and trying and drum up membership. Financial issues aside, that is not making the workplace a safer place whatsoever.


As early as the mid 1990s, this sort of legislation should have been in evolution and was recommended. We had a 2004 inquiry by the Productivity Commission; we had a Comcare review performed in 2008, including the Taylor-Fry actuarial report; and very briefly and most recently, as I said, there was a review of the SRC Act, performed in 2012-13 and undertaken by Peter Hanks and Allan Hawke, reviewing both the compensation benefit structures and the scheme's performance and in particular governance and financial frameworks. They have consulted those two individuals extensively. You do not have to take one side of parliament's word on this; they have worked with the participants of Comcare scheme and developed these recommendations which clearly say to both sides of this chamber that what we need is a system that allows these new entrants who are choosing to self insure, who are carrying both the risks and benefits and are saying, 'We want to work to reduce within our workplaces the call on workers compensation by having world standards and, in turn, we want our premium to reflect that.'


The great challenge of staying in some of the state based schemes unable to have this say is you are, effectively, paying premiums that cover the transgressions of other corporations and entities. A self-insurer simply says: 'I may be big, I may be small, but I am going to take that risk. I am going to take the actuarial risk, cover my workers and have world-class safety arrangements in place, and we will reap the benefits ultimately by being self-insured and paying lower premiums.' But it is not about lower premiums; it is about lower calls on the SRC system. It is about fewer people requiring workers compensation, because we have world-class safety in our workplaces.


This is a common-sense piece of legislation. It is extraordinary that the other side not only opposes it but really cannot tell you any good reason why they oppose it except, as we suggest, they all just want a few more free lunches for union members. I know that drives them and it drives their preselection, but ultimately this is about corporations and entities that cross state borders being able to pick up the risks and the costs of self-insurance to do that, to remove the need for a minister to be able to determine if you are eligible, to simply be able to apply to the SRCC. This is common-sense, red tape removing legislation and something that not just this side but both sides of the chamber should be supporting.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (11:59):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 145, treaties tabled on 26 August and 2 September 2014.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




WYATT ROY:
  by leave—Today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report 145. The report contains the committee's views on three proposed treaties: the force posture agreement between Australia and the United States, the agreement between Australia and Japan for the transfer of defence equipment and technology and the agreement between Australia and the US for the sharing of visa and immigration information.


The force posture initiatives were announced in 2011 to support our efforts to deepen our long-standing alliance with the United States. The initiatives involve the annual rotation of the US Marines Corps and United States Air Force personnel in northern Australia. This year's rotation involved approximately 1,500 personnel and that number will grow to over 2,500 personnel in the coming years. The regular influx of United States personnel is expected to provide a considerable economic benefits of the Northern Territory and Australia, particularly with regard to the retail, transport, recreation and other service sectors.


The force posture agreement provides the legal, policy and financial framework required for the full implementation of the two force posture initiatives. For example, the agreement requires respect for Australian sovereignty and laws. It imposes obligations for consultation. It also states that initiatives will occur at Australian facilities, consistent with Australia's long-standing policy that there are no foreign military bases on Australian soil. It provides certainty around the conditions for US access to Australian-owned facilities, as well as types of activities the US forces will be able to conduct. The force posture initiatives represent an important new element in our defence cooperation with the United States and reaffirms our commitment to that alliance.


The agreement with Japan for the transfer of defence equipment and technology will facilitate Australian access to Japan's world-renowned capability in this area. The agreement will allow Australia's Defence Science and Technology Organisation and Japan's Technical Research and Development Institute to work together more closely on areas of common interest and mutual benefit. The treaty is part of the broader move to deepen Australia-Japan defence cooperation in a range of areas, including in training and exercises, personnel exchanges, maritime security and peacekeeping.


The agreement with the US to share visa and immigration information is required to allow the automation of the existing immigration information sharing process. The process involves the exchange of fingerprints for checking against each country's respective biometric data holdings. The automation of the process is expected to increase the speed, efficiency and volume of that exchange. Currently, the US and Australia exchange up to 20,000 fingerprints a year. If there is a fingerprint match, then agreed biographic information, immigration history and travel information is exchanged. Such matches have uncovered identity and immigration fraud. When fully implemented, this automation system is expected to allow us to exchange in excess of one million fingerprints with the US per year for checking.


The committee supports the ratification of all of these treaties discussed in this report. On behalf the committee, I commend the report to the House.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (12:03):  by leave—On report No. 145 from the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I concur with the remarks made by the chair of the committee. I thank the chair, other members of the committee and the committee secretariat for the work that they have done in preparing this report.


I did want to make some remarks about chapter 4 of the report, which is the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America for the sharing of visa and immigration information. This agreement is required for the automation of the existing immigration information sharing process. This automation is expected to enable increased speed, efficiency and volumes of exchanges. The present arrangements with the United States have enabled up to 20,000 fingerprints per year to be sent for checking. In the event that there is a fingerprint match, then agreed biographic information, immigration history and travel information is exchanged with the country that had the match. Such matches have in the past uncovered identity and immigration fraud.


This is important. Frankly, the extent of immigration fraud is not widely appreciated. Indeed, there were very serious reports in August this year that visa fraud is widespread, but it is not being investigated because the Department of Immigration's investigation and enforcement capacity has collapsed. It has been reported that as many as nine in 10 skilled migrant visas may be fraudulent and that there was a Somali people smuggling cell in Melbourne, which was linked to a terrorist suspect; but the investigation into that ceased due to lack of resources. Meaningful investigations and prosecution activity of migration fraud in the Melbourne office has effectively ceased. A 2010 investigation concluded that around 90 per cent or more of 40,000 fees applications in the general skilled migration program lodged per year for the previous three years were suspect. A 2009 investigation concluded that the student visa program was failing, the general skilled migration program was failing and the falsification of qualifications was prolific.


A key problem is that since 2004 the migration program has skyrocketed that the resources of the department have not increased to keep pace with that. The permanent program has gone up from 100,000 at that time to 240,000 now and we have over one million people in Australia on temporary visas who have work rights. It is simply beyond the department to check the validity of the claims that people are making about their qualifications and work experience. It is apparently even beyond the capacity of the department to close down passport swapping scams—this is not Operation Sovereign Borders; this is operation open borders! I think we need a parliamentary inquiry to look at this. We should learn from these reports that it is better to put real effort into educating and training young Australians and making sure that we have labour market testing for employers so that young Australian graduates and young Australians who are unemployed are offered the jobs before we look overseas.


In fact, I have asked the Minister for Immigration to investigate the reports in The Age of 8 August this year, which were that a corrupt Department of Immigration official helped run a $3 million criminal migration racket involving more than 1,000 fraudulent visa applications. I have asked whether it is correct that the government has issued new licences in the past six months to migration agents who were previously identified by the Department of Immigration as having bribed employers to obtain fake work references for visa applicants. I have asked whether the government will review these licences with a view to withdrawing them. So these are serious issues. In October 2009, a departmental report made the startling finding that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship may have been responsible for granting a record number of student visas to people who may not be considered genuine students, as well as granting permanent residence to skilled migration applicants who did not have the skills being claimed. I hope that these very serious matters will be given the attention they deserve, and I think the House for the opportunity to make these brief remarks.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:08):  I rise today to support the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014 on behalf of the opposition. This support is founded in support for economic growth through export trade and our small and medium-sized businesses. Labor is committed to expanding Australia's international trading opportunities to generate jobs and growth for the future, and this bill is broadly consistent with that objective.


This bill is similar to, but not as extensive or ambitious as, Labor's prior bill that lapsed at the end of last year: the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (New Mandate and Other Measures) Bill 2013. It is disappointing that the government has failed to reach the same level of ambition in its re-engineered version of this lapsed bill.


Labor's record with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation goes back to its establishment. In 1991, the Hawke Labor government passed the original Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill to re-establish the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, known as the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This original bill established the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation as an independent statutory corporation separate from Austrade, offering competitive export credit facilities for Australian exporters.


The origins of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation were grounded in a report to the Hawke Government by the Departments of Industry, Technology and Commerce; Foreign Affairs and Trade; Primary Industries and Energy; Treasury; Finance; and the Prime Minister and Cabinet on the effectiveness of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and its export finance and insurance services. The scope of the number of government departments involved is illustrative of the reach of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's activities and the importance of export markets across the Australian economy.


The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is Australia's well respected export credit agency. Its mission is to provide finance and insurance support to assist Australian exporters to grow their international businesses in circumstances where there are gaps in, or constraints on, the private market financial sector. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's operations are subject to requirements in both the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act and the minister's Statement of Expectations. We are pleased to note that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation still today operates under the minister's Statement of Expectations issued by Labor's former Minister for Trade, Dr Craig Emerson.


Over the years, Labor governments have guided the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and have sought to keep its operations efficient with changing markets. On 1 September 2011, the then Assistant Treasurer and now opposition leader, Mr Shorten, released the terms of reference for the Productivity Commission inquiry into the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The inquiry considered the role for government involvement in the provision of export credits, insurance, reinsurance and other financial services. It also considered the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's funding arrangements, capital adequacy requirements and the interaction between the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's operations and other government programs, international agencies and the private sector. After extensive consultation and deliberation, the Productivity Commission delivered its report, which contained multiple recommendations in relation to the Efic's operation. The Labor government accepted the majority of these recommendations and introduced two bills to amend the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act. One bill passed in 2013 and is currently in effect. The other bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued ahead of the last election.


It is good to see that the current government has picked up the substance and spirit of this former Labor bill. However, as previously noted, it is disappointing that the government's re-engineered version is not quite as ambitious. The bill only has two principal changes, only one of which was recommended by the Productivity Commission. These changes are the widening of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's direct lending function to all goods, not just capital goods; and the widening of the competitive neutrality provisions as recommended by the Productivity Commission.


In relation to the impact on small to medium-sized enterprises, the Minister for Trade and Investment and the Minister for Small Business put out a media release on 8 October 2014 entitled 'EFIC's renewed focus on SMEs to boost jobs and growth'. The statement said:


… Export Finance and Insurance Corporation … will be refocused to increase its capacity to finance small and medium sized businesses seeking to capitalise on global trade opportunities.


If there is any refocusing, it is not stated in the bill before the chamber. In Labor's lapsed bill, we saw fit to clearly legislate a requirement that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation focus its activities towards small and medium enterprises because Labor is a party that supports small business. It is not a party that talks up SMEs but remains buried in the coat pocket of big business. Labor's record on small business is a very good record and one that we are proud of. In government, Labor supported and established a range of programs to assist small businesses to expand their trade and export opportunities.


The Export Market Development Grants scheme is a terrific example. The scheme offered financial assistance for small and medium businesses in a wide range of industry sectors and products. The scheme reimbursed up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenses above $10,000, provided that the total expenses were at least $20,000, and it provided up to seven grants to each eligible applicant.


To boost business links with Asia, Labor established the Asian century business engagement grants for Australian business organisations to improve links with Asia and help broaden their reach into emerging business centres.


The TradeStart program was another platform to assist small- and medium-sized enterprises to achieve long-term success in international business. The Women in Global Business program was established to provide support to women involved in export related activities, offering networking, training and business assistance to increase female participation in international trade and investment, delivering increased economic benefit and job creation through greater diversity. Labor created the Anti-Dumping Commission within the Australian Customs Service to ensure our anti-dumping and countervailing system was strong and robust. These programs were designed to assist small businesses to be export ready and provide them with the tools they need to grow their business and market opportunities internationally.


It is a shame that Labor's legislative mandate to focus on SMEs was not taken up by the coalition in its re-engineered version of this bill. Indeed, the government has shown in many areas that its rhetoric of support for small business is not matched by action. For example, the Prime Minister and his Minister for Small Business demonstrated the little regard they have for Australia's two million small businesses by removing Labor's small business tax concessions, the tax loss carry-back and the instant asset write-off provisions, plus the special depreciation rules for motor vehicles. This will be a significant cost to small businesses across Australia, with the government cutting more than $5 billion of direct tax assistance. Small businesses employ more than five million Australians and are well placed to increase their productivity and employment with the right policy settings. That ought to be a focus of government. Labor initiated and completed many reforms in government to assist these very same small businesses, and in opposition we will continue to support changes that better support small business.


This bill changes the definition of an 'eligible transaction' by replacing the words 'capital goods' with 'goods', and repealing the definition of 'capital goods'. This change now enables the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to provide direct loans in relation to non-capital goods as well as capital goods. Given that only about four percent of Australia's exports are capital goods, the opening up of the remaining 96 per cent of non-capital exports as 'eligible transactions' has the potential to have significant ramifications for the operations of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The government has failed to outline the anticipated increase in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation activity and estimate the expected increase in loans as a result of the changes proposed in this bill. Further, there is no statement from the government on how this change will impact the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's risk profile or profitability, and in turn how this will impact on the government's capital and other funding arrangement with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.


The second substantial amendment affected by this bill is to expand the competitive neutrality provision in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act to encompass all of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's operations. Currently, such provisions only apply to short-term insurance contracts. In practice, this is an outdated theoretical provision as the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation now lists only medium-sized insurance as a product. Previously, however, when it did provide short-term insurance contract products, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation made tax-equivalent payments of $2 million in the 1999-2000 financial year and $0.8 million in the 2000-01 financial year. This amendment was recommended by the Productivity Commission and was included in Labor's lapsed bill.


As a government corporation, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is currently exempt from a number of Commonwealth and state taxes. This exemption has the potential to give the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation a competitive advantage over private sector lending institutions. In its 2012 inquiry report, the Productivity Commission recommended that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation should pay a tax-equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee in order to ensure that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's activity on the commercial account complies with competitive neutrality arrangements. This bill, similar to Labor's prior bill, implements this recommendation. Once implemented, the Minister for Trade and Investment will be able to inform the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in writing of applicable debt neutrality charges or guarantee fees. This will in turn raise revenue for the Commonwealth. Again, however, the government has not provided any additional information on such estimated revenues.


In conclusion, although we are disappointed with the lack of scope and vision in the government's re-engineering of a lapsed Labor bill, Labor does support this Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. We support economic growth through trade and through our small- and medium-sized businesses. These amendments, when coupled with the promised government direction to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to focus on SMEs, have the potential to have a positive impact on exporting small- and medium-sized businesses.

If there is any refocusing, it is not stated in the bill before the chamber. In Labor's lapsed bill, we saw fit to clearly legislate a requirement that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation focus its activities towards small and medium enterprises because Labor is a party that supports small business. It is not a party that talks up SMEs but remains buried in the coat pocket of big business. Labor's record on small business is a very good record and one that we are proud of. In government, Labor supported and established a range of programs to assist small businesses to expand their trade and export opportunities.


The Export Market Development Grants scheme is a terrific example. The scheme offered financial assistance for small and medium businesses in a wide range of industry sectors and products. The scheme reimbursed up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenses above $10,000, provided that the total expenses were at least $20,000, and it provided up to seven grants to each eligible applicant.


To boost business links with Asia, Labor established the Asian century business engagement grants for Australian business organisations to improve links with Asia and help broaden their reach into emerging business centres.


The TradeStart program was another platform to assist small- and medium-sized enterprises to achieve long-term success in international business. The Women in Global Business program was established to provide support to women involved in export related activities, offering networking, training and business assistance to increase female participation in international trade and investment, delivering increased economic benefit and job creation through greater diversity. Labor created the Anti-Dumping Commission within the Australian Customs Service to ensure our anti-dumping and countervailing system was strong and robust. These programs were designed to assist small businesses to be export ready and provide them with the tools they need to grow their business and market opportunities internationally.


It is a shame that Labor's legislative mandate to focus on SMEs was not taken up by the coalition in its re-engineered version of this bill. Indeed, the government has shown in many areas that its rhetoric of support for small business is not matched by action. For example, the Prime Minister and his Minister for Small Business demonstrated the little regard they have for Australia's two million small businesses by removing Labor's small business tax concessions, the tax loss carry-back and the instant asset write-off provisions, plus the special depreciation rules for motor vehicles. This will be a significant cost to small businesses across Australia, with the government cutting more than $5 billion of direct tax assistance. Small businesses employ more than five million Australians and are well placed to increase their productivity and employment with the right policy settings. That ought to be a focus of government. Labor initiated and completed many reforms in government to assist these very same small businesses, and in opposition we will continue to support changes that better support small business.


This bill changes the definition of an 'eligible transaction' by replacing the words 'capital goods' with 'goods', and repealing the definition of 'capital goods'. This change now enables the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to provide direct loans in relation to non-capital goods as well as capital goods. Given that only about four percent of Australia's exports are capital goods, the opening up of the remaining 96 per cent of non-capital exports as 'eligible transactions' has the potential to have significant ramifications for the operations of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The government has failed to outline the anticipated increase in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation activity and estimate the expected increase in loans as a result of the changes proposed in this bill. Further, there is no statement from the government on how this change will impact the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's risk profile or profitability, and in turn how this will impact on the government's capital and other funding arrangement with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.


The second substantial amendment affected by this bill is to expand the competitive neutrality provision in the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act to encompass all of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's operations. Currently, such provisions only apply to short-term insurance contracts. In practice, this is an outdated theoretical provision as the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation now lists only medium-sized insurance as a product. Previously, however, when it did provide short-term insurance contract products, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation made tax-equivalent payments of $2 million in the 1999-2000 financial year and $0.8 million in the 2000-01 financial year. This amendment was recommended by the Productivity Commission and was included in Labor's lapsed bill.


As a government corporation, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is currently exempt from a number of Commonwealth and state taxes. This exemption has the potential to give the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation a competitive advantage over private sector lending institutions. In its 2012 inquiry report, the Productivity Commission recommended that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation should pay a tax-equivalent charge and a debt neutrality fee in order to ensure that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's activity on the commercial account complies with competitive neutrality arrangements. This bill, similar to Labor's prior bill, implements this recommendation. Once implemented, the Minister for Trade and Investment will be able to inform the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in writing of applicable debt neutrality charges or guarantee fees. This will in turn raise revenue for the Commonwealth. Again, however, the government has not provided any additional information on such estimated revenues.


In conclusion, although we are disappointed with the lack of scope and vision in the government's re-engineering of a lapsed Labor bill, Labor does support this Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment (Direct Lending and Other Measures) Bill 2014. We support economic growth through trade and through our small- and medium-sized businesses. These amendments, when coupled with the promised government direction to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to focus on SMEs, have the potential to have a positive impact on exporting small- and medium-sized businesses.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (13:30):  Yesterday in question time we had the unedifying spectacle of the Prime Minister giving us a demonstration in lying about lying. We all know that the night before the election the Prime Minister promised the Australian people that there would be no cuts the ABC and no cuts to the SBS. Those opposite were elected on this platform of no cuts the ABC or the SBS. They have betrayed that trust with their local communities.


That promise was made by a Prime Minister looking straight into the camera in Penrith in Western Sydney. No amount of hand wringing, petitions against oneself, letters to Mark Scott or feigned indignation from the front and back bench of those opposite is going to change the fact that they have ripped half a billion dollars out of the ABC and the SBS after being elected on a promise not to make any cuts. All of those opposite are guilty of inflicting these cuts that was see, amongst other things, 400 ABC employees lose their jobs; the Adelaide ABC production studio close; regional ABC posts in Wagin, Morwell, Gladstone, Port Augusta and Nowra shut; Radio National's Bush Telegraph cease; and the Newcastle afternoon show axed. There will be no more state specific 7.30program. Women's sport is cut. Those opposite can have an ABC that is nothing more than a glorified Twitter feed if they like, but Australians want diversity of content. They want Australian stories and they want our ABC protected. (Time expired)

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:15):  In recent days, the parliament and the people have been exposed to the spectacle—the undignified spectacle—of the Prime Minister ducking and weaving, denying promises that he made on camera, denying the implications of what he said, denying what he said to the Australian people and the firm commitments he made to the Australian people before the election. It is an undignified spectacle from the Prime Minister of Australia. He has had one defence against all of it; he says: 'Yes, but I am fixing the budget. I am doing all this to fix the budget. I know I said before the election that I wouldn't use the budget as an excuse to breach my promises, but I'm fixing the budget.' That is his alibi to the Australian people. That is his excuse for the breach of his commitments to the Australian people right across the board, including Australia's pensioners, Australia's families and Australia's Friends of the ABC and Save Our SBS. That is his alibi and excuse. But his alibi is a false one; his excuse is a feeble one, because, despite that excuse, he is not fixing the budget. Even by his own test, the budget is getting worse on his watch and on his Treasurer's watch.


It takes a special kind of talent to bring down a budget so unfair and so regressive and so rejected by the Australian people and the parliament! This is a budget which rips our social fabric as well as making our economy worse; that takes a special kind of talent from a very ordinary Treasurer! We have a Treasurer so driven by prejudice that he is prepared to bring in cuts which not only damage Australian families but also damage confidence in the Australian economy, damage the budget itself and damage business conditions right across the country. This is a Treasurer who is so determined to score political points that he is talking our economy down and using irresponsible language. The Treasurer of Australia is so determined to play politics that his words and deeds are a wrecking ball to confidence. 


We have an unusual situation in Australia. Normally, it is the government talking the budget up and the government talking the economy up. That is the normal situation. In Australia, we have a Treasurer determined to talk the economy and the budget down, and an opposition responsibly pointing out the economic and budget fundamentals. That is how extreme and desperate this Treasurer is. The Treasurer talked the economy down in the lead-up to the budget, and we saw the impact immediately. When the Australian people actually saw the budget and the cuts their Treasurer had in mind, we saw the impact on our economy even more starkly. 


We had the Treasurer and Prime Minister say there would be an adrenaline rush to the economy and consumer confidence just by their very election. Well, some adrenaline and some rush! We have seen consumer confidence fall 13 per cent since the election. The now Treasurer, the former shadow Treasurer, has had plenty to say about consumer confidence over the years. He issued a press release on 14 December 2011 in relation to a decline in consumer confidence entitled 'Consumers lose confidence in government'. He tweeted—he does like Twitter, our Treasurer, and he used to like it a little more. He used to consult it about public policy, about little matters like climate change! He did a cracker of a tweet on 14 May 2013! He tweeted:


This Budget delivers even more debt, deficits, taxes and broken promises from a Government that can't be trusted.


He's a clairvoyant! He saw his own budget coming 12 months in advance! I am often critical of our Treasurer, but he could see into the future on that particular occasion! 


But make no mistake: the impact on the Australian economy and on consumer confidence is a direct result of his words and his deeds, and there are plenty of people who have made this point. In relation to the latest Westpac index of consumer sentiment in May, Westpac's chief economist, Bill Evans, commented:


The sharp fall in the Index is clearly indicating an unfavourable response to the recent Federal Budget. 


That was one of the sharp declines in consumer confidence. When asked by Westpac in May what impact consumers expected the budget to have on their family finances over the next 12 months, 59.2 per cent considered that they would worsen—and they are right. What an impact that had on consumer confidence right across the country. In September, the budget still loomed large. It was delivered in May; in September, it still loomed large in relation to consumer confidence. On recall of major news items, the proportion of respondents recalling news items relating to budget and taxation issues was the second highest since the survey was introduced in the mid-1970s. Do you know when the highest one was, Madam Speaker? It was the one just before, under this Treasurer as well. He has the highest and the second highest on his watch. This is a direct result of his words and his deeds. 


We hear a lot from this Treasurer and this government about how they are business friendly and they understand business, but there actions belie their words. The Australian Institute of Company Directors have called them out for what they are. They did a survey of directors across the country, with almost half the directors claiming the government's performance is impacting negatively on their business decisions. A majority of directors believe that the federal government's performance is negatively affecting consumer confidence—well, there is plenty of evidence for that. Around half of directors rate the government's performance in office as poor or very poor. It gets worse. Directors have become more pessimistic about the future, and an increasing number of them say the federal government does not understand business and does not understand their concerns. This is the impact of this so-called pro-business government and this pro-business Treasurer.


This has a direct impact on the budget bottom line. We are going to see a budget update in a couple of weeks. Remember when the previous government had to write down revenue? The Treasurer would get into full huff-and-puff mode. He would beat his chest like only he can. He would allege a scandal; he would allege incompetence; he would say that there was no revenue problem and that it would all be different under his watch. What do we get today when we ask, 'What will you do: will you blame revenue or blame Labor?' He is not a man for half measures, our Treasurer. He proudly proclaims, 'Both.' He is going to blame both. What a diminished figure this Treasurer is.


We will see the impact of his own actions and words in a couple of weeks in the budget update. We have already seen it in the figures. We have seen it in consumer confidence. We have seen it in the national performance of services survey. Seventy per cent of our economy is services and we have seen them contract for eight consecutive months. We saw in September the link made directly by that survey to the budget. The survey raised 'concerns about the weak state of the local economy and the effect of federal budget uncertainties'. That is a direct result of this Treasurer's incompetence, his lack of an economic strategy and his lack of an ability to convince the parliament or the people that his policies are fair—because they are not. His budget is fundamentally unfair and it is also wrong for the Australian economy.


We have a Treasurer who fundamentally misjudged the state of the economy in May, who thought that the economy could do with a dose of him talking it down, who thought that the economy could do with a dose of his harsh cuts and who thought that the economy could do with a dose of his rhetoric and his actions—and the economy is paying a price. Every Australian worker is paying a price. Australia's young people are paying a price, with youth unemployment the highest it has been since the now Prime Minister was minister for employment, with youth underutilisation at a record high in the labour market and with a youth unemployment crisis—and what is this government's response? To deliberately create an underclass by throwing people under 30 off the Newstart allowance. That is a shame when it comes to fairness and it is a shame when it comes to economic policy.


Is it any wonder that we see senior Liberals privately speculating in quite an extraordinary development, and perhaps senior Nationals as well, that the Treasurer might not make it to the next election? He might join that small and exclusive group of treasurers who are so incompetent that they cannot make a term. This Treasurer might be sacked by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications put in his place. This Treasurer is so incompetent that senior Liberals speculate that he will not make it because he is incompetent, because he misunderstands the economy, because his unfair policies are bad for Australian families, because he has created budget emergencies right across the country—



Mr Briggs interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  It all sounds a bit disorderly to me! You will desist across the table.




Mr BOWEN:
  because he has created budget emergencies for Australia's states, because he has created a national budget emergency, because he is incompetent, because he is not up to the job, because he is a bad Treasurer, because he does not understand the Australian economy, because he does not understand the impact of his words and his actions and because his prejudice is so bad that he introduces unfair policies which not only are unfair but are bad and damaging to the economy, which is in his care. (Time expired)




Mr Albanese:
  I raise a point of order, Madam Speaker. During the last two minutes of the shadow Treasurer's contribution, the member for Mayo yelled out unparliamentary language and was not called to account by you, in the context in which today, in response to my question, you indicated that there was unruly behaviour in the House. I put it to you, Madam Speaker, that both sides need to be held to account, not just one side. That was an example of outrageous behaviour—



The SPEAKER:  The member will resume his seat. The behaviour being complained of by you after today's performance is just so ironical that it is not worth passing comment on. What we saw were two men in this chamber shouting at each other.



Mr Albanese interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member will resume his seat.




Mr Albanese:
  Aren't I entitled to raise a point of order?



The SPEAKER:  Not if I anticipate that I know what it is.




Mr Albanese:
  Well, you're a genius then, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  Indeed I may well be, compared to you.




Mr Albanese:
  You might allow me to make the point, Madam Speaker.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (15:27):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to put on the Hansard record that I do think you are a genius. I commend you for your 'giving tree'. I think it is very appropriate, and I would urge members to take the opportunity to make a donation and put an offering on that tree, which has an angel on top which I believe bears a resemblance to your face, Madam Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  I don't think so!




Mr McCORMACK:
  Given the fact that it is 25 November, one month out from Christmas, and with apologies to Clement Moore, I have a poem for the House, because Labor is fixated with the night before the election. So here is my poem:


Twas the night before the election, when all through this House


Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.


The stocking was empty, the cupboard was bare,


Because Labor had governed for six years without care.


Indeed they had. That is why our country, our nation, is in such a mess.


The member for Gippsland pointed out to me that during the member for McMahon's effort he was talking about the Prime Minister using an alibi in that the budget was worse than expected. Yes, Member for Gippsland, the budget was worse than expected, but an alibi is only needed, as the member for Gippsland pointed out, when a crime has been committed. The only crime that has been committed was by the Labor Party, and that was over six long, shameful years when they took the electorate for granted, they took the nation for granted and they took the economic management of our country for granted.


On 12 May 2011, Wayne Swan, then the Treasurer, was caught out on morning radio, when he could not answer as to the last time a Labor government had produced a surplus. It was pointed out that it was 1989, which was before the member for Longman even saw the light of day—before he was born. The member for McMahon was sworn in as Treasurer on 27 June last year, after those rather forgettable years of mismanagement by Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley, and he served until the election. The deficit blew out from $18 billion to $30 billion in just a few weeks prior to the election.


Then when the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook was produced, the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, discovered to his horror that the deficit was, in fact, $48 billion, with cumulative deficits as far as the eye could see—$123 billion. We heard in question time today—it may not have been heard in this raucous end of the chamber—the member for Fraser calling out, 'What are you doing about the deficits, Joe?' Fair dinkum! Love a duck! Really and truly! The deficits were caused by that side.


Seeing as I am into quoting today, Aristotle said more than 400 years before Christ, 'To avoid criticism say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.' I think that probably sums up to this country what the Leader of the Opposition, who is not fit to lead, is all about. On 12 November this year, a journalist asked him, 'What would you say to Vladimir Putin if you came across him at the G20?' Shorten said, 'Nothing.' The journalist asked, 'Just to clarify, you would not seek to talk to Mr Putin?' Shorten said, 'Not in the first instance.' Doesn't that sum up what the member for Maribyrnong offers to this nation, what he brings to this parliament and what he gives to the Australian public? Nothing. It is absolutely diddly-squat.


The contrast between the coalition's success after just 14 months in government and Labor's legacy after six years in office could not be more stark. Contrary to what those opposite would have you believe and contrary to what the red-faced member for McMahon was shouting across the dispatch box, we are cleaning up after Labor's debt and deficit legacy. We are investing for the future. We are getting on with the job of building a more prosperous nation for Australians.


Labor did not have the stomach for difficult choices. But we are getting on with the job. I bumped into the Minister for Immigration the other day in the airport. He told me that we have closed nine detention centres. The member for Rankin might laugh, but we have closed nine detention centres. Most of the unauthorised arrivals in those detention centres came when the member for McMahon was doing the job or trying to do the job or, indeed, failing dismally at the job of being the immigration minister. Labor's policies allowed in 55,000 people—half of whom came under the member for McMahon's watch—who we then had to deal with and process. Each and every one of them cost taxpayers $170,000.


Labor put more beds in detention centres than they put into hospitals in Australia, which is absolutely shameful. If we had not had to spend money on those sorts of programs, maybe the ABC would not have to undergo the savings that it is now and would not have to undergo a saving of less than one per cent per year for five years of their $5,500 million budget. The choices are quite stark. You either get Labor again at the next election and they will bring back the carbon tax, a revised version of the mining tax and the illegal arrivals, or you stick with the government of the day, the coalition, who are building the roads, stopping the boats, ending the waste and doing everything that we said that we would do.


Let's not get too caught up in an interview on SBS the night before the election. Let's not get too cute about what might have been said the night before the election. We are doing things because our economic situation, as left by Labor, is in a mess and we need to fix it up. The mums and dads out on the street expect us to do just that. They do not get too caught up with the big words and weaselly words of the member for McMahon, who is just doing a job advertisement to be the next opposition leader. Do not worry. He is not counting the numbers of the deficit. He should have been doing that when he was the Labor Treasurer for a few short weeks. He is doing the numbers on getting the job of opposition leader. Quite frankly, I feel a little bit sorry for the member for Maribyrnong. I feel sorry the him because he has not got the wholehearted support of those people behind him. Nor does he deserve to have it, because he knifed two Labor Prime Ministers—Rudd and Gillard. Let's not forget that.


But the fact is we have a Prime Minister who has the wholehearted support of the Liberal and National parties. That is what we are about. We are about solid, strong, secure government. That is what we are bringing to the Australian people. That is what we are bringing to make sure that the debt and deficit legacy of Labor is but a distant memory. We have removed the carbon tax, as we said we would. That is a $550 saving for the average family. We have removed the mining tax, as we said we would, so that we can create jobs and growth in the electorate of, for example, the member for Flynn, who I can see in here. I know the member for Dawson was absolutely elated when that mining tax was lifted.


Had it not been abolished, Labor's mining tax could have been expected to raise $668.5 million over the forward estimates. But the associated spending by Labor was expected to reach more than $17,000 million. How could they raise $668.5 million but forward spend $17 billion and then go and promise the regions all these sorts of things that they knew they were never going to have to deliver? Labor knew they were never going to be able to deliver them because they knew they were not going to be in government. They knew that they had mucked it up so badly in six long, disastrous years that change was needed. Indeed, on 7 September last year, change was accomplished.


Achieving efficiency savings across the Commonwealth and the ABC has to occur. We would all love to be able to fund the ABC to the level it has now. But under Labor there were 10 per cent efficiency cuts in defence. Did we hear the chest beating and hand wringing from the ALP on that? I almost said 'the ABC'; I meant the ALP. Did we hear that once? Not really. They just came in and cut defence. They pared it back to pre World War II levels, back to 1938. People in my electorate were absolutely outraged. I know how people in the electorate of the member for Gippsland—who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence and doing a damn fine job at it, too—were outraged about that. So let's not get too cute about a few cutbacks to organisations which need efficiency measures to be implemented. Let's not get too cute when their side actually cut back spending in defence by 10 per cent at a time when we were fighting a very deadly war in Afghanistan. Let's not get too cute about that. We have abolished the carbon tax. We are getting on with the job of building the roads of the 21st century. We are repairing the mess that Labor left. We are fixing up the budget so that we will, one day, get back in surplus.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (15:44):  Member for Riverina, you are no poet laureate. You should stay away from the poetry and stick to the limericks. The one about the budget standing on the burning deck, as if all of your commitments are turning into ash and all of your promises about what you would do would go. The only thing I will give the Treasurer credit for is he is very effective at this one thing: he will tell you something with such bluff and bluster that in six months time you will be guaranteed he will walk away from it, guaranteed that he will crab walk away from the commitment he made. Because, remember earlier in January 2013—




Mr Pasin:
  Let's talk about Swanny's surplus.




Mr HUSIC:
  and thank you member for Barker for walking straight into it. Because earlier, in January 2013, I remember the shadow Treasurer, now Treasurer, telling ABC AM, and I quote: 'Our commitment is emphatic. Based on the numbers published today, we will deliver a surplus in our first year and every year after that.' That is what he said last year. And guess what happened? He walked away from that.


The member for Mayo wants to refer to our time in government. You often hear from the coalition a reference to, 'But what about your time in government?' The thing is this: on the path to your office, on the path to election, you made it a virtue by saying that what you say you will do you will deliver. Those opposite said that, if they make a commitment, they will deliver it. But, every time they make a commitment, they cannot.


The other time when the Treasurer spoke with such confidence, such gusto that he would be able to achieve was in May 2013, when he said: 'I can promise that the coalition will deliver a better budget bottom line than Labor.' A better bottom line. Let's fast forward six months to their first MYEFO document. PEFO—independently established—said that the budget deficit will be $30 billion. What happened? By MYEFO it went to $47 billion for their first one. This was not a case of trying to blame the former government; there were active decisions that were made by those opposite that contributed to it: the $9 billion they gifted and handed over to the Reserve Bank; the $1.1 billion that they turned their back on in terms of profit shifting and the way you could have dealt with that. They turned their back on changing the way in which wealthy superannuants are taxed. Their active decisions deteriorated the budget. So when the Treasurer, in May 2013, said, 'I can promise that the coalition will deliver a better budget bottom line than Labor,' again, wait six months and it all turns to dust.


The Treasurer got a few good confidence figures in November 2013 and he suddenly went out and told everyone. He got a few good figures on consumer confidence and in November of last year said, 'Consumers have now started taking their wallets out of their pockets.' And guess what happened six months after that. After the consumers took their wallets out of their pockets, these people opposite took $6,000 out through their budget. A budget that ripped people off. It ripped off pensioners. It lifted fuel tax. It ripped off people who wanted to send their children to university. It imposed a GP tax. The consumers took their wallets out and then they got thugged by this government in their very first budget. And what happened as a result? Confidence tanked. 


When you look at all of the figures, one after the other, the business sector cannot believe what they are seeing. What they are seeing now is people concerned about whether or not they will be able to spend, because the budget has ripped $6,000 out of families. At a time when the economy needs that confidence, it is not there. The only time you see confidence is from one person, and it is the Treasurer just before he is about to make another stuff-up; he will tell you one thing on one day, and in six month's time it will end and be departed from. Just like a Prime Minister who is simply incapable of telling the truth. You cannot trust a single commitment given by this government; they will walk away from it once they have the votes, and that is what people should remember.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (15:42):  The proposition before the House this afternoon is that apparently there is an unfair budget which is damaging Australia's economy. That is the proposition which has been put. Let us remember that what damaged the economy of Australia was six years of chaotic and incompetent management. Who can forget the rank incompetence of a Treasurer who stood up in May 2012 and said: 'The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy'? What about the ignominious failure to deliver? What was that a powerful indicator of? What that was a powerful indicator of was that panicky and inexperienced hands were at the economic wheel. This was a man who promised a surplus for 2012-13; he actually delivered an $18 billion deficit following deficits in the previous four years of $27 billion, $54 billion, $47 billion and $43 billion—and yet he expected the Australian people to believe that he would deliver a dramatic turnaround in one year. An indicator of rank incompetence and rank inexperience. What he did do was leave this country on a trajectory heading towards a massive government debt, had corrective action not been taken, of $667 billion by 2024 according to his own documents.


Who can forget some of the high points of the damage to Australia's economy that was done by the chaotic incompetence of the previous government? Who can forget the blow-out of $11 billion in border protection costs? Who can forget the blow-out of some $6 billion to $8 billion in the cost of school halls? Who can forget the pink batts program, which cost $2.8 billion and four lives, or the $900 stimulus cheques sent to 27,000 Australians overseas and 21,000 dead people? We ask who can forget? I will tell you who can forget that: it is the people on the other side of the chamber who are forgetting that. They have wilfully blinded their minds and they have closed their ears to the historical record. But the accuracy of the historical record is there. The Labor Party has the temerity to talk about an unfair budget; what could be more unfair than the generational inequity of loading a huge debt burden on successive generations because you are too weak and too incompetent to make the necessary decisions?


By contrast, what is boosting the economy is a well-structured budget that is part of an integrated economic strategy to back the private sector and to build prosperity. Let's look at some of the indicators: the ABS data released on 6 November this year is that jobs growth is 12,300 per month this year. That is more than double the 2013 average. In the ANZ's consumer confidence survey released on the 25th, consumer confidence is at 114.3—above the long-run average since 1990. The NAB's monthly business survey for October showed that confidence was up by 12 points, which is the biggest monthly gain since 1998. Those are the facts about how the economy is performing. It is doing that because what this government is doing is establishing the conditions for the private sector to prosper.


If there is one thing that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government never understood, it was that the prosperity that generates the tax revenue—on which all of the incidences of a civilised society depend, such as health, education and aged-care—depends on the private sector. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government seemed to think that you could solve everything by pumping taxpayers' money into government owned ventures: $43 billion was pumped into the National Broadband Network company and $10 billion went into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


What were we left with? A series of deficits and a huge debt, which we are now steadily and credibly working to turn around. We have a steady and credible plan to reduce the budget deficit over four years. We are steadily doing what we said we would do. We have removed the carbon tax and the mining tax, as we said we would. We are putting in place the stimulus to get the private sector working and we are capturing business opportunities through the enormously important free-trade agreements in Korea, Japan and China. We are doing what we said we would do to stimulate the private sector. That is the way to generate prosperity, boost the economy and create more jobs. What could be fairer than that?

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (15:47):  In February 2013, as the days of summer and cricket gave way to the days of autumn and football, the now Prime Minister stood up in Sydney and promised two things. The first thing he said was that if the coalition government was elected, there would be:


…an instantaneous adrenaline charge in our economy.


The other thing he said to CEDA on 15 February 2013 was that there would be an 'instantaneous surge of confidence' in the economy. Of course, the reality has been very different.


As the shadow Treasurer has said and as my other colleagues have said, the government has misread the economy. That has cost confidence. When you damage confidence, you damage growth and you damage jobs. If we cast our minds back to the time of the Prime Minister's speech, they were handing out this glossy pamphlet with Joe Hockey on the front with the blank look on his face and they were promising that the sun would shine and the birds would sing if they were elected. They said that confidence would be boosted, jobs would be boosted, the cost of living would come down and living standards would go up.


If we cast our minds to that period, we know that the reality has turned out very differently. When they try to justify it and when they try to explain all of their other broken promises on hospitals, schools, the ABC, the SBS, pensions and petrol—all of those broken promises—they say, 'Don't worry. We know we broke all of those promises, but judge us on our economic promises.' That is as if there is some sort of hierarchy of hypocrisy that the Australian people will let them get away with. They say, 'We have broken all of these other promises, but judge us on the economy.'


On the basis that you can choose opinion but you cannot choose facts, let's run through some of them. Our world ranking on living standards has gone from 8th to 14th in the world since the government was elected. The cost of living, as a result of their budget, is an extra $6,000 per year for an average family. The unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent on the day that the government was elected; it is now 6.2 per cent. There are 40,000 extra people looking for a job today than the day that the government was elected. When it comes to consumer confidence, it is down 13 per cent since the government was elected. Business confidence has gone down since the budget came out. When it comes to the budget, in the first mid-year update the Treasurer doubled the deficit.


We now have another mini-budget coming up. It is due in the next few weeks. Already, the excuses are mounting about this mini-budget coming up in a couple of weeks' time. Our front bench asked the Treasurer today to pick from a menu of excuses and he said, 'I will have all of them. I will have all of the excuses. I will have every excuse on the menu. Any excuse you want to pitch up to me, I am happy to rely on.' As the member for Wakefield said, it was like fish jumping into a boat. It was like we had hooked him by making him admit, two or three weeks earlier than he had hoped, that he is going to go for every single excuse. He is going to blame everyone else except himself, despite having been the Treasurer for the last 15 months.


I remember very well when the Treasurer was the shadow Treasurer he would always say, 'Well, you can't hide behind the iron ore price. You can't hide behind the global economy. You can't hide behind fluctuations in world prices for resources.' Already, we have seen with the sneaky little leaks to the gallery upstairs that that is exactly what he intends to do. The government promised that they would make the budget better. The budget in this mini-budget will be worse. They promised that they would fix the cost of living. If you ask families in my community and communities right around Australia, including communities represented by those opposite, they know that the budget makes the cost of living worse. The government said that they would be part of the solution when it came to the budget or cost of living and they have turned out to be part of the problem.


There is another little sneaky thing that people need to keep an eye out for. The member for Jagajaga and I have been discussing this. With all of these are cuts that are rightly held up in the Senate, the Treasurer—in his typically sneaky way—will try to claim them as savings and improvements to the budget bottom line when the mini-budget comes out. Is it any wonder that Laurie Oakes talks about Joe Hockey being like the Hindenburg?


There is a quote in the Laurie Oakes piece, and it says:


People criticised Joe for going on holidays to Fiji. Now some of us are sorry he came back.


I think that a lot of people on that side of the House over there, judging by their silence and judging by them pretending to read and all that sort of thing, agree with it. The fact is, it is beyond question: their misreading of this economy is costing this economy confidence, and when it is costing this economy confidence it is costing growth and jobs as well.

"Whiteley, Brett, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (15:52):  What an interesting MPI we have here today; the Abbott government is unfair and is damaging Australia's economy! Let us talk about an unfair budget. What is more unfair than a political party, that held office in this country for six years, that has basically stolen every last dollar and cent from my children and my future grandchildren. Going into the future, accumulated deficits of $123 million and debt owed by this country of $667,000 million. What is more unfair than that?


Doing what is right for our great country is not easy. It is not easy; in fact, it is tough. It takes courage, and it takes courageous people, and it takes a courageous political party. Doing what is right for your political party in the case of the ALP is always easy—just instil fear, promise the world to everyone and tell everyone that you are a friend. It is like the old Joh Bjelke-Petersen line: feed the chooks—just had out more money.


The question is, to all the smart alecs on the other side, who is paying for it? Who is paying for it? The member for Charlton over there stood in this place recently, talking about the fact that he wanted a future for his children while he was talking about the carbon tax. He wanted a tremendous future for his children. Why did he not actually make a similar speech as each and every budget was rolled out by his treasurers every single year when he accumulated a deficit? Why don't you tell your children about that?


This lot opposite, who held the Treasury benches for six years, had leaders that could not lead, treasurers that could not count, immigration ministers that could not say no and finally they had a foreign minister that could not find a pair of pyjamas that matched his ego. They stand for nothing. They have great bravado in this place, as we just heard a few moments ago, where they are hanging their hats, their coats, their jocks and their socks on the power of the Senate to stand in the way of a courageous government that is trying desperately to get this country's debt and deficit under control. Well, I have got news for you, and if you listen then you might learn something. The news is: you do not, even with your best friends the Greens, hold control of the Senate. I actually believe that the crossbench senators in the other place are more than honourable. They are certainly more honourable than you and the Greens, that is for sure. I think, deep down in my heart of hearts, that they too want to be courageous, that they too want to save their children and their grandchildren from the absolute cliff-face dilemma that this country is going to face through the next generation. I think, with all the honourable intentions that we can find, that we will find a way, together with the crossbenchers, to make a move forward.


We are a government that is serious about what is best for the country, not what is best for us. If we were doing what is best for us, we would be taking the easy road as you did for six years. After six years, this is the question I have for the Australian people. They gave a verdict on September 13 last year. The question is this: did they vote to give us the mandate to do the things we want purely because this lot over here were relationally dysfunctional, or was it because they were economically incompetent, or was it both? It was both. The Australian people installed a government to get debt and deficit under control. As I wrap up, I will tell you something for nothing: you can do a lot to instil fear into individuals and into individual groups and scare the daylights out of them, or you can do something for the nation and build a future.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (15:57):  As you well know, during the last Labor government we had a global financial crisis, and because of the expert financial management of that Labor government, what did we come out of the global financial crisis with? We had a AAA credit rating, one of the lowest net debts in the OECD and the 12th largest economy in the world. If you want to talk about debt, you compare the net debt that Australia had at the end of the global financial crisis with the OECD average. Everyone in this chamber knows that Labor's expert management during the global financial crisis saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. It is something we are very proud of because on this side of the chamber we actually care about jobs. We are not out there saying that the cuts to the ABC, the flagrant breach of promise by this government, is somehow not of any consequence, when one in 10 jobs in the ABC is going. We actually understand that every one of those people who are losing their jobs before Christmas is going to be devastated because we care about jobs, unlike this mob. What have they done?


What is the unemployment rate now? It is 6.2 per cent, seasonally adjusted. A 6.2 per cent unemployment rate because of the record of this government. When are you lot going to start taking responsibility? You are in government. Start taking some responsibly for the state of this nation and the state of its economy—6.2 per cent unemployment. Might I add that in my home state of Queensland, it is seven per cent, seasonally adjusted. It is an absolute disgrace. It is an absolute shame what Liberals and Nationals do to our economy and to our unemployment rate.


Why does this mob opposite, this government opposite, not care about the jobs for working Australians? Don't they understand that in a more equal economy, in an economy where people have dignity, they have work, not only is it good for the economy; it is good for the budget? I say on this point of jobs that one of the greatest problems with not having a job is that it makes it even harder to bear the cost of living. What has this government done for the cost of living? 



A government member interjecting—  




Ms BUTLER:
  I hear someone over there interjecting about the carbon tax. I am so pleased that that is being interjected to me, because 59 per cent of households say that the repeal of the carbon tax has had absolutely no impact, no reduction, on their household expenses—no reduction whatsoever. But what is happening with the cost of living, what is happening in households, what is happening around the kitchen table is that one half of households say that they are cutting back on essential items. How is that for consumer confidence! How is that for the economy! Half of households are cutting back on non-essentials. What is an even greater shame than that is that one-third of households are cutting back on essentials. In fact, 15 per cent say that they have deliberately missed paying a bill by its due date, because of the cost of living pressures that are on their household at the moment. It is a crying shame. 


It is about time that the Liberal-National government, the Abbott government, a year into their first term, started taking some responsibility for the consequences of their own actions. Stop pointing the finger at Labor. Stop pointing the finger at our side of the chamber. Stop being so obsessive about us and start taking some responsibility for what you have done. What is our economic legacy? The 12th biggest economy after the global financial crisis, hundreds of thousands jobs saved, AAA credit rating and one of the lowest net debts in the OECD is what our legacy is. What is your legacy going to be members opposite? Is it going to be tens of thousands more unemployed? There are 40,000 more people in employment queues since this rotten first Abbott budget. It is an atrocious record so far, and one of which this government ought to be ashamed. 


What about consumer confidence? We know that this government's first rotten budget smashed consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment is down 13 per cent since the election. Unfortunately, it is what economists have come to expect of this government, with Westpac's chief economist saying in November: 'This is an unsurprising but still disappointing result.' They are not surprised that you lot are smashing consumer confidence; they are just very, very disappointed. It is a shocking first budget, it is an unfair budget and it is damaging the Australian economy—and you ought to be ashamed.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:02):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this MPI. 




Mr Pasin:
  Go easy, Luke. 




Mr SIMPKINS:
  I will be nice. What we have come to see in the last year is a number of great achievements. The carbon tax has been taken away; it is gone. Hence, Australian families are $550 a year better off. We have even had lower public transport fares and the lower cost of utilities—it is endless like that. From a Western Australian perspective, the mining tax has gone. And we are doing what we can to help out that sector as well. There is stopping the boats. This is an $11 billion saving as a result of having a border control system, a humanitarian intake that now depends on need, not on how much cash you have got—a compassionate approach at last. 


In amongst all of that, we have made great steps forward with the free trade agreement with Japan and the free trade agreement with China. This is helping to build the economy and helping to concentrate on what can be achieved in the future so that we can go to our schools and talk about what great benefits are coming in the future. I think these are really good things. There are a lot of positive things to be said. There is the red and green tape reduction. There is over $2 billion at least a year in savings as a result of what this government has done. So there are lots of good stories to be told. 


I guess one of the things that we still must approach is the fact that we have been left with a budget problem; there is no doubt about it. We have got to manage the budget. We have got to have this country living within its means. We cannot just increase the debt. I hear a young child up there in the gallery, and I do worry about the debt levels that are going to be left to the children of this country. I think it is the responsibility of this government and this nation to make the adjustments that we need right now so that this country can live within its means, so that we are not just shifting the debt to future generations. Children being born today will effectively have $25,000 or more in debt allocated to them, because what has happened in the past has to be fixed. I worry about the standard of living of people who are being born right now, unless we can get the budget under control. When I look across to the other side, I think the children of the future will remember who was responsible for that. In fact, I think in the future children will curse the day that Kevin Rudd was elected and then Julia Gillard, who followed him, and then Rudd again. They will curse the day that these people who could not manage an economy, who could not manage a budget, have shifted that debt to them. The people who will have to pay for the reckless spending in this country will rue the day that those opposite were elected, because they have to live with what that lot left them. 


There are a lot of people in this parliament who are friends of groups. I believe that the friends of motoring are having a function and the friends of netball also have a function coming up soon. But there is also a group that is not bipartisan, and that is the friends of debt and deficit over there and they joined with their mates, the Greens—people who get in the way of responsible government and will not help this country and this government to make this country live within its means. They reach out to greed and they ask everyone, 'What's in it for you?' They reach out and try to get people to think only of themselves, and in that they are betraying the future generations of this country—the children of this country who will have to live with generations of problems, debt and a lower standard of living—because they will not help us get things back under control. It is an absolute disgrace, and they will be held accountable for it. The Australian people will remember who was responsible for this mess.

There is only one member opposite who has actually nailed this, but they are not actually present today and that was the member who, when this budget first came down, had the courage to call this budget what it is—


This stinking, rotting carcass around this government's neck.


It has been that since day 1 and they can't shake that smell—they can't get rid of it. They have shaken it every which way, but nothing helps. 


It is the Australian public that knows exactly—they have your measure on what this budget is like. The people of Newcastle know full well what this budget is doing. There is so much evidence to show, contrary to the bluster from members opposite—the busting of business confidence, the plummeting of consumer confidence post-budget. This so-called adrenalin charge is astonishing—I mean: the battery ran out sometime ago; I don't know where it has gone; but it is just spluttering along at some terrible pace behind. For people in my electorate this budget is making it harder and harder to get a job. Since this budget came down there are more than 40,000 Australians who have joined the job queue—sending the unemployment rates to the highest level since 1997.



Mr Pasin interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Barker.




Ms CLAYDON:
  Since this budget came down in my electorate of Newcastle the unemployment rate has nearly doubled, moving from 4.7 to eight per cent. Thousands of people in my electorate have lost their jobs since this government was elected—workers at Arrium, the Hunter TAFE, WesTrac, Pacific National, QantasLink and Sandvik, just to name a few, have lost their jobs. What about this week, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the cuts that were never going to happen—the cuts to the ABC. Remember? Now we have the farcical situation where members opposite are lying about the lies. We have petitions from government members—




Mr Keenan:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member is aware that that is unparliamentary and she is required to withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I think you will note that on both sides that has been used quite frequently in the last few days and so it is not a point of order.




Ms CLAYDON:
  The cuts to the ABC which have been so devastating in my community of Newcastle—1233 Newcastle has lost more than a third of their staff this week. Members opposite, where were you when the Commission of Audit was coming down? Were you warning about these job losses from the ABC? Not a peep from members opposite! Where were you when the budget was being debated in this chamber? Were you worrying about jobs in regional Australia? There was not a peep—nothing from you guys whatsoever. These are real jobs in my community, and people are really hurting. There are people grieving for their work—




Mr Whiteley:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was wondering if the member could clarify how much the Labor party intends to put back into the ABC budget.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  There is no point of order.




Ms CLAYDON:
  Those opposite own their own budget and their own stinking, rotting carcass. They need to take a little bit of responsibility for what they are doing in government, because the people of Newcastle have their measure. They know what you are up to. In addition to the job losses at the ABC, workers in the shipbuilding industry at Forgacs still face an uncertain future, because this government could not bring themselves to bring forward some contracts for supply ships that might be tendered out to Australian manufacturers. No, oh no. Remember the lies we had? The lie about no capacity in Australia to build these ships—it was another lie. If this government continues down this current path and locks Forgacs and other shipbuilders will be out of multibillion contracts, then it is going to mean that everyone is out of work.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (16:12):  I think we all know who the rotting, stinking carcass belongs to. This topic for the MPI today takes me back to my university debating days. It would just be dreadful today if I had drawn the affirmative team and had to speak in support of this ridiculous topic. My team would be the losers for sure, hands down, just like Labor lost—lost control, lost sight, lost their way, lost the right to govern in September 2013. But today, Labor's matter of public importance is not difficult to oppose. Yes, they lost the plot as well.


We have heard it all today in this MPI, but it is worth repeating. Let's look at a few facts about Labor's 2007-2013 mess. Between 2008 and 2009, Labor delivered a deficit totalling $191 billion. Labor left accumulated deficits totalling $123 billion. If you say it quickly enough, it does not sound like a lot. Without intervention, the Australian budget would have been in deficit for 16 consecutive years—not just 'unfair', but incredibly irresponsible by those on the other side.


But we have intervened to stop the madness—the Abbott government's good fair budget management will recover the Australian economy. Let me say a little more on Labor. Labor presided over the fastest deterioration of our debt position in more than 50 years—since the Second World War. Labor introduced more than 20,000 new or amended bits of regulation, and that is new red tape; that is money and time down the drain; that hurts business; that is unfair and that damaged the economy. Without intervention, small business might just be down the gurgler, but we have intervened, chopping the tape, reviving business—that is the Abbott government's good fair budget management: rebuilding the economy, rebuilding confidence. We have our eye on the ball, our eye on the budget, our eye on the outcome to reduce Labor's appalling debt legacy and restore Australia's budget situation.


Let me turn to rural and regional matters. The National Farmers' Federation issued their scorecard on the Abbott government's recently announced FTA. The NFF have awarded the maximum five stars to dairy, beef, veal, sheepmeat and horticulture and four stars to wine—and I am very pleased for my member opposite. This means either major or outstanding improvements on Labor's dismal economic and budget legacy. The China FTA will create more jobs and opportunities by providing for Australia to invest in China in industries such as aged care, private hospitals, telecommunications, hospitality, travel agencies, construction and motor vehicle insurance. So those opposite can have their little outburst, but the facts speak very loudly. The Abbott government's fair and disciplined budgeting is rebuilding Australia's economy.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:16):  What Andrew Robb has done with this free trade agreement with Japan is a fantastic thing. Just before the election in 2013 Andrew Robb addressed a capacity crowd at a lunch in Townsville. The words he said that day will stay with me always. He said that in the tropical world—that is, between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer—there are around 600 million people who would be considered to be in the middle class and by 2035 that number is expected to grow to 3.6 billion. Most of those people will be directly on top of North Queensland, so it is important to be able to get free trade agreement signed. We have signed free trade agreements with Korea and China and there are more to come.


My region, my state and our country are perfectly positioned in that space. What we must do, though, is remember that this is not just about food and fibre, it is not just about mining. This agreement and the agreement with China have also freed up the services economy. We have got a bunch of school kids up behind the glass and I say hello to them. You can only sell an asset once; you can sell something to an overseas country once and you can trade those sorts of things. But Australia is a service based economy. When you kids graduate from high school, go to university or get yourself a trade—if you go into the Army and become a logistician—the great things that you learn will put you in good stead to feed into this service based economy, to be the representatives of Australia and take our economy further. This is not just about food and fibre. This is one of the things that Andrew Robb has been saying all the way through. It is about our services—accountants, solicitors, town planners, architects, builders and our construction industry. All those people will feed into this. It is the people who run nursing homes, our nurses. All those trades that you kids will do when you leave school will feed into what this free trade agreement tries to do.


We have to understand where we are in the world and the opportunity that we have in this space. We have an opportunity to service 3.6 billion people, most of whom live directly above us in the Asian zone. That is the massive opportunity that we have. What we must also understand is that just signing a free trade agreement does not mean that the job is done. A free trade agreement is just an invitation to the table. All a free trade agreement does is give you an opportunity to impress. When you run a dairy farm and want to make sure that your top-quality cheese, yoghurt and milk gets into these markets, you get an opportunity through a free trade agreement to present to people in these markets. But you still have to close the deal. You still have to use your ability as a salesperson and the quality of your product to get that job done. A free trade agreement allows you deliver your product for the price they are prepared to pay and make a profit along the way. The Minister for Trade, Andrew Robb, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are doing a great job into space. We are in this game and it has taken 10 long years of hard work across three or four parliaments to get this work done. We are doing it because, when I am older, I will need you guys to look after me. That is why we are doing it. It will make sure that you guys will have the opportunity to get in there and have a real go.


I am from Townsville. Townsville has two Japanese sister cities—Shunan, which is located in Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Iwaki. In that space, we are reaching out on a cultural basis. This is not just across coal, wheat, grapes or wine; it includes our arts, our culture. We have a massive ability to provide for people in this space. This free trade agreement is a great thing for Australia. The work that Andrew Robb has done in this space has been fantastic for our country. The work is still going on and it will be perfect for when you guys start to leave school. That is the message that I want to hear. My son is in grade 7. When he leaves school, when he gets in this space, I want to make sure that the has an opportunity to make a real name for himself when he goes overseas. I thank the House and I support this legislation wholeheartedly.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (16:22):  I rise today to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. This bill represents a great opportunity for Australia. I take this time to pay tribute to our fantastic trade minister, the member for Goldstein, Mr Andrew Robb, for his proven leadership, his effortless negotiation and commitment to building positive relationships between Australia and Japan. Australia and Japan have enjoyed close ties over the years, but this economic partnership agreement is a historic agreement that will benefit Australians for decades to come.


Under the leadership of the trade minister, Australians have witnessed the largest Australian trade envoys reaching out to Japan, China and South Korea. Each of these trade delegations have resulted in positive outcomes for the Australian economy, Australian business and Australian consumers. The Abbott government's message to the world is crystal clear: Australia is now under new management and we are open for business. I am proud to say that throughout all these rigorous negotiations our government has kept the national interest at the forefront of their decision making. The coalition stated from the outset that these agreements must be in our national interest, and we have delivered.


The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is a great win for the Australian economy and for the people of Macarthur. It represents the best quality trade deal that Japan has ever concluded. More than 97 per cent of Australia's current trade with Japan will receive preferential access or enter duty free when the agreement is fully implemented, giving Australian farmers, producers, manufacturers and exporters a significant competitive advantage. The agreement encompasses a wide range of goods and services. Most importantly, it represents a fantastic deal for Australian farmers. As one of our most valuable beef markets, this new agreement with Japan will see our beef exports, which are currently worth $1.4 billion, receive an immediate and significant competitive advantage through rapid tariff reductions. Fresh beef producers and live cattle exporters will also benefit from reductions in tariffs. Additionally, and very importantly, Japan has agreed that Australian beef will never again be subjected to the 50 per cent global snapback tariff, creating certainty for our beef and cattle exporters.


Another excellent feature of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is the agreement by Japan to review and negotiate these outcomes on beef, which will provide a positive framework towards further liberalisation. This framework includes a review triggered immediately if Japan provides another country with a better deal on beef, aimed at providing Australia equivalent treatment; an automatic review aimed at improving access five years after this current agreement comes into force; and a review of the safeguard mechanism after 10 years to consider abolishing the safeguard or increasing the safeguard trigger levels which are set above current trade levels. This feature is incredibly important in ensuring that Australia's interests, and our commitment to building and maintaining trade relationships with Japan, is not second bested by other global competitors. It represents a great deal for the Australian economy and for Australian farmers. I am pleased to see aspects of this framework featuring in many of the agricultural and horticultural tariff items.


Dairy farmers and producers are also beneficiaries of this historic agreement with Japan. Dairy products, predominately cheeses, are one of Australia's biggest agricultural exports to Japan. These exports were worth $452 million in 2013. Under the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, Australian dairy producers will receive significant preferential access on key dairy exports, including cheese, ice-cream and yoghurt. Exports of milk based products will receive immediate duty free access, with products including lactose, casein, milk albumen and milk protein concentrates. The Macarthur electorate has one of Australia's largest dairies, the Leppington Pastoral Company. I look forward to seeing the many benefits of this agreement for our dairy farmers and producers within the Macarthur region.


At the last election the coalition made a commitment to the Australian people that we would build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. With this agreement we are delivering on this promise. Australian importers of Japanese manufactured items will benefit from reductions in Australian tariffs and, in some cases, the elimination of Australian tariffs on some items. This is particularly important for the agricultural sector. The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement will be a great coup for my electorate of Macarthur, which has a growing agricultural sector. A local advocate for this agreement is Mr Eric Gilleland and his sons Rhys and Brett of Macarthur Mowers and Marine who are looking forward to seeing the benefits of reduced tariffs in agricultural machinery and council and golf course mowing equipment. Macarthur Mowers and Marine have just secured an exclusive agreement with the Japanese manufacturing giant, IHI Industries, to import the high-quality Shibaura golf course and council mowing equipment for New South Wales. As the largest dealer for Japanese manufactured Shindaiwa power equipment in Australia, Macarthur Mowers and Marine stand to gain a competitive edge with more affordable prices for Macarthur consumers.


I am excited about seeing the benefits of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement in the Macarthur electorate. Local Macarthur families will benefit from greater competition within the consumer goods market, meaning a better deal on many electronic and household products. This will help to reduce some of the cost-of-living pressures faced by families across Macarthur. My electorate can only stand to win from this agreement, and I look forward to seeing the fruits of closer ties with one of Australia's closest trading partners.


I commend this bill to the House and I thank the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the trade minister and the Minister for Immigration and Border Security, as well as all of the departments who have worked so hard to secure this great deal for Australia and the people of Macarthur.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (16:28):  I rise to speak on the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation Bill 2014. Imagine if I said to you that I had discovered a one-shot caffeine hit for the Australian economy—a boost that would drive jobs, investment, productivity and real incomes; a boost that would strengthen our best sectors and organisations and create opportunities for growth in massive new markets. That is exactly what good free trade agreements do. And, after years of procrastination, we finally have a government that is prepared to get on with negotiating quality free trade agreements.


I came into this parliament because I believed that a more open, more outward-looking Australia would be a better Australia. I came into this parliament because I believed that the massive and fast-growing markets to our north offered unprecedented opportunities for Australia. But the previous government had no idea how to realise this potential. Australia is in fact far less open than we often think. Our exports amount to little over 20 per cent of GDP, and many of our competitors are far ahead of us: the UK at 32 per cent, Korea at 57 per cent, Canada at 30 per cent, New Zealand at 29 per cent and China at 27 per cent.


I saw time and time again in my career prior to entering the parliament how opening up an economy to these sorts of opportunities, the sorts of opportunities that we are implementing in this bill, is absolutely transformational. The start of Australia's strong economic history began with a trade agreement with the UK for wool in the 1830s, and soon after we saw a similar sort of agreement with the UK in gold. After the war we saw an agreement with the Japanese for coal and more recently, in the late sixties, we opened up our massive and now extraordinarily beneficial iron ore industry with the Japanese. We all know well the story of the iron ore boom in Australia's north-west which began in the early 2000s and which we are still benefiting from, and if we look a little further afield we see the boom in the South Island of New Zealand driven by white powder—milk powder. I know that these opportunities have an enormous amount to offer us, and I saw some of the most recent of them, particularly around iron ore and milk powder in New Zealand, at very close quarters. 


I learnt very early on that these opportunities are easily missed. It is easy to find an excuse to avoid pursuing them, it is easy to put roadblocks in the way and it is easy to listen to the naysayers who will tell you that this is fool's gold and that there are so many different trade-offs you have to make that you never get a deal done. Fortunately we have a minister who has executed on these deals and would have none of this naysaying. We have seen three transformational agreements this year, as we said we would—with Japan, with Korea and with China. Of course the one we are talking about today in this bill is the one with Japan, and we look forward to a similar agreement with India. This bill is intended to support the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. We know that negotiations began in 2007 and did not conclude until April 2014—by an extraordinary coincidence, it seemed that not very much happened in that period between 2007 and 2013, when Labor was in power. The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to introduce new rules of origin for goods imported into Australia.


The benefits of free trade agreements are not always well understood, and I want to focus on the benefits for a moment. Not only do these agreements bring lower prices for the importing countries and better access and higher prices for the exporting countries but also they do something else very important—they allow us to specialise, allow us to focus on our great strengths. Adam Smith worked this out several centuries ago when he talked about the pin factory. He noted that by specialising, by allowing people to focus on what they did best, by breaking up a task into its smaller components, we could drive enormous levels of productivity. In fact, the industrial revolution was built around that very simple insight. We are seeing exactly the same thing happening right now in the global economy. An iPhone has 451 components, and the 10 most valuable come from six different countries. That is specialisation, that is what we are seeing in the global economy at the moment, and that is exactly why these trade agreements are so important—because we need to back our strengths. We need to focus on our strengths, and nowhere is that more important than when we look at agriculture. The naysayers quote from a Productivity Commission report that was done a number of years ago and say that these agreements do not really deliver. Let me tell you what is so important about all three of these agreements with Japan, Korea and China—agriculture is a big part of them. Agriculture is one of our great strengths. These are large countries, large importers, and they offer great potential for us to focus on our strengths. As importantly, these agreements not only include agriculture but also extend to resources and services. We know that is where the economic growth will come for us beyond the current commodities boom.


In the time I have left I want to focus on some clear benefits I am already seeing in my electorate from this strengthening relationship with Asia. I was recently involved in the opening of the Hilltops abattoir at Young—an export beef facility which will employ, once at full capacity, 380 people. There has been millions of dollars of investment focused entirely on exporting meat up into Asia. We are already seeing the benefits of these deepening relationships. Brumby Aircraft out at Cowra have entered into a 40-year joint-venture with AVIC, a Chinese aircraft company, initially involving the export of 280 small aircraft up into China. The benefits from these free trade agreements, and in particular this Japanese free trade agreement, will be enormous. I commend the bill to the House.

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (16:35):  The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is an irrevocable return to high friendship in the economic relations of Japan and Australia. JAEPA is the most liberalising trade agreement Japan has ever concluded. More than 97 per cent of Australia's exports to Japan will receive preferential access or enter Japan duty free. At the end of 2013, Japanese investment in Australia was valued at $131 billion and Australian investment in Japan reached $50.2 billion. Let the naysayers know that this relationship benefits us nearly three times as much as Japan. Gone will be the high barriers for trade with Japan, including agricultural tariffs of up to 219 per cent. There will be immediate duty-free access for milk protein concentrates as well as new opportunities for ice-cream and frozen yoghurt exports. Tariffs on macadamia nuts, asparagus, lobsters, crustaceans and shellfish will be eliminated immediately, and there will be immediate duty-free and quota-free access for wheat for feed and barley for feed as well as streamlined export arrangements for some Australian wheat varieties. This is a good move for WA, and it is an especially positive move for all WA wheat growers. 


JAEPA is a stepping stone, as it puts in place a framework to achieve an even better deal. Almost 30 years ago, in August 1986, US President Ronald Reagan signed an economic partnership agreement with Japan. In a radio address on 2 August 1986 he stated:


These agreements are examples of positive, result-oriented trade action. Instead of closing markets at home, we've opened markets to U.S. products abroad, thus helping to create more American jobs. … Because, believe me, when Americans are competing on a level playing field, they can outproduce and outsell anyone, anywhere in the world.


I trust and believe in Australia. I trust and believe in our Australian ingenuity and excellence. In trying to help workers in ailing industries, we must be careful that the cure is not worse than the disease, like the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the US that deepened and prolonged the Great Depression. Our plan is to create high-paying, sustainable jobs in the high-value-added goods and services sector. There is no other game in town. We either all get on board with the new rules of the game or we all lose out together.


I support the global growth targets of 2.1 per cent per annum agreed at the Brisbane G20. FTAs are our future. Tariff barriers are a redundant relic of history. Viewed in the context of our digital age, they are as outdated as other fashionable ideas from that period—and about as useful as an underwater hair dryer. Listen to some of the many pros of free trade: lower costs, increased purchasing power, comparative advantage improves economic growth. We compete in a globally connected, interdependent and competitive world.


In July the Business Council released a report that identified tourism, education, resources and energy, advanced manufacturing, agriculture and food manufacturing, professional and financial services as areas where Australia can be globally competitive. High-quality services are one of Australia's competitive strengths and largest areas of employment. The removal of trade restrictions in aged care, education, tourism, mining and construction, engineering and manufacturing services gives Australia an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from Japan's aged and ageing population.


The combined impact of the agreement with China, the FTAs signed this year with Japan and Korea, and a commitment to complete negotiations with India within 12 months puts Australia at the epicentre of Asian growth. We have achieved these agreements in the region that is set to account for half of the world's economic output. What the Howard government started, the Abbott government is finishing.


There are moral arguments to support free and freer trade among nations. Free trade respects the dignity and sovereignty of an individual. Free trade restrains the power of the state. Free trade brings people together across distance and cultures. Australia was built on foreign investment—first from Britain, then from America and, more recently, from Japan and China.


Japan and Australia are more alike than unalike. We have passed the days of horror. War is too short a syllable, too simple a word, to truly tell of the terrible, thundering terror of daily death, dismemberment and rape. To get to JAEPA has been a journey. Our achievement—our victory—is moving from questions and fears of attacks to questions and fear of a tax. This bill builds hope, reward, and opportunity.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:41):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. It was good to hear the member for Hume refer to the work of Adam Smith, probably one of the greatest intellects in the economics sphere, ever. It was in his work The Wealth of Nations, back in 1776, that he wrote:


It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. … If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.


Two hundred and forty years of economic history have shown that Smith was right. Wherever countries have engaged in free trade, it has led to greater wealth, it has led to greater opportunity, it has led to more and high-paying jobs, and it has led to a higher standard of living. That is why we should give great praise to Minister Robb for the work that he has done, not just on this free trade agreement but also on the free trade agreements struck, within the first year of this coalition government, with China, Japan and Korea. It is an absolutely remarkable achievement that will have enormous benefits for our nation for decades to come.


In relation to our current trade with Japan, we imported from Japan over $21 billion in 2013. But we actually export to Japan, currently, more than double that. We currently sell to Japan almost $50 billion worth of goods and services. This is the base that we are working off. This free trade agreement gives us the opportunity to increase that base. It gives us opportunity across our agricultural sector and our manufacturing sector. It gives opportunity especially to our services sector. All those sectors have the opportunity to create more export sales, to create greater wealth for this nation and to create greater opportunity.


There are a few reasons that this is very important. Of course there is the wealth of the country, but it is also important, I would say, for many in our agricultural sector. Because having more companies, or more markets, to sell to helps break down the current economically damaging monopsony situation that many people in our food industry find themselves in with our overly concentrated supermarket sector. If those companies have export markets to sell to, they cannot be as easily held hostage by the demands of a powerful buyer. 


It is also very important because of the situation that we find ourselves in as a nation. There are many things that both sides of the House want to do. We want to provide more money for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance. But the only way we can do those things is to build the wealth, increase the wealth, of the country, and the best way to do that is through further free trade agreements.


We also have the job of fixing the current budget. We often talk about deficits and surpluses. I think, rather than saying the country is currently running a deficit, we should rephrase it and say we are running a loss. For the last six years, we as a nation have been running a loss. The Commonwealth government have been spending more money than we have been raising. That means we have to borrow money, which then creates an obligation not only to pay it back sometime in the future but also to pay the ongoing interest bill. That is what we face, with $1 billion in interest payable every single month, and we know that about 75 per cent of that flows out of the country. If we are going to turn that around, we need to increase our productivity, we need to increase the wealth of this nation, and free trade is one of the best ways we can do that.


The other benefit of this trade deal, of course, is the lower prices that it will lead to for Australian consumers. There are some doubting Thomases. But I will just leave you with one example. The EPA with Japan will reduce the duty on cars imported from Japan. It will reduce the price and make them duty-free. We have reduced the duties on cars over the last couple of years. If we look at a base-model Toyota Corolla, 20 years ago that was just under $20,000. Today, the very same starter-model Toyota Corolla has not increased 1c in price; it is still under $20,000. That is despite CPI increasing, over those 20 years, by something like 66 per cent. So you are getting a car for the same value as you were 20 years ago, but you are getting a better car, with improved features, greater fuel efficiency and more safety. That is because we have lowered tariffs; that is because we have lowered duties. 


The Japan-Australia EPA is one of three remarkable free trade agreements that have been struck by our trade minister. He stands congratulated, and I commend this bill to the House.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (16:47):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, commonly called the Japanese free trade agreement. The Prime Minister said on election night back in September 2013 that Australia was 'open for business'—and, boy, we have to be. The challenges that are in front of this government grow daily as we discover the full inheritance left to us by the Labor Party, and one of the things we have to do is increase our trade. I think it was the New Zealand Prime Minister who said, and I paraphrase: 'No-one ever got rich selling to themselves.' We have to open up new markets. 


Since that time, this government and in particular Andrew Robb, the Minister for Trade and Investment, have put in an exemplary performance and delivered on three free trade agreements. This is the detail, but the headline agreements are there. This deal with Japan is historical in that it breaks new ground. We have gone where no other similar country has gone before. Over many, many years, the thing that gridlocked the negotiations between Australia and Japan was access for our agricultural products to the Japanese markets. There are some that Japan chooses to still protect, but it has given no better access to anybody else in the world than it has to Australia in this instance. Written into these agreements is what we could call most favoured nation trading status, which means that, if somebody gets a better deal than us subsequently, we are in a position to claim the same. So full credit goes to Andrew Robb and his team for convincing Japan that trade liberalisation delivers a mutual benefit to both countries.


I want to concentrate on some of the industries within my electorate which stand to benefit greatly from this trade agreement and the other ones. Grey is a major supplier of beef to the world market, particularly from the northern pastoral regions of my electorate. This is what I sometimes call the romantic heart of Australia—up the Birdsville Track, the Oodnadatta Track, the Strzelecki Track or along the Ghan railway. This is where Sir Sidney Kidman pioneered his giant cattle properties. They exist in much the same manner as they did 100 years ago, except that are larger now because fewer people produce more of the same product, and they do it well. They have also now, largely, become registered as organic suppliers on the world market, which has increased their value. That makes theirs a premium product and they are looking for premium markets, and of course the Japanese market is one of them.


Tariffs have not been eliminated on beef, but over the next 15 years they will be halved on frozen beef and they will be down by 15 per cent on fresh beef. As I said, this is a better deal than anybody else has; and, should anybody else get a better deal, we will be getting it along with them, thank you very much. We are now also exempt from the national snap-back tariff that Japan can enforce with other nations. If the quota gets out of step and they are worried about the amount of beef coming into Japan, they can actually impose a 50 per cent tariff. We are exempt from that.


As for grain, my electorate and South Australia generally are exporters of grain. Japan is our fourth-largest market for wheat. We do operate under low tariffs into Japan currently, but there are some very highly regulated quotas, some of which at last will be going by the board. In particular, we will be the only country able to export feed wheat into Japan outside this very strict quota regulation. That gives us a great advantage in the world market. Barley will be duty free and have no quota. That is a great opportunity for us. The Japanese beef industry is always looking for good quality feed.


Seafood is very big business in my electorate right around the coastline, but particularly around Port Lincoln. Southern bluefin tuna tariffs are being phased out over 10 years. I know the industry would like to have seen them phased out quicker, but they are going, and that is a movement forward. We have seen quite a bit of confrontation, trying to get rock lobster into certain markets, particularly the Chinese market, in previous years. Rock lobster tariffs are being reduced immediately, from 9.6 per cent, as are those for prawns and abalone, of which the Grey electorate is a prominent supplier.


In the resources sector, coal, iron ore and LNG already have duty-free access to Japanese markets. They are the things that they have wanted from us for a very long time, but there have been products like titanium oxide, which in my electorate is mined at Iluka's Jacinth Ambrosia deposits just out of Ceduna, which will have tariffs reduced to nothing over the next few years.


All of those things are good for my electorate. I look forward to giving speeches that will highlight the benefits of both the Korean free trade agreement and, particularly, the Chinese free trade agreement, which has just been reached, at least in headline form, over the next few months. I look forward to Andrew Robb continuing his stellar performance and convincing the Indian nation that it is indeed in their great interest and ours to advance the cause of free trade.

Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (16:54):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 and its cognate bill the Customs Tariff Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. These two bills are being enacted to meet our obligations under the various chapters of the recent Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement and to enable changes to the Customs Act 1901 to achieve that.


I commend these bills to the House because this agreement has massive positive implications for our economy and our nation and for Japan as well. This agreement builds on the original agreement on commerce that was signed in 1957 by the Prime Minister of Japan at the time, Mr Kishi, and the Australian minister for trade at the time, 'Black Jack' McEwen. Our current trade minister, Mr Robb, has done an excellent job in achieving this agreement, the second in the trifecta of international trade agreements.


What does this trade agreement mean for the Lyne electorate? In the Lyne electorate there are many agricultural exporters, manufacturers and service providers, but it is the agricultural exporters who employ the most people who will be affected by this agreement. They employed many, many people who put food on the table for their families, pay wages and pay taxes to the government. With more trade comes more job security, because the jobs of one in four people in regional Australia are underpinned by foreign trade. A stronger economy at home will be a result of increased agriculture exports. We export to Japan $66.5 billion in goods and $4.3 billion in services. Japan has $131 billion invested here and we have $50 billion invested within Japan.


Tariffs on goods going into Japan mean the landed price of Australian goods is higher and make our products less price competitive compared to our competition. Dropping and reducing tariffs makes our products much more competitive. As a result, producers in the Lyne electorate and in broader Australia will benefit. It is not just the producers at this end who will benefit, consumers will as well. We all buy a lot of electrical goods and cars that come out of Japan. Admittedly, the tariffs remaining on Japanese goods coming into the country are not great, but five per cent on the price of a modern car is a significant reduction, and we as consumers will all see the benefit of that.


The Lyne electorate produces some of the best grass-fed and grass- and grain-finished beef in Australia. Currently the tariff is 38.5 per cent. Eventually that will fall to 19.5 per cent. That makes the $1.4 billion trade of Australian beef even better value to Japan, particularly relative to our competitors from North and South America. That means that there will be better prices at the rails at the cattle sales in Wauchope or Taree or Gloucester, eventually, because there will be more competition for Australian beef from exporters. There will be better prices and volumes for the Wingham Abattoir, the biggest employer in the Manning Valley. There will be better prices for marbled Hokubee beef, which is produced in Wauchope, when it is exported into Asia, particularly into Japan. These better export prices will eventually mean greater competition, more volume of trade and better prices at the farm gate. In addition to beef, cow hides can now enter Japan duty free. Again, that means stronger demand for the product that comes out of Wingham beef, a stronger local economy and a much more secure position for its 380 employees.


Between the Hastings and Manning valleys, Hannam Vale and Johns River areas and the Comboyne Plateau there is almost 30 per cent of the milk supply of New South Wales being produced. Most of this enters the daily fresh milk market, but extra supply can go into the export market. As a result of this trade agreement, the market for milk protein concentrates casein and lactose, which currently amounts to $53 million annually, can grow. We have duty-free quotas for cheese which can also grow.


On the North Coast of the Lyne electorate, we have a lot of wood products from North Coast Timbers and the mills at Herons Creek or up at Telegraph Point or down at Pambula, such as fibre boards, particle boards and structured and laminated timber, that can all go into the Japanese market. As mentioned earlier, with this free trade agreement, Australian produce is much more price competitive. That means there will be greater demand for Australian product and better product prices at the farm gate.


Wine production in the Lyne electorate has been going into the Japanese market for many years. Just down the road from where I live, the very prestigious Cassegrain Wines have been producing quality wine that has been served on the Shinkansen for up to a decade. They are part of the $42 million trade of wine exports into Japan, particularly the premium end of the market, such as restaurants, as well. The 15 per cent tariff will drop immediately to zero for bulk wine being imported into Japan. Bottled product will have the tariff drop slower. This will allow this industry to be so much more competitive relative to wines from France and Chile.


Also we have macadamias and avocadoes on the Comboyne Plateau and at Redhill and Telegraph Point at the north end of the Lyne electorate that feed into both the domestic market and the Australian export market. This is $16½ million worth of macadamias that feed into the Japanese market, most of which come from 400 producers on the North Coast. That market will grow as well. It is quite a small tariff, but every bit of price reduction means our product is much more competitive.


We do not have a lot produced seafood in our area, but there is a significant crustacean and lobster market which feeds mainly into the local market. But if other big producers in the domestic market are now exporting to Japan, it means our product from the North Coast will be that much more competitive. Whole new opportunities will come into play with this free trade agreement, so I wholeheartedly support these two bills.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (17:03):  The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement will offer opportunities to Australian businesses, individuals and companies. I want to use my time to start with to congratulate the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb. He has done a huge job that should not be underestimated—three major free trade agreements in a year. The weight of work that has gone on behind the scenes is huge. I know that the minister has applied himself and all of the resources at his disposal to get this done. These are truly landmark free trade agreements for Australia and they will see benefits almost ad infinitum in this country.


Australian companies and businesses have been given an opportunity. That is one of the best things we as a government can do—give them an opportunity. That is what these free trade agreements do. We know that Japan is a vital, longstanding and highly complementary economic partner for Australia. We will also see through this free trade agreement and partnership with Japan a strengthening of our bilateral relationship, something that we on this side of the House certainly do not underestimate.


In 2013 two-way goods and services trade with Japan reached $70.8 billion, making Japan Australia's second largest trading partner, with a surplus to Australia of $28.3 billion. The latest merchandise trade figures show Japan was Australia's second largest goods export destination and third largest source of imports in 2013. At the end of 2013, Japanese investment in Australia was valued at $131 billion and Australian investment in Japan was valued at $50.2 billion.


Despite the strong and mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship between Japan and Australia over a sustained period, we have seen the absence of a bilateral trade agreement. That has constrained Australian producers and exporters and their ability to further build trade in the context of high tariffs. It has maintained inefficient barriers to Australia's trade, which has also limited profitability. It certainly has not provided protection for Australia's exporters against preferential agreements that Japan has concluded or is negotiating with key competitors. It maintained higher costs for Australian consumers and businesses for key Japanese imports and maintained barriers to investment in trade and services. We heard that in Australia services are 70 per cent of our economy and only 17 per cent of our exports. So there is a great opportunity for growth in that sector in all of the free trade agreements.


The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement also provides an opportunity to take this bilateral relationship to the next level and further build the framework underpinning a key economic partnership for Australia. As we know, Australian exporters have faced very high tariffs into Japan, with customs duties levied on 6.5 per cent of Australian goods exported to that country. These are particularly high in agriculture, a vital area of trade for Australia, with an average tariff of 16.6 per cent. As Japan is Australia's second largest agricultural market, with an estimated total value of $4 billion in 2013, it is Australia's largest market for beef, cheese, animal feed and offal and an important destination for sugar, vegetable oil, seafood, fruit and nuts. Of course, Japan historically has imposed high tariffs on a range of agricultural goods, particularly on those key products of interest for Australia, including beef, dairy, wheat, sugar, barley, vegetable oils, tuna and rice.


Any agreement and any change in this certainly provides opportunities for businesses, for individuals and for companies—the opening of the door. Of course, many agricultural exports also confronted complex or opaque regulatory frameworks that included things from tariff rate quotas, state trading and special safeguard and emergency tariffs. So, in the absence of an EPA with Japan, Australian producers—agricultural producers—would continue to face these very high tariffs and complex barriers on major products. It is not just agricultural products; Japan is also Australia's second largest market for non-agricultural goods, with exports worth over $42 billion. It is Australia's largest destination for coal and liquefied natural gas, second-largest destination for iron ore and a major market for petroleum and aluminium.


In keeping my remarks similar to the ones that I have made, I really wanted to focus on the fact that the opening of the doors—the strengthening of the bilateral arrangement—is a key deliverable from this agreement. Once again, I will finish where I started. I know, as every member on our side does, the power of work that has been done by the minister to deliver these three critical free trade agreements. It has been an outstanding effort. In my speech today I want to recognise his efforts and all of those who have been working on this through the department—through DFAT. I think the job they have done has been absolutely outstanding. I have no doubt that the general economy as well as individual companies, individual businesses and individual industries are those that will benefit from the work that has been completed.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (17:09):  I echo the words of the previous speaker. Australia's relationship with Japan has been of enormous weight and importance to us dating right back to obviously before World War II. But, most ominously, the foresight of Robert Menzies to initiate trade agreements as early as 12 years after the end of World War II certainly stood Australia apart from the rest of the developed world in developing that relationship early; it has proven to be an important one. Over the last few decades we have seen a rise in the optimism of Australia that Japan would be a reliable, solid trading partner—culturally important as well. Linguistically, it has become a major language taught in our schools. Through the seventies, we had a proliferation of Japanese becoming available to school students—I was one who studied Japanese for five years. We were always dealing with a degree of hysteria about Asia at the same time. I can remember, in the mid seventies, proposals for the Iwasaki resort in Yeppoon, Queensland, was met by ferocious opposition. The fact that there could possibly be Japanese investment on a small patch of Queensland land would bring an end to the Australia as we knew it. How wrong we were at the time, and how far we have moved on.


Japan, despite being in the economic doldrums for the last 15 years, remains a massive trading partner—the third largest economy in the world and second-largest export market and trading partner for Australia. We were right to jump in early and become not only a source of resources, energy and manufacturing but agriculture and food. Japan respects the relationship, no more strongly exemplified than by the visit of the Japanese Prime Minister earlier this year and the close relationship that he shared with our Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.


What, of course, we need with Japan is to recognise that it is the last great advanced economy for which we did not have a high-quality trade agreement, of those nations with which we had a highly developed trade arrangement. What we are now seeing in this shift, quite rapidly, with the work of the trade minister, will be a series of trade agreements with developing economies—some of the giant economies that are in the G20 and moving up to be the economies of the future. It is a very, very subtle but important shift, moving from advanced economy FTAs like that of Japan, the US, Singapore and New Zealand through to a focus on India, China and, potentially, Indonesia. These three massive economies with very, very high populations that are looking for significant capital investments and significant energy and food security place Australia in an incredibly important place.


We are a nation that, as I have said many times before, has a small population with a high capital base. With that low labour ratio, we need all hands on deck and every Australian trained as highly as possible to do the jobs of tomorrow. We do not yet have that. We still import around 175,000 overseas nationals to do the work that we need done in this country because we are unable to train Australians to do that work. That should be a challenge for us; that is a challenge because 175,000 salaries repatriated to overseas economies is simply a missed opportunity for Australian families. On the same token, we have 133,000 people leaving school every year going straight onto Newstart who are utterly unemployable. It is this skilling mismatch which has to be the policy challenge for Australia over the next decade.


Eliminations of tariffs, as I have said, are wonderful. It is extraordinary that it was almost grinding to a halt under the previous Labor government. How could they make such little progress over six years unless there was a subtle and deliberate intention to not engage in bilateral agreements? They were not moving forward any multiparty agreements either. There was just no real respect for the fact that reducing tariffs between economies is a win-win. Much of it is this focus on who is going to do better out of a free trade agreement; will it be the large economy or will it be the small one? Let us be honest, in any free trade agreement, the absolute benefit is probably going to swing slightly towards the larger economy. But in a relative sense the benefits accrue to the smaller economy and the benefits probably accrue to an export economy. If you are a major internal consumption economy, the benefits of trade liberalisation are slightly less. But for Australia what we dig up, what we grow and what we produce is, because of our small population, mostly exported. We benefit from freer trade. These have been listed by previous speakers, and I do not need to go through them again, but I want to highlight some of the large ones. Obviously these are around resources. If we can have a situation where 99.7 per cent of all of our export products in energy, agriculture and resources become tariff free to an economy like Japan, it just creates so many more jobs.


These percentages have been rolling off the tongues of analysts over the last few weeks, but let's remind ourselves what a one per cent reduction in a tariff means. In a highly competitive, liberalised economic market, reducing tariffs by one per cent simply makes your product one per cent cheaper in the destination economy. That is enough to swing sales and that is enough to change market share. That therefore has massive volume impacts for the producer. If we can export more, this is simply a multiplier—volume and profit.


It is a wonderful opportunity for Australia that we seem to have just forsaken for six years under a Labor government. I am yet to hear an adequate explanation for why all of these free-trade agreements, which mostly started in the Howard years, stalled for six years. It is economically damaging that they did so. The fact that they could only sign one—it was effectively one that we had almost completely negotiated for them, so all they had to do was submit the paperwork—is a real blight on the record of the Labor government. I hope that is highlighted in greater detail.


I say that to the miners out there and I say that to the agricultural providers, particularly beef providers. They stand to be $5.5 billion better off because of this beef agreement. That is just one sector. Compare that with the molestation of the live-trade agreement under the previous Labor government and the sorrow, the indebtedness and the destruction that they wrought on live export by hasty decision. That has killed of not just one year but many family dynasties who were involved in live export. It was a horrible price to pay by a short-sighted government that did not respect the importance of our trade relationship with our near Asian neighbours. I pleased to say today that that era is closed.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (17:16):  It is very good to have an opportunity to speak on this most critical area of the free-trade agreement between Australia and Japan. I think there is no more important economic policy area than free trade. We talk a lot about removing red tape from the economy, removing impediments and so on. The reality is that the international system of trade barriers and protections represents probably the single most value-destructive act of global governance over the last century.


That is because what we are talking about in free trade liberalisation is effectively undoing the work that nations have done in previous era. When you impose a tariff on the product, you make it more expensive and you make it less attractive to buy. Consequently, less of it gets bought. You also make it more difficult on the other side for people in your own nation to manufacture goods, because it is harder to sell them overseas. It is just an economic philosophy that is entirely flawed and entirely wrong.


But, interestingly, it took this government to actually do something about it with our big trading partners—Korea, Japan and China. All within the space of 12 months, the Minister for Trade has managed to secure these blockbuster agreements. The Japanese agreement is the one we are talking about today. It is our second largest trading partner. There is more than $70 billion in trade relations and 97 per cent of our exports will now be free of tariffs or treated preferentially as a result of this deal. Earlier, we have the tremendous outcome on the Korean agreement as well. Just last week, there was the China agreement, which will benefit businesses like the owners of Lamb & Cumin, which is located in Hurstville in my electorate of Banks. We do not have a lot of lambs in the electorate of Banks, but we do have business people who export lamb product to China. They will benefit immensely from the liberalisation of free trade under this agreement.


The question is, as the member for Bowman alluded to, why this did not happen in the last six years. Why did it not happen? Why did we have this pause button on trade liberalisation during the entire period of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government? The reason is very clear. That is that they did not really believe in free trade. They did not really believe that these agreements were politically attractive for them and for their union base. As a consequence, they did not pursue them.


If you go back to 2008, the member for Lilley showed great foresight when he said in relation to the free-trade agreement with China:


We're negotiating with the Chinese but I don't anticipate any outcome of that process for some time…


He said that back in 2008 and he was absolutely right. That was because it took six years and a change of government for there to be some outcome. You do wonder why it took so long and it took a change of government.


Again, in 2011 the member for Lilley, who was the Treasurer of the whole country of Australia, was involved—according to The Australian Financial Review—in arguments within cabinet to the effect that the politics of free trade were not very good and, as a consequence, the government should not pursue it. The AFR at the time, through Matthew Franklin, said:


…at least four sources have agreed that Mr Swan, with the backing of several other ministers, challenged the political saleability of trade reform.


There it is: politics before substance and media releases before the actual business of doing government. What we know about our Minister for Trade is that he is not focused on tomorrow's press releases. He is focused on the hard execution and the hard work that actually leads to real results. That is what we have seen over the last 12 months. It is not about putting out some fantasy press release; it is about actually closing deals. That is what he has done.


In a statement in 2012 that you could describe making a virtue of necessity, then Minister for Trade Craig Emerson—who I believe had quite a lengthy title in his previous role, but trade was among that—actually said:


Free trade agreements, I think frankly, are overrated in what they can achieve in terms of a relationship between Australia and China.


Overrated? Come to Hurstville and tell that to the many small business people in my electorate who are trading every day with China in relation to tourism, professional services and many other areas. The former minister for trade should come to Hurstville and say to them that free trade with China is overrated. It is not overrated; it is actually a blockbuster breakthrough that has been delivered by the minister for trade. It is a fantastic thing for my electorate of Banks. It is a fantastic thing for the entire nation. We see, in the Japanese agreement, the Korean agreement and of course now the Chinese agreement, what happens when you have clear convictions, a clear philosophy and the people, frankly, with the capacity and horsepower to get hard work done. That is what you see in this government, and that is why we have been successful in free trade. Certainly, the bill we discussed today is a great exemplification of that, and I commend it to the House.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (17:23):  It is great to rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 and related bill. It is very exciting to talk about the trifecta of success that the coalition government have delivered on free trade within our first year of coming to government. We have seen within, effectively, 12 months of the election the coalition government signing historic free trade agreements with Korea, with Japan and with China. This is good for the economy. This is good for consumers. It is good for exporters, but ultimately this is good news for job creation here in Australia.


These agreements will change the face of the Australian workforce for generations to come. In no short measure, these agreements provide new opportunities to the next generation of Australians to grow the products that go into the growing Asian market, and to deliver the services that the over a billion people that are coming into the middle class in Asia will require. If you were a young Australian today, these three agreements could ultimately change the jobs that you find across the working life that you might have. These are absolutely historic agreements. Here, in this Japanese agreement that we are discussing today, this is the first time that Japan has signed an agreement with a major exporter, particularly a major agriculture exporter. For beef, where we have got over a $5 billion advantage, for dairy, for horticulture and for nuts, the advantage that we have with Japan is an advantage that almost no other nation on earth has. If you are an Australian exporter going into the Japanese market, there is not another country that you are competing with that can compete in the same way that Australia can as a result of this historic agreement.


The minister for trade has just walked into the chamber and I congratulate him. He has become an absolute rock star of the coalition's first year in government, delivering things that many of our critics said could not be delivered. Here we stand, a very short period of time after the last federal election, with the delivery of three historic agreements.


Just recently, we saw the signing of the Chinese agreement and we got everything we wanted and more on agriculture, and that is great news for our country and great news for jobs. But the big thing in the Chinese agreement—and one that I think the public is just underestimating a little bit at the moment but in the decades to come will come to appreciate as transformative for our economy—is that we have access in the service side in health, in child care, in architecture and in law into the Chinese market. Again, no other country on earth has that level of access, where 100 per cent Australian owned companies can go into the Chinese marketplace and deliver these things. What this means is very simple: in a market of 1.3 billion people where literally millions of people are coming into the middle class, they are going to become consumers of our services, of our education services, of our childcare services, of our healthcare services and of architecture and of law. This is an enormous market, and the Chinese free trade agreement gives access into the Chinese market that effectively, in many cases, no other country on earth has in terms of advantage or that access. So I am very excited as part of the coalition government and as the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to be talking today about delivering on these three historic free trade agreements, something that is great for the economy, great for exporters, great for consumers and, above all else, will create thousands of new jobs across the decades to come here in Australia.

"Varvaris, Nickolas, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr VARVARIS
 (Barton) (17:27):  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on today's combined bill, the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, on the Australian-Japanese economic partnership that the coalition has concluded in recent months. This important partnership agreement was seven years in the making, and I am proud that this side of the House was able to successfully complete it within their first term of government. Today's customs amendment bill and customs tariff amendment bill will ensure that one of our most vital trading and investment partners will mutually thrive in a competitive global environment.


Whilst Australia and Japan have enjoyed a warm international relationship driven by mutual interests, there is no denying that Australia's largest trading partner and source of capital investment plays a significant role in further enhancing Australia's growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. I am excited by this economic partnership agreement and what the bills today will mean for Australian exporters, the agriculture sector and other Australian businesses. Increased bilateral trade, investment and closer economic integration benefit both countries and ensure that Australian businesses remain viable now and into the future. 


The recent agreement is a comprehensive, wide ranging one that provides both countries with more liberal access to goods, services and investment markets. It will also ensure that Australian businesses have more accessibility and ease to do business in Japan, which was previously marred by opaque regulations, high tariffs and complex bureaucracy. Australian exporters of consumer goods, non-consumer goods and those in the tourism, education and healthcare sectors all stand to benefit from this economic partnership agreement. More than 97 per cent of Australia's exports to Japan will receive preferential access or enter duty-free when the agreement is fully implemented.


Today's bill will also amend the Customs Act to enable imported goods to enter Australia at a preferential rate of customs levy. In addition, goods imported to Australia that have originated from Japan will have preferential entry. Without the Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan, Australian agricultural and horticultural producers will continue to face high tariffs on commercial agreements, making Australian producers' market share in Japan increasingly difficult to sustain. Australia's ongoing competitive position in Japan is not guaranteed due to the myriad strong producers coming from other nations such as the USA; therefore, the EPA is the first step to ensure that our export businesses can be commercially viable in a saturated market.


It is important to point out that Japan has also been concurrently negotiating trade agreements with other key competitors, including the European Union, Canada, the United States and New Zealand, with trade agreements already in place with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Chile, India, Mexico and Peru. The coalition's signing of the EPA will not only deliver tariff elimination and reductions for Australian businesses; it will also position our country above our competitors, through strong renegotiation provisions should Japan provide better access for the above mentioned competitors. Not having signed and delivered the EPA would have been extremely regrettable for our producers. If we did nothing, Australian exporters would face steep tariffs, resulting in loss of market share and no competitive advantage over Japan's other trading partners. We would also be denying Australian consumers cheaper imports. 


Japan is a vital and longstanding economic partner. In 2013 alone, our two-way goods and services reached $70.8 billion, of which $28.3 billion was surplus for Australia. For exports, Japan was our second-largest market, with 15.5 per cent of export goods leaving Australia. Yet, Australian exporters face a custom levy of 6.5 per cent of goods exported to Japan, whilst Australian agricultural businesses face an even higher tariff of 16.6 per cent. Japanese trade and investment in Australia in 2013 was valued at $131 billion, whilst Australia's trade and investment in Japan stood at $50.2 billion. Given that Japan is Australia's second-largest agricultural partner and that agriculture is also Australia's vital area of trade, the EPA will make an enormous positive impact on rural and regional communities. High quality Australian goods such as beef, cheese, animal feed, offal, sugar, vegetable oils, seafood, fruit and nuts are some of our most favoured products in Japan, and it would be a real shame for these exporters to lose market share simply due to tariffs. Similarly, Australian wine producers face stiff competition from countries such as Chile, who already have a tariff advantage through its existing trade agreement with Japan. In 2013, Chilean wine exports rose to $178 million, whilst imports from Australia actually decreased to $46 million. Again, given that Australia is world-renowned for its wine quality and its close proximity to Japan, it would be senseless not to be able to export a large quantity due to customs duties. The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement also guarantees access to the Japanese market for a range of lucrative Australian service providers due to Australia's high reputation in areas such as financial, legal, education and telecommunications services. I commend the bill to the House.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (17:33):  I rise to conclude the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, and thank the House for the opportunity. The bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1955 that will implement Australia's tariff commitments set out in the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. These amendments are complementary to those contained in the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. 


In summing up, I would firstly like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate. It is a most significant agreement that we have reached with the Japanese government and the Japanese people. It will lay the groundwork to take our relationship, which has been a very strong one, to another level altogether. You could see the sense of interest in Japan in the concluding weeks of this agreement and the enthusiasm with which Prime Minister Abe, his senior colleagues, the most senior business leaders within Japan and the many others throughout their community received this agreement. This does indicate that the relationship which has been forged since 1957, when the original commercial agreement was signed, is now going to be taken to a new level altogether.


Of course, Japan is Australia's second-most important trading partner, taking nearly $50 billion of Australian exports of goods and services in 2012-13. They supplied imports of goods and services worth $21 billion in the same year, and Australia has a trade surplus of $28 billion with Japan. They are also our third-largest source of foreign direct investment, with over $126 billion invested in Australia. So, as is often seen in history when there is a strong trading relationship, you end up with a strong and mutually beneficial investment relationship, and that has been the case with Japan. This agreement not only goes to trade but also to investment. There is a very strong investment chapter to try to ensure that the ease of doing business in Australia is maximised and that the encouragement for doing business in Australia is maximised. It is most appropriate that our two countries have reached this agreement. 


Negotiations on JAEPA commenced in 2007, the year in which we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the first Japan-Australia commerce agreement. JAEPA takes our relationship, as I said, to a new level. It demonstrates that Australia can continue to forge deeper relations with our old friends, while accommodating the arrival of new friends. As other speakers have mentioned this afternoon, we have just concluded the free trade agreement with China, which is in a similar vein to Japan's. It is a very comprehensive and very protection-eliminating document. Again, it goes very strongly into service areas, as does the Japanese agreement. 


The big growth for Australia in the future will be in the services area. In exports, of course, resources and energy will continue to be a feature for hundreds of years for Australia, and similarly agriculture and agribusiness will be a mainstay of our trade for centuries. We are the most knowledge based economy in the region, along with Japan, and our services are much in demand. Currently, 80 per cent of our GDP is services, yet the services sector contributes only 15 per cent of our exports. In many cases the failure of growth in the services sector has occurred because of the many barriers erected by many of the countries in the region, which prevent the ease of doing services business in those economies: services like legal work, engineering work, architectural work, project management services, auctioneering services, perhaps, anything to do with town planning services, education, health and ageing. In all of these areas we have world-class expertise, and our capacity to contribute so much in the region around us is starting to be realised by these countries. 


Our long-term relationship with Japan and with Korea has led to two free trade agreements which were finalised earlier this year. Both of those countries have allowed a significant opening up of services arrangements between our two countries. The China agreement—the third in the trifecta—is a remarkable document for the opportunities Australian services have in that market, which no-one else has. It is the leading edge and there are literally dozens and dozens of opportunities that have been granted to us by the Chinese government that they have not given to anyone else at this stage.


After seven years of negotiations, JAEPA is the most liberalising agreement Japan has ever concluded. It goes a lot further towards freer trade, especially in agricultural products, than Japan would be prepared to give in the WTO. The big feature of the Japanese agreement is that not only it is strong on services, but that for the first time the five untouchable areas in trade agreements were confronted; and, outside of rice, we saw movement in all of them and some significant movement, especially in beef and sheep meats. It is really an agreement which will take our relationship and our opportunities in the agricultural space to a whole new level. In fact former US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, Kurt Campbell, described the agreement as 'a massive victory for Australia', and he observed that Europe and the United States had been trying to get this kind of agreement from Japan for 30 years. 


Most speakers have detailed the huge benefits that we will have in things like frozen beef with a sliding scale of cuts in tariffs and with a very big up-front cut. If the agreement enters into force before April next year—as I am certain it will—we will get a cut and then we will get another one after 1 April. There will be a 10 per cent total reduction in tariff in the first four months of this agreement, and that will be an advantage over the US market of 10 per cent—and they are our biggest competitor in the Japanese market for beef. That 10 per cent advantage will increase up to 19 per cent in subsequent years. In a similar way we have seen opportunities with the guaranteed safety net that says any improvements bilaterally negotiated for access by the US with Japan will be automatically applied to Australia. So with the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, if the United States finds itself with any advances on what we have achieved, then we will automatically receive those same advantages. We have also negotiated removal of the 50 per cent global snapback tariff being applied to Australia when volumes exceed a trigger level. In other words, if they feel the increase in imports is getting too high too fast, there will be a trigger which discourages other imports, and that trigger will not apply to Australian agricultural products. Dairy producers receive a tariff-free quota of 20,000 tonnes for cheese, which is in addition to the current 28,000 tonnes under the WTO. 


There is a whole raft of other benefits—tariffs on most seafoods, fruit, vegetables, nuts, honey and wine will all be eliminated in between one and 10 years—most of them are front-end loaded. Australian wine was worth $42 million in exports to Japan last year, but it has been losing market share to Chile since Chile signed an FTA with Japan. JAEPA allows us to level the playing field with Chile and gain immediate advantage over key competitors, such as France, Italy, Spain and the US. Outside of agriculture the agreement provides an immediate elimination of all remaining tariffs on minerals and bulk resources. This includes immediate elimination of the 3.2 per cent tariff on our $89 million worth of coking coal exports and the 7.9 per cent tariff on our $74 million petroleum and oils exports to Japan.


In services JAEPA will also allow Australian financial services companies to provide investment and portfolio management services to Japanese customers. This is significant, as Japan has the second largest pool of pension funds globally after the US. Japan has also agreed to expedite registration procedures for Australian lawyers and has committed to allowing Australian lawyers to form professional legal corporations in Japan. A raft of different qualifications and professions where mutual recognition is either going to be allowed or considered after a review process. 


We will form a committee to review this agreement on a continuing basis so that everyone can see that this is a dynamic document. This is a living document. This is a document that will move with the times. It is a 21st century trade and investment agreement and one that will make our relationship stronger than it has ever been before. So it is something to celebrate. 


I notice that there is an amendment from those opposite. I make the comment that the three requirements that the opposition are looking for are unnecessary. They are looking for an inclusion to not agree to any investor state dispute settlement provisions in this agreement. But it is not in there. We are just about to have it enter into force. Secondly it says, 'to enact policies to ensure that Australian workers benefit from jobs growth'. That is the whole point of this agreement, to create more jobs. That is what we are doing in seeking to clean up the economic mess that we inherited; to make the best advantage of the three agreements. Much of our objective is to stop the recklessly high levels of spending built into previous governments' programs and replace that debt-fuelled government spending with private sector activity. 


These three agreements—and this one in particular from Japan—will further increase the opportunities for investment from these countries, but also for trade, which will build growth here and will build profits. It will give confidence to more investors locally. It will slow the growth of government spending and replace it with private sector activity in our local economy, which is fundamental to our long-term sustainable growth objectives. 


I do not see a need to support the amendments. The final element that the opposition wanted was to utilise the review mechanisms in the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, to seek further market access gains, especially in agriculture. That is a sound sentiment, but we put that review in so that we could further achieve gains in agriculture. So I think it is unnecessary.


Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to summarise some significant contributions that we have had in this debate. It is a very important occasion for Australia to sign off and enter into force this landmark agreement which will help set up, along with the other two agreements, the foundations for strong trade and investment between Australia and our three big partners in the region. It will build jobs and prosperity for many decades to come.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:16):  What Andrew Robb has done with this free trade agreement with Japan is a fantastic thing. Just before the election in 2013 Andrew Robb addressed a capacity crowd at a lunch in Townsville. The words he said that day will stay with me always. He said that in the tropical world—that is, between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer—there are around 600 million people who would be considered to be in the middle class and by 2035 that number is expected to grow to 3.6 billion. Most of those people will be directly on top of North Queensland, so it is important to be able to get free trade agreement signed. We have signed free trade agreements with Korea and China and there are more to come.


My region, my state and our country are perfectly positioned in that space. What we must do, though, is remember that this is not just about food and fibre, it is not just about mining. This agreement and the agreement with China have also freed up the services economy. We have got a bunch of school kids up behind the glass and I say hello to them. You can only sell an asset once; you can sell something to an overseas country once and you can trade those sorts of things. But Australia is a service based economy. When you kids graduate from high school, go to university or get yourself a trade—if you go into the Army and become a logistician—the great things that you learn will put you in good stead to feed into this service based economy, to be the representatives of Australia and take our economy further. This is not just about food and fibre. This is one of the things that Andrew Robb has been saying all the way through. It is about our services—accountants, solicitors, town planners, architects, builders and our construction industry. All those people will feed into this. It is the people who run nursing homes, our nurses. All those trades that you kids will do when you leave school will feed into what this free trade agreement tries to do.


We have to understand where we are in the world and the opportunity that we have in this space. We have an opportunity to service 3.6 billion people, most of whom live directly above us in the Asian zone. That is the massive opportunity that we have. What we must also understand is that just signing a free trade agreement does not mean that the job is done. A free trade agreement is just an invitation to the table. All a free trade agreement does is give you an opportunity to impress. When you run a dairy farm and want to make sure that your top-quality cheese, yoghurt and milk gets into these markets, you get an opportunity through a free trade agreement to present to people in these markets. But you still have to close the deal. You still have to use your ability as a salesperson and the quality of your product to get that job done. A free trade agreement allows you deliver your product for the price they are prepared to pay and make a profit along the way. The Minister for Trade, Andrew Robb, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are doing a great job into space. We are in this game and it has taken 10 long years of hard work across three or four parliaments to get this work done. We are doing it because, when I am older, I will need you guys to look after me. That is why we are doing it. It will make sure that you guys will have the opportunity to get in there and have a real go.


I am from Townsville. Townsville has two Japanese sister cities—Shunan, which is located in Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Iwaki. In that space, we are reaching out on a cultural basis. This is not just across coal, wheat, grapes or wine; it includes our arts, our culture. We have a massive ability to provide for people in this space. This free trade agreement is a great thing for Australia. The work that Andrew Robb has done in this space has been fantastic for our country. The work is still going on and it will be perfect for when you guys start to leave school. That is the message that I want to hear. My son is in grade 7. When he leaves school, when he gets in this space, I want to make sure that the has an opportunity to make a real name for himself when he goes overseas. I thank the House and I support this legislation wholeheartedly.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (16:22):  I rise today to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. This bill represents a great opportunity for Australia. I take this time to pay tribute to our fantastic trade minister, the member for Goldstein, Mr Andrew Robb, for his proven leadership, his effortless negotiation and commitment to building positive relationships between Australia and Japan. Australia and Japan have enjoyed close ties over the years, but this economic partnership agreement is a historic agreement that will benefit Australians for decades to come.


Under the leadership of the trade minister, Australians have witnessed the largest Australian trade envoys reaching out to Japan, China and South Korea. Each of these trade delegations have resulted in positive outcomes for the Australian economy, Australian business and Australian consumers. The Abbott government's message to the world is crystal clear: Australia is now under new management and we are open for business. I am proud to say that throughout all these rigorous negotiations our government has kept the national interest at the forefront of their decision making. The coalition stated from the outset that these agreements must be in our national interest, and we have delivered.


The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is a great win for the Australian economy and for the people of Macarthur. It represents the best quality trade deal that Japan has ever concluded. More than 97 per cent of Australia's current trade with Japan will receive preferential access or enter duty free when the agreement is fully implemented, giving Australian farmers, producers, manufacturers and exporters a significant competitive advantage. The agreement encompasses a wide range of goods and services. Most importantly, it represents a fantastic deal for Australian farmers. As one of our most valuable beef markets, this new agreement with Japan will see our beef exports, which are currently worth $1.4 billion, receive an immediate and significant competitive advantage through rapid tariff reductions. Fresh beef producers and live cattle exporters will also benefit from reductions in tariffs. Additionally, and very importantly, Japan has agreed that Australian beef will never again be subjected to the 50 per cent global snapback tariff, creating certainty for our beef and cattle exporters.


Another excellent feature of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is the agreement by Japan to review and negotiate these outcomes on beef, which will provide a positive framework towards further liberalisation. This framework includes a review triggered immediately if Japan provides another country with a better deal on beef, aimed at providing Australia equivalent treatment; an automatic review aimed at improving access five years after this current agreement comes into force; and a review of the safeguard mechanism after 10 years to consider abolishing the safeguard or increasing the safeguard trigger levels which are set above current trade levels. This feature is incredibly important in ensuring that Australia's interests, and our commitment to building and maintaining trade relationships with Japan, is not second bested by other global competitors. It represents a great deal for the Australian economy and for Australian farmers. I am pleased to see aspects of this framework featuring in many of the agricultural and horticultural tariff items.


Dairy farmers and producers are also beneficiaries of this historic agreement with Japan. Dairy products, predominately cheeses, are one of Australia's biggest agricultural exports to Japan. These exports were worth $452 million in 2013. Under the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, Australian dairy producers will receive significant preferential access on key dairy exports, including cheese, ice-cream and yoghurt. Exports of milk based products will receive immediate duty free access, with products including lactose, casein, milk albumen and milk protein concentrates. The Macarthur electorate has one of Australia's largest dairies, the Leppington Pastoral Company. I look forward to seeing the many benefits of this agreement for our dairy farmers and producers within the Macarthur region.


At the last election the coalition made a commitment to the Australian people that we would build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. With this agreement we are delivering on this promise. Australian importers of Japanese manufactured items will benefit from reductions in Australian tariffs and, in some cases, the elimination of Australian tariffs on some items. This is particularly important for the agricultural sector. The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement will be a great coup for my electorate of Macarthur, which has a growing agricultural sector. A local advocate for this agreement is Mr Eric Gilleland and his sons Rhys and Brett of Macarthur Mowers and Marine who are looking forward to seeing the benefits of reduced tariffs in agricultural machinery and council and golf course mowing equipment. Macarthur Mowers and Marine have just secured an exclusive agreement with the Japanese manufacturing giant, IHI Industries, to import the high-quality Shibaura golf course and council mowing equipment for New South Wales. As the largest dealer for Japanese manufactured Shindaiwa power equipment in Australia, Macarthur Mowers and Marine stand to gain a competitive edge with more affordable prices for Macarthur consumers.


I am excited about seeing the benefits of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement in the Macarthur electorate. Local Macarthur families will benefit from greater competition within the consumer goods market, meaning a better deal on many electronic and household products. This will help to reduce some of the cost-of-living pressures faced by families across Macarthur. My electorate can only stand to win from this agreement, and I look forward to seeing the fruits of closer ties with one of Australia's closest trading partners.


I commend this bill to the House and I thank the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the trade minister and the Minister for Immigration and Border Security, as well as all of the departments who have worked so hard to secure this great deal for Australia and the people of Macarthur.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (16:28):  I rise to speak on the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation Bill 2014. Imagine if I said to you that I had discovered a one-shot caffeine hit for the Australian economy—a boost that would drive jobs, investment, productivity and real incomes; a boost that would strengthen our best sectors and organisations and create opportunities for growth in massive new markets. That is exactly what good free trade agreements do. And, after years of procrastination, we finally have a government that is prepared to get on with negotiating quality free trade agreements.


I came into this parliament because I believed that a more open, more outward-looking Australia would be a better Australia. I came into this parliament because I believed that the massive and fast-growing markets to our north offered unprecedented opportunities for Australia. But the previous government had no idea how to realise this potential. Australia is in fact far less open than we often think. Our exports amount to little over 20 per cent of GDP, and many of our competitors are far ahead of us: the UK at 32 per cent, Korea at 57 per cent, Canada at 30 per cent, New Zealand at 29 per cent and China at 27 per cent.


I saw time and time again in my career prior to entering the parliament how opening up an economy to these sorts of opportunities, the sorts of opportunities that we are implementing in this bill, is absolutely transformational. The start of Australia's strong economic history began with a trade agreement with the UK for wool in the 1830s, and soon after we saw a similar sort of agreement with the UK in gold. After the war we saw an agreement with the Japanese for coal and more recently, in the late sixties, we opened up our massive and now extraordinarily beneficial iron ore industry with the Japanese. We all know well the story of the iron ore boom in Australia's north-west which began in the early 2000s and which we are still benefiting from, and if we look a little further afield we see the boom in the South Island of New Zealand driven by white powder—milk powder. I know that these opportunities have an enormous amount to offer us, and I saw some of the most recent of them, particularly around iron ore and milk powder in New Zealand, at very close quarters. 


I learnt very early on that these opportunities are easily missed. It is easy to find an excuse to avoid pursuing them, it is easy to put roadblocks in the way and it is easy to listen to the naysayers who will tell you that this is fool's gold and that there are so many different trade-offs you have to make that you never get a deal done. Fortunately we have a minister who has executed on these deals and would have none of this naysaying. We have seen three transformational agreements this year, as we said we would—with Japan, with Korea and with China. Of course the one we are talking about today in this bill is the one with Japan, and we look forward to a similar agreement with India. This bill is intended to support the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. We know that negotiations began in 2007 and did not conclude until April 2014—by an extraordinary coincidence, it seemed that not very much happened in that period between 2007 and 2013, when Labor was in power. The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to introduce new rules of origin for goods imported into Australia.


The benefits of free trade agreements are not always well understood, and I want to focus on the benefits for a moment. Not only do these agreements bring lower prices for the importing countries and better access and higher prices for the exporting countries but also they do something else very important—they allow us to specialise, allow us to focus on our great strengths. Adam Smith worked this out several centuries ago when he talked about the pin factory. He noted that by specialising, by allowing people to focus on what they did best, by breaking up a task into its smaller components, we could drive enormous levels of productivity. In fact, the industrial revolution was built around that very simple insight. We are seeing exactly the same thing happening right now in the global economy. An iPhone has 451 components, and the 10 most valuable come from six different countries. That is specialisation, that is what we are seeing in the global economy at the moment, and that is exactly why these trade agreements are so important—because we need to back our strengths. We need to focus on our strengths, and nowhere is that more important than when we look at agriculture. The naysayers quote from a Productivity Commission report that was done a number of years ago and say that these agreements do not really deliver. Let me tell you what is so important about all three of these agreements with Japan, Korea and China—agriculture is a big part of them. Agriculture is one of our great strengths. These are large countries, large importers, and they offer great potential for us to focus on our strengths. As importantly, these agreements not only include agriculture but also extend to resources and services. We know that is where the economic growth will come for us beyond the current commodities boom.


In the time I have left I want to focus on some clear benefits I am already seeing in my electorate from this strengthening relationship with Asia. I was recently involved in the opening of the Hilltops abattoir at Young—an export beef facility which will employ, once at full capacity, 380 people. There has been millions of dollars of investment focused entirely on exporting meat up into Asia. We are already seeing the benefits of these deepening relationships. Brumby Aircraft out at Cowra have entered into a 40-year joint-venture with AVIC, a Chinese aircraft company, initially involving the export of 280 small aircraft up into China. The benefits from these free trade agreements, and in particular this Japanese free trade agreement, will be enormous. I commend the bill to the House.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (16:35):  The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is an irrevocable return to high friendship in the economic relations of Japan and Australia. JAEPA is the most liberalising trade agreement Japan has ever concluded. More than 97 per cent of Australia's exports to Japan will receive preferential access or enter Japan duty free. At the end of 2013, Japanese investment in Australia was valued at $131 billion and Australian investment in Japan reached $50.2 billion. Let the naysayers know that this relationship benefits us nearly three times as much as Japan. Gone will be the high barriers for trade with Japan, including agricultural tariffs of up to 219 per cent. There will be immediate duty-free access for milk protein concentrates as well as new opportunities for ice-cream and frozen yoghurt exports. Tariffs on macadamia nuts, asparagus, lobsters, crustaceans and shellfish will be eliminated immediately, and there will be immediate duty-free and quota-free access for wheat for feed and barley for feed as well as streamlined export arrangements for some Australian wheat varieties. This is a good move for WA, and it is an especially positive move for all WA wheat growers. 


JAEPA is a stepping stone, as it puts in place a framework to achieve an even better deal. Almost 30 years ago, in August 1986, US President Ronald Reagan signed an economic partnership agreement with Japan. In a radio address on 2 August 1986 he stated:


These agreements are examples of positive, result-oriented trade action. Instead of closing markets at home, we've opened markets to U.S. products abroad, thus helping to create more American jobs. … Because, believe me, when Americans are competing on a level playing field, they can outproduce and outsell anyone, anywhere in the world.


I trust and believe in Australia. I trust and believe in our Australian ingenuity and excellence. In trying to help workers in ailing industries, we must be careful that the cure is not worse than the disease, like the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the US that deepened and prolonged the Great Depression. Our plan is to create high-paying, sustainable jobs in the high-value-added goods and services sector. There is no other game in town. We either all get on board with the new rules of the game or we all lose out together.


I support the global growth targets of 2.1 per cent per annum agreed at the Brisbane G20. FTAs are our future. Tariff barriers are a redundant relic of history. Viewed in the context of our digital age, they are as outdated as other fashionable ideas from that period—and about as useful as an underwater hair dryer. Listen to some of the many pros of free trade: lower costs, increased purchasing power, comparative advantage improves economic growth. We compete in a globally connected, interdependent and competitive world.


In July the Business Council released a report that identified tourism, education, resources and energy, advanced manufacturing, agriculture and food manufacturing, professional and financial services as areas where Australia can be globally competitive. High-quality services are one of Australia's competitive strengths and largest areas of employment. The removal of trade restrictions in aged care, education, tourism, mining and construction, engineering and manufacturing services gives Australia an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from Japan's aged and ageing population.


The combined impact of the agreement with China, the FTAs signed this year with Japan and Korea, and a commitment to complete negotiations with India within 12 months puts Australia at the epicentre of Asian growth. We have achieved these agreements in the region that is set to account for half of the world's economic output. What the Howard government started, the Abbott government is finishing.


There are moral arguments to support free and freer trade among nations. Free trade respects the dignity and sovereignty of an individual. Free trade restrains the power of the state. Free trade brings people together across distance and cultures. Australia was built on foreign investment—first from Britain, then from America and, more recently, from Japan and China.


Japan and Australia are more alike than unalike. We have passed the days of horror. War is too short a syllable, too simple a word, to truly tell of the terrible, thundering terror of daily death, dismemberment and rape. To get to JAEPA has been a journey. Our achievement—our victory—is moving from questions and fears of attacks to questions and fear of a tax. This bill builds hope, reward, and opportunity.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:41):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. It was good to hear the member for Hume refer to the work of Adam Smith, probably one of the greatest intellects in the economics sphere, ever. It was in his work The Wealth of Nations, back in 1776, that he wrote:


It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy. … If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.


Two hundred and forty years of economic history have shown that Smith was right. Wherever countries have engaged in free trade, it has led to greater wealth, it has led to greater opportunity, it has led to more and high-paying jobs, and it has led to a higher standard of living. That is why we should give great praise to Minister Robb for the work that he has done, not just on this free trade agreement but also on the free trade agreements struck, within the first year of this coalition government, with China, Japan and Korea. It is an absolutely remarkable achievement that will have enormous benefits for our nation for decades to come.


In relation to our current trade with Japan, we imported from Japan over $21 billion in 2013. But we actually export to Japan, currently, more than double that. We currently sell to Japan almost $50 billion worth of goods and services. This is the base that we are working off. This free trade agreement gives us the opportunity to increase that base. It gives us opportunity across our agricultural sector and our manufacturing sector. It gives opportunity especially to our services sector. All those sectors have the opportunity to create more export sales, to create greater wealth for this nation and to create greater opportunity.


There are a few reasons that this is very important. Of course there is the wealth of the country, but it is also important, I would say, for many in our agricultural sector. Because having more companies, or more markets, to sell to helps break down the current economically damaging monopsony situation that many people in our food industry find themselves in with our overly concentrated supermarket sector. If those companies have export markets to sell to, they cannot be as easily held hostage by the demands of a powerful buyer. 


It is also very important because of the situation that we find ourselves in as a nation. There are many things that both sides of the House want to do. We want to provide more money for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance. But the only way we can do those things is to build the wealth, increase the wealth, of the country, and the best way to do that is through further free trade agreements.


We also have the job of fixing the current budget. We often talk about deficits and surpluses. I think, rather than saying the country is currently running a deficit, we should rephrase it and say we are running a loss. For the last six years, we as a nation have been running a loss. The Commonwealth government have been spending more money than we have been raising. That means we have to borrow money, which then creates an obligation not only to pay it back sometime in the future but also to pay the ongoing interest bill. That is what we face, with $1 billion in interest payable every single month, and we know that about 75 per cent of that flows out of the country. If we are going to turn that around, we need to increase our productivity, we need to increase the wealth of this nation, and free trade is one of the best ways we can do that.


The other benefit of this trade deal, of course, is the lower prices that it will lead to for Australian consumers. There are some doubting Thomases. But I will just leave you with one example. The EPA with Japan will reduce the duty on cars imported from Japan. It will reduce the price and make them duty-free. We have reduced the duties on cars over the last couple of years. If we look at a base-model Toyota Corolla, 20 years ago that was just under $20,000. Today, the very same starter-model Toyota Corolla has not increased 1c in price; it is still under $20,000. That is despite CPI increasing, over those 20 years, by something like 66 per cent. So you are getting a car for the same value as you were 20 years ago, but you are getting a better car, with improved features, greater fuel efficiency and more safety. That is because we have lowered tariffs; that is because we have lowered duties. 


The Japan-Australia EPA is one of three remarkable free trade agreements that have been struck by our trade minister. He stands congratulated, and I commend this bill to the House.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (16:47):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, commonly called the Japanese free trade agreement. The Prime Minister said on election night back in September 2013 that Australia was 'open for business'—and, boy, we have to be. The challenges that are in front of this government grow daily as we discover the full inheritance left to us by the Labor Party, and one of the things we have to do is increase our trade. I think it was the New Zealand Prime Minister who said, and I paraphrase: 'No-one ever got rich selling to themselves.' We have to open up new markets. 


Since that time, this government and in particular Andrew Robb, the Minister for Trade and Investment, have put in an exemplary performance and delivered on three free trade agreements. This is the detail, but the headline agreements are there. This deal with Japan is historical in that it breaks new ground. We have gone where no other similar country has gone before. Over many, many years, the thing that gridlocked the negotiations between Australia and Japan was access for our agricultural products to the Japanese markets. There are some that Japan chooses to still protect, but it has given no better access to anybody else in the world than it has to Australia in this instance. Written into these agreements is what we could call most favoured nation trading status, which means that, if somebody gets a better deal than us subsequently, we are in a position to claim the same. So full credit goes to Andrew Robb and his team for convincing Japan that trade liberalisation delivers a mutual benefit to both countries.


I want to concentrate on some of the industries within my electorate which stand to benefit greatly from this trade agreement and the other ones. Grey is a major supplier of beef to the world market, particularly from the northern pastoral regions of my electorate. This is what I sometimes call the romantic heart of Australia—up the Birdsville Track, the Oodnadatta Track, the Strzelecki Track or along the Ghan railway. This is where Sir Sidney Kidman pioneered his giant cattle properties. They exist in much the same manner as they did 100 years ago, except that are larger now because fewer people produce more of the same product, and they do it well. They have also now, largely, become registered as organic suppliers on the world market, which has increased their value. That makes theirs a premium product and they are looking for premium markets, and of course the Japanese market is one of them.


Tariffs have not been eliminated on beef, but over the next 15 years they will be halved on frozen beef and they will be down by 15 per cent on fresh beef. As I said, this is a better deal than anybody else has; and, should anybody else get a better deal, we will be getting it along with them, thank you very much. We are now also exempt from the national snap-back tariff that Japan can enforce with other nations. If the quota gets out of step and they are worried about the amount of beef coming into Japan, they can actually impose a 50 per cent tariff. We are exempt from that.


As for grain, my electorate and South Australia generally are exporters of grain. Japan is our fourth-largest market for wheat. We do operate under low tariffs into Japan currently, but there are some very highly regulated quotas, some of which at last will be going by the board. In particular, we will be the only country able to export feed wheat into Japan outside this very strict quota regulation. That gives us a great advantage in the world market. Barley will be duty free and have no quota. That is a great opportunity for us. The Japanese beef industry is always looking for good quality feed.


Seafood is very big business in my electorate right around the coastline, but particularly around Port Lincoln. Southern bluefin tuna tariffs are being phased out over 10 years. I know the industry would like to have seen them phased out quicker, but they are going, and that is a movement forward. We have seen quite a bit of confrontation, trying to get rock lobster into certain markets, particularly the Chinese market, in previous years. Rock lobster tariffs are being reduced immediately, from 9.6 per cent, as are those for prawns and abalone, of which the Grey electorate is a prominent supplier.


In the resources sector, coal, iron ore and LNG already have duty-free access to Japanese markets. They are the things that they have wanted from us for a very long time, but there have been products like titanium oxide, which in my electorate is mined at Iluka's Jacinth Ambrosia deposits just out of Ceduna, which will have tariffs reduced to nothing over the next few years.


All of those things are good for my electorate. I look forward to giving speeches that will highlight the benefits of both the Korean free trade agreement and, particularly, the Chinese free trade agreement, which has just been reached, at least in headline form, over the next few months. I look forward to Andrew Robb continuing his stellar performance and convincing the Indian nation that it is indeed in their great interest and ours to advance the cause of free trade.

Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (16:54):  I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 and its cognate bill the Customs Tariff Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. These two bills are being enacted to meet our obligations under the various chapters of the recent Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement and to enable changes to the Customs Act 1901 to achieve that.


I commend these bills to the House because this agreement has massive positive implications for our economy and our nation and for Japan as well. This agreement builds on the original agreement on commerce that was signed in 1957 by the Prime Minister of Japan at the time, Mr Kishi, and the Australian minister for trade at the time, 'Black Jack' McEwen. Our current trade minister, Mr Robb, has done an excellent job in achieving this agreement, the second in the trifecta of international trade agreements.


What does this trade agreement mean for the Lyne electorate? In the Lyne electorate there are many agricultural exporters, manufacturers and service providers, but it is the agricultural exporters who employ the most people who will be affected by this agreement. They employed many, many people who put food on the table for their families, pay wages and pay taxes to the government. With more trade comes more job security, because the jobs of one in four people in regional Australia are underpinned by foreign trade. A stronger economy at home will be a result of increased agriculture exports. We export to Japan $66.5 billion in goods and $4.3 billion in services. Japan has $131 billion invested here and we have $50 billion invested within Japan.


Tariffs on goods going into Japan mean the landed price of Australian goods is higher and make our products less price competitive compared to our competition. Dropping and reducing tariffs makes our products much more competitive. As a result, producers in the Lyne electorate and in broader Australia will benefit. It is not just the producers at this end who will benefit, consumers will as well. We all buy a lot of electrical goods and cars that come out of Japan. Admittedly, the tariffs remaining on Japanese goods coming into the country are not great, but five per cent on the price of a modern car is a significant reduction, and we as consumers will all see the benefit of that.


The Lyne electorate produces some of the best grass-fed and grass- and grain-finished beef in Australia. Currently the tariff is 38.5 per cent. Eventually that will fall to 19.5 per cent. That makes the $1.4 billion trade of Australian beef even better value to Japan, particularly relative to our competitors from North and South America. That means that there will be better prices at the rails at the cattle sales in Wauchope or Taree or Gloucester, eventually, because there will be more competition for Australian beef from exporters. There will be better prices and volumes for the Wingham Abattoir, the biggest employer in the Manning Valley. There will be better prices for marbled Hokubee beef, which is produced in Wauchope, when it is exported into Asia, particularly into Japan. These better export prices will eventually mean greater competition, more volume of trade and better prices at the farm gate. In addition to beef, cow hides can now enter Japan duty free. Again, that means stronger demand for the product that comes out of Wingham beef, a stronger local economy and a much more secure position for its 380 employees.


Between the Hastings and Manning valleys, Hannam Vale and Johns River areas and the Comboyne Plateau there is almost 30 per cent of the milk supply of New South Wales being produced. Most of this enters the daily fresh milk market, but extra supply can go into the export market. As a result of this trade agreement, the market for milk protein concentrates casein and lactose, which currently amounts to $53 million annually, can grow. We have duty-free quotas for cheese which can also grow.


On the North Coast of the Lyne electorate, we have a lot of wood products from North Coast Timbers and the mills at Herons Creek or up at Telegraph Point or down at Pambula, such as fibre boards, particle boards and structured and laminated timber, that can all go into the Japanese market. As mentioned earlier, with this free trade agreement, Australian produce is much more price competitive. That means there will be greater demand for Australian product and better product prices at the farm gate.


Wine production in the Lyne electorate has been going into the Japanese market for many years. Just down the road from where I live, the very prestigious Cassegrain Wines have been producing quality wine that has been served on the Shinkansen for up to a decade. They are part of the $42 million trade of wine exports into Japan, particularly the premium end of the market, such as restaurants, as well. The 15 per cent tariff will drop immediately to zero for bulk wine being imported into Japan. Bottled product will have the tariff drop slower. This will allow this industry to be so much more competitive relative to wines from France and Chile.


Also we have macadamias and avocadoes on the Comboyne Plateau and at Redhill and Telegraph Point at the north end of the Lyne electorate that feed into both the domestic market and the Australian export market. This is $16½ million worth of macadamias that feed into the Japanese market, most of which come from 400 producers on the North Coast. That market will grow as well. It is quite a small tariff, but every bit of price reduction means our product is much more competitive.


We do not have a lot produced seafood in our area, but there is a significant crustacean and lobster market which feeds mainly into the local market. But if other big producers in the domestic market are now exporting to Japan, it means our product from the North Coast will be that much more competitive. Whole new opportunities will come into play with this free trade agreement, so I wholeheartedly support these two bills.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (17:03):  The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement will offer opportunities to Australian businesses, individuals and companies. I want to use my time to start with to congratulate the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb. He has done a huge job that should not be underestimated—three major free trade agreements in a year. The weight of work that has gone on behind the scenes is huge. I know that the minister has applied himself and all of the resources at his disposal to get this done. These are truly landmark free trade agreements for Australia and they will see benefits almost ad infinitum in this country.


Australian companies and businesses have been given an opportunity. That is one of the best things we as a government can do—give them an opportunity. That is what these free trade agreements do. We know that Japan is a vital, longstanding and highly complementary economic partner for Australia. We will also see through this free trade agreement and partnership with Japan a strengthening of our bilateral relationship, something that we on this side of the House certainly do not underestimate.


In 2013 two-way goods and services trade with Japan reached $70.8 billion, making Japan Australia's second largest trading partner, with a surplus to Australia of $28.3 billion. The latest merchandise trade figures show Japan was Australia's second largest goods export destination and third largest source of imports in 2013. At the end of 2013, Japanese investment in Australia was valued at $131 billion and Australian investment in Japan was valued at $50.2 billion.


Despite the strong and mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship between Japan and Australia over a sustained period, we have seen the absence of a bilateral trade agreement. That has constrained Australian producers and exporters and their ability to further build trade in the context of high tariffs. It has maintained inefficient barriers to Australia's trade, which has also limited profitability. It certainly has not provided protection for Australia's exporters against preferential agreements that Japan has concluded or is negotiating with key competitors. It maintained higher costs for Australian consumers and businesses for key Japanese imports and maintained barriers to investment in trade and services. We heard that in Australia services are 70 per cent of our economy and only 17 per cent of our exports. So there is a great opportunity for growth in that sector in all of the free trade agreements.


The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement also provides an opportunity to take this bilateral relationship to the next level and further build the framework underpinning a key economic partnership for Australia. As we know, Australian exporters have faced very high tariffs into Japan, with customs duties levied on 6.5 per cent of Australian goods exported to that country. These are particularly high in agriculture, a vital area of trade for Australia, with an average tariff of 16.6 per cent. As Japan is Australia's second largest agricultural market, with an estimated total value of $4 billion in 2013, it is Australia's largest market for beef, cheese, animal feed and offal and an important destination for sugar, vegetable oil, seafood, fruit and nuts. Of course, Japan historically has imposed high tariffs on a range of agricultural goods, particularly on those key products of interest for Australia, including beef, dairy, wheat, sugar, barley, vegetable oils, tuna and rice.


Any agreement and any change in this certainly provides opportunities for businesses, for individuals and for companies—the opening of the door. Of course, many agricultural exports also confronted complex or opaque regulatory frameworks that included things from tariff rate quotas, state trading and special safeguard and emergency tariffs. So, in the absence of an EPA with Japan, Australian producers—agricultural producers—would continue to face these very high tariffs and complex barriers on major products. It is not just agricultural products; Japan is also Australia's second largest market for non-agricultural goods, with exports worth over $42 billion. It is Australia's largest destination for coal and liquefied natural gas, second-largest destination for iron ore and a major market for petroleum and aluminium.


In keeping my remarks similar to the ones that I have made, I really wanted to focus on the fact that the opening of the doors—the strengthening of the bilateral arrangement—is a key deliverable from this agreement. Once again, I will finish where I started. I know, as every member on our side does, the power of work that has been done by the minister to deliver these three critical free trade agreements. It has been an outstanding effort. In my speech today I want to recognise his efforts and all of those who have been working on this through the department—through DFAT. I think the job they have done has been absolutely outstanding. I have no doubt that the general economy as well as individual companies, individual businesses and individual industries are those that will benefit from the work that has been completed.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (17:09):  I echo the words of the previous speaker. Australia's relationship with Japan has been of enormous weight and importance to us dating right back to obviously before World War II. But, most ominously, the foresight of Robert Menzies to initiate trade agreements as early as 12 years after the end of World War II certainly stood Australia apart from the rest of the developed world in developing that relationship early; it has proven to be an important one. Over the last few decades we have seen a rise in the optimism of Australia that Japan would be a reliable, solid trading partner—culturally important as well. Linguistically, it has become a major language taught in our schools. Through the seventies, we had a proliferation of Japanese becoming available to school students—I was one who studied Japanese for five years. We were always dealing with a degree of hysteria about Asia at the same time. I can remember, in the mid seventies, proposals for the Iwasaki resort in Yeppoon, Queensland, was met by ferocious opposition. The fact that there could possibly be Japanese investment on a small patch of Queensland land would bring an end to the Australia as we knew it. How wrong we were at the time, and how far we have moved on.


Japan, despite being in the economic doldrums for the last 15 years, remains a massive trading partner—the third largest economy in the world and second-largest export market and trading partner for Australia. We were right to jump in early and become not only a source of resources, energy and manufacturing but agriculture and food. Japan respects the relationship, no more strongly exemplified than by the visit of the Japanese Prime Minister earlier this year and the close relationship that he shared with our Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.


What, of course, we need with Japan is to recognise that it is the last great advanced economy for which we did not have a high-quality trade agreement, of those nations with which we had a highly developed trade arrangement. What we are now seeing in this shift, quite rapidly, with the work of the trade minister, will be a series of trade agreements with developing economies—some of the giant economies that are in the G20 and moving up to be the economies of the future. It is a very, very subtle but important shift, moving from advanced economy FTAs like that of Japan, the US, Singapore and New Zealand through to a focus on India, China and, potentially, Indonesia. These three massive economies with very, very high populations that are looking for significant capital investments and significant energy and food security place Australia in an incredibly important place.


We are a nation that, as I have said many times before, has a small population with a high capital base. With that low labour ratio, we need all hands on deck and every Australian trained as highly as possible to do the jobs of tomorrow. We do not yet have that. We still import around 175,000 overseas nationals to do the work that we need done in this country because we are unable to train Australians to do that work. That should be a challenge for us; that is a challenge because 175,000 salaries repatriated to overseas economies is simply a missed opportunity for Australian families. On the same token, we have 133,000 people leaving school every year going straight onto Newstart who are utterly unemployable. It is this skilling mismatch which has to be the policy challenge for Australia over the next decade.


Eliminations of tariffs, as I have said, are wonderful. It is extraordinary that it was almost grinding to a halt under the previous Labor government. How could they make such little progress over six years unless there was a subtle and deliberate intention to not engage in bilateral agreements? They were not moving forward any multiparty agreements either. There was just no real respect for the fact that reducing tariffs between economies is a win-win. Much of it is this focus on who is going to do better out of a free trade agreement; will it be the large economy or will it be the small one? Let us be honest, in any free trade agreement, the absolute benefit is probably going to swing slightly towards the larger economy. But in a relative sense the benefits accrue to the smaller economy and the benefits probably accrue to an export economy. If you are a major internal consumption economy, the benefits of trade liberalisation are slightly less. But for Australia what we dig up, what we grow and what we produce is, because of our small population, mostly exported. We benefit from freer trade. These have been listed by previous speakers, and I do not need to go through them again, but I want to highlight some of the large ones. Obviously these are around resources. If we can have a situation where 99.7 per cent of all of our export products in energy, agriculture and resources become tariff free to an economy like Japan, it just creates so many more jobs.


These percentages have been rolling off the tongues of analysts over the last few weeks, but let's remind ourselves what a one per cent reduction in a tariff means. In a highly competitive, liberalised economic market, reducing tariffs by one per cent simply makes your product one per cent cheaper in the destination economy. That is enough to swing sales and that is enough to change market share. That therefore has massive volume impacts for the producer. If we can export more, this is simply a multiplier—volume and profit.


It is a wonderful opportunity for Australia that we seem to have just forsaken for six years under a Labor government. I am yet to hear an adequate explanation for why all of these free-trade agreements, which mostly started in the Howard years, stalled for six years. It is economically damaging that they did so. The fact that they could only sign one—it was effectively one that we had almost completely negotiated for them, so all they had to do was submit the paperwork—is a real blight on the record of the Labor government. I hope that is highlighted in greater detail.


I say that to the miners out there and I say that to the agricultural providers, particularly beef providers. They stand to be $5.5 billion better off because of this beef agreement. That is just one sector. Compare that with the molestation of the live-trade agreement under the previous Labor government and the sorrow, the indebtedness and the destruction that they wrought on live export by hasty decision. That has killed of not just one year but many family dynasties who were involved in live export. It was a horrible price to pay by a short-sighted government that did not respect the importance of our trade relationship with our near Asian neighbours. I pleased to say today that that era is closed.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (17:16):  It is very good to have an opportunity to speak on this most critical area of the free-trade agreement between Australia and Japan. I think there is no more important economic policy area than free trade. We talk a lot about removing red tape from the economy, removing impediments and so on. The reality is that the international system of trade barriers and protections represents probably the single most value-destructive act of global governance over the last century.


That is because what we are talking about in free trade liberalisation is effectively undoing the work that nations have done in previous era. When you impose a tariff on the product, you make it more expensive and you make it less attractive to buy. Consequently, less of it gets bought. You also make it more difficult on the other side for people in your own nation to manufacture goods, because it is harder to sell them overseas. It is just an economic philosophy that is entirely flawed and entirely wrong.


But, interestingly, it took this government to actually do something about it with our big trading partners—Korea, Japan and China. All within the space of 12 months, the Minister for Trade has managed to secure these blockbuster agreements. The Japanese agreement is the one we are talking about today. It is our second largest trading partner. There is more than $70 billion in trade relations and 97 per cent of our exports will now be free of tariffs or treated preferentially as a result of this deal. Earlier, we have the tremendous outcome on the Korean agreement as well. Just last week, there was the China agreement, which will benefit businesses like the owners of Lamb & Cumin, which is located in Hurstville in my electorate of Banks. We do not have a lot of lambs in the electorate of Banks, but we do have business people who export lamb product to China. They will benefit immensely from the liberalisation of free trade under this agreement.


The question is, as the member for Bowman alluded to, why this did not happen in the last six years. Why did it not happen? Why did we have this pause button on trade liberalisation during the entire period of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government? The reason is very clear. That is that they did not really believe in free trade. They did not really believe that these agreements were politically attractive for them and for their union base. As a consequence, they did not pursue them.


If you go back to 2008, the member for Lilley showed great foresight when he said in relation to the free-trade agreement with China:


We're negotiating with the Chinese but I don't anticipate any outcome of that process for some time…


He said that back in 2008 and he was absolutely right. That was because it took six years and a change of government for there to be some outcome. You do wonder why it took so long and it took a change of government.


Again, in 2011 the member for Lilley, who was the Treasurer of the whole country of Australia, was involved—according to The Australian Financial Review—in arguments within cabinet to the effect that the politics of free trade were not very good and, as a consequence, the government should not pursue it. The AFR at the time, through Matthew Franklin, said:


…at least four sources have agreed that Mr Swan, with the backing of several other ministers, challenged the political saleability of trade reform.


There it is: politics before substance and media releases before the actual business of doing government. What we know about our Minister for Trade is that he is not focused on tomorrow's press releases. He is focused on the hard execution and the hard work that actually leads to real results. That is what we have seen over the last 12 months. It is not about putting out some fantasy press release; it is about actually closing deals. That is what he has done.


In a statement in 2012 that you could describe making a virtue of necessity, then Minister for Trade Craig Emerson—who I believe had quite a lengthy title in his previous role, but trade was among that—actually said:


Free trade agreements, I think frankly, are overrated in what they can achieve in terms of a relationship between Australia and China.


Overrated? Come to Hurstville and tell that to the many small business people in my electorate who are trading every day with China in relation to tourism, professional services and many other areas. The former minister for trade should come to Hurstville and say to them that free trade with China is overrated. It is not overrated; it is actually a blockbuster breakthrough that has been delivered by the minister for trade. It is a fantastic thing for my electorate of Banks. It is a fantastic thing for the entire nation. We see, in the Japanese agreement, the Korean agreement and of course now the Chinese agreement, what happens when you have clear convictions, a clear philosophy and the people, frankly, with the capacity and horsepower to get hard work done. That is what you see in this government, and that is why we have been successful in free trade. Certainly, the bill we discussed today is a great exemplification of that, and I commend it to the House.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (17:23):  It is great to rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 and related bill. It is very exciting to talk about the trifecta of success that the coalition government have delivered on free trade within our first year of coming to government. We have seen within, effectively, 12 months of the election the coalition government signing historic free trade agreements with Korea, with Japan and with China. This is good for the economy. This is good for consumers. It is good for exporters, but ultimately this is good news for job creation here in Australia.


These agreements will change the face of the Australian workforce for generations to come. In no short measure, these agreements provide new opportunities to the next generation of Australians to grow the products that go into the growing Asian market, and to deliver the services that the over a billion people that are coming into the middle class in Asia will require. If you were a young Australian today, these three agreements could ultimately change the jobs that you find across the working life that you might have. These are absolutely historic agreements. Here, in this Japanese agreement that we are discussing today, this is the first time that Japan has signed an agreement with a major exporter, particularly a major agriculture exporter. For beef, where we have got over a $5 billion advantage, for dairy, for horticulture and for nuts, the advantage that we have with Japan is an advantage that almost no other nation on earth has. If you are an Australian exporter going into the Japanese market, there is not another country that you are competing with that can compete in the same way that Australia can as a result of this historic agreement.


The minister for trade has just walked into the chamber and I congratulate him. He has become an absolute rock star of the coalition's first year in government, delivering things that many of our critics said could not be delivered. Here we stand, a very short period of time after the last federal election, with the delivery of three historic agreements.


Just recently, we saw the signing of the Chinese agreement and we got everything we wanted and more on agriculture, and that is great news for our country and great news for jobs. But the big thing in the Chinese agreement—and one that I think the public is just underestimating a little bit at the moment but in the decades to come will come to appreciate as transformative for our economy—is that we have access in the service side in health, in child care, in architecture and in law into the Chinese market. Again, no other country on earth has that level of access, where 100 per cent Australian owned companies can go into the Chinese marketplace and deliver these things. What this means is very simple: in a market of 1.3 billion people where literally millions of people are coming into the middle class, they are going to become consumers of our services, of our education services, of our childcare services, of our healthcare services and of architecture and of law. This is an enormous market, and the Chinese free trade agreement gives access into the Chinese market that effectively, in many cases, no other country on earth has in terms of advantage or that access. So I am very excited as part of the coalition government and as the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to be talking today about delivering on these three historic free trade agreements, something that is great for the economy, great for exporters, great for consumers and, above all else, will create thousands of new jobs across the decades to come here in Australia.

"Varvaris, Nickolas, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr VARVARIS
 (Barton) (17:27):  I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on today's combined bill, the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, on the Australian-Japanese economic partnership that the coalition has concluded in recent months. This important partnership agreement was seven years in the making, and I am proud that this side of the House was able to successfully complete it within their first term of government. Today's customs amendment bill and customs tariff amendment bill will ensure that one of our most vital trading and investment partners will mutually thrive in a competitive global environment.


Whilst Australia and Japan have enjoyed a warm international relationship driven by mutual interests, there is no denying that Australia's largest trading partner and source of capital investment plays a significant role in further enhancing Australia's growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. I am excited by this economic partnership agreement and what the bills today will mean for Australian exporters, the agriculture sector and other Australian businesses. Increased bilateral trade, investment and closer economic integration benefit both countries and ensure that Australian businesses remain viable now and into the future. 


The recent agreement is a comprehensive, wide ranging one that provides both countries with more liberal access to goods, services and investment markets. It will also ensure that Australian businesses have more accessibility and ease to do business in Japan, which was previously marred by opaque regulations, high tariffs and complex bureaucracy. Australian exporters of consumer goods, non-consumer goods and those in the tourism, education and healthcare sectors all stand to benefit from this economic partnership agreement. More than 97 per cent of Australia's exports to Japan will receive preferential access or enter duty-free when the agreement is fully implemented.


Today's bill will also amend the Customs Act to enable imported goods to enter Australia at a preferential rate of customs levy. In addition, goods imported to Australia that have originated from Japan will have preferential entry. Without the Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan, Australian agricultural and horticultural producers will continue to face high tariffs on commercial agreements, making Australian producers' market share in Japan increasingly difficult to sustain. Australia's ongoing competitive position in Japan is not guaranteed due to the myriad strong producers coming from other nations such as the USA; therefore, the EPA is the first step to ensure that our export businesses can be commercially viable in a saturated market.


It is important to point out that Japan has also been concurrently negotiating trade agreements with other key competitors, including the European Union, Canada, the United States and New Zealand, with trade agreements already in place with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Chile, India, Mexico and Peru. The coalition's signing of the EPA will not only deliver tariff elimination and reductions for Australian businesses; it will also position our country above our competitors, through strong renegotiation provisions should Japan provide better access for the above mentioned competitors. Not having signed and delivered the EPA would have been extremely regrettable for our producers. If we did nothing, Australian exporters would face steep tariffs, resulting in loss of market share and no competitive advantage over Japan's other trading partners. We would also be denying Australian consumers cheaper imports. 


Japan is a vital and longstanding economic partner. In 2013 alone, our two-way goods and services reached $70.8 billion, of which $28.3 billion was surplus for Australia. For exports, Japan was our second-largest market, with 15.5 per cent of export goods leaving Australia. Yet, Australian exporters face a custom levy of 6.5 per cent of goods exported to Japan, whilst Australian agricultural businesses face an even higher tariff of 16.6 per cent. Japanese trade and investment in Australia in 2013 was valued at $131 billion, whilst Australia's trade and investment in Japan stood at $50.2 billion. Given that Japan is Australia's second-largest agricultural partner and that agriculture is also Australia's vital area of trade, the EPA will make an enormous positive impact on rural and regional communities. High quality Australian goods such as beef, cheese, animal feed, offal, sugar, vegetable oils, seafood, fruit and nuts are some of our most favoured products in Japan, and it would be a real shame for these exporters to lose market share simply due to tariffs. Similarly, Australian wine producers face stiff competition from countries such as Chile, who already have a tariff advantage through its existing trade agreement with Japan. In 2013, Chilean wine exports rose to $178 million, whilst imports from Australia actually decreased to $46 million. Again, given that Australia is world-renowned for its wine quality and its close proximity to Japan, it would be senseless not to be able to export a large quantity due to customs duties. The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement also guarantees access to the Japanese market for a range of lucrative Australian service providers due to Australia's high reputation in areas such as financial, legal, education and telecommunications services. I commend the bill to the House.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-11-25,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (17:33):  I rise to conclude the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, and thank the House for the opportunity. The bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1955 that will implement Australia's tariff commitments set out in the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. These amendments are complementary to those contained in the Customs Amendment (Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014. 


In summing up, I would firstly like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate. It is a most significant agreement that we have reached with the Japanese government and the Japanese people. It will lay the groundwork to take our relationship, which has been a very strong one, to another level altogether. You could see the sense of interest in Japan in the concluding weeks of this agreement and the enthusiasm with which Prime Minister Abe, his senior colleagues, the most senior business leaders within Japan and the many others throughout their community received this agreement. This does indicate that the relationship which has been forged since 1957, when the original commercial agreement was signed, is now going to be taken to a new level altogether.


Of course, Japan is Australia's second-most important trading partner, taking nearly $50 billion of Australian exports of goods and services in 2012-13. They supplied imports of goods and services worth $21 billion in the same year, and Australia has a trade surplus of $28 billion with Japan. They are also our third-largest source of foreign direct investment, with over $126 billion invested in Australia. So, as is often seen in history when there is a strong trading relationship, you end up with a strong and mutually beneficial investment relationship, and that has been the case with Japan. This agreement not only goes to trade but also to investment. There is a very strong investment chapter to try to ensure that the ease of doing business in Australia is maximised and that the encouragement for doing business in Australia is maximised. It is most appropriate that our two countries have reached this agreement. 


Negotiations on JAEPA commenced in 2007, the year in which we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the first Japan-Australia commerce agreement. JAEPA takes our relationship, as I said, to a new level. It demonstrates that Australia can continue to forge deeper relations with our old friends, while accommodating the arrival of new friends. As other speakers have mentioned this afternoon, we have just concluded the free trade agreement with China, which is in a similar vein to Japan's. It is a very comprehensive and very protection-eliminating document. Again, it goes very strongly into service areas, as does the Japanese agreement. 


The big growth for Australia in the future will be in the services area. In exports, of course, resources and energy will continue to be a feature for hundreds of years for Australia, and similarly agriculture and agribusiness will be a mainstay of our trade for centuries. We are the most knowledge based economy in the region, along with Japan, and our services are much in demand. Currently, 80 per cent of our GDP is services, yet the services sector contributes only 15 per cent of our exports. In many cases the failure of growth in the services sector has occurred because of the many barriers erected by many of the countries in the region, which prevent the ease of doing services business in those economies: services like legal work, engineering work, architectural work, project management services, auctioneering services, perhaps, anything to do with town planning services, education, health and ageing. In all of these areas we have world-class expertise, and our capacity to contribute so much in the region around us is starting to be realised by these countries. 


Our long-term relationship with Japan and with Korea has led to two free trade agreements which were finalised earlier this year. Both of those countries have allowed a significant opening up of services arrangements between our two countries. The China agreement—the third in the trifecta—is a remarkable document for the opportunities Australian services have in that market, which no-one else has. It is the leading edge and there are literally dozens and dozens of opportunities that have been granted to us by the Chinese government that they have not given to anyone else at this stage.


After seven years of negotiations, JAEPA is the most liberalising agreement Japan has ever concluded. It goes a lot further towards freer trade, especially in agricultural products, than Japan would be prepared to give in the WTO. The big feature of the Japanese agreement is that not only it is strong on services, but that for the first time the five untouchable areas in trade agreements were confronted; and, outside of rice, we saw movement in all of them and some significant movement, especially in beef and sheep meats. It is really an agreement which will take our relationship and our opportunities in the agricultural space to a whole new level. In fact former US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, Kurt Campbell, described the agreement as 'a massive victory for Australia', and he observed that Europe and the United States had been trying to get this kind of agreement from Japan for 30 years. 


Most speakers have detailed the huge benefits that we will have in things like frozen beef with a sliding scale of cuts in tariffs and with a very big up-front cut. If the agreement enters into force before April next year—as I am certain it will—we will get a cut and then we will get another one after 1 April. There will be a 10 per cent total reduction in tariff in the first four months of this agreement, and that will be an advantage over the US market of 10 per cent—and they are our biggest competitor in the Japanese market for beef. That 10 per cent advantage will increase up to 19 per cent in subsequent years. In a similar way we have seen opportunities with the guaranteed safety net that says any improvements bilaterally negotiated for access by the US with Japan will be automatically applied to Australia. So with the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, if the United States finds itself with any advances on what we have achieved, then we will automatically receive those same advantages. We have also negotiated removal of the 50 per cent global snapback tariff being applied to Australia when volumes exceed a trigger level. In other words, if they feel the increase in imports is getting too high too fast, there will be a trigger which discourages other imports, and that trigger will not apply to Australian agricultural products. Dairy producers receive a tariff-free quota of 20,000 tonnes for cheese, which is in addition to the current 28,000 tonnes under the WTO. 


There is a whole raft of other benefits—tariffs on most seafoods, fruit, vegetables, nuts, honey and wine will all be eliminated in between one and 10 years—most of them are front-end loaded. Australian wine was worth $42 million in exports to Japan last year, but it has been losing market share to Chile since Chile signed an FTA with Japan. JAEPA allows us to level the playing field with Chile and gain immediate advantage over key competitors, such as France, Italy, Spain and the US. Outside of agriculture the agreement provides an immediate elimination of all remaining tariffs on minerals and bulk resources. This includes immediate elimination of the 3.2 per cent tariff on our $89 million worth of coking coal exports and the 7.9 per cent tariff on our $74 million petroleum and oils exports to Japan.


In services JAEPA will also allow Australian financial services companies to provide investment and portfolio management services to Japanese customers. This is significant, as Japan has the second largest pool of pension funds globally after the US. Japan has also agreed to expedite registration procedures for Australian lawyers and has committed to allowing Australian lawyers to form professional legal corporations in Japan. A raft of different qualifications and professions where mutual recognition is either going to be allowed or considered after a review process. 


We will form a committee to review this agreement on a continuing basis so that everyone can see that this is a dynamic document. This is a living document. This is a document that will move with the times. It is a 21st century trade and investment agreement and one that will make our relationship stronger than it has ever been before. So it is something to celebrate. 


I notice that there is an amendment from those opposite. I make the comment that the three requirements that the opposition are looking for are unnecessary. They are looking for an inclusion to not agree to any investor state dispute settlement provisions in this agreement. But it is not in there. We are just about to have it enter into force. Secondly it says, 'to enact policies to ensure that Australian workers benefit from jobs growth'. That is the whole point of this agreement, to create more jobs. That is what we are doing in seeking to clean up the economic mess that we inherited; to make the best advantage of the three agreements. Much of our objective is to stop the recklessly high levels of spending built into previous governments' programs and replace that debt-fuelled government spending with private sector activity. 


These three agreements—and this one in particular from Japan—will further increase the opportunities for investment from these countries, but also for trade, which will build growth here and will build profits. It will give confidence to more investors locally. It will slow the growth of government spending and replace it with private sector activity in our local economy, which is fundamental to our long-term sustainable growth objectives. 


I do not see a need to support the amendments. The final element that the opposition wanted was to utilise the review mechanisms in the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, to seek further market access gains, especially in agriculture. That is a sound sentiment, but we put that review in so that we could further achieve gains in agriculture. So I think it is unnecessary.


Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to summarise some significant contributions that we have had in this debate. It is a very important occasion for Australia to sign off and enter into force this landmark agreement which will help set up, along with the other two agreements, the foundations for strong trade and investment between Australia and our three big partners in the region. It will build jobs and prosperity for many decades to come.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (21:00):  I recently received letters from some very passionate teachers and parents in my local area asking me to speak up on behalf of students with disabilities and their school communities. One of those teachers was actually my daughter Elizabeth, who I am very proud of and know to be a very dedicated teacher.


These people expressed to me that the needs of students with disabilities are not currently being adequately resourced in our schools, particularly in the non-government sector. The Labor government committed to the Gonski plan for school funding, which included loadings for students with disabilities to ensure schools would receive additional support to make sure that they were able to address their needs. Labor put in place $100 million of interim loading in 2014, while the true level of need and consistent national methodology was being worked out in consultation with the states and territories. Before the last election, the coalition promised to support Labor's proposal and implement the Gonski plan in full.


Amongst other things, this government has failed to deliver on the expected increase in funding for students with disabilities in the budget and they have also failed to extend the interim More Support for Students with Disability program. This is another of the broken promises by the Abbott government. It is a part of the $80 billion cut to schools and hospitals and a betrayal of the students with disabilities, their families and their schools.


Parents of children with disabilities are worried that their children will not get the support they need nor will they get a fair go. They fear that their kids will not get the opportunity to achieve their full potential in life. Disturbingly, the funding for students with a disability is alarmingly low, given the high level of support that they actually need.


Now, tragically, we find many of these kids are lost in the mainstream education, forcing parents to contemplate withdrawing them from traditional education in favour of homeschooling. These students, in turn, miss out on important aspects of schooling, including socialising in a school community, while other students actually miss out on a level of diversity in the school environment.


My daughter Elizabeth is not only a dedicated teacher but a mother of a child with a disability. My grandson Nathaniel is on the autism spectrum and he attends a local systemic Catholic school. Elizabeth loves her job, but says that she goes to school each day with a sense of dread. In a letter she wrote to me, she said:


I dread the phone call that reports my son has thrown a chair across the classroom.


I dread the phone call reporting that my son has been suspended because he was so frustrated with the noise in the overcrowded classroom that he has had a meltdown.


This is my life at the moment. This is the life of so many parents of kids with disabilities.


This dread would be eased with the commitment of appropriate funding. Such resourcing would allow our kids to feel like they are part of society.


Proper resources would allow our kids to dream about their future, including attending university. Funding would ease the likelihood of a lifetime of welfare.


Our kids just want to know that they have a place in our community. Therefore, the government must accept that they need to do more in education. At the moment, they are devaluing students with disabilities.


I would like to say this to all parents, teachers and particularly students with a disability, including my grandson Nathaniel: I care.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Fowler for a very moving piece.
