Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:01):  The coalition will not oppose the Corporations Amendment (Improving Account­ability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. However, we will seek to make an important amendment to it and we will raise some questions during the committee stages of the debate. While we are broadly supportive of the objective of achiev­ing better alignment between share­holders and boards on the issue of executive remuneration, we are concerned about the potential for unintended consequences which can flow from excessive and overly prescriptive regulation in this area.


This bill does implement recom­mendations of the Productivity Commission from its recent inquiry into executive remuneration in Australia which reported back on 4 January 2010. Concern around the issue of executive remuneration led to this review. The review commenced in 2009 and received 170-odd submissions. The final report was provided to the government back in December 2009.


This bill's main provisions include requiring a vote for directors to stand for re-election if they do not adequately address shareholder concerns on remuneration issues over two consecutive years—the so-called 'two-strikes rule'. It changes regulation with respect to the use of remuneration consul­tants. It prohibits directors and executives voting their shares on remuneration resolu­tions. It prohibits hedging of incentive rem­uneration. It requires shareholder approval for declarations of no vacancy at an annual general meeting. It requires that any directed proxies are voted as directed. It seeks to reduce the complexity of the rem­uneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


Changes to voting arrangements must, in our view, be careful not to distort the wishes of the majority of shareholders. The views of a minority of shareholders, while important, should not too easily hold hostage the majority view across company annual general meetings. When it comes to the level of support required to reject a remuneration report—a process that can lead to a spill of the board—we believe the bar has been set too low. As currently proposed, the threshold for the two-strikes rule is 25 per cent of votes cast. This could be a very low threshold indeed. If fewer than 50 per cent of votes are cast and there are 25 per cent of that, it could be a very small number of shareholders that could lead a company to a circumstance where the board would be spilled at a subsequent AGM. Therefore, the coalition will be moving an amendment to require the threshold to be 25 per cent—but 25 per cent of the total votes available to be cast. That is still a minority across any AGM; however, it is a more representative sample and, we believe, more appropriate in the context of what is being proposed.


There are a number of other issues that we might be able to address during the com­mittee stages of the bill, but I do flag that during the committee stages the coalition will be moving a series of amendments to ensure, essentially, that the 25 per cent threshold for the two-strikes rule is applied to the votes available to be cast, not just to the votes actually cast at the AGM. We think that that is a more appropriate reflection of a sufficient proportion of shareholder votes at an AGM in relation to remuneration matters.

Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:06):  The Greens have a long history of calling for a curb on executive remuneration. I cannot go beyond former Prime Minister Rudd's description of some of the packages going to CEOs in 2008 as 'obscene'. And obscene they are. An example of that is Rio Tinto's Tom Albanese, who has over $9 million in the latest package, which is a 328 per cent increase in one year. Ask some of the workers in Rio Tinto how they would like a 328 per cent increase, let alone a multi­million dollar package. I am sure we would find that they would all like that sort of consideration. Don Voelte, who is about to go back across the Pacific from Woodside, is getting over $8 million. It would be interesting to see if there is a severance package there. The Commonwealth Bank's CEO is getting over $16 million; that is a 75 per cent increase in one year, and this is a bank that still charges pensioners $2 to withdraw $20 if they have their account with a rival bank. Then there is BHP Billiton, where Marius Kloppers is the recipient of $11 million.


The community has a right to be very concerned about the growing gap between the richest and the poorest in this country. It is something we Greens speak a lot about on a global basis. The number of people on the planet who cannot feed themselves—who are hungry—at the moment has gone from 800 million to 1,000 million this year, but we are here talking about executives who are on packages of more than $2 million, $5 million, $10 million or $15 million in one year. All of us are born onto the planet equal, but human society—and that includes in democratic countries—is allowing the growth of an egregious difference in the way we and our fellow human beings, inside and outside this country, are treated.


The average CEO in Australia earns over 100 times the average wage, and executive remuneration is going up faster than average wages. That means the average CEO in this country is taking home each year more than 100 times the income of people who are on the average wage. There is no way that that can be justified. I know we will hear from the opposition—and it has been the standard mantra from business itself—that you have to pay extraordinary and obscene packages to get the best talent. That does not bear scrutiny, because the best talent—and there is a lot of discussion about this in corporate management circles these days—has a very clear human dimension to it. It is not just talking about profit lines and management regimes; it is about treating workers within your own aegis with sympathy, as human beings and as people who effectively keep corporations going every bit as much as any CEO may do.


When we go back to looking at how out of kilter this is, the total remuneration of a chief executive of a top-50 company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange was $6.4 million last year, in 2010—$6.4 million. Here we are in a cycle of struggle as far as government is concerned, looking at making things harder for people with disabilities or families who have youngsters at home and are dependent upon government supple­ments, because there is not money in the kitty—and why isn't there money in the kitty? Amongst other reasons, it is because the two-speed economy means the miners and the mining sector are not only not paying their way but making it more difficult for everybody's kitty. Up go interest rates because of these multibillion-dollar profits. Up has gone the dollar because of these multibillion-dollar profits. Much of those profits is being exported overseas. We Greens are in favour of free enterprise, but that means free enterprise which is regulated through the democratic system by this parliament. We do not see in this legislation the required and responsible option of saying to CEOs, 'You can have multimillion-dollar take-home packages, provided they are not more than 30 times the average take-home pay of people in your enterprise.'



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Forshaw
):  Excuse me, Senator Brown. There is too much conversation. Senator Brown, you have the call.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The Greens—I might say with some embarrassment, because we think even this proposal is out of kilter—will move to amend this bill so that there is a limit of 30 times put on the gap between executive salaries and the average worker. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I ask every other senator: when you sit down and think about it, do you believe that executives do 30 times the amount of work of the average worker in any corporation? The answer is: no, they do not. Then do you believe that executives who have had the privilege of getting to the top should not have a qualification which says they understand their workers enough to be able to share the largesse of the corporation so that they do not get more out of the corporation than their work warrants—or, to put it the other way, that the average workers in the corporation are not going home struggling to make ends meet while the executive is working out how to spend a multimillion-dollar take-home package that is more than 30 times that of the average worker in the corporation? Common sense, common decency and an egalitarian approach to the way our society works demand that we seriously look at this extraordinary overrun of the executive pay gravy train, driven up front by executives and boards themselves. From 2001-2010 executive pay rose by 130 per cent, but average weekly earnings rose only by 52 per cent. That is not taking into account real amounts because that is even more startling. On a percentage basis executive salaries are rising at three times that of average workers. Over the last financial year executive pay rose by an average of almost $1 million—$18,000 per week. That is the increase in what Kevin Rudd called 'obscene packages'. Over the same period the average wage of full-time workers rose by just $3,200, or $62 per week. So there you have executives getting $18,000 per week extra and the average workers getting $62. How can we entertain facilitating that sort of increase? The legislation we have before us today says that it will empower shareholders in corpor­ations, if they have a 25 per cent vote twice against executive packages, to have a 50 per cent vote to throw out the board. But it does not really tackle this issue, and the Labor minister and the coalition representative opposite know that—it is not going to occur. The obscenity of these packages cuts right across our national ethos of a fair go.


Company profits as a share of national income are at record levels, but the wages share of national income is at the lowest level since 1984. How can that be? I can assure you that this legislation will not address that problem. In the past I and my colleagues have proposed in this Senate—and Adam Bandt, the member for Mel­bourne, in the House of Repre­sen­tatives—measures which include a cap on total executive remuneration of $5 million to stop the excesses of the past decade. That limit is more than 10 times the Prime Minister's salary. Is anybody in this Senate or the House going to get up and try to explain why any executive of any mining corporation or banking outfit in this country should be paid more than 10 times the Prime Minister's salary? No, nobody in the coalition or Labor ranks will do that, but that is effectively what they will all vote for if they turn down the Greens amendment today—and I am not holding my breath.




Senator Fifield:
  Feel free.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  You might wish that I would hold my breath but I am challenging you, when your turn comes again, to respond to this out-of-kilter situation. Look at this: a top marginal tax rate of 50 per cent on incomes of more than $1 million in a year is proposed by the Greens and everybody votes it down.


We also want a binding shareholder vote on company remuneration policy. We believe these measures are sensible and, if implemented, would have already started to rein in the executive salary imbalance that I have talked about. We know what the bill is about. I have put forward the preferred options that the Greens would be pursuing and we stick to our guns on it, because what we are proposing is eminently reasonable; in fact, it is far short of what we should have if we were to have a fairer system in place in this country.


The Greens support other measures in the bill to increase transparency with regard to executive remuneration. That includes increasing the transparency and account­ability with respect to the use of rem­uneration consultants; in particular, that such consultants report to non-executive directors or the remuneration committee. We also support addressing conflicts of interest that exist with directors and executives voting their shares on remuneration packages and agree that directors and executives with voting shares should not be allowed to vote on the remuneration reports.


We also back the components of the bill ensuring that remuneration remains linked to performance by prohibiting hedging of incentive remuneration; requiring share­holder approval for declarations of no vac­ancy at an annual general meeting; prohibit­ing proxy shareholders from cherry picking the proxies they exercise by requiring that any directed proxies that are not voted default to the chair, who is required to vote for the proxies as directed; and reducing the complexity of the remuneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


These measures also go to implementing some of the principles of executive remun­eration agreed by the G20, nearly two years back, improving the way companies go about determining remuneration for executives and increasing transparency, which is at the heart of this legislation. But when it gets to the key—the actual definition of a limit to executive packages which are right off the show and getting worse—this bill is not going to address the problem. The Greens amendment will address the problem—and very modestly at that—but this bill will not do that. I will be moving the amendments in committee, and I will ask the other senators in the chamber to seriously consider those amendments. I can assure them that they will have the backing of the Australian people if the amendments are supported.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (10:21):  On behalf of the govern­ment I thank those honourable senators who have taken part in the debate on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The issues for those of us in the chamber are familiar. We have had debate on these matters in some way, shape or form, certainly I can recollect, at least four or five times over the last five or six years. It well illustrates the community interest in executive remuneration.


The government, and I on behalf of the government, believe it is important to have a remuneration framework that not only is internationally competitive but also appropriately rewards executives for the wealth they create for shareholders. While Australia's framework is relatively strong, the global financial crisis highlighted many issues relating to remuneration structures. In particular, it illustrated the dangers of remuneration structures that focus on short-term results, reward excessive risk taking and promote corporate greed.


Responding to these concerns in 2009, the government delivered reforms to empower shareholders to reject excessive termination benefits or 'golden handshake' payments. Also in 2009, the government announced it would task the Productivity Commission to undertake a broad review of Australia's remuneration framework. Following a comprehensive inquiry, the Productivity Commission found that Australia's corporate governance and remuneration framework is highly ranked internationally. However, it also recommended a range of reforms to further strengthen Australia's remuneration framework.


The government supported and further strengthened the majority of the recom­mendations. This bill implements many of these recommendations, and will put in place measures that will empower shareholders to influence the remuneration decisions of their company. For example, the bill requires company boards to be responsive to shareholder concerns on remuneration issues through the introduction of a 'two-strikes' test. This will ensure greater accountability of board members if they do not adequately respond to shareholder concerns on remuneration issues over two consecutive years.


In addition, the bill facilitates the independence of remuneration consultants by introducing measures that will assist shareholders to assess the independence of the advice that remuneration consultants provide to boards and remuneration com­mittees. The bill does this by introducing requirements about who must approve the engagement of a remuneration consultant and who the remuneration consultant must report to. The bill also requires the board and the remuneration consultant to provide a declaration of his independence as well as requiring disclosure of key information such as the fees paid to the remuneration consultant.


The bill prohibits the company's directors and key executives or key management personnel and their closely related parties from voting their shares in a non-binding vote on a remuneration report. This will address the conflict of interest that arises when key management personnel vote on their own remuneration packages.


Key management personnel would also be prohibited from voting undirected proxies on a remuneration report and spill resolution, with an exception for when they are acting as chair of the meeting and the shareholder has provided their informed consent. The exception for the chair is intended to apply to the non-binding vote required under section 250R of the Corporations Act.


The bill also prohibits key management personnel from hedging their incentive remuneration. This will ensure that remuneration remains linked to performance and the interests of management remains aligned with the interests of shareholders. The bill prevents boards from declaring 'no vacancy' without explicit shareholder con­sent. This will ensure that the board cannot operate in a closed-shop fashion and will provide greater scope for shareholder oversight on issues like executive remuneration.


Finally, the bill prevents proxy holders from cherry-picking which proxies they exercise, which will enfranchise shareholders who choose to vote by proxy. In summary, this bill will give unprecedented power to shareholders, improve the accountability of company directors on remuneration issues, address conflicts of interest that exist in the remuneration-setting process and promote a culture of responsible remuneration prac­tices. At the same time, the bill recog­nises that directors are accountable to shareholders for the level and composition of executive remuneration. As shareholders are the owners of the company, they take on the risk of investing their capital and share in the company's profits and losses and they deserve more say over how the pay of company executives is set. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-06-20,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:27):  I move: 


(1)   Schedule 1, item 8, page 7 (after line 29), after Part 2D.8, insert:


Part 2D.9—Limit on benefits for key management personnel


206N—Limit on benefits for key management personnelDespite any other provision of this Act, an entity must not give, or propose to give, a benefit in connection with a member of the key management personnel of the entity which in any financial year exceeds, or is capable of exceeding, an amount that is 30 times the average wage or salary of a full-time employee of the entity.


Note 1:   The recipient of the benefit need not be the member of the key management personnel.


Note 2:   Key management personnel has the meaning given by section 9.


(2)   If the benefit is given, or is proposed to be given, in connection with a member of the key management personnel of the entity for a period of less than 12 months in a financial year, the amount calculated under subsection (1) is taken to be reduced proportionately to reflect the number of days in that year to which the benefit relates.


(3)   In this section:



benefit includes the amount of the benefit or the money value of the benefit (if it is not, or not solely, a payment of a monetary amount).



entity includes related entities, so that the total or all benefits given by related entities in relation to a member of the key management personnel must not exceed the relevant amount. full-time employee does not include any person who is a member of the key management personnel or who holds a similar position, or any other person prescribed by the regulations.


(4)   For the purposes of subsection (1), the regulations may prescribe a method or methods for the calculation of the average wage or salary of a full-time employee of an entity.


The amendment is self-explanatory. There are definitions below that. It means that we as a parliament responsible for ensuring that the people of this nation share in its wealth put a limit of 30 times on the packages of CEOs that of the average worker in a corporation. I am not going to labour the point. It is so obviously self-explanatory; it is so obviously reasonable; it is so obviously decent; it is so obviously in keeping with Australians and the hard work that people do for corporations that there should be such a limit paid on the executive caps.


We are talking about this in an era in which stronger action is being taken in Europe, in an era in which we are seeing—and I know that the opposition argues—a greater international interchange of CEOs. Many of the CEOs that get these extra­ordinary packages in Australia come to Australia for a few years and leave again. The opposition argues—




Senator Cormann:
  And the government.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  And the government, that they will be better skilled than Australians. I do not accept that. I do not believe it and, as I said in the second reading speech, I think there is a humanity involved in the payment in the qualities that you look for in a CEO. There is some parallel here in the endless argument about how well or otherwise members of parlia­ment are paid and there can be no justification—and I have heard none in this debate and will hear none—for packages as big as $16 million in one year being taken, raked off by CEOs of big banks in this country, while, as I said, there is a regressive tax at ATM level on the poorest people in Australia, put on by the banks and illegal if it were in the United Kingdom, but done here in Australia and raising enormous amounts of money. It is not enough to pay for those CEO packages, you would not think, but contributes to them at the expense of people who are having a real struggle—good Australians, people who have worked all their lives for this country and for these corporations, who find themselves in struggle street while bank managers and mining corporation managers take home packages way in excess of $10 million, and headed even higher in a country where the principle of a fair go and a reasonable relationship between CEOs packages and those of ordinary workers has been lost and needs to be regained. I commend this amendment to the bill to the chamber.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:32):  The coalition will not be supporting this Greens amendment. The level of executive remuneration is appropriately a matter for companies to decide. It is up to shareholders and their company boards to make these sorts of decisions. Parliament has a role in ensuring that a proper framework is in place to ensure transparency of decision-making around executive remuneration matters. While we have concerns about some aspects of this bill, hence the coalition amendments on the Notice Paper, this is what this bill is trying to do. But there is no role in the coalition's view for government, or the parliament for that matter, to interfere in the level of remuneration by imposing a legislation pay cut.


The Greens proposal in our view is completely irresponsible. To go down this path seriously undermines our international competitiveness when it comes to attracting the best and brightest to run our companies. We do want to attract the best people to lead Australian companies so that those com­panies reach their full potential, which of course helps Australia to maximise our potential in terms of economic growth. This is obviously an area where it is easy to go for the populist proposal that can readily generate a superficial level of public support. But when you actually scrutinise the implications of this and what it would mean in terms of maximising our opportunities across Australia, this would actually be a very, counterproductive amendment if it were passed by the Senate and, as such, the coalition will oppose it and recommends to the Senate that it do likewise.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (10:34):  On behalf of the govern­ment, this is not an unfamiliar amendment. We have had it brought to the Senate on at least three or four occasions that I can recall in dealing with these matters, though I think on this occasion we are dealing with a proposed cap from the Greens of approxi­mately $1.98 million. On previous occasions, I can recollect, it was approximately $5 million.


Shareholders take on the risk of investing capital and they share in the company's profits and losses. As the owners of a company, the government believes they do deserve more say over the remuneration of company executives. I suppose the key argument before us in dealing with this amendment and the legislation is how that is achieved. Giving shareholders a greater ability to spill the board, that is, remove them, over the remuneration of company executives, is a tough measure. It is a tough measure by any international standards that I am aware of.


But we also have to be economically responsible. Companies are important to the Australian economy and it is the role of the owners of those companies, the shareholders, to hold directors accountable on rem­uneration matters. It is not the role of government to hold the executives directly responsible; it is the role of shareholders. 


The Productivity Commission reports states that a cap, as is being proposed here—and which of course was obviously a matter of consideration by the PC; it was certainly presented by a number of the submitters to the PC—


... would disadvantage some firms over others and have undesirable commercial consequences for Australian companies relative to their competitors


and that is on page xxvii, page 27. 


The Productivity Commission also points out in the report:


There is no single right answer to structuring pay. Board discretion remains central to ensuring that pay structures are appropriate for each company's circumstances over time.


That is on page 189. It continues:


A salary cap would place Australia's public companies at a disadvantage against international competitors and private companies particularly in relation to hiring and retaining their executive talent. 


Under the government's reforms directors will need to be able to stand in front of the shareholders and justify their decisions in relation to the pay packets of executives or face the risk of being removed from the board. The government wants to make sure that Australia has a system that rewards talent, hard work and good performance and gives shareholders the ability to have their say if they believe that an executive is being paid too highly. Importantly, the two-strikes test strengthens the non-binding vote while maintaining the fundamental principle underlying Australia's corporate governance framework that directors are responsible for, and accountable to, shareholders on all aspects of the management of the company. The Labor government will not be support­ing the amendment moved by Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens.

Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:37):  There we got the same old argument that we do not have the best and brightest in Australia and we need to import them from overseas—jack up the salaries, give more millions on top of the millions already, attract the Don Voeltes and other people from elsewhere because we do not have the talent in Australia. What rubbish! What utter hogwash! If Senator Cormann and the opposition want to have a plebiscite they should have one on the Greens' wish to put a cap of $5 million on CEO salaries. If you want to spend millions more dollars of taxpayers' money, try us on that one. 




Senator Cormann:
  Are you proposing that? 




Senator BOB BROWN:
  I bet you and Mr Abbott will not do that, will you? Of course, you will not.

  I think we have touched a nerve here.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Not mine, but you carry on.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  No, you have had to defend him. We are not going to hear such a positive mood for my challenge. Let us have a plebiscite, if the opposition want one, on pegging these obscene CEO salaries at $5 million, which is 75 times the average income of workers in this country. If they want to do something about making this country a fairer place in the future, they should try that on. Of course, they will not. They repeatedly come in here to advocate for the already rich—the super-rich, the millionaires and the barons—against the interests of the average worker and the future of the average Australian. 


This is a more modest amendment. I have heard the government just reject it. It is the right thing to do. The Greens feel very strongly about this matter and feel very justified in bringing this worthy amendment before the chamber.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (10:40):  There is one relatively brief point I want to make about this issue of international competitiveness. Whether Senator Brown or indeed anyone else likes the fact or not, it is a fact that many areas of the economy in Australia—and I can think of many sectors, including the mining sector and the finance sector—are interlinked with the rest of the world. Whether people like that or not, it is just a fact of life that we are in an internationally competitive world. It is appropriate that in some areas of the labour market there is movement to and from Australia as part of that world economy, and that is true in financial services, tourism and mining. That is just a fact of life.


No matter how some people might criticise that or be concerned about it, it is part of the international capitalist economy in which we live. Part of that, of course, is the movement to and from labour markets and on occasions—I would not argue or suggest on all occasions or anywhere near it—you need to take into account the pay and conditions in that international labour market itself. That is just part and parcel of a modern Australian economy and a modern world economy.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:41):  The minister mentioned financial services now need to be there with the rest of the world, so is he going to join other members of the G20 in supporting a Tobin tax so that financial services have minimal tax applied so we can help feed the million people starving around the world? I do not think we are going to hear that from this government. I do not think we are going to hear from the government or the opposition that there will be agreement to back financial packages going to CEOs that may come through in the UK or Europe. We as a parliament here are charged to set rules for our own country. Sure, there is international trade in lots of things but there are lots of restrictions on that as well, legislated by the coalition and legislated by the opposition. That is what we are here for. We are here to ensure we do the right thing by Australians, and this amend­ment does the right thing by Australians.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:42):  I was working away in my office watching the in-house broadcast of these proceedings on the TV, as I always do, and I was occasioned to come down here by the ultimate hypocrisy of the Greens yet again. Here is Senator Bob Brown railing about the multinationals, the millionaires and the billionaires and how the Greens are opposed to them. I reflect on the flood levy tax, which the Greens supported quite vociferously, and wonder why then Senator Brown was not so concerned about the multinational billionaire companies. You will recall that with the flood levy, which the Greens supported, the only people who were taxed were individual Australians, not companies—not the big mining companies that earn so much money and send all the profits overseas, as we keep hearing Senator Brown talk about. When I asked Senator Brown during that debate why he was exempting those multinational billionaire companies, as he calls them—the companies that send all of Australia's profits overseas, as he says—from the flood levy but imposing that flood levy on ordinary Australians, did I get an answer from Senator Brown? Of course I did not, because it just demonstrates the hypocrisy of the Greens political party. I do not want a rerun of the flood levy tax debate, but I do want to ask Senator Brown again why it was that he was imposing a tax on the local butcher and baker but not imposing the same tax on Woolworths and Coles, who are the principal competitors of the local butcher and baker. Did I get an answer to that? Would I get an answer now perhaps, Senator Brown? Perhaps you will tell me why your party's hypocrisy knew no ends when it came to the flood levy tax. That was an important debate, as is the debate before us today.


What Senator Cormann has indicated on the bill and amendment is sensible and is the way I will vote when this bill comes to fruition, but I do want to know, on hearing all the pious words, all the anger and all the enthusiasm of Senator Brown about the billionaires who run the country, why he exempted those billionaires from the flood levy. Why did he make the local butcher and baker pay the flood levy tax but not Coles and Woolworths?




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Forshaw
):  Order! Senator Macdonald, I appreciate the context in which you have been putting your remarks in this debate, but we are dealing with entirely different legislation. I think you are starting to stray, particularly in asking questions of Senator Brown on another piece of legislation. You should return to making remarks on this bill.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I hoped I was and I certainly intended to talk about this bill. I thought the approach that Senator Cormann adopted on this bill was one which all Australians would support and is certainly the one that I as a senator will be supporting. What I cannot stand in this committee stage is the absolute hypocrisy of the Greens political party. Anyone listening to the debate on this bill would have heard Senator Brown railing about the wealthy people and the billionaires and how they should not be allowed to get away with it.


In the context of that debate, I ask Senator Brown about those that he calls billionaire, multinational companies, mining companies, Woolworths and Coles. I do not agree with his descriptions, as I do not agree with his descriptions on this amendment before the chair, but why is he so opposed to the foreign, wealthy individuals or companies that he is talking about in this debate yet in the flood levy he let them off absolutely scot-free? It did not cost them a cent. It cost the local butcher and baker a heap and will continue to do so while this flood levy is on. Thanks to Senator Brown supporting the government on this, those multinational companies—the billionaires he talks about who run these companies—have been let off scot-free.



I challenge Senator Brown. Perhaps it is not directly on message, but he refused to answer the question during that debate. He scurried away, joined his mates in the Labor Party and got that tax through on ordinary Australians, but when we suggested it should be a more wide-ranging tax—that is, an income tax that everyone paid to fix up the flood damage in my state and other states—where was Senator Brown? He had scurried away. He was not game to come back and answer those questions then. So here is his opportunity. Perhaps he can do it now. A division having been called and the bells being rung—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senators, the matter that is currently under consideration will have to be adjourned because we have a standing order that says that divisions on Monday mornings cannot take place before 12.30 pm and any questions put to the Senate must be adjourned until after that time. This division will have to be put again at a later stage today because we will not be here at 12.30 pm. The motion moved by Senator Brown is postponed.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:58):  As we flagged during the second reading debate, I will move the amendments which have been circulated on behalf of the coalition in relation to the number of votes having to be cast in order to trigger the so-called two-strikes rule, which can lead to a spill motion. I seek leave to move amendments (1) to (4) on sheet 7087 together.


Leave granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  I move:


 (1)   Schedule 1, item 9, page 8 (lines 4 and 5), omit ""votes cast on a resolution that the remuneration report be adopted were"", substitute ""total votes that were entitled to be cast on a resolution that the remuneration report be adopted were cast"".


 (2)   Schedule 1, item 13, page 12 (lines 6 and 7), omit ""votes cast on a resolution that the remuneration report be adopted were"", substitute ""total votes that were entitled to be cast on a resolution that the remuneration report be adopted were cast"".


 (3)   Schedule 1, item 13, page 12 (lines 9 and 10), omit ""votes cast on a resolution that the remuneration report be adopted were"", substitute ""total votes that were entitled to be cast on a resolution that the remuneration report be adopted were cast"".


 (4)   Schedule 1, item 19, page 16 (lines 29 and 30), omit ""votes cast were"", substitute ""total votes that were entitled to be cast were cast"".


The government is proposing to introduce the so-called two-strikes rule. Under the new law, a two-strikes and re-election process would be introduced in relation to the non-binding shareholder vote on the rem­uneration report. The first strike would occur where a company's remuneration report received a no vote of 25 per cent or more. If this occurred, an explanation of the board's proposed action in response to the no vote would be required. The second strike would occur where a company's subsequent rem­uneration report received a no vote of 25 per cent or more. Where this occurred, share­holders would vote at the same AGM to determine whether the directors needed to stand for re-election. If the spill motion passed with more than 50 per cent of eligible votes cast then a spill meeting would take place within 90 days.


We are talking about a process which can have significant consequences for the companies involved. The government is proposing to calculate the 25 per cent vote on the basis of 25 per cent of the votes cast. The coalition takes the view that that is an inappropriately low proportion. In fact, as we understand it, there is no threshold below which the vote would be prevented from falling. Let me explain. If only 40 per cent of the votes available to be cast are cast—and 25 per cent of 40 per cent is 10 per cent—10 per cent of shareholders can start a process which can lead to a spill motion to be considered by the AGM. I do not think there is any limit as to how low this could go. I would be interested in getting the minister's clarification. What if only 20 per cent of the votes available to be cast are cast? With the 25 per cent, that comes to five per cent of shareholders.


I think our amendment is pretty self-explanatory. We think that a more appropriate threshold is 25 per cent of the votes available to be cast. This is still far from a majority of the shareholders in a company. To have these sorts of consequences, you would expect votes to be 50 per cent plus one. Because of what is being proposed here, 25 per cent seems to be the appropriate percentage, but it should not be 25 per cent of votes cast; it should be 25 per cent of votes available to be cast. Otherwise, as I have mentioned, too small a proportion of overall shareholders would be involved, leading to an outcome which was not properly representative.


As I mentioned, we think it is much more appropriate to use 25 per cent of total votes available, because that would be much more representative than what the government is proposing. That would still be a minority of the shareholders in a particular company, but it would be more than the government currently proposes, where there does not seem to be a limit below which a shareholder vote could fall while still triggering the two-strikes rule.


With those words, I commend the coalition amendment to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (11:02):  I have a couple of points on this amendment from the Liberal-National Party. On the issues of the threshold of 25 per cent, the Productivity Commission did consult widely. It is obviously a matter of considerable interest, and indeed contention, for many.


While the first two strikes occur where a company's remuneration report receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more, there are still several protective measures in place to ensure that there is not a destabilising effect on company operations and that minority shareholders cannot abuse the process to inappropriately undermine company stab­ility. Following the second strike, share­holders will vote to determine whether the directors will need to stand for re-election. The spill resolution can only pass with 50 per cent or more of eligible votes cast. If it passes then the spill meeting, which must be held within 90 days, also requires over 50 per cent of votes to pass. The two-strikes process allows shareholders to express their concern with the remuneration report and compels a company to outline their response to these concerns.


As the PC concluded, a threshold of 25 per cent would better align with levels commonly accepted as demonstrating serious shareholder concern about remuneration, particularly in light of current voting patterns. Clearly it provides a greater level of accountability than a threshold of 50 per cent. In short, the two-strikes test empowers share­holders to take action against unres­ponsive boards while avoiding any destab­ilising effect on companies. 


The senator asked a question about the minimum. The minimum is not a legislative minimum; it is the minimum established in the company's constitution, so that is the relevant figure. We believe it is appropriate, we do not believe it is set too low and we oppose the opposition's amendment.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Trood
):  The question is that the amendment standing in the name of the opposition be agreed to. A division is required. Under the standing orders for sitting of the Senate on Monday mornings, divisions have to be postponed until a later hour of the day, so we cannot proceed with this further now.


Progress reported.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:01):  The coalition will not oppose the Corporations Amendment (Improving Account­ability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. However, we will seek to make an important amendment to it and we will raise some questions during the committee stages of the debate. While we are broadly supportive of the objective of achiev­ing better alignment between share­holders and boards on the issue of executive remuneration, we are concerned about the potential for unintended consequences which can flow from excessive and overly prescriptive regulation in this area.


This bill does implement recom­mendations of the Productivity Commission from its recent inquiry into executive remuneration in Australia which reported back on 4 January 2010. Concern around the issue of executive remuneration led to this review. The review commenced in 2009 and received 170-odd submissions. The final report was provided to the government back in December 2009.


This bill's main provisions include requiring a vote for directors to stand for re-election if they do not adequately address shareholder concerns on remuneration issues over two consecutive years—the so-called 'two-strikes rule'. It changes regulation with respect to the use of remuneration consul­tants. It prohibits directors and executives voting their shares on remuneration resolu­tions. It prohibits hedging of incentive rem­uneration. It requires shareholder approval for declarations of no vacancy at an annual general meeting. It requires that any directed proxies are voted as directed. It seeks to reduce the complexity of the rem­uneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


Changes to voting arrangements must, in our view, be careful not to distort the wishes of the majority of shareholders. The views of a minority of shareholders, while important, should not too easily hold hostage the majority view across company annual general meetings. When it comes to the level of support required to reject a remuneration report—a process that can lead to a spill of the board—we believe the bar has been set too low. As currently proposed, the threshold for the two-strikes rule is 25 per cent of votes cast. This could be a very low threshold indeed. If fewer than 50 per cent of votes are cast and there are 25 per cent of that, it could be a very small number of shareholders that could lead a company to a circumstance where the board would be spilled at a subsequent AGM. Therefore, the coalition will be moving an amendment to require the threshold to be 25 per cent—but 25 per cent of the total votes available to be cast. That is still a minority across any AGM; however, it is a more representative sample and, we believe, more appropriate in the context of what is being proposed.


There are a number of other issues that we might be able to address during the com­mittee stages of the bill, but I do flag that during the committee stages the coalition will be moving a series of amendments to ensure, essentially, that the 25 per cent threshold for the two-strikes rule is applied to the votes available to be cast, not just to the votes actually cast at the AGM. We think that that is a more appropriate reflection of a sufficient proportion of shareholder votes at an AGM in relation to remuneration matters.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-06-20,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:06):  The Greens have a long history of calling for a curb on executive remuneration. I cannot go beyond former Prime Minister Rudd's description of some of the packages going to CEOs in 2008 as 'obscene'. And obscene they are. An example of that is Rio Tinto's Tom Albanese, who has over $9 million in the latest package, which is a 328 per cent increase in one year. Ask some of the workers in Rio Tinto how they would like a 328 per cent increase, let alone a multi­million dollar package. I am sure we would find that they would all like that sort of consideration. Don Voelte, who is about to go back across the Pacific from Woodside, is getting over $8 million. It would be interesting to see if there is a severance package there. The Commonwealth Bank's CEO is getting over $16 million; that is a 75 per cent increase in one year, and this is a bank that still charges pensioners $2 to withdraw $20 if they have their account with a rival bank. Then there is BHP Billiton, where Marius Kloppers is the recipient of $11 million.


The community has a right to be very concerned about the growing gap between the richest and the poorest in this country. It is something we Greens speak a lot about on a global basis. The number of people on the planet who cannot feed themselves—who are hungry—at the moment has gone from 800 million to 1,000 million this year, but we are here talking about executives who are on packages of more than $2 million, $5 million, $10 million or $15 million in one year. All of us are born onto the planet equal, but human society—and that includes in democratic countries—is allowing the growth of an egregious difference in the way we and our fellow human beings, inside and outside this country, are treated.


The average CEO in Australia earns over 100 times the average wage, and executive remuneration is going up faster than average wages. That means the average CEO in this country is taking home each year more than 100 times the income of people who are on the average wage. There is no way that that can be justified. I know we will hear from the opposition—and it has been the standard mantra from business itself—that you have to pay extraordinary and obscene packages to get the best talent. That does not bear scrutiny, because the best talent—and there is a lot of discussion about this in corporate management circles these days—has a very clear human dimension to it. It is not just talking about profit lines and management regimes; it is about treating workers within your own aegis with sympathy, as human beings and as people who effectively keep corporations going every bit as much as any CEO may do.


When we go back to looking at how out of kilter this is, the total remuneration of a chief executive of a top-50 company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange was $6.4 million last year, in 2010—$6.4 million. Here we are in a cycle of struggle as far as government is concerned, looking at making things harder for people with disabilities or families who have youngsters at home and are dependent upon government supple­ments, because there is not money in the kitty—and why isn't there money in the kitty? Amongst other reasons, it is because the two-speed economy means the miners and the mining sector are not only not paying their way but making it more difficult for everybody's kitty. Up go interest rates because of these multibillion-dollar profits. Up has gone the dollar because of these multibillion-dollar profits. Much of those profits is being exported overseas. We Greens are in favour of free enterprise, but that means free enterprise which is regulated through the democratic system by this parliament. We do not see in this legislation the required and responsible option of saying to CEOs, 'You can have multimillion-dollar take-home packages, provided they are not more than 30 times the average take-home pay of people in your enterprise.'



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Forshaw
):  Excuse me, Senator Brown. There is too much conversation. Senator Brown, you have the call.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The Greens—I might say with some embarrassment, because we think even this proposal is out of kilter—will move to amend this bill so that there is a limit of 30 times put on the gap between executive salaries and the average worker. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I ask every other senator: when you sit down and think about it, do you believe that executives do 30 times the amount of work of the average worker in any corporation? The answer is: no, they do not. Then do you believe that executives who have had the privilege of getting to the top should not have a qualification which says they understand their workers enough to be able to share the largesse of the corporation so that they do not get more out of the corporation than their work warrants—or, to put it the other way, that the average workers in the corporation are not going home struggling to make ends meet while the executive is working out how to spend a multimillion-dollar take-home package that is more than 30 times that of the average worker in the corporation? Common sense, common decency and an egalitarian approach to the way our society works demand that we seriously look at this extraordinary overrun of the executive pay gravy train, driven up front by executives and boards themselves. From 2001-2010 executive pay rose by 130 per cent, but average weekly earnings rose only by 52 per cent. That is not taking into account real amounts because that is even more startling. On a percentage basis executive salaries are rising at three times that of average workers. Over the last financial year executive pay rose by an average of almost $1 million—$18,000 per week. That is the increase in what Kevin Rudd called 'obscene packages'. Over the same period the average wage of full-time workers rose by just $3,200, or $62 per week. So there you have executives getting $18,000 per week extra and the average workers getting $62. How can we entertain facilitating that sort of increase? The legislation we have before us today says that it will empower shareholders in corpor­ations, if they have a 25 per cent vote twice against executive packages, to have a 50 per cent vote to throw out the board. But it does not really tackle this issue, and the Labor minister and the coalition representative opposite know that—it is not going to occur. The obscenity of these packages cuts right across our national ethos of a fair go.


Company profits as a share of national income are at record levels, but the wages share of national income is at the lowest level since 1984. How can that be? I can assure you that this legislation will not address that problem. In the past I and my colleagues have proposed in this Senate—and Adam Bandt, the member for Mel­bourne, in the House of Repre­sen­tatives—measures which include a cap on total executive remuneration of $5 million to stop the excesses of the past decade. That limit is more than 10 times the Prime Minister's salary. Is anybody in this Senate or the House going to get up and try to explain why any executive of any mining corporation or banking outfit in this country should be paid more than 10 times the Prime Minister's salary? No, nobody in the coalition or Labor ranks will do that, but that is effectively what they will all vote for if they turn down the Greens amendment today—and I am not holding my breath.




Senator Fifield:
  Feel free.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  You might wish that I would hold my breath but I am challenging you, when your turn comes again, to respond to this out-of-kilter situation. Look at this: a top marginal tax rate of 50 per cent on incomes of more than $1 million in a year is proposed by the Greens and everybody votes it down.


We also want a binding shareholder vote on company remuneration policy. We believe these measures are sensible and, if implemented, would have already started to rein in the executive salary imbalance that I have talked about. We know what the bill is about. I have put forward the preferred options that the Greens would be pursuing and we stick to our guns on it, because what we are proposing is eminently reasonable; in fact, it is far short of what we should have if we were to have a fairer system in place in this country.


The Greens support other measures in the bill to increase transparency with regard to executive remuneration. That includes increasing the transparency and account­ability with respect to the use of rem­uneration consultants; in particular, that such consultants report to non-executive directors or the remuneration committee. We also support addressing conflicts of interest that exist with directors and executives voting their shares on remuneration packages and agree that directors and executives with voting shares should not be allowed to vote on the remuneration reports.


We also back the components of the bill ensuring that remuneration remains linked to performance by prohibiting hedging of incentive remuneration; requiring share­holder approval for declarations of no vac­ancy at an annual general meeting; prohibit­ing proxy shareholders from cherry picking the proxies they exercise by requiring that any directed proxies that are not voted default to the chair, who is required to vote for the proxies as directed; and reducing the complexity of the remuneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


These measures also go to implementing some of the principles of executive remun­eration agreed by the G20, nearly two years back, improving the way companies go about determining remuneration for executives and increasing transparency, which is at the heart of this legislation. But when it gets to the key—the actual definition of a limit to executive packages which are right off the show and getting worse—this bill is not going to address the problem. The Greens amendment will address the problem—and very modestly at that—but this bill will not do that. I will be moving the amendments in committee, and I will ask the other senators in the chamber to seriously consider those amendments. I can assure them that they will have the backing of the Australian people if the amendments are supported.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (10:21):  On behalf of the govern­ment I thank those honourable senators who have taken part in the debate on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The issues for those of us in the chamber are familiar. We have had debate on these matters in some way, shape or form, certainly I can recollect, at least four or five times over the last five or six years. It well illustrates the community interest in executive remuneration.


The government, and I on behalf of the government, believe it is important to have a remuneration framework that not only is internationally competitive but also appropriately rewards executives for the wealth they create for shareholders. While Australia's framework is relatively strong, the global financial crisis highlighted many issues relating to remuneration structures. In particular, it illustrated the dangers of remuneration structures that focus on short-term results, reward excessive risk taking and promote corporate greed.


Responding to these concerns in 2009, the government delivered reforms to empower shareholders to reject excessive termination benefits or 'golden handshake' payments. Also in 2009, the government announced it would task the Productivity Commission to undertake a broad review of Australia's remuneration framework. Following a comprehensive inquiry, the Productivity Commission found that Australia's corporate governance and remuneration framework is highly ranked internationally. However, it also recommended a range of reforms to further strengthen Australia's remuneration framework.


The government supported and further strengthened the majority of the recom­mendations. This bill implements many of these recommendations, and will put in place measures that will empower shareholders to influence the remuneration decisions of their company. For example, the bill requires company boards to be responsive to shareholder concerns on remuneration issues through the introduction of a 'two-strikes' test. This will ensure greater accountability of board members if they do not adequately respond to shareholder concerns on remuneration issues over two consecutive years.


In addition, the bill facilitates the independence of remuneration consultants by introducing measures that will assist shareholders to assess the independence of the advice that remuneration consultants provide to boards and remuneration com­mittees. The bill does this by introducing requirements about who must approve the engagement of a remuneration consultant and who the remuneration consultant must report to. The bill also requires the board and the remuneration consultant to provide a declaration of his independence as well as requiring disclosure of key information such as the fees paid to the remuneration consultant.


The bill prohibits the company's directors and key executives or key management personnel and their closely related parties from voting their shares in a non-binding vote on a remuneration report. This will address the conflict of interest that arises when key management personnel vote on their own remuneration packages.


Key management personnel would also be prohibited from voting undirected proxies on a remuneration report and spill resolution, with an exception for when they are acting as chair of the meeting and the shareholder has provided their informed consent. The exception for the chair is intended to apply to the non-binding vote required under section 250R of the Corporations Act.


The bill also prohibits key management personnel from hedging their incentive remuneration. This will ensure that remuneration remains linked to performance and the interests of management remains aligned with the interests of shareholders. The bill prevents boards from declaring 'no vacancy' without explicit shareholder con­sent. This will ensure that the board cannot operate in a closed-shop fashion and will provide greater scope for shareholder oversight on issues like executive remuneration.


Finally, the bill prevents proxy holders from cherry-picking which proxies they exercise, which will enfranchise shareholders who choose to vote by proxy. In summary, this bill will give unprecedented power to shareholders, improve the accountability of company directors on remuneration issues, address conflicts of interest that exist in the remuneration-setting process and promote a culture of responsible remuneration prac­tices. At the same time, the bill recog­nises that directors are accountable to shareholders for the level and composition of executive remuneration. As shareholders are the owners of the company, they take on the risk of investing their capital and share in the company's profits and losses and they deserve more say over how the pay of company executives is set. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:08):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 5) Bill 2010 makes a number of changes to Australian taxation law. The bill extends the main residence capital gains tax exemption to a capital gains tax event that is a compulsory acquisition of part of the adjacent land or structure of the main residence without the compulsory acquisition applying to the dwelling. The bill also allows non-profit subentities to access goods and services tax concessions available to a parent entity, including the higher registration turnover threshold available for non-profit bodies. It also provides that it will not be mandatory for the Commissioner for Taxation to apply a payment credit for running a balance account surplus against a tax debt that is a business activity statement amount unless that amount is due and payable.


The previous two issues flow from recommendations made by the Board of Taxation in its review of the legal framework for the administration of the GST. The bill makes two further changes to the eligibility criteria for accessing the film tax offsets, reducing the qualifying expenditure threshold for the post digital and visual effects offset from $5 million to $500,000 and removing the local production expen­diture requirements for films between $15 million and $50 million.


The bill also changes the rules surrounding deductions in relation to benefit for terminal medical conditions, allowing costs associated with providing terminal medical condition benefits to become tax deductible. Furthermore, the bill includes school uniforms and a range of eligible expenses for the education expenses tax offset from 1 July 2011. The measures I have listed so far are measures which the coalition will support.


We have a further aspect to this bill which involves a broad variety of issues. The final change that is proposed in this bill is a change to the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings. This issue was first proposed in the 2008 budget. This is another issue where the government made a real mess of things by not thinking things through properly. After the government decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings in the 2008 budget, this particular segment of the market just completely collapsed. It is, again, an example of where the government did not think things through before acting. The consequences in the marketplace were immediate. We know that this government is addicted to new and ad hoc tax increases. This is just another one of those examples.


Capital protected borrowings are generally associated with the purchase and holding of shares, units in a unit trust or stapled securities such as instalment warrants. These financial products allow an investor to borrow money to purchase shares, units or stapled securities. These then become security for the loan. These products are used almost exclusively by individuals to access the equity, mainly Australian, or unit trust markets in a relatively prudent way. Industry, yet again, had not been consulted at all about the change and has made strong representations to the government post the May 2008 budget to have the original decision changed.


Since then the government has delayed proposing legislation to implement the change on a number of occasions—in effect, for a period of three years now. In the May 2010 budget, the government then undertook to amend its proposal, changing its preferred benchmark rate by increasing it by 100 basis points. At current interest rate levels, this would be about nine per cent—about six percentage points below the personal unsecured lending rate. This measure, according to the budget papers, cost the government $28 million.


Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 to adjust the benchmark interest rate used to determine the cost of capital protection on a capital protected borrowing. The benchmark rate is to be the RBA's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus the 100 basis points, as I have mentioned. The change would be effective for capital protected borrowings entered into from 13 May 2008, although there have not been all that many of them, given the absolutely incompetent way in which the government sought to introduce the proposal back in 2008.


Stakeholders understand that apportion­ment of deductible interest expenses involves a measure of discretion and subjectivity, but they maintain that the housing loan rate, even plus 100 basis points, is way too low. There is evidence, as I have mentioned, that capital protected borrowings have completely dried up since May 2008, which in turn has impaired the ability of individual investors to access the share market. The Senate Economics Committee inquired into this issue and its report was tabled on 25 March 2011. I want to commend the work done, in particular, by Senator David Bushby, in putting together a very sound argument in the coalition senators' dissenting report as to why what the government is proposing to do is not in the public interest. Evidence from Mr Duncan Fairweather, Executive Director of the Australian Financial Markets Association, revealed the scale of the collapse in these types of financial products. He said 'capital protected loans have fallen by over 45 per cent since the May 2008 budget announcement'.


It is clear that the benchmark rates will be set at an arbitrary threshold. The govern­ment's 2008 budget decision was clearly wrong, which is why they have subsequently walked away from it. The 100 basis point change contained in this legislation is an attempt by the government to salvage a mess that they have created by offering some sort of compromise. However, as I mentioned, stakeholders and experts in the industry argue that it is set way too low to reflect the economics of this market. The Tax Institute, in its submission to the inquiry, argued that the government's approach 'could produce inequitable and distortive outcomes'. More persuasive is the establishment of a benchmark rate at the midpoint between the indicator rates for standard variable rate housing loans and personal unsecured variable rate loans, as was recommended by the Australian Financial Markets Association. 


The amendment that the coalition will seek to move during the committee stage is an attempt to set a level for this benchmark interest rate under capital protected borrowings that equates the cost of the component required for capital protection equivalent to the cost of acquiring separate protection. Given that this was the original goal of the legislation in establishing a threshold, it would seem to the coalition to be the more sensible approach. I appreciate that this is all very technical. However, the consequences in the marketplace have been real and immediate. It is not in our national interest for this sort of gung-ho, ad hoc approach by government to prevent people from accessing the share market in a prudent way where they essentially provide insurance for themselves in the context of their investments. The coalition amendment would establish that the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings would be at the midpoint between the indicator rates for standard variable rate housing loans and the personal unsecured variable rate loans as published by the Reserve Bank. We think that this is a more appropriate compromise position between the status quo and what the government has been trying to do since May 2008.


Evidence presented to the inquiry by Treasury suggests that the government's revenue estimates in relation to the original proposal and this amendment are highly overstated and unlikely to be achieved. In an exchange between Senator Bushby and Treasury, Senator Bushby asked:


Have you done any seat-of-the-pants calculations on what you think the impact that might have?


Dr Lynch said:


… we advised Treasury in 2008, that the market would fall back substantially. It has done that.


So the government knew that the market was going to fall back substantially and they still pressed ahead. Dr Lynch continued:


Further, the level of activity in the income generator within that part of the industry has declined commensurately. Also the number of people employed in that part of the industry has been reduced. For a variety of reasons we think revenue certainly will not meet the expectations that are in the forecast. We cannot be precise with those numbers because I do not have the full basis behind the Treasury estimates.


Dr Lynch further said:



Looking at the longer term, if the market continues in the direction it is going at the present, there will not be very much revenue collected at all through this process.



As such, the fiscal impact of the proposed coalition amendment is assessed as minimal, which is consistent with the AFMA's evidence to the committee. I appreciate tax laws amendment bills are mostly very technical in nature. This bill deals with a broad cross-section of issues. All but one will be supported by the coalition. We will seek to make an amendment to the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings, consistent with what I have outlined.

Senator HURLEY,ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator HURLEY
 (South Australia) (11:19):  Capital protected borrowings are indeed a useful tool for conservative investment in the market. The government has recognised this and seeks to put in place a schedule of this TLAB 5 that does continue this type of investment on reasonable grounds. John Murray's excellent definition of capital protected borrowings from the Parliamentary Library Bills Digest on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 5) Bill 2010 is:


Capital protected borrowings (CPBs) are financial products used for investing in shares. A CPB usually consists of a limited recourse loan and a put option. Under the terms of a limited recourse loan, a lender cannot recover more than the value of the shares if the borrower defaults on the loan. If the value of the shares has increased over the term of the loan and exceeds the loan amount, the borrower pays back the loan amount in cash. Under the ‘put option facility’ if the value of shares has decreased and is less than the loan amount, the borrower transfers the securities back to the lender in full satisfaction of the loan. The borrower’s capital (the amount invested in the product) is therefore protected against a fall in the value of the securities.


This has some loose similarity to the margin loan type system, but it protects the capital while not protecting the interest expense. Under the previous system, both the capital and the interest expense were deductible. The Australian Taxation Office moved to change this. There are very, very few investments where your capital is a deductible expense and the ATO moved against this overly generous system. Indeed, it was overly generous and the popularity of these products was high—and for very good reason: it was a tax system that was far more generous than most. The initial proposal in the 2008 budget caused a reaction against that. The government listened to the concerns in the financial market; they went back out and consulted about the proposals and came back with a different proposal. That proposal was that the interest expense would be looked at under a different way: the variable housing loan rate plus 100 basis points. This was a way to get a midrange that would reflect both a normal interest rate deductibility plus that 100 basis points that recognised the peculiar nature of added expenses in the setting up and running of these types of loans. That is a fairly reasonable rate.


The committee had a look at that and recognised that the margin loan rate was a measure that could be looked at. In the majority report of the committee, we recommended that the rate be set at between the RBA variable housing rate and the margin loan rate. The government has produced a graph that shows that the rate in this bill, of the variable housing loan rate plus 100 basis points, is at the moment exactly in the middle of that variable housing loan rate and the margin loan rate. The government makes the point that, as those rates will tend to come together as the markets settle down, the variable housing rate plus 100 basis points will actually tend towards the more generous end of the system. I take the government's point in that and also the point that the 100 basis points will continue on the more generous end. Although I see some merit in coming closer towards the margin loan rate, I accept that these two rates will converge and that the 100 basis points will be quite a generous outcome for most investors.


It is well known that in our tax system investors will go to wherever they can legally reduce their tax rate. I have no problem with this. The government has no problem with this. But we cannot create distortions in the market by being overly generous in the tax treatment. This is what the Australian tax office realised in the beginning when they withdrew this deductibility. A court case overturned that, and the government has responded in a measured fashion. Again, we have the coalition seeking to be negative about any government proposal; in fact, in this proposal it has taken the outer end of what the industry wants—the very outer end.


My understanding is that industry have indicated that they are happy with the margin loan rate as the indicator. Currently the rate proposed by the government is about 100 basis points below that and, as I have said before, it will probably come closer to the margin loan rate in the end. So the coalition have not only accepted that but have gone to the outer limits of what the industry have proposed as the outcome they wanted. This is not a sensible solution and again shows the coalition treading a more populist path. They are in opposition; they do not see any need to be responsible. I am sure they would have a different view if they were in government.




Senator CORMANN:
  We were in government; we put a better rate.




Senator HURLEY:
  The coalition have put in the outer limit of what the industry wanted. The industry have indicated that they would be satisfied with the margin loan rate, which, as of April 2011, was just under 10 per cent. The rate that the coalition are looking for is nearly 12 per cent, which is two per cent above the margin loan rate. So it is an extreme position, done to garner a bit of support and to tread the populist line, when in fact there is a sensible solution.


I am sure that the government position will be supported by an increase in the amount of these capital protected borrowings that come about. Of course we want to make it a possible option, but we do not want to make it so attractive that it is used for tax evasion, and that is the whole point of this schedule. As I said, the committee leaned towards the possibility of bringing it up towards the margin loan rate, but in the end I am happy to accept that what the government has done is a more practical and reasonable solution. It gives certainty to the markets, and it does give that little bit of recognition of the extra expense and uncertainty in setting up these kinds of financial instru­ments. I am happy that this is a reasonable bill and that schedule 2 is a reasonable response to industry concerns. I commend the government for not proceeding with its original proposal but listening to industry response and coming back with a measured compromise.


Before I finish my remarks I want to commend the government on another part of the schedule of this TLIP 5 bill, and that is the tax deductibility of school uniforms. Additional education expenses have mounted considerably over the years, certainly since I went to school. Even in public schools, a lot of parents find themselves paying extra in school fees, extra in excursions, extra in a number of other areas, and this creates a great deal of pressure on families. The expenses tend to occur at the beginning of the year, when it is quite difficult because of expenses arising from school holidays and the Christmas festive period. Parents are hit with a number of expenses at the beginning of the school year and, indeed, all through the school year. I am very pleased that the Gillard government, in recognition of its election policy, has put in place the tax deductibility of school uniforms. It is not only private schools that have school uniforms now; most public schools have school uniforms. My son went to what was then Elizabeth Fields Primary School in the Davoren Park area. It was a public school, and at that time the schools were working very hard to get their children to buy school uniforms.


First of all, it does give that sense of school pride and school identification, which is extremely good for a school. Secondly, it means that to a large extent there is no difference in the dress of the pupils in the school. So it sounds like a very small measure, but it can be very important to pupils. The Elizabeth Fields school that my son went to was in a very low socioeconomic area—one of the lowest in the state, if not the country—but, nevertheless, there were still a range of income levels in the school. There were working parents, single parents who did and who did not work—there was quite a range.


These days there is quite a lot of competition—I suppose there always has been—between children about how they are dressed and whether they are dressed in the latest clothes advertised on TV and so on. I think a school uniform provides equality between children and takes away one of those aspects that can cause embarrassment to children. So I am a big supporter of school uniforms. I think they are a very valuable part of a school and I really think they contribute to the sense of school pride. I have noticed more and more public schools—certainly in the northern area—tend to go towards having school uniforms.


The tax deductibility, of course, benefits those people who are working. The tax deduction applies only to them. But non-working parents get other supports that have been put in place for families of schoolchildren. So I think it is a reasonable response. When we talk about working families in some of the lower socioeconomic areas, we are talking about people often on an income of perhaps only around $30,000 a year. I think it is clear to all of us here what a difficult struggle it is. There are a number of people in the area where I used to live—in and around Davoren Park and Andrews Farm—who are on incomes of around $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 a year. They are buying a house or paying rent and they are paying their rising utility bills on that amount of money, and it is a difficult struggle to keep going. Tax deductibility of school uniforms will be a great help to them.


I think it generally reflects the Gillard government's commitment to education. Julia Gillard herself, of course, is demonstrably committed to equal opportunity in education and to the improvement of our education system. It gives me great satisfaction to work under a Prime Minister who has that commitment. It is very important, not just in social terms but in economic terms as well, that we have a well-educated population. With the increasing level of robotics and computer aided technology in all areas, including manufacturing but extending right throughout our working life, and with the increased demands of occupational health and safety and training, it is very important that we have a well-educated population. Therefore, it is critical that our government have that focus on education. Small measures such as tax deductibility do add up to a very important demonstration of support for education and support for families to continue to encourage their children to go as far as possible in their education.


So I am delighted to see this measure in this bill. Generally speaking, I think the other measures are pretty uniformly non-controversial, and it is good to see that the government is tidying up areas such as the film tax offsets. We take great pride in this country in the quality of our filmmaking. There is always debate about how best to do it. In fact, when we were in opposition one of my first economics committee meetings was a debate about the change in the tax arrangements for supporting filming in Australia. It is quite interesting that this will perhaps be one of my last contributions as well. This film tax offset will indeed make things easier and clearer for the film industry.


The other measures in schedule 3, 4, 5 and 6 are general tidying up of the tax system that the economics committee looks at regularly. I want to thank the other members of the committee and the secretariat for the work that they did on these hearings. Many people find these tax issues quite dry. We on the economics committee enjoy them immensely and enjoy going through some of this detail. We are very well assisted by members of the financial community. They are very generous in giving their time and explaining to members of the committee in their hearings some of these tricky details of how the system works. I thank them for their contribution and their assistance in all these measures.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  Firstly, if you would allow me, Mr Acting Deputy President, could I just indicate to Senator Hurley—and I am sure this is on behalf of all the members of the Senate Economics Legislation committee—our thanks for her very competent and very effective chairing of the economics committee over, anyway, the three years that I have been involved. Senator Hurley, you and I have had our moments at the economics committee, but you have always been very true to your views. You have always been extremely keen to make sure that the committee operates in a way that ensures that the issues that are before the committee are dealt with effectively, and it has meant that you have slapped me down on a number of occasions—and I have to say to you that you were right every time you did it. So thanks, Senator Hurley, for the work that you have done over that period of time. I, with the other senators, wish you all the best for your future. Certainly you will not have to continue dealing with these dry issues—or maybe not—that come before the Senate economics committee. You said everyone enjoys them immensely. I think you were being a bit over the top when you said that, but that was a nice way to finish your contribution to the economics committee.


The Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 5) Bill 2010 has seven schedules. Schedule 1 relaxes certain eligibility requirements for the film tax offsets, with the aim of enabling more companies to benefit from these offsets. It reduces the minimum qualifying expenditure threshold for the post, digital and visual effects offset from $5 million to $500,000, and it removes the requirement for films with qualifying expenditure of between $15 million and $50 million to have at least 70 per cent of the film's total production expenditure as qualifying Australian production expenditure in order to qualify for the location offset.


I think supporting the Australian film industry is extremely important. The Australian film industry does for this country what the film industry does for many countries, and that is that it actually pushes our culture out to the rest of the world and says, 'This is where we are at; this is what we stand for.' I think it is good that the government continues to support the film industry. The film industry is one of those areas where you cannot measure what the productivity is to the economy, but if you simply look at the economy as being an economy and not a culture as well then you tend to forget these issues. What the government is trying to do here is to make sure that our culture is recognised around the world—a culture that we can be proud of and that is about ensuring that the struggles and tribulations that are in place in this country are recognised around the world. How we have overcome those struggles and tribulations is extremely important, and our film industry is important in doing that. I reckon there are some pretty crook films made from time to time as well, but there are some really good films, and we should be supporting the film industry in this country. Some of the most talented actors around the world come from Australia, and that is because the government took the view that we need to protect and support our culture and promote our culture around the world with the film industry. So I am very supportive and very pleased that the government has removed the requirement for films with qualifying expenditure of between $15 million and $50 million to have at least 70 per cent of the film's total production expenditure as qualifying Australian production expenditure. I think that is a very good part of this bill, and it is extremely important that we continue to support the Australian film industry.


Schedule 2 amends division 247 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to adjust the benchmark interest rate used in the capital protected borrowings provisions to the Reserve Bank of Australia's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus 100 basis points for capital protected borrowings entered into, amended or extended after 7.30 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on 13 May 2008—that is, the budget time. The schedule also amends division 247 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 for transitional arrange­ments for capital protected borrow­ings entered into at or before the 2008 budget time to 30 June 2013. This allows capital protected borrowings entered into at or before the 2008 budget time to apply to the benchmark interest rate used prior to the 2008 budget time until 30 June 2013 or for the life of the product, whichever is earlier. Senator Hurley said we deal with some dry issues. There is one of the dry issues that we deal with, but it is an important issue that the government has tackled in schedule 2.


Schedule 3 amends the income tax law to extend the main residence capital gains tax exemption—the CGT exemption—to a CGT event that is a compulsory acquisition or other involuntary realisation of part of a main residence. The extended exemption will apply where part of a main residence—the part being some or all of the dwelling's adjacent land or structure—is compulsorily acquired or subject to a similar arrangement without the dwelling itself also being compulsorily acquired or subject to the similar arrangement. So this is an important amendment to ensure that there is fairness in relation to this application of income tax law.


Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow super­annuation funds and retirement saving account providers—RSA providers—to deduct the cost of providing terminal medical condition benefits to members. It also amends certain sections of the ITAA 1997 to reflect the drafting convention that the term 'individual' should be used when referring to a human being. I think there is much more work to be done in relation to superannuation. Superannuation is absolutely fundamental to the ongoing economic growth of this country. The Labor government, when it introduced super­annuation, had a long-term vision to ensure that no-one should have to retire in poverty and that there should be some equality between different groups of workers, different classes of workers, in this country to have access to decent retirement benefits. I remember that when I became a union official in 1981 one of my jobs was to go out and try to get superannuation entitlements for workers around the country, because workers were not getting a fair go on superannuation. What this is about is to make sure we continue to grow the super­annuation industry, make the superannuation industry more flexible in a fair and reasonable way and make sure it is relevant to working people in this country, a rele­vance that is extremely important given the benefits that superannuation has not only to the individual worker but to the overall economy as the basis of providing funding to banks, to investors and to driving this economy.


This is a minor amendment to the operation of superannuation funds, but we should never forget that the superannuation industry is absolutely fundamental and important to working people and the broader economy. This might be a minor amendment but it is an amendment that fits in with the overall growth of the superannuation industry and is so important to making sure that people who need access to their superannuation funds can get access for properly determined issues. And what can be more important than deducting the cost of providing benefits to members with a terminal medical condition. Many workers who have worked in the power industry, as I did, and in the shipbuilding industry, as I did, have ended up with mesothelioma and with their life coming to a horrible and tragic end. We should be doing whatever we can to support those workers and their families as they deal with this great challenge of work related death.


It is important to make sure that people can get access to the best aspects of their superannuation through that period. I take the view that we must continue to monitor the operation of superannuation; we must continue to monitor the effectiveness of superannuation in the Australian economy and we must ensure that every worker gets a fair go when it comes to superannuation. That is why it is so important that when we are introducing the mining tax we ensure that we can increase superannuation for workers in this country. It is about building not just an economy but a good society, a fair society. These are the issues that arise from superannuation.


Schedule 5 amends the GST law to allow non-profit subentities to access the GST concessions available to their parent entity, including the higher registration turnover threshold for non-profit bodies. This amendment confirmed the Commissioner for Taxation's current approach in interpreting the law to allow non-profit subentities to access these concessions.


Schedule 6 amends the Taxation Adminis­tration Act 1953 to provide that it will not be mandatory for the Commissioner for Taxation to apply a payment, credit or running balance account surplus against a tax debt that is a business activity statement unless that amount is due and payable. The amendment applies on and from 1 July 2011.


Schedule 7 expands the education tax refund to include school uniform expenses incurred from 1 July 2011. This was announced by the Prime Minister on 13 July 2010 and will cover expenditure on school uniforms which are required or are otherwise approved by a school, including optional school uniforms and sports or physical education uniforms. The ETR allows eligible families to claim 50 per cent of their eligible education expenses to the maximum claimable amounts which are indexed each year. In 2009-10 the maximum claimable amounts were $780—that is, the maximum refund of $390—for each primary school child and $1,558—that is, a maximum refund of $779—for each secondary school child.


This is an important initiative of the government in ensuring that there is a good society, that there is some fairness and equity out there, and that government recognises the cost of education for families. There is no point in just talking about an education revolution or talking about building a good society if we do not actually focus on the issues that are important for families, many of whom are doing it pretty tough.


In the NSW electorate of Macquarie, in which I live, which covers the Windsor and Blue Mountains areas, we have a great range of schools. We have private schools that are very well resourced and where the families can predominantly afford to look after their kids in the way they want to look after them, but there are also areas in the Macquarie electorate where the families are doing it really, really tough. And, when families are doing it really tough, it is important that the government recognises that and does what it can to help those families. What could be more important than ensuring that children in disadvantaged areas can go to a school with decent facilities and not have to have what happened recently when I was in the Windsor area? It was two degrees in the morning and what did we have? We had an open playground area, where all the school children had to be in order to open up new school buildings for the BER. It was not covered and it was nowhere big enough. It is not a good thing for kids to be out in the open air when it is two degrees on a winter morning in Windsor. There is still much more to be done in the Building the Education Revolution program. There is still much more to be done to ensure that we can have our kids well and truly looked after in the public school system. I am a great supporter of the public school system and I would like to see more funding going into the public school system. What this does is make sure that everyone gets a fair go across both the public and private school systems.


There is a lot more to be done. This initiative will help families in the areas that I look after, in the electorate of Macquarie, that are doing it tough. Parents will look forward to getting this money to ensure their kids have access to a school uniform, even if the family is doing it tough. In these debates in here we sometimes forget that families really do it tough from time to time. We want to make sure that kids can have decent facilities in schools and that they have access to school uniforms.


When I was down at Windsor there were two school kids there with polo shirts on in a temperature of two degrees with the wind blowing off the mountains absolutely freezing. But I do not think it was because their families did not have the money to do anything about it; it was because the kids did not think the school jumper was 'cool'. So we have to make sure that when we do this the school jumpers are 'cool' and the kids actually keep themselves warm.


This part of the bill importantly ensures that we also give our kids access to sport and physical education uniforms. It is a great thing in the seat of Macquarie, where I live, to see the school students out there looking after the sporting facilities and out there proud to be representing their school in their school uniforms and sports uniforms.


I am very pleased with this bill. I think this is another demonstration that the Gillard government has got it right on a range of issues in education: Building the Education Revolution, making sure kids have access to decent technological equipment and more computers into the schools—computers that actually deliver for the generation that is computer savvy, the generation that will leave us for dead in computer skills and the generation that can do work anywhere in Australia or anywhere around the world because they are computer literate. Building the infrastructure that brings schools in this country into the 21st century is a massive benefit to the education system in this country. Everywhere I go people are saying they want more, not less, and I think the combination of amendments, especially the part on school education, in this bill is very important.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (11:55):  First of all, I thank those senators who have contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Measures No. 5) Bill 2010. Schedule 1 increases access to film tax offsets. It reduces the minimum qualifying expenditure threshold for the post-digital and visual effects, PDV, offset and it simplifies eligibility requirements for the location offset. This measure is expected to increase employment opportunities and to assist in building capacity and expertise in the local film industry, which will in turn provide benefits for domestic productions.


The change to the location offset in particular will also reduce compliance costs for affected taxpayers. The government is assisting the film industry to attract offshore productions to Australia and expand opportunities for Australian PDV providers to bid for international work. This schedule gives effect to the government's 2010-11 budget announcement. The government, in the 2011-12 budget, has made further commitments to providing support to the Australian film industry.


Schedule 2 adjusts the benchmark interest rate used in the taxation of capital protected borrowing provisions to the Reserve Bank of Australia's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus 100 basis points for capital protected borrowings entered into, amended or extended after 7.30 pm AEST on 13 May 2008. These changes to the benchmark interest rate were first announced on 13 May 2008 and revised on 11 May 2010. The new benchmark interest rate provides a more appropriate basis for apportioning the expense in capital protected borrowings between interest on a borrowing that does not embed the cost of capital protection on one hand and the cost of capital protection on the other. The cost of capital protection will not be treated as interest for tax deductibility purposes. The new benchmark rate takes into account industry concerns over the credit risk borne by lenders for the cost of capital protection that is paid on a deferred basis.


Schedule 2 also provides for transitional arrangements for capital protected borrowings entered into at or before 7.30 pm AEST 13 May 2008. The transitional arrange­ments allow capital protected borrow­ings entered into on or before 13 May 2008 to apply the existing benchmark interest rate until 30 June 2013 or the life of the product, whichever is earlier. This schedule was referred to the Senate Econ­omics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report on the rationale and consequences of changing the benchmark interest rate. The committee recommended that the benchmark interest rate be amended to reflect a range between the variable rate for housing loans and the RBA's indicator lending rate for margin loans. The new benchmark interest rate of the RBA's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus 100 basis points is consistent with the range recommended by the committee.


These amendments are expected to save $170 million over the forward estimates period. These changes are another demonstration of the government's com­mitment to ensure that the tax system is as fair and as efficient as possible.


Schedule 3 extends the main residence capital gains tax exemption to cover a CTG event—that is, a compulsory acquisition or other involuntary realisation of a part of a main residence. The extended exemption will apply where part of a main residence—the part being some or all of the dwelling's adjacent land or structure—is compulsorily acquired without the dwelling itself also being compulsorily acquired.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:08):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 5) Bill 2010 makes a number of changes to Australian taxation law. The bill extends the main residence capital gains tax exemption to a capital gains tax event that is a compulsory acquisition of part of the adjacent land or structure of the main residence without the compulsory acquisition applying to the dwelling. The bill also allows non-profit subentities to access goods and services tax concessions available to a parent entity, including the higher registration turnover threshold available for non-profit bodies. It also provides that it will not be mandatory for the Commissioner for Taxation to apply a payment credit for running a balance account surplus against a tax debt that is a business activity statement amount unless that amount is due and payable.


The previous two issues flow from recommendations made by the Board of Taxation in its review of the legal framework for the administration of the GST. The bill makes two further changes to the eligibility criteria for accessing the film tax offsets, reducing the qualifying expenditure threshold for the post digital and visual effects offset from $5 million to $500,000 and removing the local production expen­diture requirements for films between $15 million and $50 million.


The bill also changes the rules surrounding deductions in relation to benefit for terminal medical conditions, allowing costs associated with providing terminal medical condition benefits to become tax deductible. Furthermore, the bill includes school uniforms and a range of eligible expenses for the education expenses tax offset from 1 July 2011. The measures I have listed so far are measures which the coalition will support.


We have a further aspect to this bill which involves a broad variety of issues. The final change that is proposed in this bill is a change to the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings. This issue was first proposed in the 2008 budget. This is another issue where the government made a real mess of things by not thinking things through properly. After the government decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings in the 2008 budget, this particular segment of the market just completely collapsed. It is, again, an example of where the government did not think things through before acting. The consequences in the marketplace were immediate. We know that this government is addicted to new and ad hoc tax increases. This is just another one of those examples.


Capital protected borrowings are generally associated with the purchase and holding of shares, units in a unit trust or stapled securities such as instalment warrants. These financial products allow an investor to borrow money to purchase shares, units or stapled securities. These then become security for the loan. These products are used almost exclusively by individuals to access the equity, mainly Australian, or unit trust markets in a relatively prudent way. Industry, yet again, had not been consulted at all about the change and has made strong representations to the government post the May 2008 budget to have the original decision changed.


Since then the government has delayed proposing legislation to implement the change on a number of occasions—in effect, for a period of three years now. In the May 2010 budget, the government then undertook to amend its proposal, changing its preferred benchmark rate by increasing it by 100 basis points. At current interest rate levels, this would be about nine per cent—about six percentage points below the personal unsecured lending rate. This measure, according to the budget papers, cost the government $28 million.


Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 to adjust the benchmark interest rate used to determine the cost of capital protection on a capital protected borrowing. The benchmark rate is to be the RBA's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus the 100 basis points, as I have mentioned. The change would be effective for capital protected borrowings entered into from 13 May 2008, although there have not been all that many of them, given the absolutely incompetent way in which the government sought to introduce the proposal back in 2008.


Stakeholders understand that apportion­ment of deductible interest expenses involves a measure of discretion and subjectivity, but they maintain that the housing loan rate, even plus 100 basis points, is way too low. There is evidence, as I have mentioned, that capital protected borrowings have completely dried up since May 2008, which in turn has impaired the ability of individual investors to access the share market. The Senate Economics Committee inquired into this issue and its report was tabled on 25 March 2011. I want to commend the work done, in particular, by Senator David Bushby, in putting together a very sound argument in the coalition senators' dissenting report as to why what the government is proposing to do is not in the public interest. Evidence from Mr Duncan Fairweather, Executive Director of the Australian Financial Markets Association, revealed the scale of the collapse in these types of financial products. He said 'capital protected loans have fallen by over 45 per cent since the May 2008 budget announcement'.


It is clear that the benchmark rates will be set at an arbitrary threshold. The govern­ment's 2008 budget decision was clearly wrong, which is why they have subsequently walked away from it. The 100 basis point change contained in this legislation is an attempt by the government to salvage a mess that they have created by offering some sort of compromise. However, as I mentioned, stakeholders and experts in the industry argue that it is set way too low to reflect the economics of this market. The Tax Institute, in its submission to the inquiry, argued that the government's approach 'could produce inequitable and distortive outcomes'. More persuasive is the establishment of a benchmark rate at the midpoint between the indicator rates for standard variable rate housing loans and personal unsecured variable rate loans, as was recommended by the Australian Financial Markets Association. 


The amendment that the coalition will seek to move during the committee stage is an attempt to set a level for this benchmark interest rate under capital protected borrowings that equates the cost of the component required for capital protection equivalent to the cost of acquiring separate protection. Given that this was the original goal of the legislation in establishing a threshold, it would seem to the coalition to be the more sensible approach. I appreciate that this is all very technical. However, the consequences in the marketplace have been real and immediate. It is not in our national interest for this sort of gung-ho, ad hoc approach by government to prevent people from accessing the share market in a prudent way where they essentially provide insurance for themselves in the context of their investments. The coalition amendment would establish that the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings would be at the midpoint between the indicator rates for standard variable rate housing loans and the personal unsecured variable rate loans as published by the Reserve Bank. We think that this is a more appropriate compromise position between the status quo and what the government has been trying to do since May 2008.


Evidence presented to the inquiry by Treasury suggests that the government's revenue estimates in relation to the original proposal and this amendment are highly overstated and unlikely to be achieved. In an exchange between Senator Bushby and Treasury, Senator Bushby asked:


Have you done any seat-of-the-pants calculations on what you think the impact that might have?


Dr Lynch said:


… we advised Treasury in 2008, that the market would fall back substantially. It has done that.


So the government knew that the market was going to fall back substantially and they still pressed ahead. Dr Lynch continued:


Further, the level of activity in the income generator within that part of the industry has declined commensurately. Also the number of people employed in that part of the industry has been reduced. For a variety of reasons we think revenue certainly will not meet the expectations that are in the forecast. We cannot be precise with those numbers because I do not have the full basis behind the Treasury estimates.


Dr Lynch further said:



Looking at the longer term, if the market continues in the direction it is going at the present, there will not be very much revenue collected at all through this process.



As such, the fiscal impact of the proposed coalition amendment is assessed as minimal, which is consistent with the AFMA's evidence to the committee. I appreciate tax laws amendment bills are mostly very technical in nature. This bill deals with a broad cross-section of issues. All but one will be supported by the coalition. We will seek to make an amendment to the benchmark interest rate for capital protected borrowings, consistent with what I have outlined.

Senator HURLEY,ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator HURLEY
 (South Australia) (11:19):  Capital protected borrowings are indeed a useful tool for conservative investment in the market. The government has recognised this and seeks to put in place a schedule of this TLAB 5 that does continue this type of investment on reasonable grounds. John Murray's excellent definition of capital protected borrowings from the Parliamentary Library Bills Digest on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 5) Bill 2010 is:


Capital protected borrowings (CPBs) are financial products used for investing in shares. A CPB usually consists of a limited recourse loan and a put option. Under the terms of a limited recourse loan, a lender cannot recover more than the value of the shares if the borrower defaults on the loan. If the value of the shares has increased over the term of the loan and exceeds the loan amount, the borrower pays back the loan amount in cash. Under the ‘put option facility’ if the value of shares has decreased and is less than the loan amount, the borrower transfers the securities back to the lender in full satisfaction of the loan. The borrower’s capital (the amount invested in the product) is therefore protected against a fall in the value of the securities.


This has some loose similarity to the margin loan type system, but it protects the capital while not protecting the interest expense. Under the previous system, both the capital and the interest expense were deductible. The Australian Taxation Office moved to change this. There are very, very few investments where your capital is a deductible expense and the ATO moved against this overly generous system. Indeed, it was overly generous and the popularity of these products was high—and for very good reason: it was a tax system that was far more generous than most. The initial proposal in the 2008 budget caused a reaction against that. The government listened to the concerns in the financial market; they went back out and consulted about the proposals and came back with a different proposal. That proposal was that the interest expense would be looked at under a different way: the variable housing loan rate plus 100 basis points. This was a way to get a midrange that would reflect both a normal interest rate deductibility plus that 100 basis points that recognised the peculiar nature of added expenses in the setting up and running of these types of loans. That is a fairly reasonable rate.


The committee had a look at that and recognised that the margin loan rate was a measure that could be looked at. In the majority report of the committee, we recommended that the rate be set at between the RBA variable housing rate and the margin loan rate. The government has produced a graph that shows that the rate in this bill, of the variable housing loan rate plus 100 basis points, is at the moment exactly in the middle of that variable housing loan rate and the margin loan rate. The government makes the point that, as those rates will tend to come together as the markets settle down, the variable housing rate plus 100 basis points will actually tend towards the more generous end of the system. I take the government's point in that and also the point that the 100 basis points will continue on the more generous end. Although I see some merit in coming closer towards the margin loan rate, I accept that these two rates will converge and that the 100 basis points will be quite a generous outcome for most investors.


It is well known that in our tax system investors will go to wherever they can legally reduce their tax rate. I have no problem with this. The government has no problem with this. But we cannot create distortions in the market by being overly generous in the tax treatment. This is what the Australian tax office realised in the beginning when they withdrew this deductibility. A court case overturned that, and the government has responded in a measured fashion. Again, we have the coalition seeking to be negative about any government proposal; in fact, in this proposal it has taken the outer end of what the industry wants—the very outer end.


My understanding is that industry have indicated that they are happy with the margin loan rate as the indicator. Currently the rate proposed by the government is about 100 basis points below that and, as I have said before, it will probably come closer to the margin loan rate in the end. So the coalition have not only accepted that but have gone to the outer limits of what the industry have proposed as the outcome they wanted. This is not a sensible solution and again shows the coalition treading a more populist path. They are in opposition; they do not see any need to be responsible. I am sure they would have a different view if they were in government.




Senator CORMANN:
  We were in government; we put a better rate.




Senator HURLEY:
  The coalition have put in the outer limit of what the industry wanted. The industry have indicated that they would be satisfied with the margin loan rate, which, as of April 2011, was just under 10 per cent. The rate that the coalition are looking for is nearly 12 per cent, which is two per cent above the margin loan rate. So it is an extreme position, done to garner a bit of support and to tread the populist line, when in fact there is a sensible solution.


I am sure that the government position will be supported by an increase in the amount of these capital protected borrowings that come about. Of course we want to make it a possible option, but we do not want to make it so attractive that it is used for tax evasion, and that is the whole point of this schedule. As I said, the committee leaned towards the possibility of bringing it up towards the margin loan rate, but in the end I am happy to accept that what the government has done is a more practical and reasonable solution. It gives certainty to the markets, and it does give that little bit of recognition of the extra expense and uncertainty in setting up these kinds of financial instru­ments. I am happy that this is a reasonable bill and that schedule 2 is a reasonable response to industry concerns. I commend the government for not proceeding with its original proposal but listening to industry response and coming back with a measured compromise.


Before I finish my remarks I want to commend the government on another part of the schedule of this TLIP 5 bill, and that is the tax deductibility of school uniforms. Additional education expenses have mounted considerably over the years, certainly since I went to school. Even in public schools, a lot of parents find themselves paying extra in school fees, extra in excursions, extra in a number of other areas, and this creates a great deal of pressure on families. The expenses tend to occur at the beginning of the year, when it is quite difficult because of expenses arising from school holidays and the Christmas festive period. Parents are hit with a number of expenses at the beginning of the school year and, indeed, all through the school year. I am very pleased that the Gillard government, in recognition of its election policy, has put in place the tax deductibility of school uniforms. It is not only private schools that have school uniforms now; most public schools have school uniforms. My son went to what was then Elizabeth Fields Primary School in the Davoren Park area. It was a public school, and at that time the schools were working very hard to get their children to buy school uniforms.


First of all, it does give that sense of school pride and school identification, which is extremely good for a school. Secondly, it means that to a large extent there is no difference in the dress of the pupils in the school. So it sounds like a very small measure, but it can be very important to pupils. The Elizabeth Fields school that my son went to was in a very low socioeconomic area—one of the lowest in the state, if not the country—but, nevertheless, there were still a range of income levels in the school. There were working parents, single parents who did and who did not work—there was quite a range.


These days there is quite a lot of competition—I suppose there always has been—between children about how they are dressed and whether they are dressed in the latest clothes advertised on TV and so on. I think a school uniform provides equality between children and takes away one of those aspects that can cause embarrassment to children. So I am a big supporter of school uniforms. I think they are a very valuable part of a school and I really think they contribute to the sense of school pride. I have noticed more and more public schools—certainly in the northern area—tend to go towards having school uniforms.


The tax deductibility, of course, benefits those people who are working. The tax deduction applies only to them. But non-working parents get other supports that have been put in place for families of schoolchildren. So I think it is a reasonable response. When we talk about working families in some of the lower socioeconomic areas, we are talking about people often on an income of perhaps only around $30,000 a year. I think it is clear to all of us here what a difficult struggle it is. There are a number of people in the area where I used to live—in and around Davoren Park and Andrews Farm—who are on incomes of around $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 a year. They are buying a house or paying rent and they are paying their rising utility bills on that amount of money, and it is a difficult struggle to keep going. Tax deductibility of school uniforms will be a great help to them.


I think it generally reflects the Gillard government's commitment to education. Julia Gillard herself, of course, is demonstrably committed to equal opportunity in education and to the improvement of our education system. It gives me great satisfaction to work under a Prime Minister who has that commitment. It is very important, not just in social terms but in economic terms as well, that we have a well-educated population. With the increasing level of robotics and computer aided technology in all areas, including manufacturing but extending right throughout our working life, and with the increased demands of occupational health and safety and training, it is very important that we have a well-educated population. Therefore, it is critical that our government have that focus on education. Small measures such as tax deductibility do add up to a very important demonstration of support for education and support for families to continue to encourage their children to go as far as possible in their education.


So I am delighted to see this measure in this bill. Generally speaking, I think the other measures are pretty uniformly non-controversial, and it is good to see that the government is tidying up areas such as the film tax offsets. We take great pride in this country in the quality of our filmmaking. There is always debate about how best to do it. In fact, when we were in opposition one of my first economics committee meetings was a debate about the change in the tax arrangements for supporting filming in Australia. It is quite interesting that this will perhaps be one of my last contributions as well. This film tax offset will indeed make things easier and clearer for the film industry.


The other measures in schedule 3, 4, 5 and 6 are general tidying up of the tax system that the economics committee looks at regularly. I want to thank the other members of the committee and the secretariat for the work that they did on these hearings. Many people find these tax issues quite dry. We on the economics committee enjoy them immensely and enjoy going through some of this detail. We are very well assisted by members of the financial community. They are very generous in giving their time and explaining to members of the committee in their hearings some of these tricky details of how the system works. I thank them for their contribution and their assistance in all these measures.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  Firstly, if you would allow me, Mr Acting Deputy President, could I just indicate to Senator Hurley—and I am sure this is on behalf of all the members of the Senate Economics Legislation committee—our thanks for her very competent and very effective chairing of the economics committee over, anyway, the three years that I have been involved. Senator Hurley, you and I have had our moments at the economics committee, but you have always been very true to your views. You have always been extremely keen to make sure that the committee operates in a way that ensures that the issues that are before the committee are dealt with effectively, and it has meant that you have slapped me down on a number of occasions—and I have to say to you that you were right every time you did it. So thanks, Senator Hurley, for the work that you have done over that period of time. I, with the other senators, wish you all the best for your future. Certainly you will not have to continue dealing with these dry issues—or maybe not—that come before the Senate economics committee. You said everyone enjoys them immensely. I think you were being a bit over the top when you said that, but that was a nice way to finish your contribution to the economics committee.


The Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 5) Bill 2010 has seven schedules. Schedule 1 relaxes certain eligibility requirements for the film tax offsets, with the aim of enabling more companies to benefit from these offsets. It reduces the minimum qualifying expenditure threshold for the post, digital and visual effects offset from $5 million to $500,000, and it removes the requirement for films with qualifying expenditure of between $15 million and $50 million to have at least 70 per cent of the film's total production expenditure as qualifying Australian production expenditure in order to qualify for the location offset.


I think supporting the Australian film industry is extremely important. The Australian film industry does for this country what the film industry does for many countries, and that is that it actually pushes our culture out to the rest of the world and says, 'This is where we are at; this is what we stand for.' I think it is good that the government continues to support the film industry. The film industry is one of those areas where you cannot measure what the productivity is to the economy, but if you simply look at the economy as being an economy and not a culture as well then you tend to forget these issues. What the government is trying to do here is to make sure that our culture is recognised around the world—a culture that we can be proud of and that is about ensuring that the struggles and tribulations that are in place in this country are recognised around the world. How we have overcome those struggles and tribulations is extremely important, and our film industry is important in doing that. I reckon there are some pretty crook films made from time to time as well, but there are some really good films, and we should be supporting the film industry in this country. Some of the most talented actors around the world come from Australia, and that is because the government took the view that we need to protect and support our culture and promote our culture around the world with the film industry. So I am very supportive and very pleased that the government has removed the requirement for films with qualifying expenditure of between $15 million and $50 million to have at least 70 per cent of the film's total production expenditure as qualifying Australian production expenditure. I think that is a very good part of this bill, and it is extremely important that we continue to support the Australian film industry.


Schedule 2 amends division 247 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to adjust the benchmark interest rate used in the capital protected borrowings provisions to the Reserve Bank of Australia's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus 100 basis points for capital protected borrowings entered into, amended or extended after 7.30 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on 13 May 2008—that is, the budget time. The schedule also amends division 247 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 for transitional arrange­ments for capital protected borrow­ings entered into at or before the 2008 budget time to 30 June 2013. This allows capital protected borrowings entered into at or before the 2008 budget time to apply to the benchmark interest rate used prior to the 2008 budget time until 30 June 2013 or for the life of the product, whichever is earlier. Senator Hurley said we deal with some dry issues. There is one of the dry issues that we deal with, but it is an important issue that the government has tackled in schedule 2.


Schedule 3 amends the income tax law to extend the main residence capital gains tax exemption—the CGT exemption—to a CGT event that is a compulsory acquisition or other involuntary realisation of part of a main residence. The extended exemption will apply where part of a main residence—the part being some or all of the dwelling's adjacent land or structure—is compulsorily acquired or subject to a similar arrangement without the dwelling itself also being compulsorily acquired or subject to the similar arrangement. So this is an important amendment to ensure that there is fairness in relation to this application of income tax law.


Schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow super­annuation funds and retirement saving account providers—RSA providers—to deduct the cost of providing terminal medical condition benefits to members. It also amends certain sections of the ITAA 1997 to reflect the drafting convention that the term 'individual' should be used when referring to a human being. I think there is much more work to be done in relation to superannuation. Superannuation is absolutely fundamental to the ongoing economic growth of this country. The Labor government, when it introduced super­annuation, had a long-term vision to ensure that no-one should have to retire in poverty and that there should be some equality between different groups of workers, different classes of workers, in this country to have access to decent retirement benefits. I remember that when I became a union official in 1981 one of my jobs was to go out and try to get superannuation entitlements for workers around the country, because workers were not getting a fair go on superannuation. What this is about is to make sure we continue to grow the super­annuation industry, make the superannuation industry more flexible in a fair and reasonable way and make sure it is relevant to working people in this country, a rele­vance that is extremely important given the benefits that superannuation has not only to the individual worker but to the overall economy as the basis of providing funding to banks, to investors and to driving this economy.


This is a minor amendment to the operation of superannuation funds, but we should never forget that the superannuation industry is absolutely fundamental and important to working people and the broader economy. This might be a minor amendment but it is an amendment that fits in with the overall growth of the superannuation industry and is so important to making sure that people who need access to their superannuation funds can get access for properly determined issues. And what can be more important than deducting the cost of providing benefits to members with a terminal medical condition. Many workers who have worked in the power industry, as I did, and in the shipbuilding industry, as I did, have ended up with mesothelioma and with their life coming to a horrible and tragic end. We should be doing whatever we can to support those workers and their families as they deal with this great challenge of work related death.


It is important to make sure that people can get access to the best aspects of their superannuation through that period. I take the view that we must continue to monitor the operation of superannuation; we must continue to monitor the effectiveness of superannuation in the Australian economy and we must ensure that every worker gets a fair go when it comes to superannuation. That is why it is so important that when we are introducing the mining tax we ensure that we can increase superannuation for workers in this country. It is about building not just an economy but a good society, a fair society. These are the issues that arise from superannuation.


Schedule 5 amends the GST law to allow non-profit subentities to access the GST concessions available to their parent entity, including the higher registration turnover threshold for non-profit bodies. This amendment confirmed the Commissioner for Taxation's current approach in interpreting the law to allow non-profit subentities to access these concessions.


Schedule 6 amends the Taxation Adminis­tration Act 1953 to provide that it will not be mandatory for the Commissioner for Taxation to apply a payment, credit or running balance account surplus against a tax debt that is a business activity statement unless that amount is due and payable. The amendment applies on and from 1 July 2011.


Schedule 7 expands the education tax refund to include school uniform expenses incurred from 1 July 2011. This was announced by the Prime Minister on 13 July 2010 and will cover expenditure on school uniforms which are required or are otherwise approved by a school, including optional school uniforms and sports or physical education uniforms. The ETR allows eligible families to claim 50 per cent of their eligible education expenses to the maximum claimable amounts which are indexed each year. In 2009-10 the maximum claimable amounts were $780—that is, the maximum refund of $390—for each primary school child and $1,558—that is, a maximum refund of $779—for each secondary school child.


This is an important initiative of the government in ensuring that there is a good society, that there is some fairness and equity out there, and that government recognises the cost of education for families. There is no point in just talking about an education revolution or talking about building a good society if we do not actually focus on the issues that are important for families, many of whom are doing it pretty tough.


In the NSW electorate of Macquarie, in which I live, which covers the Windsor and Blue Mountains areas, we have a great range of schools. We have private schools that are very well resourced and where the families can predominantly afford to look after their kids in the way they want to look after them, but there are also areas in the Macquarie electorate where the families are doing it really, really tough. And, when families are doing it really tough, it is important that the government recognises that and does what it can to help those families. What could be more important than ensuring that children in disadvantaged areas can go to a school with decent facilities and not have to have what happened recently when I was in the Windsor area? It was two degrees in the morning and what did we have? We had an open playground area, where all the school children had to be in order to open up new school buildings for the BER. It was not covered and it was nowhere big enough. It is not a good thing for kids to be out in the open air when it is two degrees on a winter morning in Windsor. There is still much more to be done in the Building the Education Revolution program. There is still much more to be done to ensure that we can have our kids well and truly looked after in the public school system. I am a great supporter of the public school system and I would like to see more funding going into the public school system. What this does is make sure that everyone gets a fair go across both the public and private school systems.


There is a lot more to be done. This initiative will help families in the areas that I look after, in the electorate of Macquarie, that are doing it tough. Parents will look forward to getting this money to ensure their kids have access to a school uniform, even if the family is doing it tough. In these debates in here we sometimes forget that families really do it tough from time to time. We want to make sure that kids can have decent facilities in schools and that they have access to school uniforms.


When I was down at Windsor there were two school kids there with polo shirts on in a temperature of two degrees with the wind blowing off the mountains absolutely freezing. But I do not think it was because their families did not have the money to do anything about it; it was because the kids did not think the school jumper was 'cool'. So we have to make sure that when we do this the school jumpers are 'cool' and the kids actually keep themselves warm.


This part of the bill importantly ensures that we also give our kids access to sport and physical education uniforms. It is a great thing in the seat of Macquarie, where I live, to see the school students out there looking after the sporting facilities and out there proud to be representing their school in their school uniforms and sports uniforms.


I am very pleased with this bill. I think this is another demonstration that the Gillard government has got it right on a range of issues in education: Building the Education Revolution, making sure kids have access to decent technological equipment and more computers into the schools—computers that actually deliver for the generation that is computer savvy, the generation that will leave us for dead in computer skills and the generation that can do work anywhere in Australia or anywhere around the world because they are computer literate. Building the infrastructure that brings schools in this country into the 21st century is a massive benefit to the education system in this country. Everywhere I go people are saying they want more, not less, and I think the combination of amendments, especially the part on school education, in this bill is very important.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (11:55):  First of all, I thank those senators who have contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Measures No. 5) Bill 2010. Schedule 1 increases access to film tax offsets. It reduces the minimum qualifying expenditure threshold for the post-digital and visual effects, PDV, offset and it simplifies eligibility requirements for the location offset. This measure is expected to increase employment opportunities and to assist in building capacity and expertise in the local film industry, which will in turn provide benefits for domestic productions.


The change to the location offset in particular will also reduce compliance costs for affected taxpayers. The government is assisting the film industry to attract offshore productions to Australia and expand opportunities for Australian PDV providers to bid for international work. This schedule gives effect to the government's 2010-11 budget announcement. The government, in the 2011-12 budget, has made further commitments to providing support to the Australian film industry.


Schedule 2 adjusts the benchmark interest rate used in the taxation of capital protected borrowing provisions to the Reserve Bank of Australia's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus 100 basis points for capital protected borrowings entered into, amended or extended after 7.30 pm AEST on 13 May 2008. These changes to the benchmark interest rate were first announced on 13 May 2008 and revised on 11 May 2010. The new benchmark interest rate provides a more appropriate basis for apportioning the expense in capital protected borrowings between interest on a borrowing that does not embed the cost of capital protection on one hand and the cost of capital protection on the other. The cost of capital protection will not be treated as interest for tax deductibility purposes. The new benchmark rate takes into account industry concerns over the credit risk borne by lenders for the cost of capital protection that is paid on a deferred basis.


Schedule 2 also provides for transitional arrangements for capital protected borrowings entered into at or before 7.30 pm AEST 13 May 2008. The transitional arrange­ments allow capital protected borrow­ings entered into on or before 13 May 2008 to apply the existing benchmark interest rate until 30 June 2013 or the life of the product, whichever is earlier. This schedule was referred to the Senate Econ­omics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report on the rationale and consequences of changing the benchmark interest rate. The committee recommended that the benchmark interest rate be amended to reflect a range between the variable rate for housing loans and the RBA's indicator lending rate for margin loans. The new benchmark interest rate of the RBA's indicator lending rate for standard variable housing loans plus 100 basis points is consistent with the range recommended by the committee.


These amendments are expected to save $170 million over the forward estimates period. These changes are another demonstration of the government's com­mitment to ensure that the tax system is as fair and as efficient as possible.


Schedule 3 extends the main residence capital gains tax exemption to cover a CTG event—that is, a compulsory acquisition or other involuntary realisation of a part of a main residence. The extended exemption will apply where part of a main residence—the part being some or all of the dwelling's adjacent land or structure—is compulsorily acquired without the dwelling itself also being compulsorily acquired.

The speech read as follows—



Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011


Over the last thirty years, Australia has exported more than 150 million sheep and cattle to be slaughtered overseas.


More than two million of these animals have died en route.


For the ones that survive, an even crueller fate can await.


On Monday 30 May 2011, ABC's Four Corners aired footage shot in Indonesian abattoirs by Animals Australia and the RSPCA, which showed Australian cattle being tortured and brutalised during slaughter.


Cattle had their tails broken, their eyes gouged, the tendons on their legs slashed; their throats were cut with blunt knives, with an average of 13 strokes taken to kill an animal.


The Mark 1 slaughter boxes, designed in Australia and installed in Indonesian abattoirs using Australian taxpayer funds, do nothing to alleviate this torture. 


In fact, they could be said to facilitate it.


These reports are the latest in a long line of industry exposés, where animal welfare groups have revealed the cruelty inherent in our live export markets.


It is time to bring an end to this brutal trade.


Following the Four Corners investigation, hundreds of thousands of Australians have protested against the live export trade.


Among those protesting are live-stock industry groups, who understand the damage being done to Australia's industry by the condoning of these brutal practices.


Meat and Livestock Australia has said that they were not aware of these practices in Indonesia, and that they are working on improving animal welfare standards in export markets.


However, given that MLA has been active in Indonesia for some twenty years, and that MLA inspectors have provided training and conducted inspections in the abattoirs featured in the Four Corners program, this argument seems to hold little weight.


At the end of the day, it is time to agree that we can no longer condone this violent, inhumane treatment of Australian animals.


The argument that 'if we don't send these countries animals to slaughter, someone else will' is not acceptable.


The fact is, we are sending animals, and they are being abused in the most horrible, brutal ways possible.


It is time to take action.


This Bill proposes to end live exports completely from 1 July 2014. 


In the meantime, regulations will be put in place to ensure that any country we export to meets World Animal Health Organization standards for animal welfare, and that the animals are stunned using humane and appropriate restraints immediately before slaughter.


Currently, not a single country Australia exports to meets these guidelines.


The end date of 1 July 2014 will allow the Government and industry time to restructure, to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to allow Australia to transition to chilled meat exports only.


The Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union has estimated that, in the last twenty years, some 150 meat processing plants have closed, at the cost of approximately 40,000 jobs. The AMIEU says that this is directly attributable to the live export trade.


The Government needs to ensure that there is an appropriate plan in place before the end of live exports. 


This plan should include subsidies to assist producers in transporting their animals until abattoirs in the north are reopened, and compensation to ensure that the industry can make the changes they need to.


It is time to bring an end to this trade, and to support industry in restructuring.


As a country, we can no longer support these brutal practices. We can no longer turn a blind eye to abuse we are in effect sanctioning.


There can be no more excuses for inexcusable behaviour.


It should also be noted that New Zealand banned its live export cattle trade in 2004 following the death of 5000 sheep on an Australian ship bound for Saudi Arabia, and is now a substantial supplier of processed meat to Indonesia.


In response to the Four Corners investigation, New Zealand's Agriculture Minister David Carter has said that New Zealand would not under any circumstances send live cattle to Indonesia.


""The footage is horrific, and that is why New Zealand has such a strong stance on animal welfare,"" Mr Carter said.


""Under no circumstances should we ever send animals from New Zealand to be treated that way.""


If our cousins across the ditch could manage this transition, we should be able to as well.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:38):  Scarcely has there been a more accurate and succinct motion condemning the deception of the Australian people by any government. Prime Minister Gillard's broken promise to the Australian people can be summed up in her immediate promises before the election. Just six days before the election, on 16 August 2010, Prime Minister Gillard said: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Those were her words, meant to soothe the concerns of the Australian people, who knew a carbon tax would be ineffective, would not help the environment and would only add to the cost-of-living pressures that they were already crumbling under.


That was not the last time Prime Minister Gillard had mouthed that platitude or something similar. On 20 August, four days later, she said: 'I rule out a carbon tax.' She made a crystal-clear promise to the Aust­ralian people and four days later reiterated it—confirming her previous words—when she was justifying the brutal knifing of the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, also saying there needed to be a 'community consensus' before a price on carbon could be introduced.


Let me confirm for the record that we will be referring to this price on carbon. However, it is not a price on carbon at all; it is a price on carbon dioxide—which the government will maintain is a pollutant even though her own pollutants agency does not recognise it as such. We know this is about spin and sophistry to cover up for a Prime Minister who does not have a mandate to introduce this very poor policy. It is not grounded in political validation through an election. It is not grounded in a validation of the science. It is not a validation of any justification—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I hear the interjections about the GST from Senator Polley on the other side. The extraordinary delusions of the Labor Party—they refuse to acknowledge the simple fact that Prime Minister Howard, in proposing a GST, took it to an election and put it very clearly in front of the Australian people. There seems to be a stark difference, Senator Polley, between our approach of levelling with the Australian people and the approach taken by this Prime Minister, who is about deception and spin.



Senator Polley interjecting—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I will just remind you, Senator Polley and others on that side that it was the 'real Julia' we heard from during the election, the one who spoke without scripted notes. Remember, she was not going to have scripted notes—they all trotted out that line after their policy launch—except for the fact that she had them in front of her. The lies that have been told by this Prime Minister and this government are extraordinary.


That is why the coalition is asking for this government to renew the faith of the Australian people, to redress the breach of trust with the Australian public that is leaving such a bitter taste in their mouths. The voters of Australia did not elect a parliament or a government that supported a carbon tax. Voters did not force a carbon tax onto a reluctant Prime Minister. This Prime Minister forced it upon herself, and she wants to force it onto the Australian people. She maintains that her backflip on her 'no carbon tax' election promise is not a breach of the trust of the Australian people—it is necessary to redress climate change. Yet they will not tell us what the environmental benefits will be.


Many people tell us what the consequences of this carbon tax will be. We know that it will put up the price of electricity, which Australian families are already suffering under. At $26 a tonne, it is estimated it will put 25 per cent on the cost of electricity. But of course the main pressure group within the ALP, which is the Greens, wanted to start at $40 a tonne and then raise it to $100 a tonne. Imagine the impact that would have on every Australian family. The price of electricity will filter through to every other goods and services provider because most of those involve the use of electricity. We also know that the price of transport will rise, putting even more pressure on the costs of living. We know these things because they are self evident. Everyone seems to recognise and identify them except the government.


We also know that jobs will be exported because industries will be forced to close. In Port Pirie in South Australia, 35 per cent of the workforce is directly or indirectly employed through the smelter. We could see that smelter move offshore, taking with it the efficient emissions and recreating the emissions in a far less efficient manner overseas.


Of course, that does not matter to Prime Minister Gillard or the Labor Party, because what they are interested in is taking more money from the pockets of the Australian people. Make no mistake, this is about a big tax to prop up a big-spending government. Yes, they are going to give some money back in the form of, maybe, some pension relief or some tax relief—we are not sure yet—but they are going to keep the majority of it. They are going to keep the majority of the revenue taken from this big tax—estimated to be $12 billion in its first year—to try to balance their books. Not for them is the normal way of Australian families, where they cut their cloth to fit their purse and where they have to tighten their belts, which families are asked to do all the time. That does not enter the vernacular of this government. They are happy to waste as much money as they possibly can, always seeking short-term benefit, to the long-term detriment of our nation.


The coalition put to the government—and we put it to the Australian people—that the only legitimate way this government can introduce this big new tax is, firstly, to seek the assent of the Australian people. We would, of course, prefer an election, because that is the time-honoured way in which it is done, but we also understand that, with the balance of power of the Independents in the House, the government is not prepared to go to an election right now. So we say: why not seek the authorisation of the Australian people by way of a plebiscite? In the Prime Minister's earlier spin and rhetoric when she brutally knifed Kevin Rudd, she said that she would not introduce a CPRS, a carbon tax or any other price on carbon dioxide emissions without a broad based consensus. I hate to break it to those on the other side but a broad based consensus is not simply the word of paid mouthpieces like Professor Ross Garnaut and Dr Tim Flannery. It is not about them just making up stuff and saying, 'This is outrageous; we're all going to be dest­roying the planet unless we can implement a tax.' But that is exactly what has happened. It is about getting the Australian people onside and knowing that this is going to be an effective and positive policy for the country. The Australian people know that it is not. They know that this is a tax that has been foisted upon them without authorisation, without justification and without explan­ation. This is an extraordinary position for a government to take, and it is a very disappointing position for any government to take. I can fully understand how there may have to be some subtle shifts in policy positions, but I cannot understand how something that has been so unequivocally ruled out can then be ruled in without any further reference to the Australian people.


The unfortunate thing is that the coalition will strive valiantly to make the Australian people aware of what this government is doing to them. But, I regret to say, I fear their awareness may come when it is too late. If this carbon tax gets through the parliament and is implemented, it will only escalate until the coalition can get in and repeal it. Whether it starts at $10, $15, $20 or $25, what we know is that, over the next four years or until this government is gone, it will continue to rise and the 'benefits' will continue to hurt the Australian people, because the benefits of this tax are benefits for other nations. The benefits will create industry in other nations, and they will create jobs in other nations. We will see emissions exported to other nations, where they will get larger, and every Australian will suffer when they turn on their lights, when they open their fridge and when they drive their car. The only one who will not suffer will be this Prime Minister, who will be put out to pension with her superannuation. She will have to wash her hands of the consequences of her heinous policy position. This is a tragedy for Australia, and this government needs to level with the Australian people.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:48):  Another day, another stunt by those on the other side. I have to say that I think the people out there in voter land are getting a bit tired of it so, as far as I am concerned, bring it on. The more you do it, the more you show how unstatesmanlike your leader is and how you are just a party of nay-sayers and negativity. You have taken opposition pretty hard—I understand that—but, by crikey, the way you are all behaving is abysmal. We have seen this scare campaign before. It is the same campaign we saw about jobs during the global financial crisis, where Mr Hockey said that, under Labor, 300,000 Australians were going to lose their jobs in its first term. What happened? In fact, more than 700,000 more Australians are in jobs today than when the government took office, despite the impact of the global financial crisis.


I cannot help but feel a sense of irony when those opposite, including Senator Fifield, decide to lecture us on taking a consistent position. They are the party of short memories. I mean, this is the coalition that in 2007 went to the Australian people with a policy of implementing an emissions trading scheme. In fact, the singular event that dismantled the bipartisan policy of putting a price on carbon was the election of Tony Abbott as Leader of the Opposition. The Liberal-National coalition have come a long way under Mr Abbott—a long way to the right, that is. If there is any doubt now in the minds of the Australian people that Tony Abbott's motive is to prevent action on climate change, then let me put it to rest. Let us examine the evidence bit by bit.


Exhibit 1 is the manner of Mr Abbott's ascension to the leadership. Let us not forget that Mr Abbott was elected to the opposition leadership on a platform of opposing action on climate change. He rolled Malcolm Turnbull for one reason and one reason only: the then Leader of the Opposition had finally come to an agreement with the government on an emissions trading scheme. Mr Abbott won that ballot by one vote, and now a deathly silence has fallen over those in the ranks of the coalition who supported an ETS and supported putting a price on carbon emissions. But the fact that Mr Abbott won that ballot so narrowly indicates a few things to me: (1) that most members and senators in this parliament support putting a price on carbon; (2) that the opposition is clearly divided on this issue; and (3) that those in the opposition who supported putting a price on carbon in late 2009 are too cowardly to speak out. Exhibit No. 2 in the evidence that Mr Abbott opposes climate change action is his denial of the science of climate change itself. In July 2009 on the 7.30 Report Mr Abbott said:




I am, as you know, hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change.



This was followed by a statement in October 2009 at a town hall meeting when he described the argument that human activities were causing climate change as 'absolute crap'. In December 2009 on 2GB he made the astonishingly ill-informed statement that the world's warming had stopped over the last decade, for which he was rebuked by many reputable climate scientists. In June 2010 he told 2GB's Alan Jones that the science on climate change was 'not as certain as many people say'. 




Senator Bernardi:
  I bet you can't name one climate scientist.




Senator BILYK:
  I will come to that, Senator. Then in July 2010, on ABC Brisbane, Mr Abbott said:




I don't necessarily think that carbon dioxide is the environmental villain that everyone makes it out to be ...



And later—




... the scientific consensus is not nearly as solid as the climate change zealots would have us believe. 



So who are Mr Abbott's 'climate change zealots' who try and tell us there is a scientific consensus on climate change? Could he be referring to award-winning scientist Professor Tim Flannery? Or perhaps Australia's Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb? Is he a 'climate change zealot'? I would be interested to know how many in the ranks of the opposition support Mr Abbott's comments on the science of climate change. We know that Senator Minchin is unconvinced by the science, and the same appears to be true for Senator Joyce. One has to wonder how much the opposition's policies are influenced by the fact that there are many within their ranks who have their heads in the sand because they just don't believe the threat exists. And if you think the threat exists, then remember that Mr Abbott was denying the threat less than a year ago. In fact, he is still denying it.


Exhibit No. 3 is the opposition's sham policy that serves as a proxy for something resembling a plan to tackle climate change. If you want to know the real motives behind Mr Abbott's so-called direct action proposal, you need only to have listened to Mr Turnbull on Lateline. When asked why the coalition's policy was better, Mr Turnbull replied that it could be 'more easily abandoned'. Mr Turnbull has let the cat out of the bag. He probably feels uncomfortable revealing what the rest of the opposition does not want to admit: that the coalition's direct action policy is no more than a tokenistic gesture to those Australians who support action on climate change. It is basically the policy you have when you don't really have a policy—it is a complete Clayton's policy. I am sure when the coalition adopted it they celebrated with a round of Clayton's to go with it.


Perhaps instead of recruiting Angry Anderson for their ads, the coalition could have signed up Fabio to promote 'I can't believe it's not climate change action'. Or perhaps a better description for the opposition's policy would be 'direct inaction'. That is what it should be called. It will cost Australian taxpayers $720 per household, it will punch a $20 billion black hole in the budget, and it will not provide any compensation for the rising costs that Australians face as a result. Moreover, it will not achieve the bipartisan target of a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions on 2000 levels by 2020. 


The government, on the other hand, will make the big polluters pay. It will do so by putting a fixed price on carbon emissions as a transitional measure towards an emissions trading scheme. It is a market based solution. We know from a recent Productivity Commission report that market based schemes are the cheapest way to reduce carbon emissions. We know that some of the costs will be passed on to consumers, and we will be providing generous household assistance to compensate. 


If you go back in history and look at the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—which was coalition policy until Mr Turnbull was unceremoniously rolled—100 per cent of low-income households and 50 per cent of middle-income households would have been at least fully compensated for the cost impact, with many actually being better off under the scheme. The details of the carbon price scheme are being negotiated through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and will be announced with plenty of time for Australian industry and Australian householders to prepare for the scheme's introduction in July 2012. 


But Senator Fifield is not really arguing about the policy itself. His MPI is about consistency, and when the opposition seeks to lecture those on this side of the chamber about consistency, well they are living in a glasshouse. For a party with more positions on climate change science and climate change action than a professional contortionist, Mr Abbott's call for a plebiscite is a bit rich. It is  also one of the biggest dummy-spits in Australian political history. Mr Abbott refuses to accept the verdict of the Australian people from the last election. As I said, they have not taken too well to opposition at all. He also refuses to accept the verdict of the Independents and crossbenchers when they rejected his $11 billion black hole—a black hole that he kept successfully hidden from the Australian people until after the election. Tony Abbott clearly is not faint-hearted about spending money when he is proposing to spend—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Bilyk, you must refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his proper name.




Senator BILYK:
  Mr Abbott clearly is not faint-hearted about spending money when he is proposing to spend $80 million on a political stunt. He knows it is a stunt, because he refuses to say whether he will accept the verdict of the plebiscite even if it goes ahead. The way democracy works is that MPs and senators are elected to represent their communities in parliament and to make laws. In a few months, MPs and senators will have a chance to vote on the government's plans for a carbon price. That is how democracy works. 


But if you want to talk about our mandate, Senator Fifield—he has done a bit of a runner, I think—then here it is: the government went to the last election with a policy of putting a price on carbon. Amid all the bluster, stunts and fanfare coming from those ostriches on the other side of the chamber, this whole debate comes down to one simple fact— (Time expired)

 (Queensland) (15:58):  I don't mind people coming in here and making some strong points, some solid points—even vigorous points—but what I object to is people coming in here and telling blatant lies. That speech was a series of blatant mistruths.




Senator Arbib:
  I ask that Senator Boswell withdraw that imputation.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Boswell, I think you should withdraw that because the implication is that the speaker was lying. I think you should withdraw.




Senator BOSWELL:
  I withdraw. However you like to dress it up, the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Four days later she repeated it. You cannot get any other interpretation from that. It is so straightforward that it does not lend itself to any interpretation other than that there will be no carbon tax. Then we are going to have 150 of the best and brightest turn up to a citizens assembly to make the decision. That was laughed out of court. Who was going to be in the 150?


There was a very strong story going around—it was not a rumour; it was a story—and it was actually told by Kevin Rudd. Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan told him to drop this carbon tax like a hot cake. What did he do? He listened to their and advice and dropped it like a hot cake, only to be garrotted, emasculated by the fact that he dropped the carbon tax when he was told to by the now Prime Minister and the now Deputy Prime Minister. No wonder he is bitter and twisted. No wonder he is hurt. No wonder the people of Queensland think that he was done over—and he was. He did exactly what he was told to do and then got garrotted for it.


The government told the people there would be no carbon tax. I actually believe that that is what they meant until the Greens told them: 'Hang on, if you want our support you will have a carbon tax whether you like it or not, whether 72 per cent of the people like it or not. Seventy-two per cent don't like it, 28 per cent do, but that doesn't matter. We're the Greens and we're telling you what to do. All we want is 10 per cent of that vote.' You are bleeding to the Greens to the left and you are bleeding to the blue-collar workers to the right. You waffle on and you cannot make a decision. I have been down this track myself with Pauline Hanson and there is one way to do it: you go in and say, 'We are the government and we will try and assist you when you don't hurt our followers.' 


When you do that you will be the Labor Party that stands up for something, but until you do that your vote will just be whittled away, as it is now. Twenty-seven per cent. Has anyone seen the Labor vote down at 27 per cent? It has never gone down that far, never been there, ever. And of course it will go there. People know who runs this government: it is Bob Brown. If you are for the Bob Brown line of thought you vote Green. If you are against the Bob Brown line of thought you vote for the coalition. That is why your vote is being whittled away and whittled away. Do you want to do something about it? I believe Tony Abbott gave you a way out today.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Hutchins
):  Senator Boswell, you need to refer to senators and members by their proper titles.




Senator BOSWELL:
  The Leader of the Opposition is giving you a way out. He is going to introduce a bill tomorrow for a plebiscite asking: are you in favour of laws to impose a carbon tax? This is the greatest opportunity you have. You can get out of this by supporting that bill. You can say: 'Well, 72 per cent of the people voted against it; we can't defy them. The people are always right.' I will give you a bit of advice: take this and run. Take this offer of Tony Abbott's and say: 'We support it. We want to go to a plebiscite.' And when the result is, as it will be, 72 per cent of people, or around that number, saying they do not want a carbon tax and 24 per cent saying they do, you can come to the parliament and say: 'We cannot do this. It is clearly not in the people's interest. They have expressed their wish for no carbon tax.'


But no, you are not going to do that. You will go full steam ahead and defy 72 per cent of the people. You are going to get the result when the next election comes around. You are thinking: 'We'll put this in and rush it through. We'll give people a bit of compensation and they're so stupid they'll forget it.' You are completely under­estimating the intelligence of the Australian people. If you think they will take this, you are so naive that you just do not understand what it is all about.


The unions are erupting. Paul Howes, before he was kneecapped, said, 'If one job goes, that's it, we're out.' I can assure Paul Howes that many more jobs than one will go. Now we have Tony Maher of the CFMEU starting to say we will need more compensation, more assistance for the mining industry. That is shorthand for saying, 'Get out of this.' Senator Cameron is the most inconsistent. He says, 'We've got to have a carbon tax, we want a carbon tax and, by the way, let's bring some tariffs in to protect jobs.' On one hand, a carbon tax will kill jobs, but Senator Cameron says, 'Let's have some tariffs so we'll balance it up a bit.'


If you cannot believe me, why don't you believe Paul Howes? Why don't you believe Tony Maher. Why don't you believe the unions? Because they are telling you in no uncertain terms. They are on the floor, hearing it from the workers, the people who work at BlueScope and OneSteel, the 20,000 people who are employed by the steel industry. They only have to add another $8 a tonne on 7.5 million tonnes of steel and that will put the bottom line up $60 million, a loss for those two companies. They have already lost $55 million in the last six months and now you want to inflict on them another cost of $60 million. How do you expect these people to pay decent wages when they are making a loss? How do you expect them to retain their workers when they are making a loss? Every day the CEOs of BlueScope and OneSteel are wondering how to keep the industry going. They think, 'We're already losing money, and the government is just hitting us again and again and again.' I am a bit different from a lot of people here—I made my living as a salesman. I was a manufacturer's agent and I sold things, and I was pretty successful at it. I want to tell the Labor Party one thing: never try and sell a shoddy product. A product has got to give value, it has got to give a price advantage and it has got to give someone who buys it an advantage. This carbon tax falls down on all three fronts. It is going to put the worker at a disadvantage. It is going to put business at a disadvantage. It is going to put the battler at a disadvantage. And they know it. If you try and sell a product that is shonky and then try to back it up with $12 million worth of advertising—we had a word for that in the trade. Something that was very bad to sell we called a 'dog'—and this thing is barking. A carbon tax is just barking, that's how bad it is!


If you want to go and sell this carbon tax, let's go and tell the farmers and tell the battlers and tell industry they are better off. But when you have convinced them of that—and you will not—let's go to the people in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines and tell them: 'We want to inflict a higher cost on your food, on your electricity, on your transport, on your accommodation. We want you to suffer. We want you never to be able to get out of Third-World-country status—we just want you to stay there and suffer.' Do you think they're going to do that?


A carbon tax will only work if you get the rest of the world to come on side. In China in 2020 the carbon tax will have risen by 496 per cent; in India, by 350 per cent. What is the point of inflicting this on us when you know that there is no other country in the world, other than in the EU, that has brought in a carbon tax? And even a carbon tax in the EU collects $5 billion compared with ours collecting $11 billion in one year. (Time expired)

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:09):  Let us make no mistake here today: there are many points of difference, as we have had clearly illustrated this afternoon, on the issue of climate change between those opposite and the Gillard government, but none more so than on promises made to the Australian people about the facts on climate change, about the facts on what a price on carbon is, about the impacts of a carbon price on Australian industry and Australian jobs and about the facts of the impacts of a carbon price on Australian families. The majority of Australian people are worried about climate change; they want action on climate change, and they want that action now. Most people are smart enough to figure this out. They just want us to work through this with all the players and get on with it because, contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe, a delay damages our economy and, in turn, our environment.


It is an important environmental and economic imperative that we should not continue to delay. I pay tribute to my government, the Gillard government, and members of the crossbenches who are working hard to find agreement so we can get on with what must be done. All these people are working hard through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. It is not easy; there are diverse opinions. But one thing is clear, and that is that we must put a price on carbon. We must put a price on pollution. The Australian people also want a price on carbon; they want to make polluters pay.


So why are we here debating this motion today? It is because those opposite and their leader, Mr Abbott, do not believe that climate change is real. And because they do not believe that climate change is real they will do anything to stop the government putting in place a mechanism to make a contribution towards preventing the effects of climate change on our global and Aust­ralian environment, on our economy, on our industry, on our jobs and on our families. Here we are talking about Mr Abbott's latest wrecking-ball attempt, his latest scare tactic, his latest political stunt—all designed to stop action on climate change.


Mr Abbott now wants a plebiscite of the Australian people on carbon pricing, a plebiscite that will cost an estimated $80 million. But it is nothing more than a stunt designed to distract public debate from the real issues at hand. If he was serious about this he would have bothered to notify the parliament that he was going to introduce a private member's bill, but he did not even consult about his own proposal and he did not make the deadline to put the bill to parliament. Then he goes on radio in Melbourne and says that if a plebiscite did go ahead, if the Australian people who participated in his $80 million scare tactic voted yes for a carbon tax, he would still not support a carbon tax. So he is nothing more than a wrecker. He does not care what the Australian people really think about climate change. He just has the attitude that he will wreck anything positive that the Australian government is trying to do. He is not engaged in real policy debate on the question of climate change confronting this nation. He does not want the Gillard government to push ahead with tackling climate change by charging polluters for every tonne of pollution they produce. But the opposition can pull as many stunts as they like—that does not change two basic facts before us. No. 1: climate change is real. No. 2: it is in our economic and environmental interests to address climate change.


This week, as the Science Meets Parliament event takes place again, I am reminded of statements made by the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, FASTS, who have commended the government on consulting on the most important starting point for this debate, and that is the science. FASTS commended the government for using science to guide its climate change reform plans. They said:


It's time for Australians to embrace sensible science and reject cheap politics.


The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies' chief executive officer, Anna-Maria Arabia, said:


While politicians debate the ins and outs of the proposed carbon tax, FASTS calls on all sides of politics to put peer-reviewed science ahead of cheap political arguments … When the Bureau of Meteorology warned tropical cyclone Yasi was on the way, no one doubted it. Why should we treat warnings from some of Australia’s top climate scientists on climate change any differently?


FASTS calls on all political parties to listen to the experts, to focus on the evidence—including the same experts and evidence that advised Anna Bligh during the natural disasters that hit our shores earlier this year.


In March 2010 the Bureau of Meteorology said their observations clearly demonstrated climate change was real. Nothing has changed.’


The peer-reviewed verdict is in.  Action on climate change is too important to be derailed by naysayers and luddites. Action by governments, business, and the community must be fuelled by certainty, not doubt … 


So we as politicians, as representatives of the Australian people, should be driven by a basic desire to build consensus on this question so that we can make progress on an important problem facing our nation and our globe. We must work with the Australian community responsibly. We must take them on the journey to do what we know must be done; and that is exactly what the Gillard government is doing. But it is not only scientists who are calling on us to put a price on carbon. Leading market economists have also taken up this cudgel. Earlier this month, we saw 13 of our most prominent economists calling for such a price on carbon, because they know that a price on carbon is good for our economy. 


The former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Grattan Institute director, Saul Eslake; St George chief economist, Besa Deda; Citigroup Global Markets' Paul Brennan and Westpac chief economist, Bill Evans all have declared that putting a price on carbon is the best way to reduce carbon pollution. This eminent group have all described a price on carbon as 'a necessary and desirable structural reform of the Australian economy.' The Chief Economist of Westpac Bank, Mr Bill Evans, who was a signatory to the open letter, said:


The move to more efficient, cleaner energy through a well designed market mechanism to price carbon is a major and desirable structural and economic reform which will help Australia competitively position in a global low carbon economy.


This reinforces, yet again, that every credible participant in this debate knows that the only responsible thing for our nation to do is to price carbon. But what will happen to our economy if we do as Mr Abbott bids us? He bids us to do nothing, and he tries to scare us by saying that a price on carbon is a threat to our economy. But the real threat to our economy—to our competitive position—would be to do nothing. It does not come from a price on carbon; it comes from Mr Abbott's throwing out of his economics handbook and from his continued focus on perpetuating myths about the impact of a price on carbon. 


The manufacturing industry is a good example. The Leader of the Opposition has been out and about making all sorts of outlandish claims about the impact of a price on carbon on Australia's manufacturing sector. But he is misleading manufacturers when he makes these claims—claims like 'industry will be wiped out'. The simple fact is that there are big consequences for the Australian manufacturing sector if we do nothing. The Australian government is not pretending there will not be challenges for industries as they adjust to a carbon price. But I promise you this: this is a Labor government that will provide the best support for the best possible adjustment. We have no choice but to begin this trans­formation. It is quite conceivable that, if we have do not have an appropriate price on carbon in our economy, we could face other nations imposing border tax adjustments on our exports, tariffs that would penalise Australian exporters for not producing in an economic system with a price on carbon in place. Countries are already making moves towards making this reality, and we cannot expect to do nothing when the world is acting. If we do nothing, Australian industry will get left behind. It will become uncompetitive. We know that, in order to support jobs and compete in the next century, a century which will be increasingly characterised by a move towards the clean energy and technology of the future, we need to act now. We need to be an economic leader in the field. But we are already in danger of falling behind. Many other nations are adjusting their economies to a carbon constrained future. They are adjusting much more rapidly than Australia is, because they are not being held back by a bunch of powerful climate change deniers, who are being led here by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott. The Leader of the Opposition once supported action on climate change and on pricing carbon, but all the opposition can offer now is denial of basic scientific facts, denial of basic economic facts and rank political opportunism.


The Gillard government, on the other hand, is very mindful of the position of the manufacturing industry given the strength of the Australian dollar and rising commodity prices. The Leader of the Opposition is misleading manufacturers when he makes over-the-top claims that industry will be wiped out by a price on carbon. A price on carbon is not the foremost challenge facing Australia's manufacturing sector; we have to work together to support the manufacturing sector, and part of that is adjusting to a price on carbon and maintaining the efficiency of the sector as we move to put a price on carbon. The simple fact is that, if we do not price carbon, the manufacturing sector of the economy will get left behind. A carbon price is a major economic reform and an incentive to reduce pollution, to support jobs and to drive investment in renewable energy and low emissions technologies. If we cannot keep up in these sectors, which will be the global growth opportunity sectors in the future, there will be no hope for Australia's manufacturing sector. A price on carbon will create incentives throughout our economy to reduce carbon emissions.



The matter of public importance before the chamber is yet another political stunt; it makes no contribution to getting on with addressing the policy settings on climate change. (Time expired)

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria) (16:24):   The flagrant disregard with which the Gillard government is treating the Australian public on the proposed introduction of a carbon tax is disgraceful, and they should stand condemned.


Before the last federal election, we heard many people quote the Prime Minister's own words: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. She said this because she knew that a carbon tax was unacceptable to the men and women of Australia. Australia should not take an isolated approach to the reduction of carbon emissions. Instead, the actions of any Australian government must take into account the actions of all other Western developed nations and the emerging economic powerhouses of China and India; we should not act alone.


With Australia emitting only a very small percentage of global emissions, it is incum­bent upon us to consider the effect that a carbon tax will have on the businesses and industries of Australia against the overall impact of anything we can do to make a difference in the global economy. We do not live in a silo—as much as those on the other side of the chamber would like to think that that is the case, it is simply not the case—and any action we take must give consideration first to Australian industry and second to the flow-on effect it will have on the cost of living for all Australian families.


In the manufacturing sector, we have seen job losses since early 2008 at a record high—108,000 jobs have been lost. That has happened before the introduction of a carbon tax and its application to the so-called 1,000 biggest emitters. In my home state of Victoria, which has the largest number of manufacturers in Australia, businesses are looking at being put out of operation, as energy costs are primed to skyrocket. Victoria is heavily dependent on brown coal energy, and many more Victorians are therefore set to lose their jobs. Many Victorian businesses operate with a very small profit margin and have no so-called 'fat in the system' to sustain escalating costs. This means that they can either pass on the extra costs or, if they cannot pass them on, go out of business—it is as simple as that.


The Australian Labor Party draws its senators and members from the union movement, so I am dumbfounded that it is not seeking to protect the livelihood of the workers, who are the very people it professes to represent. This reflects the Labor Party's old class-war rhetoric in which the employer is always the bad guy—the capitalist making money off the workers. But if Labor had any understanding of business they would know that employers have the interests of employees at heart and that the futures and livelihoods of employers and employees are inextricably linked.


A carbon tax will not only put many employers out of business; it will also, sadly, put many workers out of a job. The government should reflect further and take a hard look at what is happening in other countries to see what happens when you do not have a healthy economy and when the health of your economy is not at the front and centre of your agenda. Only a fool would think that China and India will not prioritise their own economic advancement and put their consideration of global emissions lower down the list. This government does not need to take into account the situation globally in order to determine its course of action.The public polls taken on this issue over the last few months have all been consistent and they all tell us the same thing: Australians do not want a carbon tax and are rightfully concerned about the impact it would have on rising costs of living.


The modelling that was undertaken on the impact of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's ETS, based on a carbon price of $26 a tonne, showed that it would add an average $300 per year to electricity prices and upwards to $500 in New South Wales. A carbon tax would also increase grocery prices by virtue of the energy used in getting those very groceries onto the shelves. This is a government that only knows how to govern with the imposition of more taxes. It is not a wealth creator, not a job creator, but rather a spender of more taxpayer-funded money. With 14 new and increased taxes since its election, a rising deficit and increasing, escalating national debt, a carbon tax will ultimately be another measure to raise income.


The Prime Minister's assurances that all tax raised will be directed to those most affected does nothing to assuage the concern that those very people who may be compensated for increasing costs may well be out of a job. In my mind, it is always better to empower the individual with the opportunity to work and provide for themselves, and to provide and offer governance which encourages and raises productivity, thereby giving them the opportunity to improve their own standards, rather than to tax them to oblivion.


This is a government that has shown it cannot be trusted. We are now debating a carbon tax because of the short-term political expediency of the Prime Minister. In negotiating a formal alliance with the Greens, we know that Prime Minister Gillard did a backroom deal with the Greens for their support to form government. Let there be no misunderstanding here: this is a government that knows it is on the skids. We only have to walk down the corridors here to see the concerned faces of those who sit on the other side of the chamber. This is government on the skids. It knows it but it has clearly locked itself into a series of commitments. It is a government that has put itself before the interests of the Australian people. It is a government that puts power before the interests and livelihoods of the Australian people.


But I regret to say to those who may be listening to this: you have not seen anything yet. At least here in the Senate we have been able to hold the government to account in some small measure to date. We have been able to engage in dialogue which has been able to influence the policy direction of this government. However, after 1 July, the Australian Greens will provide the Aust­ralian Labor Party the support they need so that they will hold a majority in this place. It is because of the deal with the Greens that we are now discussing a carbon tax, and there is nobody in this place who does not believe otherwise. It is purely because of the backroom deals that have taken place that we now have a carbon tax on the table that we are discussing. It is only fair to ask how high the Greens will demand the government to jump for their continuing support to get whatever legislation the government wants through this place.


In conclusion, it is a sad day when the people of Australia are ignored. It is a sad day when the voice of the Commonwealth parliament is ignored. It is an even sadder day when the government benches, those on the other side of the chamber, do not stand up for the rights of their constituents and tell the Prime Minister that enough is enough.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:34):  It is great to be part of the contribution to this MPI debate. As always, there is great conga line of people lining up, hands on hips. The climate sceptics who sit opposite are coming in one by one to talk about all this worry about loss of jobs and about our losing touch with the union movement. What a load of nonsense! I will not use the words that Mr Tony Abbott uses when he refers to climate change. We all know what those are. He says climate change is 'crap'—that is the language he uses when he wants to discuss what climate change is all about, Senator Kroger.


As a Queensland senator, I come into this chamber often to speak about climate change, particularly in our state. It is one of those states that enjoy the eastern seaboard with numerous residents living along it. They will be the ones affected mostly by this inaction, if nothing is done about climate change. In fact, somewhere around 85 per cent of the nation's population live in coastal areas that will be affected by climate change if we do not proceed and do something about it. In 2009 it was calculated that, by 2100, about 247,000 residential buildings could be at risk as a result of rising sea levels and that it would cost $63 billion to replace them. And those are 2009 figures, of course.


Mr Deputy President Hutchins, I am sure you have been to Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef and have had the pleasure of seeing what the reef is all about—the marine life up there and the tourists that come from all over the world to go out onto the reef, enjoy time on our beaches and have a great holiday. That is all going to disappear. That is not a scare campaign; it has been identified scientifically that, if something is not done about climate change, all that will disappear.


Conversely, you get the opposition leader going into workplaces claiming that jobs will be lost in wrecking yards and bakeries. At any place he visits he reckons jobs will be destroyed and people will be out of work. There will be businesses shutting down. Once again, it is an absolute nonsense for him to be going around scaring the public about something that needs to be debated soundly with some passion and some understanding of what the scientists inform us.


As you are probably aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, on the weekend there was a Labor state conference in Queensland. I was so proud to hear the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, announce the construction of the Solar Dawn power plant, which will be built at Chinchilla, west of Brisbane, an area which needs jobs. I heard an earlier speaker in this debate talking about the loss of jobs. This is going to promote jobs. At an estimated cost of $1.2 billion, you can imagine what sort of employment will be generated by this solar power plant at Chinchilla. Incidentally, it will generate 250 megawatts of power. It will be the largest federal government Solar Flagship Program undertaking and we will be supporting it with $464 million of funding. As a Queenslander, I am proud to be part of these announcements, which demonstrate our commitment to renewable energy.


Let us look at the contribution that Mr Tony Abbott has made to this debate. Back in 2007 he supported John Howard's decision to take an emissions trading scheme to the election campaign. In July 2009, he supported the passing of Kevin Rudd's ETS. Then he came out and said he was opposed to the ETS. Today I was fortunate enough to be on the floor of the House of Repre­sentatives, where the Prime Minister of New Zealand spoke of New Zealand's relationship with Australia. I found Mr Tony Abbott's contribution to be quite strange. Rather than approach the relationship with some sort of diplomacy and statesmanship, he claimed that we should water down the carbon-pricing arrangements that we are about to debate in this place. Once again, he flip-flops from one position to another. By inapprop­riately discussing his position on climate change, he made an absolute fool of himself in front of the Prime Minister of our closest neighbour and closest friend, New Zealand. This is what you get from Mr Tony Abbott.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (16:56):  by leave—I present a report that is not quite a delegation report, but it is the report of the delegates who attended the United Nations General Assembly between September and December 2010 as parliamentary advisers to the Australian Permanent Mission to the UN.


Australia has been sending two members of the federal parliament to the United Nations General Assembly to serve as parliamentary advisers to our permanent mission there for 54 years—a very long time. Australia, of course, is one of the founding members of the United Nations, and was one of the most consistent contributors to its finances. So Australia is seen as a very strong supporter of the UN and its agencies, and of the United Nations General Assembly process.


The General Assembly actually runs from mid-September to mid-December and is held, of course, in New York, heralded by the ringing of the Peace Bell by the Secretary-General in the rose garden of the United Nations headquarters. In the first couple of weeks of the General Assembly there was a forum on the Millennium Development Goals, which were set 10 years ago by the United Nations.


The Millennium Development Goals were set with the ultimate aim of eradicating poverty and hunger, improving education, providing gender equality and empowering women around the world. In many countries of the world women are really severely discriminated against, not only in terms of their human rights in marriage and so on; they are also prevented from having education, holding jobs and so on. In many parts of the world there are very high infant mortality rates and the Millennium Development Goals aim to reduce those mortality rates.


Improving maternal health was another Millennium Development Goal and combating HIV AIDS, malaria and other communicable diseases is the sixth goal. Ensuring environmental sustainability was the seventh goal and developing a global partnership for development was the last millennium goal. We are not doing as well as we should be towards achieving those goals but certainly progress is being recorded, which is a very good thing. I found the period that I was at the UN a great experience and it gave a great overview of the way the United Nations and its agencies worked. I think there is a need for reform of the United Nations, especially in its decision-making process, which is a process of consensus whereby if one country does not agree to a course of action then that action does not occur. Quite useful programs and decisions can sometimes be held up for a very long time. We were given an example where one country has held up a decision for some 10 years because of this consensus approach to decision making. That certainly needs reforming.


The structure or membership of the Security Council also needs reforming. Its membership represents the power blocs of the world at the end of the Second World War and it is time we recognised that the Second World War ended more than 60 years ago. The permanent membership of the Security Council should be revised to reflect the modern power structures of the world.


The two parliamentary advisers had to choose two United Nations General Assembly committees to belong to. I chose to be on the second committee, which was economics and finance, and the third committee, which dealt with human rights issues and medical issues. It was very interesting and educational to see over two months how the Australian diplomats and other diplomats worked together to come to an agreement on the hundreds of resolutions which were put to those committees. Most of the hearings were held in camera. The diplomats showed a great deal of skill and intelligence in debating the small variations in words which were put up by different delegations and in achieving outcomes.


There were other countries that had MPs at the United Nations. We had a meeting with the Malaysian group, who were there for about three or four weeks. In fact, Australia was quite unusual in having delegates there for the entire General Assembly process. At the end of our time there a further meeting was held of the International Parliamentary Union, which was attended by about 70 MPs. They all made it plain that they saw the UN as having a major and good role in the world, for all its faults. In my view, the United Nations has been a force for good in the world through its agencies, such as the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and UNESCO. In its peace­keeping roles, the United Nations has succeeded in keeping the world a more peaceful place.


There is a quote from Dag Hammarskjold displayed around the United Nations building that the UN was not designed to take humanity to heaven but rather to prevent it from descending into hell. It is my view that the UN has succeeded in that objective. In the years since World War II, the world has not descended into the hell of a nuclear war, even though there were lots of minor skirmishes around the world. The UN managed to maintain a higher level of peace than might otherwise have been the case in the years since World War II ended.


Overall, it was a great privilege to go to the United Nations. I enjoyed the experience and learnt a great deal about the respect in which Australia is held by other countries of the world for our contribution to many areas of the activities of the United Nations. I am very grateful for having had this experience.

Senator O'BRIEN,ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator O'BRIEN
 (Tasmania) (17:04):  I concur with the remarks Senator Eggleston made on the report of the delegates who attended the United Nations General Assembly between September and December 2010 as parliamentary advisers to the Australian permanent mission to the United Nations and thank him and his staff for the work they have done in pulling the report together. Firstly, I thank some of the staff of our mission: Ambassador Gary Quinlan and Deputy Permanent Representative Andrew Goledzinowski; councillors now having left their posts, David Windsor and Andrew Rose; particularly First Secretary Sarah de Zoeten and Shannon White, who were very helpful to me in my role on this occasion at the assembly; AusAID representative, Fleur Davies, who was tireless in her work but quite prepared to involve both Senator Eggleston and me in the role of AusAID working through the United Nations in New York; and advisers Peter Stone and Sally Weston, who were involved in a number of issues, particularly the balloting process and Australia's negotiations in those processes for the election of representatives for various committees and, indeed, from time to time each year the selection of our choices in the ballot for membership of the Security Council that I know they were involved in.


I also give thanks to Minoli Perera, who left the mission at the end of last year and I believe is now posted in Papua New Guinea, and Rebecca Smith, who provided important assistance to us both; Kelvin Birrell, who has been at the post for many years and visited my family and me in Launceston recently on his visit to Tasmania, where he intends to relocate with his partner; and, last but not least, Joy Duncan, the personal assistant to Andrew Goledzinowski, who day by day and week by week provided us with information and assistance about the variety of things that were occurring which we perhaps did not know about and may have taken an interest in. I would also like to thank Ambassador Beazley, from our embassy in Washington, which we visited for three days during our time in the United States. I would particularly like to thank Congressional Liaison Officer Elizabeth Willis and Counsellor Jan Hutton from our mission, both of whom assisted us in accessing various appointments and gave us briefings about what was going on and some of the difficulties in the bureaucracy in Washington. They assisted us in dealing with the congress, particularly the Senate, and with some of the intricacies that our embassy encountered there.


There was an illuminating by-line in the whole process. People might think the competition between members of the Senate and members of the House of Representative here is fierce. In the United States, that contest has been won by the senators. Even the size and luxurious nature of their offices demonstrates their power over the members of the house in the United States.—in size and grandeur they were not comparable. That was a lesson in itself. It is not that I am espousing that for Australia, I am just indicating that perhaps Australian senators should not be envied compared to our United States counterparts.


I also thank Fiona Way and Lyn Witheridge from the International and Community Relations Office, who were of great assistance in organising the trip from Australia for my wife and me. I am sure Alan had similar positive experiences with the office in making the arrangements. HRG, Rebekah Campbell in particular, was also of great assistance in making arrangements for my wife and me. I wish to place on record my thanks to Rebekah.


This was my second opportunity to be part of the Australian mission to the United Nations for an extended period. I attended in 2008 with Jo Gash, the member for Gilmore, and on this occasion with Senator Eggleston, from Western Australia. On both occasions my colleagues and I got along very well. While our interests were different, I think we meshed pretty well and performed as a team representing the Australian parliament.


I understand that only three members of the Australian parliament have been to the United Nations twice. Labor's Robert Ray and, I believe, former Senator Michael Baume are the other members of parliament who have been on two occasions. I suppose I am able to say I have joined that illustrious group, having had that opportunity on two occasions.


I will not go over the circumstances which led to my visit, but Ambassador Beazley suggested at a lunch that both Senator Eggleston and I attended that to have come twice must have meant that I had drawn blood on a number of occasions in the Labor caucus. He could not have been further from the truth. I was actually not expecting to come but, because of the circumstances surrounding the last election, I received a fateful phone call asking me if I was available. Funnily enough, I said yes!


The second occasion was an opportunity, having experienced the workings of the United Nations and the committee system, to point myself at a committee that I was very interested in but did not have the opportunity to fully experience on the previous occasion. That was the Fifth Committee, Adminis­trative and Budgetary, of the United Nations, which functions somewhat like a house of review on the finances of the United Nations. I am extremely thankful to Shannon White from the mission, who involved me at every stage in the process of meeting with our Canadian and New Zealand allies, with whom we have a formalised alliance at the United Nations, the CANZ Group. In those meetings, I had the pleasure of working with Veronique Pepin-Halle, Philippe Lafortune and Karen Hung, from Canada, and Paul Ballantyne, from New Zealand. They were all very welcoming and they shared their knowledge and expertise, making my role that much more pleasurable. I am extremely grateful. I was also involved with representatives from South Korea, United States, Japan and the European Union countries. They were also welcoming and very interested in the fact that Australia sent members of its parliament to participate at an integral level in the operations of our nation and the committees of the United Nations.


I need to remark on some of the young people we met at our mission. Every year, our mission and our consulate in New York engage people they describe as 'interns'. They are unpaid; they do it for the experience to work with our missions. On the last occasion, the interns were Alan Wu, Tamer Morris, Jenna Donsky, Anna Charles and Jonathan Stambolis—all excellent young Australians, very well-qualified, who performed at an extraordinarily high level. Again, they did this without pay. They were there at their own expense, and paid their own rent and travel costs. They did that, no doubt, for a CV notation but also to provide an important service to our mission in New York. I congratulate them for the work that they performed. Just as I experienced very well-credentialed Australians on my first visit, this group of five were right up to the mark. We also saw youth representative Samah Hadid, who represented Australian youth at the mission. She was there for a shorter period than the interns but acquitted herself admirably.


The United Nations, as Alan said, is far from a perfect organisation. I have been privileged in having the opportunity to experience Australia's role in the workings of the organisation and some of its successes. It is an experience that I can recommend to anyone in this place. The experience has cemented in my mind the importance of our being part of the United Nations, the importance of the UN's existence and the importance of Australia seeking a role on the Security Council.


Question agreed to.

There is a quote from Dag Hammarskjold displayed around the United Nations building that the UN was not designed to take humanity to heaven but rather to prevent it from descending into hell. It is my view that the UN has succeeded in that objective. In the years since World War II, the world has not descended into the hell of a nuclear war, even though there were lots of minor skirmishes around the world. The UN managed to maintain a higher level of peace than might otherwise have been the case in the years since World War II ended.


Overall, it was a great privilege to go to the United Nations. I enjoyed the experience and learnt a great deal about the respect in which Australia is held by other countries of the world for our contribution to many areas of the activities of the United Nations. I am very grateful for having had this experience.

Senator O'BRIEN,ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator O'BRIEN
 (Tasmania) (17:04):  I concur with the remarks Senator Eggleston made on the report of the delegates who attended the United Nations General Assembly between September and December 2010 as parliamentary advisers to the Australian permanent mission to the United Nations and thank him and his staff for the work they have done in pulling the report together. Firstly, I thank some of the staff of our mission: Ambassador Gary Quinlan and Deputy Permanent Representative Andrew Goledzinowski; councillors now having left their posts, David Windsor and Andrew Rose; particularly First Secretary Sarah de Zoeten and Shannon White, who were very helpful to me in my role on this occasion at the assembly; AusAID representative, Fleur Davies, who was tireless in her work but quite prepared to involve both Senator Eggleston and me in the role of AusAID working through the United Nations in New York; and advisers Peter Stone and Sally Weston, who were involved in a number of issues, particularly the balloting process and Australia's negotiations in those processes for the election of representatives for various committees and, indeed, from time to time each year the selection of our choices in the ballot for membership of the Security Council that I know they were involved in.


I also give thanks to Minoli Perera, who left the mission at the end of last year and I believe is now posted in Papua New Guinea, and Rebecca Smith, who provided important assistance to us both; Kelvin Birrell, who has been at the post for many years and visited my family and me in Launceston recently on his visit to Tasmania, where he intends to relocate with his partner; and, last but not least, Joy Duncan, the personal assistant to Andrew Goledzinowski, who day by day and week by week provided us with information and assistance about the variety of things that were occurring which we perhaps did not know about and may have taken an interest in. I would also like to thank Ambassador Beazley, from our embassy in Washington, which we visited for three days during our time in the United States. I would particularly like to thank Congressional Liaison Officer Elizabeth Willis and Counsellor Jan Hutton from our mission, both of whom assisted us in accessing various appointments and gave us briefings about what was going on and some of the difficulties in the bureaucracy in Washington. They assisted us in dealing with the congress, particularly the Senate, and with some of the intricacies that our embassy encountered there.


There was an illuminating by-line in the whole process. People might think the competition between members of the Senate and members of the House of Representative here is fierce. In the United States, that contest has been won by the senators. Even the size and luxurious nature of their offices demonstrates their power over the members of the house in the United States.—in size and grandeur they were not comparable. That was a lesson in itself. It is not that I am espousing that for Australia, I am just indicating that perhaps Australian senators should not be envied compared to our United States counterparts.


I also thank Fiona Way and Lyn Witheridge from the International and Community Relations Office, who were of great assistance in organising the trip from Australia for my wife and me. I am sure Alan had similar positive experiences with the office in making the arrangements. HRG, Rebekah Campbell in particular, was also of great assistance in making arrangements for my wife and me. I wish to place on record my thanks to Rebekah.


This was my second opportunity to be part of the Australian mission to the United Nations for an extended period. I attended in 2008 with Jo Gash, the member for Gilmore, and on this occasion with Senator Eggleston, from Western Australia. On both occasions my colleagues and I got along very well. While our interests were different, I think we meshed pretty well and performed as a team representing the Australian parliament.


I understand that only three members of the Australian parliament have been to the United Nations twice. Labor's Robert Ray and, I believe, former Senator Michael Baume are the other members of parliament who have been on two occasions. I suppose I am able to say I have joined that illustrious group, having had that opportunity on two occasions.


I will not go over the circumstances which led to my visit, but Ambassador Beazley suggested at a lunch that both Senator Eggleston and I attended that to have come twice must have meant that I had drawn blood on a number of occasions in the Labor caucus. He could not have been further from the truth. I was actually not expecting to come but, because of the circumstances surrounding the last election, I received a fateful phone call asking me if I was available. Funnily enough, I said yes!


The second occasion was an opportunity, having experienced the workings of the United Nations and the committee system, to point myself at a committee that I was very interested in but did not have the opportunity to fully experience on the previous occasion. That was the Fifth Committee, Adminis­trative and Budgetary, of the United Nations, which functions somewhat like a house of review on the finances of the United Nations. I am extremely thankful to Shannon White from the mission, who involved me at every stage in the process of meeting with our Canadian and New Zealand allies, with whom we have a formalised alliance at the United Nations, the CANZ Group. In those meetings, I had the pleasure of working with Veronique Pepin-Halle, Philippe Lafortune and Karen Hung, from Canada, and Paul Ballantyne, from New Zealand. They were all very welcoming and they shared their knowledge and expertise, making my role that much more pleasurable. I am extremely grateful. I was also involved with representatives from South Korea, United States, Japan and the European Union countries. They were also welcoming and very interested in the fact that Australia sent members of its parliament to participate at an integral level in the operations of our nation and the committees of the United Nations.


I need to remark on some of the young people we met at our mission. Every year, our mission and our consulate in New York engage people they describe as 'interns'. They are unpaid; they do it for the experience to work with our missions. On the last occasion, the interns were Alan Wu, Tamer Morris, Jenna Donsky, Anna Charles and Jonathan Stambolis—all excellent young Australians, very well-qualified, who performed at an extraordinarily high level. Again, they did this without pay. They were there at their own expense, and paid their own rent and travel costs. They did that, no doubt, for a CV notation but also to provide an important service to our mission in New York. I congratulate them for the work that they performed. Just as I experienced very well-credentialed Australians on my first visit, this group of five were right up to the mark. We also saw youth representative Samah Hadid, who represented Australian youth at the mission. She was there for a shorter period than the interns but acquitted herself admirably.


The United Nations, as Alan said, is far from a perfect organisation. I have been privileged in having the opportunity to experience Australia's role in the workings of the organisation and some of its successes. It is an experience that I can recommend to anyone in this place. The experience has cemented in my mind the importance of our being part of the United Nations, the importance of the UN's existence and the importance of Australia seeking a role on the Security Council.

The second reading speeches read as follows—





Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011



The government is committed to action on climate change and the need to reduce our carbon pollution. 


This is because the government accepts the science and understands both the damage that unmitigated climate change would cause to Australia and the opportunities for our economy if we do take action.


On 24 February this year we announced the framework for a carbon price to take effect from 1 July 2012. That framework would not place any liability on agricultural, forestry or legacy waste emissions.


However, the government has also committed to create opportunities in these sectors for the creation of revenue through the reduction or storage of carbon pollution.


The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 fulfils an election com­mitment to give farmers, forest growers and landholders access to carbon markets. 


This will begin to unlock the abatement opportunities in the land sector which currently make up 23 percent of Australia’s emissions.


Australia has amongst the highest agricultural emissions of the developed countries. But we also have significant opportunities to increase carbon storage in our landscape. 


We are a big country. 


This scheme presents an opportunity for Australia to address these high emissions and for the agriculture sector to be part of the solution to climate change. 


We are already making progress in this area. 


Through Australia’s Farming Future, the government has invested $42.6 million into research and development into abatement options for the land sector. 


The CSIRO and other research institutions are making important advances in carbon estimation techniques.  


And around the country, innovative farmers have been developing ways to improve the health of agricultural soils, improve herd efficiency and to farm more sustainably. 


This scheme will drive and reward the deployment of this Australian innovation.  


The Carbon Farming Initiative will create incentives to protect our natural environment and adopt more sustainable farming practices as well as mitigate climate change. 


Increasing carbon storage in agricultural soils improves soil health and productivity. 


Revegetation will help restore degraded landscape and protect biodiversity. 


Tree planting can help to address salinity and reduce erosion.


This is important because the agricultural sector is likely to be one of the most strongly affected by climate change. 


The importance of these co-benefits is reflected in the objects of this bill.



We want to achieve carbon abatement in a manner that is consistent with protection of Australia’s natural environment and improves resilience to the impacts of climate change.


The Carbon Farming Initiative will create new, real and lasting economic opportunities for regional communities. Farmers and landholders will be rewarded for their actions to reduce or store carbon pollution. This is a very important step forward for regional and rural Australia.


This is not a government grant program. 


The legislated scheme will allow sellers to deal directly with buyers and leverage the opportunities of the market place. Such a market place allows companies to invest in local land sector abatement through long term contracts and partnerships with farmers and landholders. 


Markets are not new to farmers, nor are many of the things which can save or store carbon – trees and soil. What farmers need is a mechanism to add value to their actions and decide whether or not to invest.


Real and lasting economic opportunities are also what Indigenous Australians are telling us they want. The Carbon Farming Initiative includes a number of provisions to ensure Indigenous Australians can effectively participate and take up these opportunities.


This package of bills creates a legal framework which will provide certainty for private investment in carbon abatement.


The Carbon Farming Initiative provides a framework which is grounded in the science of climate change and provides clear economic value to actions which store or reduce our carbon pollution.




Overview 



The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 is one of a package of three related bills, including the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011 and the Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011.


The Carbon Farming Initiative is a voluntary scheme. There is no requirement to participate. But those that do will be eligible to receive carbon credits for every tonne of carbon pollution saved or stored. 


These carbon credits can be exported or sold to companies that want to offset their emissions or to sell carbon neutral products.  


The legislation seeks to balance environmental integrity with administrative simplicity. This is to enable broad participation in the scheme.


We have made a number of changes to the proposal released for consultation to reduce administrative costs.


The additionality test has been streamlined by removing the need to prove financial additionality. Instead, the government will iden­tify and list activities that are not already in wide­spread use – that go beyond common practice. The government will consult with stakeholders, and may undertake surveys, to identify activities that are beyond common practice. We will adopt a common sense approach that takes account of local conditions and industry circumstances.   


Offsets reports will not be required once reforestation and vegetation has stopped growing and is no longer receiving credits.


Project proponents can choose a reporting period between 12 months and 5 years.  


Audit requirements may be reduced for less complex projects. 


This scheme will complement other govern­ment commitments to protect Australia’s unique natural environment and enable the development of competitive and sustainable farm industries. 


This bill includes provision to exclude projects that have perverse impacts on water availability, biodiversity conservation; employment; or local communities from the scheme. 


Eligible projects will need to comply with all state, Commonwealth and local government water, planning and environment requirements. 


Project proponents will also be required to take account of regional natural resource management plans. These provide a mechanism for local communities to have their say about the type and location of abatement projects.  


The government will monitor the implications of the scheme for regional communities and on the environment.


If there is evidence that projects are likely to have a material and adverse impacts, we will consider what further protections are necessary. 


On the positive side of the ledger, the government will make it easy to market the co-benefits of abatement projects. 


We know that buyers in the voluntary market want projects that have positive environmental and social benefits.  




Integrity of abatement



Carbon credits are used to offset emissions. The price that buyers will be willing to pay for credits will depend on their perceived environmental credibility.


An independent expert committee, the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, has been established to ensure that estimation methodologies are rigorous and lead to real and verifiable abatement. 


Other elements of the design of the scheme to ensure the integrity of credits include: issuing credits after the sequestration or emissions reductions have actually occurred; tracking of credits through a central national registry – this is included in the Registry Bill; transparency provisions including the publication of a wide range of information about approved projects; appropriate enforcement provisions to address non-compliance; and a robust audit scheme based on the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme.


Carbon storage has to be permanent if it is going to be treated as equivalent to carbon emissions from industrial sectors. 


The provisions to deal with permanence are rigorous yet flexible and well suited to Australian conditions. 


Participants would be able to cancel their project and hand back credits issued at any time, for example because they wish to sell the land or use it for something else.


Land managers would not have to hand back credits if carbon stores are lost because of bushfire or drought. Instead, land managers holders will be required to take steps to re-establish lost carbon stores.


Temporary losses of carbon following a bushfire or drought would be covered by a risk of reversal buffer where a proportion of the credits are withheld. 




Conclusion



We must not let the debate over the carbon price stop us from making a start on land sector abatement through the Carbon Farming Initiative.


We need a long-term framework for rewarding land sector abatement.


This will provide the investment certainty the sector needs to be part of the solution to climate change.


 




Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011



The Carbon Credits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011contains consequential amendments and transitional provisions relating to the Carbon Farming Initiative and the establishment of the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units. It also makes various amendments to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.


The bill seeks to amend five Acts. Most of the proposed amendments will apply existing legislation relating to financial services, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing to units held in the Registry. The amendments are intended to provide additional safeguards to protect purchasers of Australian carbon credit units and international units, and to provide deterrence against criminal activities involving the Carbon Farming Initiative.


The proposed amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 will provide a strong regulatory regime to reduce the risk of market manipulation and misconduct relating to Australian carbon credits and eligible international emissions units. Appropriate adjustments to the regime to fit the characteristics of the different types of units and to avoid unnecessary compliance costs will be made through regulations.


As required by the Corporations Agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, the Ministerial Council for Cor­porations has been consulted about the amendments to the corporations legislation.


The Bill also proposes amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to ensure that financial institutions and other persons who buy and sell ACCUs and eligible international emissions units are regulated under that Act. These bodies will be subject to reporting and other requirements, including requirements to verify their customer’s identity prior to trading in Australian carbon credit units or international emissions units.


To ensure that the Carbon Credits Administrator has sufficient information to tackle undesirable behaviours by scheme participants, administrators with relevant information, such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer, will need to be able to share this information with the Administrator. The bill therefore proposes amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, the Australian Securities and Investments Com­mission Act 2001 and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007. This will allow, for example, ASIC to disclose information that it possesses about wrongdoing in connection with trading of Australian carbon credit units which is also of significance to the Administrator as the operator of the Registry.


Part 27of the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill allows reciprocal flow of relevant information from the Carbon Credits Administrator to these bodies where it is required.


The Bill also proposes amendments to the NGER Act to allow the audit framework for the Carbon Farming Initiative to utilise the existing audit framework under the NGER Act. It also proposes to extend the arrangements for reporting transfer certificates beyond 30 June 2011, and other amendments to the Act.


Using the existing audit framework under the NGER Act will promote administrative efficiency and reduce duplication; for example, there will be a single register for qualified assurance auditors. It reduces complexity for auditors (many of whom will operate under both Acts) as they are already familiar with audit requirements set out under the NGER Act and can apply the same legislative requirements in areas of overlap between NGER and CFI legislation.


Reporting Transfer Certificates allow the voluntary transfer of reporting obligations relating to a facility from a registered controlling corporation to another corporation. This could occur where the other corporation has financial control of the facility and formally applies for the transfer of responsibilities. These provisions are voluntary and impose no additional burden on industry stakeholders. They are intended to reduce administration and economic costs for industry and increase flexibility in establishing reporting arrangements.


The Reporting Transfer Certificate arrangements were a temporary measure and it was intended they would be replaced by the liability transfer certificate provisions of the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation. As this legislation failed to pass the Senate, it is necessary to extend these arrangements.


The bill also provides for transitional measures arising from the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill and the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill. It is proposed that accounts held in the non-statutory Registry prior to commencement of the bill will continue in existence under the legislated Registry. Pre-existing audit determinations will also continue to have effect.


The consequential amendments contained in this bill are important for the efficient and effective operation of the Carbon Farming Initiative and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System. The amendments seek, where possible, to streamline institutional and regulatory arrangements and minimise administrative costs in both schemes, and to provide additional safeguards for the Carbon Farming Initiative.




Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Bill 2011



This bill provides for the establishment and maintenance of a robust Australian National Registry of Emissions Units to underpin implementation of the Carbon Farming Initiative. 


An efficient electronic registry, governed by clear rules and supported by appropriate enforcement mechanisms, will allow farmers, landholders and other participants with offsets projects under the Initiative to receive, hold and transfer their carbon credits securely, with minimum costs and delay. 


This important piece of infrastructure will be based on an existing registry that the Australian government established in 2008 to meet key obligations that Australia has under the Kyoto Protocol. The bill will put the Kyoto registry, which has operated on an administrative basis to date, on a legislative footing.


Combining the registry functions of the Carbon Farming Initiative and the Kyoto Protocol means that anyone who owns tradeable units issued under both systems will be able to hold those units in a single account. This will significantly reduce account establishment and operating costs, and streamline all transactions for account holders.


All accounts that exist in the current registry will be transferred to the statutory registry at the commencement of the Carbon Farming Initiative, without disruption to current account holders.


The bill provides for the recognition in Australian legislation of the emissions units created under the Kyoto Protocol. It sets out how these units can be issued and transferred and is consistent with Kyoto Protocol rules. The Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Bill 2011 deals with the process for exchanging Australian carbon credit units issued under the Carbon Farming Initiative with certain Kyoto units, which can then be sold in international carbon markets. 


Other types of international units may also be recognised through regulations. This would allow other international carbon trading systems to be recognised and possibly linked to the Carbon Farming Initiative.


The bill will clarify that Kyoto and non-Kyoto units held in the registry are to be treated as personal property for the limited purposes of laws relating to bankruptcy, external administration, wills, intestacy and deceased estates, and any other prescribed purpose. This reduces any legal uncertainty surrounding the units in these circumstances.


A range of information in the registry will be made publicly available, including the name of account holders and the regulations may require publication of the total number of specified Kyoto units held in accounts. This information is required to meet requirements under the Kyoto Protocol and is currently available on the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency website. Publication of information will also provide a high level of transparency to ensure public confidence in the Carbon Farming Initiative.


Users of the registry will expect the administrator of the registry to protect their accounts from misuse and to safeguard their carbon credits from theft. 


High standards of security and a range of anti-fraud measures are already being applied to the existing registry. For example, the registry complies with IT security standards set by the Defence Signals Directorate and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Anyone seeking to open a registry account must also undergo an identity check.


The bill will introduce additional safeguards to minimise the risk of fraud and misuse of the registry. These safeguards include: criminal penalties for fraudulent or dishonest conduct; powers to suspend registry operations temporarily to address threats to the system; the Administrator will have discretion not to transfer units where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is fraudulent; powers to correct unauthorised entries in the registry; and powers to close the accounts of any persons who breach their registry obligations.


This bill provides for an efficient and safe system to hold and track carbon credits and other units used to implement the Carbon Farming Initiative and to meet Australia’s international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (17:18):  I firstly want to acknowledge my colleague Senator McLucas, who was handling this before the lunch adjournment. I will conclude the government's contribution to the second reading debate. Senator McLucas had referred to schedule 3, which will benefit affected taxpayers by insuring they will not be left worse-off by effectively losing some of their main residence exemption if part of their adjacent land is compulsorily acquired without the dwelling also being acquired.


Schedule 4 amends the tax laws to allow superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers to claim a income tax deduction for the cost of insuring the liability to provide terminal medical condition benefits to superannuation fund members and RSA holders. The amendment rectifies an anomaly in the tax law. The superannuation law was amended in February 2008 to include the terminal medical condition of release. This allows superannuation funds and RSA providers to provide benefits to members if the member is expected to pass away due to a terminal medical condition within 12 months. Superannuation funds and RSA providers are able to deduct the cost of providing benefits relating to the permanent incapacity condition of release and for the payment of death benefits. However, no associated deduction has been allowed for the cost of providing terminal medical condition benefits. Accordingly, this amendment will provide consistent tax treatment for similar insurance arrangements. Schedule 4 also makes some minor amendment to reflect the drafting convention that a human being should be referred to by the term 'individual' rather than the term 'person'. 


The amendments contained in schedule 5 confirm the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of the GST law in allowing non-profit subentities to access the GST concessions available to their parent entity. As part of the amendments, non-profit subentities will be allowed to access the higher registration turnover threshold of $150,000 for non-profit bodies. The amendments take effect from the start of the first tax period after royal assent.


Schedule 6 amends the taxation administration legislation to provide that it will not be mandatory for the Commissioner of Taxation to apply a payment, credit or running balance account surplus against a tax debt that is a BAS amount unless the amount is due and payable. The schedule gives effect to recommendation 39 of the Board of Taxation's review of the legal framework for the administration of the goods and services tax, reducing compliance costs and unnecessary complexity for taxpayers. 


Schedule 7 provides additional assistance for education expenses for eligible parents and carers of school age children. These amendments will expand the education tax refund to allow parents and carers to receive a refundable tax offset of up to 50 per cent for school uniform expenses from 1 July 2011. Extending the education tax refund to school uniforms builds on the education tax refund the government first introduced in July 2008, allowing parents and carers to claim a refund for laptops, home computers, printers, computer software, stationary and trade tools. The government is conscious that exactly what comprises a school uniform will vary from school to school, and has provided flexibility in the legislation to deal with various arrangements. As the education tax refund is a refundable tax offset, even if you do not pay tax you will be able to benefit from the government's decision to extend the education tax refund to cover school uniforms. The bill deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:23):  I seek leave to move the two coalition amendments which have been circulated in the chamber together.


Leave granted. 




Senator CORMANN:
  I now move the two coalition amendments to this bill which relate specifically to the issue of capital protected borrowings and more specifically the benchmark interest rate:


(1)   Schedule 2, item 7, page 7 (lines 12 to 15), omit subsection 247-20(5), substitute:


   (5)   The rate (the adjusted loan rate), at a particular time, is the midpoint at that time between the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Indicator Lending Rate for Standard Variable Housing Loans and Indicator Lending Rate for Personal Unsecured Loans — Variable Rate.


[adjusted loan rate]


(2)   Schedule 2, item 12, page 10 (lines 15 to 18), omit subsection 247-80(4), substitute:


   (4)   The rate (the adjusted loan rate), at a particular time, is the midpoint at that time between the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Indicator Lending Rate for Standard Variable Housing Loans and Indicator Lending Rate for Personal Unsecured Loans — Variable Rate.


[adjusted loan rate]


I have a few comments in response to Senator Hurley's contribution to the debate earlier. I acknowledge that Senator Hurley recognised that capital protected borrowings are indeed a useful tool for conservative investment, which, of course, they are. Where I disagree with Senator Hurley is with her following contribution when she asserted that the industry was happy with the ultimate compromise the government ended up with—they are not—and her assertion that we are being a populist opposition not focused on what we would do if we were in government. Let me just assure the chamber and people across Australia that what the coalition are proposing with our amendments here in relation to the capital protected borrowings issue, which is a very technical issue, is indeed what we would be doing in government.


In order to put all this into a bit more context it is useful to go through some of the history around this issue, which was elaborated on in the report by the Senate Economics Committee. Capital protected borrowings were first developed and marketed in Australia in the early 1990s. I am reading here from the coalition senators' dissenting report in relation to this issue in the inquiry report by the Economics Committee—




1.6 Originally, all the interest on these products was tax deductible.





1.7 In the late 1990s
—



the then Howard government—




... limited the fraction of interest that could be claimed as a tax deduction. Part of the interest was allocated as an investment expense (deductible) and the other a capital expense (not deductible).





1.8 This practice was challenged successfully in the courts. In 2002 the full bench of the Federal Court ruled that the component of 'interest' applicable to the cost of capital protection is deductible. The High Court later refused any appeal from the Tax Commissioner.





1.9 This required a legislative solution. In early 2003 the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer ... introduced an 'interim methodology'
 for


apportioning deductibility for capital protected borrowings, and opened a consultation


process to determine a longer term methodology.





1.10 The new methodology was introduced from 1 July 2007. Any interest paid in


excess of the Reserve Bank's Indicator Rate for personal unsecured loans would not be


deductible (would be considered to be payment for capital protection). Government


and industry were content although Treasury had argued for a lower rate.



But in comes the Rudd Labor government and decides to further lower the level of deductible interest rates to the point where the market in relation to capital protected borrowing completely collapsed. The Rudd Labor government was quite shocked at the immediate impact its ill-thought-out proposal had back in May 2008, which is why they did not progress this proposal at the time. The compromise proposal the government came up with eventually was just to use this arbitrary figure of adding 100 basis points to the rate originally announced in May 2008. There is absolutely no basis for that.


Evidence submitted to the Senate inquiry indicated that the 100 basis points arbitrary decision would not restore the market that was completely destroyed by the actions of the Rudd Labor government. I am quoting here from the AFMA submission.




The proposed 100 basis point increase above the rate originally announced in May 2008 acknowledges the concerns raised by the industry in this regard but it does not satisfactorily address the problems identified. 



It should be remembered that industry agreed with the government that the original rate set for these products was too high and that there was scope to come to a more appropriate arrangement. However, the government's approach has been completely inconsistent. In this context I point to evidence from the Tax Institute, which pointed out a very important issue in their submission to the inquiry:




... the purpose of the provision is to deny a deduction for the amount that is comparable to the cost of acquiring separate and explicit protection. The rate chosen should be the rate most appropriate to determine that cost.





…
   …
   …





However, the approach set out in the EM appears to be the reverse. That is, the EM appears to set out an approach intended to limit a borrower's deductions to an amount reflecting the issuer's cost of funds and assumed credit risk.



The purpose is to provide an adequate level of capital protection so as not to distort the market. So clearly the government has got it wrong up until now. They got it wrong in May 2008 and they still have it wrong by coming up with their arbitrary addition of 100 basis points. That, of course, will not address this issue satisfactorily. I suspect that the government and the minister may have to come back in six months and fix this up yet again if the coalition amendment is not successful. The coalition is seeking to assist the government and to prevent embarras­s­ment for the government in six to 12 months time when, no doubt, they will have to come up with an amendment similar or equivalent to that which the coalition is putting forward today. So I urge senators to consider this issue very carefully, look at the impact that the government's ham-fisted approach to this issue has had on the capital protected borrowings market over the last three years and join the coalition in a more sensible, appropriate and balanced approach to this issue, which, of course, is completely supported by the industry.


As Senator Hurley said, capital protected borrowings are a useful tool for conservative investment, and I do not know why the chair of the economics committee in her con­tribution started to say that making it more generous than what the government has put on the table so far would somehow encourage tax evasion. No, it will not encourage tax evasion. These are deductions of costs incurred by investors and unless Senator Hurley is suggesting that claiming appropriate deductions for costs incurred is tax evasion I do not really understand where she was coming from there.


With those few remarks, I move the two amendments that have been circulated by the coalition, and I commend them to the Senate as a more appropriate methodology for calculating the benchmark interest rate in the context of capital protected borrowings.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (17:31):  The government will not be supporting the two amendments. I have just a couple of points to make. I do not want to take the time of the Senate overly; this matter has been well canvassed and well covered by the Senate economics committee.


One point that Senator Cormann made that I do disagree with is this: he claimed that the market, because of the government's decision, had been disrupted. But coincid­ence is not causation. The market was disrupted, but it was not as a result of the government; it was as a result of the general market disruption we were seeing through the global financial crisis. That is the first point I would make.


The second point is that the government did appoint an independent expert. Professor Ken Davis was hired to evaluate the appropriate level of the benchmark rate. He found the appropriate rate was of a similar order of magnitude to the housing loan rate. He found that the upper limit of what was appropriate was the margin lending rate. So the rate that is being proposed, the housing loan rate plus 100 basis points, is around the middle of the range that was deemed appropriate by the expert. Setting the rate in the range proposed by the expert was supported by the Senate economics committee. As I have said, there was a fair amount of attention given to this matter in its report and it has been well outlined by my colleague Senator Hurley.


The government believes this is a reasonable, fair and balanced approach to setting the benchmark. Should the opposition's amendments be successful, I think it would cost government revenue of $46 million over four years on the forward estimates. And I would point out that the matter of contention is just one of the measures contained in the bill. There are a number of other important measures in this legislation and they have been touched on in the broader second reading debate. There are measures to assist taxpayers and the film industry, tax rebates for school uniforms et cetera. So I would urge the Senate to pass the bill without these two amendments—to reject these two amendments.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:33): I will not hold the Senate up much longer. I will make just one final point in response to the minister's comments about cost in the budget, because the minister clearly was not in the chamber when we went through the second reading debate. All the evidence so far is that Treasury has completely overestimated the revenue that would be generated from lowering the applicable interest rates in the context of capital protected borrowings, as they proposed in May 2008 and have not so far implemented. We believe that there is evidence to the committee that Treasury has overestimated the impact of this particular measure. Here I refer the minister specifically to an exchange between Senator Bushby and Dr Lynch where Senator Bushby asked whether any calculations had been done on the impact that that might have, and Dr Lynch said:


… we advised Treasury in 2008, that the market would fall back substantially. It has done that. Further, the level of activity in the income generator within that part of the industry has declined commensurately. Also the number of people employed in that part of the industry has been reduced. For a variety of reasons we think revenue certainly will not meet the expectations that are in the forecast. 


I emphasise: 'revenue certainly will not meet the expectations that are in the forecast.' He continued:


We cannot be precise with those numbers because I do not have the full basis behind the Treasury estimates.


…   …   …


Looking at the longer term, if the market continues in the direction it is going at the present, there will not be very much revenue collected at all through this process.


So I would caution the Senate when the minister is putting forward the sorts of estimates that he has just quoted, because invariably those sorts of estimates are found to be wrong in hindsight. Question put:


That the amendments (Senator Cormann's) be agreed to.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (17:18):  I firstly want to acknowledge my colleague Senator McLucas, who was handling this before the lunch adjournment. I will conclude the government's contribution to the second reading debate. Senator McLucas had referred to schedule 3, which will benefit affected taxpayers by insuring they will not be left worse-off by effectively losing some of their main residence exemption if part of their adjacent land is compulsorily acquired without the dwelling also being acquired.


Schedule 4 amends the tax laws to allow superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers to claim a income tax deduction for the cost of insuring the liability to provide terminal medical condition benefits to superannuation fund members and RSA holders. The amendment rectifies an anomaly in the tax law. The superannuation law was amended in February 2008 to include the terminal medical condition of release. This allows superannuation funds and RSA providers to provide benefits to members if the member is expected to pass away due to a terminal medical condition within 12 months. Superannuation funds and RSA providers are able to deduct the cost of providing benefits relating to the permanent incapacity condition of release and for the payment of death benefits. However, no associated deduction has been allowed for the cost of providing terminal medical condition benefits. Accordingly, this amendment will provide consistent tax treatment for similar insurance arrangements. Schedule 4 also makes some minor amendment to reflect the drafting convention that a human being should be referred to by the term 'individual' rather than the term 'person'. 


The amendments contained in schedule 5 confirm the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of the GST law in allowing non-profit subentities to access the GST concessions available to their parent entity. As part of the amendments, non-profit subentities will be allowed to access the higher registration turnover threshold of $150,000 for non-profit bodies. The amendments take effect from the start of the first tax period after royal assent.


Schedule 6 amends the taxation administration legislation to provide that it will not be mandatory for the Commissioner of Taxation to apply a payment, credit or running balance account surplus against a tax debt that is a BAS amount unless the amount is due and payable. The schedule gives effect to recommendation 39 of the Board of Taxation's review of the legal framework for the administration of the goods and services tax, reducing compliance costs and unnecessary complexity for taxpayers. 


Schedule 7 provides additional assistance for education expenses for eligible parents and carers of school age children. These amendments will expand the education tax refund to allow parents and carers to receive a refundable tax offset of up to 50 per cent for school uniform expenses from 1 July 2011. Extending the education tax refund to school uniforms builds on the education tax refund the government first introduced in July 2008, allowing parents and carers to claim a refund for laptops, home computers, printers, computer software, stationary and trade tools. The government is conscious that exactly what comprises a school uniform will vary from school to school, and has provided flexibility in the legislation to deal with various arrangements. As the education tax refund is a refundable tax offset, even if you do not pay tax you will be able to benefit from the government's decision to extend the education tax refund to cover school uniforms. The bill deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (19:52):  I am pleased to have this oppor­tunity to speak on these bills: the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2011, the ComSuper Bill 2011 and the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. These bills will reform governance arrangements for Commonwealth government superannua­tion schemes in line with trends in the broader superannuation industry. They will also serve to modernise some aspects of these arrangements. The purpose of these bills is to improve the superannuation arrangements for the men and women currently serving in the Australian defence forces. 


Since I assumed my current responsibilities I have had the opportunity of meeting many of these fine Australians and I have acquired a better understanding of the uniquely difficult tasks with which we task them. We have an obligation to see that their service and their sacrifices are appropriately recognised, and one way to do that is to ensure that the superannuation arrangements we put in place for our service personnel are the very best possible. This legislation demonstrates the Gillard government's commitment to improving the super­annuation arrangements for our service men and women under the Military Super­annuation and Benefit Scheme.


These bills will increase the super­annuation returns for the majority of our serving members. In fact, they will increase the take-home superannuation of over 90 per cent of our current serving personnel as well as future members of the ADF. Let me give an example. An increase of 0.5 per cent in the net investment return for a member of the RAAF who joins as an officer cadet and retires as a group captain would lead to an increase in superannuation benefits of some $41,000 over 10 years of service or $95,000 over a full career.


Recently in the Senate we have seen a series of shameless stunts by the opposition in relation to the retirement income of our Defence personnel. Senator Ronaldson has brought in a private member's bill which seeks to change the method of indexing Defence pensions for certain categories of Defence retirees. In the course of so doing, he has been highly critical of the government for not supporting his bill. Of course, what Senator Ronaldson has not explained to the Senate—nor, I might say, to anyone else—is why the Howard government, of which he was a member, did absolutely nothing about this issue for the whole 11 years it was in office. He has not told the Senate that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the Howard government, the Hon. Mr Billson, com­missioned a report on this very matter. Nor has he told us that this report, the Podger report, recommended against the course of action which the opposition is now putting forward and that Mr Billson accepted that report. He has not explained why he went to the 2007 election supporting a policy which was the very opposite of the one he now purports to support. I am still waiting for the opposition to explain their extraordinary inconsistency on this issue. In government, they accepted Mr Podger's finding that changes to the indexation system for Defence pensions could not be justified. Now, in the safety of opposition, they have discovered that all of this is a monstrous injustice for which the Labor government is obviously to blame.


Senator Ronaldson and his colleagues have some explaining to do. I am, of course, astonished to find that they are opposed to the simple and straightforward improve­ments to our Defence superannuation arrangements that are contained in these bills tonight. Last week it seemed vitally important to them to change the system for indexing Defence pensions, because our military retirees were suffering erosion of their standards of living, but, this week, when the government brings in legislation that would bring about an increase in superannuation benefits to the average ADF member of perhaps $41,000 over 10 years or $95,000 over a full career, they are opposed to it. This is quite astonishing and I think it is a real insult to the intelligence of the men and women of the ADF and the wider Defence community. How can Senator Ronaldson and others in the opposition possibly imagine that the antics of last week and their position tonight will not be matched against one another?


What grounds are the opposition using to oppose these bills tonight? Apparently it is because these bills provide that the ACTU will nominate three members of the board of the Commonwealth Superannuation Cor­pora­tion. What a shocking idea that is! The vigilance of the opposition is truly extraordinary! The notion that the peak body representing Australian employees, an organisation with more experience of administering superannuation than anyone else in the country—indeed, it lays claim to inventing modern superannuation—should have a voice on the governing body of the main Australian government civilian and military superannuation schemes. Well, how remarkable!


So now we know what the real priorities of this opposition actually are. We know that pursuing their obsessive and irrational vendetta against the Australian trade union movement is far more important to them than the welfare and standard of living of our retired public servants and Defence personnel. What a marvellous juxtaposition this is with their outlandish rhetoric of only last week.


The Liberal Party is, after all, the party that brought us Work Choices and would, of course, bring us 'Son of Work Choices' if they ever got back into power. They are opposed to anything which brings benefits to employees. But I am sure that current serving members of the ADF will note that the opposition is trying to deny them the very real benefits of this legislation on the basis of what can be described as nothing more than an ideological vendetta.


Let us now return to the bills which we are debating. The Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2011 implements the government's decision to establish a consolidated trustee for the main Australian government civilian and military superannuation schemes. The consolidated trustee body is to be known as the Commonwealth Superannuation Cor­pora­tion. The CSC will be a Com­monwealth authority for the purposes of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The bill requires the governing board of CSC to have regard to the unique nature of military service as provided for in the schemes established by the relevant military superannuation acts when it is performing functions under those acts.


The bill will also provide for the CSC to be governed by a board, in line with the common model in the broader super­annuation industry. The board will comprise 11 directors—a chair, five member directors and five employer directors. The ACTU and the Chief of the Defence Force will nominate three and two member directors respectively. This representation is consistent with the size of funds in the scheme—$19 billion in the civilian scheme and some $4 billion in the military scheme. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, after appropriate consul­tation, will choose the five employer directors. The minister will consult with the Minister for Defence in selecting suitable candidates for these positions. By merging the existing civilian and military super­annuation trustee boards into the CSC, this bill will improve the economies of scale to generate potentially higher investment returns and lower investment administration costs and combine all of the funds under the management of a single trustee board. These changes will be of significant benefit to military scheme members because of the smaller size of the military superannuation benefits fund—as I said, some $4 billion—as compared to the civilian schemes—as I said, some $19 billion. Without this consolidation, members of the MSBS, who comprise over 90 per cent of current serving ADF personnel as well as all future serving personnel, will be disadvantaged as superannuation industry funds continue to consolidate. This would reduce the MSB fund's ability to obtain good investment value and, of course, good value with respect to fees.


The ComSuper Bill 2011 implements the government's decision to modernise and clarify the governance of administration arrangements for the above schemes. It does this by establishing ComSuper as a statutory agency under the Public Service Act 1999 and replacing the Commissioner for Superannuation with a chief executive officer.


The Superannuation Legislation (Con­sequential Amendments and Trans­itional Provisions) Bill 2011 amends a range of Commonwealth legislation to take account of the new trustee arrangements and the changes to governance of administrative arrangements. It also includes transitional arrangements to facilitate these important changes. The reforms will also, through consolidating funds under management and reducing administration costs, improve the superannuation returns to members, partic­ularly defence superannuants.


After these bills were announced, the government became aware of some concerns held by ex-service organisations about some of their provisions. As a result, the government has introduced amendments to address these concerns. The following changes were made: first, amendments were made to recognise the unique nature of military service. A new objects clause and an amended functions clause were included to require the trustee to have regard to the unique nature of military service when performing a function under the military superannuation legislation. Second, the bill was amended to provide that at least one board member appointed by the Chief of the Defence Force must be present when the board is considering a matter related solely to the military schemes. Third, the establishment of the Defence Force Case Assessment Panel has now been made mandatory, with the legislation prescribing its membership. Previously the legislation gave CSC discretion to establish this panel to review decisions which are the current responsibility of the DFRDB Authority. I notice you are nodding, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore. You are obviously very familiar with these questions. Fourth, an amendment was included to provide for consultation between the finance minister and the defence minister in relation to the five employer directors of the board. This is in addition to the Chief of the Defence Force being responsible for nominating two member directors of the board.


Let me conclude by saying that the government is doing the right thing by its current serving Defence Force men and women as well as those who will serve into the future by providing the superannuation benefits for the majority of those in uniform. We have consulted with military and ex-service organisations and made several amendments in response to their concerns to further recognise the uniqueness of military service and to make changes to the operations of the trustee board when they consider military matters. This is positive legislation that will provide further support for our men and women in uniform. It is a great pity, though hardly a surprise, that this opposition, who do nothing but oppose for opposition's sake and who engage in the most irresponsible and hypocritical kind of stunting on the issue of Defence pensions, should be opposed to this worthwhile and uncontroversial legislation. They are doing so solely because of their consuming hatred of the trade union movement. They should stop. They should reconsider their attitudes and place the interests of our ADF personnel ahead of their own lonely ideological fixations. I commend the bill to the House.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (20:04):  The coalition does not support these bills. The reason we do not support these bills is that this government is completely obsessed with ensuring that its friends in the union movement get overall control, on this occasion over military superannuation and military pension arrangements. Why would it be, when only 41 per cent of public servants are members of a union, according to ABS data, that 100 per cent of employee representatives on the board created under this legislation will be ACTU nominated representatives?


Forty-one per cent of public sector employees are members of unions; 59 per cent are not. The majority of public sector employees choose not to be part of a union. Yet 100 per cent of employee representatives on the board to be created under this legislation—a board which also has responsibility for military pensions and military superannuation arrangements—will be ACTU representatives. Not only that, but also the ACTU president is the only one who can nominate employee representatives of the board. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, who has responsibility for ComSuper, is not able to dismiss any of them without getting the agreement of the President of the ACTU. Why is that appropriate? I do not think that any reasonable person in Australia would think that that is appropriate.


This is yet another example of the Labor Party looking after the vested interests of the people who put them here. Every single senator representing the Labor Party in this chamber and every single member of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives has to be a member of the union, courtesy of the constitution of the Labor Party. That is why the unions have a stranglehold over the sorts of decisions that are made by this government on issues like this. It would be much more appropriate for employee representatives on the board created under this legislation to be much more repre­sentative of the diversity of employee interests, including the 59 per cent of employees who choose not to be a member of a union. But, no, they have got to use their time in the sun, their time in government, to make sure they lock in as many benefits as possible for the vested interests of the union movement. This is about lining the pockets of the union movement, yet again, at the expense of the public interest.


During Senate estimates we asked questions about the current Aria board. This is the board that looks after all of the public sector superannuation arrangements. There are seven people on the board. Three are guaranteed positions to be dominated by the ACTU. But guess what? It just happens that four out of the seven representatives on the Aria board are representatives of the unions, so the unions have got the numbers on the Aria board. Why is that? Because, other than the ACTU nominated positions, the government has made it its business to make sure that it puts another union representative on the board. You can laugh, Senator Feeney; I know that that is a matter of great amusement for you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Senator, through the chair.




Senator CORMANN:
  Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: Senator Feeney may well laugh; he may well find this amusing. He might not think that it is appropriate to have superannuation trustees on those boards who are focused on the best interests of members of the funds, irrespective of whether or not they choose to be members of unions. He might not think that it is important for the 59 per cent of public servants who choose not to be members of unions to have a voice on these bodies. He might find that very amusing, to the point where he dismisses as an ideological hatred for unions any concern that the coalition expresses. Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I say to Senator Feeney: I do not have any hatred for unions whatsoever. The coalition does not have hatred for unions. But we think it is entirely inappropriate to have legislation setting up a corporate governance structure for super funds which entrenches a completely unrepresentative model where 41 per cent of employees who choose to be members of a union happen to get 100 per cent of the employee representative positions on the board.


These are serious matters. In the broader superannuation industry, this government has been very reluctant about and in fact has opposed many of the recommendations arising out of the Cooper review to improve corporate governance arrangements in the superannuation industry. Why? Because the union movement does not like it. The union movement does not like recommendations that improve transparency, corporate governance and integrity—things like super­annuation trustees should declare foreseeable conflicts of interest to APRA if they want to sit on multiple boards; things like the requirement to have independent directors on superannuation boards. This government has a pattern when it comes to superannuation: whether it is in the Public Service or in the private sector it is guided by one thing, and that is to protect and to pursue and to be an agent for the vested interests of the union movement. This legislation is a very sad example of this.


The minister talks about—I am sorry, Madam Acting Deputy President, I have promoted Senator Feeney—




Senator Feeney:
  Good instincts!




Senator CORMANN:
  The parliamentary secretary talks about the significant benefits of scale. We actually explored that with APRA, the regulator, during Senate estimates. APRA said that there is absolutely no evidence of the so-called benefits of scale—in particular, if you put the ACTU in such a dominant position over the funds not only of public servants but also of our defence personnel.


We have raised these concerns with the government and they of course are pressing ahead with this current model. The reason we have expressed those concerns to the government is that those concerns have been expressed to us very strongly, in particular by representatives of the defence community. We understand that the government cannot afford to do the wrong thing by the ACTU because the ACTU have a hold over them. The ACTU would not allow them to press ahead with changes that in any way undermined their stranglehold over the Commonwealth superannuation arrangements into the future. The reality is that the government should come up with a governance model which is more repre­sentative of the diversity of public sector employees' backgrounds and perspectives.


These bills establish ComSuper as a statutory agency consisting of a CEO and staff. The bills merge the existing trustees for the Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation schemes into a single trustee body, the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. The function of ComSuper is to provide administrative services to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corpora­tion, with the CEO of ComSuper appointed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in consultation with the Minister for Defence.


The Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation will be trustee for all of the existing Commonwealth super­annuation funds, including the Commonwealth Super­annuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Benefits Scheme. The Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation Board will consist of 11 members appointed by the Minister for Finance and Deregu­lation, with five employer directors chosen in consultation between the finance and defence ministers, three members nominated by the President of the ACTU, only two members nominated by the Chief of the Defence Force and one independent chair.


The reason that the coalition continues not to support these bills is because, as I have mentioned, the ACTU has completely disproportionate representation on the board and is the exclusive representative of public sector employees on that board. The current legislation still contains provisions which make it unacceptable to the defence and veteran communities. Although the bill now contains a reference to the unique nature of military service, the bill's other inclusions, particularly with regard to the disprop­ortionate ACTU representation, mean that military members' interests are not properly represented or safeguarded. The bill still gives excessive power to the ACTU with regard to appointments of board members, termination of board members and quorum arrangements for board meetings.


I will just go through some of these issues in detail. With regard to ACTU repre­sentation on the board, why should the ACTU, as I have mentioned before, have 100 per cent of the employee representative positions on the board when only 41 per cent of public sector employees are in fact members of unions? This gives a completely inappropriate and privileged benefit to the union movement ahead of proper representation for the 59 per cent of public sector employees who choose not to be members of a union. 


Defence superannuants should retain their representation of directors on the board due to the unique nature of military service and the defence community's special circum­stances. Why should the ACTU have more employee representatives on this board than the defence community? Currently the ACTU is able to nominate more directors than the Chief of the Defence Force. The defence and veteran communities believe that military representation on the board under this legislation should be at least equal to that of the ACTU or, alternatively, that the military should continue to have its own independent board. Why is it that the minister cannot dismiss an ACTU-nominated director? The legislation currently provides that the minister for finance cannot remove an ACTU-nominated director unless the president of the ACTU agrees. This is even in the case of misbehaviour, physical or mental incapacity or if the director is absent from multiple meetings of the board. That is an extraordinary position. It is an extra­ordinarily privileged position to be given to the ACTU and it is simply courtesy of the fact that the ACTU calls the shots with this government. Between the ACTU and the Greens, all of the decisions are made in the back room.


We know that Senator Cameron enjoys the positions adopted by the Greens much more than the positions adopted by his own Prime Minister. We know that because he said so. We know that Senator Cameron is very concerned about the fact that he is not allowed to speak his mind anymore inside the Labor caucus. We know that because he said so. Senator Cameron has told us about the problems with Labor senators 'getting a lobotomy' and 'becoming like zombies', not able to speak their minds. I am sure that he is going to be even more passionate in his defence of the union representation on this Commonwealth superannuation board, irrespective of the fact that they are not actually representative even of a majority of public sector employees.


The thing I really do not understand is that ACTU members, under this legislation and under the corporate governance arrange­ments set up by this Labor government, can prevent a quorum being reached. For some reason, the quorum under this legislation is said to be nine members. Nine members are needed at a board meeting for decisions to be made. That means that the three ACTU-nominated directors on their own can prevent a meeting from validly being held. Com­bined with the provisions preventing the minister from dismissing an ACTU-nominated director, this legislation gives the ACTU extraordinary powers and a completely inappropriate level of corporate governance control over Commonwealth superannuation funds. 


I would say to Senator Feeney, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that this is not about an ideological hatred of unions. For example, in Victoria a couple of weeks ago, we had the circumstance of a mooted merger between Vision Super and Equipsuper. That merger was falling over. Why was it falling over? Because the union-nominated directors on one of the funds were concerned about the proposal for direct election of the board in the merged entity and they were concerned that there was no guarantee of nominated directors on the board of the new entity.


Superannuation fund trustees are supposed to act in the members' best interests. They have a fiduciary duty to act in the members' best interests. Yet the union representatives on that board, in making a decision to not support a merger going ahead on the basis of a lack of assurance there would be a continuation of union-nominated directors, were not acting in the best interests of their members; they were acting in direct and obvious self-interest, in the interests of the union movement. They were protecting their positions. So what is being done about this?


There is absolutely no guarantee under the arrangements being put in place that the interests of 59 per cent of public sector employees who are not members of a union will be properly looked after. The ACTU representatives on that board will have a vested interest in making the best possible arrangements for union members in public sector employment. This concept that somehow it is appropriate for 41 per cent of public sector employees to get 100 per cent of the employee representative positions on the board to be created under this legislation is extraordinary. There is no proper or rational explanation as to how that is in the public interest. The only explanation that we can reasonably come up with is that this government is captive to the directions of the union movement. They have told you that that is what they want. They are insisting on it. They say: 'Yeah, go ahead with this merger. Give us more power. Give us power over more of the Commonwealth super­annuation arrangements. Make sure that we can get on top of the military super so that we can get our hands into that. But don't dare weaken or dilute the influence that we have over the public sector superannuation arrangements, even though we represent less than half the superannuants that are being covered under this scheme.' I am talking about 41 per cent of current public sector employees. How many retired members would still be members of a union?


This is a government that is completely conflicted when it comes to putting forward recommendations around the corporate governance arrangements for Common­wealth super. This government should be embarrassed at the complete inapprop­riateness of this legislation they have put forward. But, the way things have been going over the last 12 months or so, it seems that this government does not get embarrassed about anything anymore. They are just pressing ahead to lock in as many advantages for the vested interests they represent in this chamber and in this parliament as they possibly can in the time that they have remaining in government. They want to make sure that as many vested interests as possible are locked in to legislation before the Australian people can formalise their loss of trust and confidence in this government—the serious betrayal that this government has imposed on them on things like the broken promise not to impose a carbon tax on them. 


This legislation should not be supported by the Senate. I worry that, given the changed dynamics in the Senate that are around the corner, and given that the government now will have the majority and control of the Senate with the support of their alliance partners the Greens, I do not have much confidence that bad legislation like this will get proper scrutiny in the Senate as it would have done in the past. Sadly, the place for appropriate scrutiny of government legislation will no longer be the Senate; it will be the House of Repre­sentatives, because the government—not having a majority—will be able to make proposals, but ultimately it will come down to whether they are able to convince crossbench members of parliament to help them get legislation through the House of Representatives. In the Senate, I suspect the Greens will on various issues jump up and down and express concerns but in the end vote with the government no matter what. That is the way things will go in the Senate moving forward.


This is bad legislation. It is bad policy. It is completely self-interested—it is driven by a desire to institutionalise the vested interests of the Labor Party, acting as agents for the union movement. This legislation aims to entrench a corporate governance structure which gives 41 percent of public sector employees 100 percent of the employee representative positions on the board it will create. It will merge all the Commonwealth superannuation arrangements, including the military superannuation arrangements, into one organisation.


Of course, Labor senators get very touchy over all this. First we had Senator Feeney laughing and smiling, and now we have Senator Feeney and Senator Sherry talking loudly between themselves. They do not take this issue seriously. They probably feel embarrassed about the fact that they are putting legislation forward which is in the interests not of the public but of the ACTU and the broader union movement. They are probably embarrassed that they are here acting as the agents of the union movement, putting forward legislation that will entrench a seriously conflicted corporate governance structure, including military superannuation arrangements—a move which is, of course, entirely inappropriate—into the future. That is why we will move an amendment to seek to improve this very bad legislation; but we do not believe it will be passed. (Time expired)

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (19:52):  I am pleased to have this oppor­tunity to speak on these bills: the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2011, the ComSuper Bill 2011 and the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. These bills will reform governance arrangements for Commonwealth government superannua­tion schemes in line with trends in the broader superannuation industry. They will also serve to modernise some aspects of these arrangements. The purpose of these bills is to improve the superannuation arrangements for the men and women currently serving in the Australian defence forces. 


Since I assumed my current responsibilities I have had the opportunity of meeting many of these fine Australians and I have acquired a better understanding of the uniquely difficult tasks with which we task them. We have an obligation to see that their service and their sacrifices are appropriately recognised, and one way to do that is to ensure that the superannuation arrangements we put in place for our service personnel are the very best possible. This legislation demonstrates the Gillard government's commitment to improving the super­annuation arrangements for our service men and women under the Military Super­annuation and Benefit Scheme.


These bills will increase the super­annuation returns for the majority of our serving members. In fact, they will increase the take-home superannuation of over 90 per cent of our current serving personnel as well as future members of the ADF. Let me give an example. An increase of 0.5 per cent in the net investment return for a member of the RAAF who joins as an officer cadet and retires as a group captain would lead to an increase in superannuation benefits of some $41,000 over 10 years of service or $95,000 over a full career.


Recently in the Senate we have seen a series of shameless stunts by the opposition in relation to the retirement income of our Defence personnel. Senator Ronaldson has brought in a private member's bill which seeks to change the method of indexing Defence pensions for certain categories of Defence retirees. In the course of so doing, he has been highly critical of the government for not supporting his bill. Of course, what Senator Ronaldson has not explained to the Senate—nor, I might say, to anyone else—is why the Howard government, of which he was a member, did absolutely nothing about this issue for the whole 11 years it was in office. He has not told the Senate that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the Howard government, the Hon. Mr Billson, com­missioned a report on this very matter. Nor has he told us that this report, the Podger report, recommended against the course of action which the opposition is now putting forward and that Mr Billson accepted that report. He has not explained why he went to the 2007 election supporting a policy which was the very opposite of the one he now purports to support. I am still waiting for the opposition to explain their extraordinary inconsistency on this issue. In government, they accepted Mr Podger's finding that changes to the indexation system for Defence pensions could not be justified. Now, in the safety of opposition, they have discovered that all of this is a monstrous injustice for which the Labor government is obviously to blame.


Senator Ronaldson and his colleagues have some explaining to do. I am, of course, astonished to find that they are opposed to the simple and straightforward improve­ments to our Defence superannuation arrangements that are contained in these bills tonight. Last week it seemed vitally important to them to change the system for indexing Defence pensions, because our military retirees were suffering erosion of their standards of living, but, this week, when the government brings in legislation that would bring about an increase in superannuation benefits to the average ADF member of perhaps $41,000 over 10 years or $95,000 over a full career, they are opposed to it. This is quite astonishing and I think it is a real insult to the intelligence of the men and women of the ADF and the wider Defence community. How can Senator Ronaldson and others in the opposition possibly imagine that the antics of last week and their position tonight will not be matched against one another?


What grounds are the opposition using to oppose these bills tonight? Apparently it is because these bills provide that the ACTU will nominate three members of the board of the Commonwealth Superannuation Cor­pora­tion. What a shocking idea that is! The vigilance of the opposition is truly extraordinary! The notion that the peak body representing Australian employees, an organisation with more experience of administering superannuation than anyone else in the country—indeed, it lays claim to inventing modern superannuation—should have a voice on the governing body of the main Australian government civilian and military superannuation schemes. Well, how remarkable!


So now we know what the real priorities of this opposition actually are. We know that pursuing their obsessive and irrational vendetta against the Australian trade union movement is far more important to them than the welfare and standard of living of our retired public servants and Defence personnel. What a marvellous juxtaposition this is with their outlandish rhetoric of only last week.


The Liberal Party is, after all, the party that brought us Work Choices and would, of course, bring us 'Son of Work Choices' if they ever got back into power. They are opposed to anything which brings benefits to employees. But I am sure that current serving members of the ADF will note that the opposition is trying to deny them the very real benefits of this legislation on the basis of what can be described as nothing more than an ideological vendetta.


Let us now return to the bills which we are debating. The Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Bill 2011 implements the government's decision to establish a consolidated trustee for the main Australian government civilian and military superannuation schemes. The consolidated trustee body is to be known as the Commonwealth Superannuation Cor­pora­tion. The CSC will be a Com­monwealth authority for the purposes of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The bill requires the governing board of CSC to have regard to the unique nature of military service as provided for in the schemes established by the relevant military superannuation acts when it is performing functions under those acts.


The bill will also provide for the CSC to be governed by a board, in line with the common model in the broader super­annuation industry. The board will comprise 11 directors—a chair, five member directors and five employer directors. The ACTU and the Chief of the Defence Force will nominate three and two member directors respectively. This representation is consistent with the size of funds in the scheme—$19 billion in the civilian scheme and some $4 billion in the military scheme. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, after appropriate consul­tation, will choose the five employer directors. The minister will consult with the Minister for Defence in selecting suitable candidates for these positions. By merging the existing civilian and military super­annuation trustee boards into the CSC, this bill will improve the economies of scale to generate potentially higher investment returns and lower investment administration costs and combine all of the funds under the management of a single trustee board. These changes will be of significant benefit to military scheme members because of the smaller size of the military superannuation benefits fund—as I said, some $4 billion—as compared to the civilian schemes—as I said, some $19 billion. Without this consolidation, members of the MSBS, who comprise over 90 per cent of current serving ADF personnel as well as all future serving personnel, will be disadvantaged as superannuation industry funds continue to consolidate. This would reduce the MSB fund's ability to obtain good investment value and, of course, good value with respect to fees.


The ComSuper Bill 2011 implements the government's decision to modernise and clarify the governance of administration arrangements for the above schemes. It does this by establishing ComSuper as a statutory agency under the Public Service Act 1999 and replacing the Commissioner for Superannuation with a chief executive officer.


The Superannuation Legislation (Con­sequential Amendments and Trans­itional Provisions) Bill 2011 amends a range of Commonwealth legislation to take account of the new trustee arrangements and the changes to governance of administrative arrangements. It also includes transitional arrangements to facilitate these important changes. The reforms will also, through consolidating funds under management and reducing administration costs, improve the superannuation returns to members, partic­ularly defence superannuants.


After these bills were announced, the government became aware of some concerns held by ex-service organisations about some of their provisions. As a result, the government has introduced amendments to address these concerns. The following changes were made: first, amendments were made to recognise the unique nature of military service. A new objects clause and an amended functions clause were included to require the trustee to have regard to the unique nature of military service when performing a function under the military superannuation legislation. Second, the bill was amended to provide that at least one board member appointed by the Chief of the Defence Force must be present when the board is considering a matter related solely to the military schemes. Third, the establishment of the Defence Force Case Assessment Panel has now been made mandatory, with the legislation prescribing its membership. Previously the legislation gave CSC discretion to establish this panel to review decisions which are the current responsibility of the DFRDB Authority. I notice you are nodding, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore. You are obviously very familiar with these questions. Fourth, an amendment was included to provide for consultation between the finance minister and the defence minister in relation to the five employer directors of the board. This is in addition to the Chief of the Defence Force being responsible for nominating two member directors of the board.


Let me conclude by saying that the government is doing the right thing by its current serving Defence Force men and women as well as those who will serve into the future by providing the superannuation benefits for the majority of those in uniform. We have consulted with military and ex-service organisations and made several amendments in response to their concerns to further recognise the uniqueness of military service and to make changes to the operations of the trustee board when they consider military matters. This is positive legislation that will provide further support for our men and women in uniform. It is a great pity, though hardly a surprise, that this opposition, who do nothing but oppose for opposition's sake and who engage in the most irresponsible and hypocritical kind of stunting on the issue of Defence pensions, should be opposed to this worthwhile and uncontroversial legislation. They are doing so solely because of their consuming hatred of the trade union movement. They should stop. They should reconsider their attitudes and place the interests of our ADF personnel ahead of their own lonely ideological fixations. I commend the bill to the House.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (20:04):  The coalition does not support these bills. The reason we do not support these bills is that this government is completely obsessed with ensuring that its friends in the union movement get overall control, on this occasion over military superannuation and military pension arrangements. Why would it be, when only 41 per cent of public servants are members of a union, according to ABS data, that 100 per cent of employee representatives on the board created under this legislation will be ACTU nominated representatives?


Forty-one per cent of public sector employees are members of unions; 59 per cent are not. The majority of public sector employees choose not to be part of a union. Yet 100 per cent of employee representatives on the board to be created under this legislation—a board which also has responsibility for military pensions and military superannuation arrangements—will be ACTU representatives. Not only that, but also the ACTU president is the only one who can nominate employee representatives of the board. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, who has responsibility for ComSuper, is not able to dismiss any of them without getting the agreement of the President of the ACTU. Why is that appropriate? I do not think that any reasonable person in Australia would think that that is appropriate.


This is yet another example of the Labor Party looking after the vested interests of the people who put them here. Every single senator representing the Labor Party in this chamber and every single member of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives has to be a member of the union, courtesy of the constitution of the Labor Party. That is why the unions have a stranglehold over the sorts of decisions that are made by this government on issues like this. It would be much more appropriate for employee representatives on the board created under this legislation to be much more repre­sentative of the diversity of employee interests, including the 59 per cent of employees who choose not to be a member of a union. But, no, they have got to use their time in the sun, their time in government, to make sure they lock in as many benefits as possible for the vested interests of the union movement. This is about lining the pockets of the union movement, yet again, at the expense of the public interest.


During Senate estimates we asked questions about the current Aria board. This is the board that looks after all of the public sector superannuation arrangements. There are seven people on the board. Three are guaranteed positions to be dominated by the ACTU. But guess what? It just happens that four out of the seven representatives on the Aria board are representatives of the unions, so the unions have got the numbers on the Aria board. Why is that? Because, other than the ACTU nominated positions, the government has made it its business to make sure that it puts another union representative on the board. You can laugh, Senator Feeney; I know that that is a matter of great amusement for you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Senator, through the chair.




Senator CORMANN:
  Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: Senator Feeney may well laugh; he may well find this amusing. He might not think that it is appropriate to have superannuation trustees on those boards who are focused on the best interests of members of the funds, irrespective of whether or not they choose to be members of unions. He might not think that it is important for the 59 per cent of public servants who choose not to be members of unions to have a voice on these bodies. He might find that very amusing, to the point where he dismisses as an ideological hatred for unions any concern that the coalition expresses. Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I say to Senator Feeney: I do not have any hatred for unions whatsoever. The coalition does not have hatred for unions. But we think it is entirely inappropriate to have legislation setting up a corporate governance structure for super funds which entrenches a completely unrepresentative model where 41 per cent of employees who choose to be members of a union happen to get 100 per cent of the employee representative positions on the board.


These are serious matters. In the broader superannuation industry, this government has been very reluctant about and in fact has opposed many of the recommendations arising out of the Cooper review to improve corporate governance arrangements in the superannuation industry. Why? Because the union movement does not like it. The union movement does not like recommendations that improve transparency, corporate governance and integrity—things like super­annuation trustees should declare foreseeable conflicts of interest to APRA if they want to sit on multiple boards; things like the requirement to have independent directors on superannuation boards. This government has a pattern when it comes to superannuation: whether it is in the Public Service or in the private sector it is guided by one thing, and that is to protect and to pursue and to be an agent for the vested interests of the union movement. This legislation is a very sad example of this.


The minister talks about—I am sorry, Madam Acting Deputy President, I have promoted Senator Feeney—




Senator Feeney:
  Good instincts!




Senator CORMANN:
  The parliamentary secretary talks about the significant benefits of scale. We actually explored that with APRA, the regulator, during Senate estimates. APRA said that there is absolutely no evidence of the so-called benefits of scale—in particular, if you put the ACTU in such a dominant position over the funds not only of public servants but also of our defence personnel.


We have raised these concerns with the government and they of course are pressing ahead with this current model. The reason we have expressed those concerns to the government is that those concerns have been expressed to us very strongly, in particular by representatives of the defence community. We understand that the government cannot afford to do the wrong thing by the ACTU because the ACTU have a hold over them. The ACTU would not allow them to press ahead with changes that in any way undermined their stranglehold over the Commonwealth superannuation arrangements into the future. The reality is that the government should come up with a governance model which is more repre­sentative of the diversity of public sector employees' backgrounds and perspectives.


These bills establish ComSuper as a statutory agency consisting of a CEO and staff. The bills merge the existing trustees for the Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation schemes into a single trustee body, the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. The function of ComSuper is to provide administrative services to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corpora­tion, with the CEO of ComSuper appointed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in consultation with the Minister for Defence.


The Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation will be trustee for all of the existing Commonwealth super­annuation funds, including the Commonwealth Super­annuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Benefits Scheme. The Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation Board will consist of 11 members appointed by the Minister for Finance and Deregu­lation, with five employer directors chosen in consultation between the finance and defence ministers, three members nominated by the President of the ACTU, only two members nominated by the Chief of the Defence Force and one independent chair.


The reason that the coalition continues not to support these bills is because, as I have mentioned, the ACTU has completely disproportionate representation on the board and is the exclusive representative of public sector employees on that board. The current legislation still contains provisions which make it unacceptable to the defence and veteran communities. Although the bill now contains a reference to the unique nature of military service, the bill's other inclusions, particularly with regard to the disprop­ortionate ACTU representation, mean that military members' interests are not properly represented or safeguarded. The bill still gives excessive power to the ACTU with regard to appointments of board members, termination of board members and quorum arrangements for board meetings.


I will just go through some of these issues in detail. With regard to ACTU repre­sentation on the board, why should the ACTU, as I have mentioned before, have 100 per cent of the employee representative positions on the board when only 41 per cent of public sector employees are in fact members of unions? This gives a completely inappropriate and privileged benefit to the union movement ahead of proper representation for the 59 per cent of public sector employees who choose not to be members of a union. 


Defence superannuants should retain their representation of directors on the board due to the unique nature of military service and the defence community's special circum­stances. Why should the ACTU have more employee representatives on this board than the defence community? Currently the ACTU is able to nominate more directors than the Chief of the Defence Force. The defence and veteran communities believe that military representation on the board under this legislation should be at least equal to that of the ACTU or, alternatively, that the military should continue to have its own independent board. Why is it that the minister cannot dismiss an ACTU-nominated director? The legislation currently provides that the minister for finance cannot remove an ACTU-nominated director unless the president of the ACTU agrees. This is even in the case of misbehaviour, physical or mental incapacity or if the director is absent from multiple meetings of the board. That is an extraordinary position. It is an extra­ordinarily privileged position to be given to the ACTU and it is simply courtesy of the fact that the ACTU calls the shots with this government. Between the ACTU and the Greens, all of the decisions are made in the back room.


We know that Senator Cameron enjoys the positions adopted by the Greens much more than the positions adopted by his own Prime Minister. We know that because he said so. We know that Senator Cameron is very concerned about the fact that he is not allowed to speak his mind anymore inside the Labor caucus. We know that because he said so. Senator Cameron has told us about the problems with Labor senators 'getting a lobotomy' and 'becoming like zombies', not able to speak their minds. I am sure that he is going to be even more passionate in his defence of the union representation on this Commonwealth superannuation board, irrespective of the fact that they are not actually representative even of a majority of public sector employees.


The thing I really do not understand is that ACTU members, under this legislation and under the corporate governance arrange­ments set up by this Labor government, can prevent a quorum being reached. For some reason, the quorum under this legislation is said to be nine members. Nine members are needed at a board meeting for decisions to be made. That means that the three ACTU-nominated directors on their own can prevent a meeting from validly being held. Com­bined with the provisions preventing the minister from dismissing an ACTU-nominated director, this legislation gives the ACTU extraordinary powers and a completely inappropriate level of corporate governance control over Commonwealth superannuation funds. 


I would say to Senator Feeney, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that this is not about an ideological hatred of unions. For example, in Victoria a couple of weeks ago, we had the circumstance of a mooted merger between Vision Super and Equipsuper. That merger was falling over. Why was it falling over? Because the union-nominated directors on one of the funds were concerned about the proposal for direct election of the board in the merged entity and they were concerned that there was no guarantee of nominated directors on the board of the new entity.


Superannuation fund trustees are supposed to act in the members' best interests. They have a fiduciary duty to act in the members' best interests. Yet the union representatives on that board, in making a decision to not support a merger going ahead on the basis of a lack of assurance there would be a continuation of union-nominated directors, were not acting in the best interests of their members; they were acting in direct and obvious self-interest, in the interests of the union movement. They were protecting their positions. So what is being done about this?


There is absolutely no guarantee under the arrangements being put in place that the interests of 59 per cent of public sector employees who are not members of a union will be properly looked after. The ACTU representatives on that board will have a vested interest in making the best possible arrangements for union members in public sector employment. This concept that somehow it is appropriate for 41 per cent of public sector employees to get 100 per cent of the employee representative positions on the board to be created under this legislation is extraordinary. There is no proper or rational explanation as to how that is in the public interest. The only explanation that we can reasonably come up with is that this government is captive to the directions of the union movement. They have told you that that is what they want. They are insisting on it. They say: 'Yeah, go ahead with this merger. Give us more power. Give us power over more of the Commonwealth super­annuation arrangements. Make sure that we can get on top of the military super so that we can get our hands into that. But don't dare weaken or dilute the influence that we have over the public sector superannuation arrangements, even though we represent less than half the superannuants that are being covered under this scheme.' I am talking about 41 per cent of current public sector employees. How many retired members would still be members of a union?


This is a government that is completely conflicted when it comes to putting forward recommendations around the corporate governance arrangements for Common­wealth super. This government should be embarrassed at the complete inapprop­riateness of this legislation they have put forward. But, the way things have been going over the last 12 months or so, it seems that this government does not get embarrassed about anything anymore. They are just pressing ahead to lock in as many advantages for the vested interests they represent in this chamber and in this parliament as they possibly can in the time that they have remaining in government. They want to make sure that as many vested interests as possible are locked in to legislation before the Australian people can formalise their loss of trust and confidence in this government—the serious betrayal that this government has imposed on them on things like the broken promise not to impose a carbon tax on them. 


This legislation should not be supported by the Senate. I worry that, given the changed dynamics in the Senate that are around the corner, and given that the government now will have the majority and control of the Senate with the support of their alliance partners the Greens, I do not have much confidence that bad legislation like this will get proper scrutiny in the Senate as it would have done in the past. Sadly, the place for appropriate scrutiny of government legislation will no longer be the Senate; it will be the House of Repre­sentatives, because the government—not having a majority—will be able to make proposals, but ultimately it will come down to whether they are able to convince crossbench members of parliament to help them get legislation through the House of Representatives. In the Senate, I suspect the Greens will on various issues jump up and down and express concerns but in the end vote with the government no matter what. That is the way things will go in the Senate moving forward.


This is bad legislation. It is bad policy. It is completely self-interested—it is driven by a desire to institutionalise the vested interests of the Labor Party, acting as agents for the union movement. This legislation aims to entrench a corporate governance structure which gives 41 percent of public sector employees 100 percent of the employee representative positions on the board it will create.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (21:52):  In March I spoke in the Senate about the achievements of the Australian blind cricket team. In that speech I mentioned that Ben Phillips, a totally blind cricketer, would be joining the Tigers Oxfam Trailwalker team to compete in the 100-kilometre 2011 Melbourne Oxfam trail walk. Tonight I inform the Senate of the Tigers' success in completing the 100 kilometres in 37 hours and two minutes and, most importantly, the fantastic work of Ben, who did it all without seeing a single step along the way.


Ben is now totally blind. He was born legally blind and as a child had very limited vision. He went to school and learned to read, but—as the years passed and his glaucoma, aniridia and other eye conditions became worse—his sight diminished. He has been totally blind for around two years now and has only extremely limited light perception.


The Tigers first met Ben while we were training with Nick Gleeson for the 2010 Oxfam trail walk in Melbourne, when Max—a Tigers stalwart—Ben, Nick and I along with another blind walker and two other guides walked a section of the Great North Walk in Sydney. Ben works as a babysitter and is studying child care at university via correspondence—he seems to have a natural talent for getting babies off to sleep! He lives independently in Paddington in Sydney. He plays blind cricket for the Burwood club and is a regular in both the New South Wales and Australian sides.


In the first stage of the Melbourne trail walk the Tigers kept up with the pack, and we met some interesting characters along the way. Ben's bright orange vest with the silver text on the back saying: 'I'm Ben. I'm Blind.' made this congested section much easier to manage as groups overtaking the Tigers would see Ben's vest, say g'day to Ben and wish us well for the 90-plus kilometres to come. We eventually made it to checkpoint 1, which had run out of food by the time we got there—disaster!—but with a quick change of socks we were on our way to checkpoint 2 at Lysterfield Lake.


At Lysterfield we met up with our support crew, Anthony Byrne MP and his staff, who as usual gave our team magnificent support. We set off on the wide fire trail with the goal of reaching checkpoint 3 by sundown. As the fire trail wound back into suburbia, the team pushed up some steep hills around Belgrave. We made checkpoint 3, at Ferny Creek, not long after dark.


After a short break we hit the track again. Many parts of this section consist of slippery, single-file track. Light rain began to fall; heavy rain followed. Conditions were very cold and miserable. We were climbing for most the second half of this section, and we reached the highest point of the trail walk in the middle of the worst storm. Ben said this was especially difficult for him because, when the wind and rain whipped around his ears, the hood on his raincoat invariably muffled directions given by sighted team mates. Ben had no choice but to bat on and concentrate very, very hard—which, of course, he did.


We reached Olinda, the highest checkpoint in the walk, and decided to sit out the storm. When the worst of the storm moved on, so did the team. It was cold, and the wet track was difficult, but at least the wind and rain had eased. The Tigers team reached checkpoint 5 at Mount Evelyn around 5 am. After Mount Evelyn the event follows the Warburton Rail Trail, where Ben put his foot down—he raced along the Warburton Rail Trail, which is built on an old railway line and is wide, flat and consistent underfoot. Checkpoint 6 at Woori Yallock was a quick turnaround; although blisters were becoming an issue, the Tigers were determined to push on quickly.


The penultimate stage includes a climb up to and a walk along a disused aqueduct. It was quite odd that the first street sign that we stumbled upon was a huge sign pointing the way to Sussex Street, proving what I have always thought: they have their tentacles everywhere! We reached the final check­point, and some serious repair work was required on blisters. Ben sought assistance from the professionals. He had many blisters, including a whopper on his heel, which made even putting his shoes on a difficult task. The physios and podiatrists had shut up shop; but to Ben's credit he just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Okay—let's go.'


The final stage of Ben's epic began with the most awkward climb of the 100-kilometre trek. This steep, narrow section of the track is very slippery and has steep drop-offs on both the left and right hand sides of the tracks. Ben needed to concentrate hard and switch his focus and line, as the track poses dangers on both sides. The team handled this stage with military precision. We made it to the top of the hill and onto the fire trail in record time and began the run home. On the last couple of hills, where the track is covered in scree, every step felt like a dagger through the soles of our shoes. But, you will be pleased to hear, we made it to the top of the last hill and began the final precarious descent. Partly grass and partly loose rubble but all treacherous, the surface is as unpredictable as a Benji Marshall show-and-go. I have gone base-over-apex on that hill every year we have participated!


In a final sprint to the finish line, Ben proudly waved his Tigers flag—he had done it. He finished the 100 kilometres in 37 hours and two minutes, and that is a great achievement. Let me quote Ben's own words about this. This is what Ben said:




I've been overwhelmed with emotion this afternoon, just crying my guts out with joy. I can't tell you how liberating it is having experienced years of bullying and discrimination for being blind ... then to go and conquer something most people will never do, and wear a bright vest that says ""I'm Ben. I'm blind. Tigers "" and do that for 100 km for all to see. It became something positive, I feel valued and special and I no longer need to hide [being blind].


My thanks as always go to Max, who does so much of the organisation for our trail walkers; to John Paul; and to our fantastic support crew: Alex, Helen, Daniel and Anthony Byrne and his staff; and, as always, I pay special tribute to the Balmain Tigers Rugby League Football Club, who have been so generous in their support for this worthy cause, as have all our other supporters and donors—and so many of them have done so now for a very long period of time. As far as Ben's three other team members are concerned, I just want to say this: as far as we are concerned, our mate Ben is a real hero.
