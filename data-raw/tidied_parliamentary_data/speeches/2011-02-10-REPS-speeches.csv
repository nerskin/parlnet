That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following items of private Members’ business, being reported from the Main Committee, or called on, and considered immediately in the following order:
Home Insulation Program—Report from Main Committee; and
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010—Order of the day No. 9.
I advise the House that the motion by the member for Mayo regarding a detention facility at Inverbrackie will not be brought forward for a vote, at the member’s request. I spoke earlier today with the member for Mayo. He was preparing with his wife to visit the hospital for the birth of his child. On behalf of the House, I wish him and his wife all the best on what will be a very momentous occasion.

Mr Hunt interjecting—
—I am advised by his colleague, the member for Flinders, that this will be his and his wife’s third child.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make some concluding remarks in relation to the motion with respect to the Home Insulation Program.
 (Hon. BC Scott)—The motion before the House is to suspend standing orders. I put the question.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—I seek leave to address this matter in brief.
Leave granted.
—This motion, in brief, is about two fundamental concepts of transparency and public safety. The motion has sought to achieve two things: firstly, the release of the full rate of defects discovered to date under both the Home Insulation Safety Plan and the Foil Insulation Safety Program, and, secondly, it calls on the Australian government to release information on the asbestos problem discovered under the Home Insulation Program. These are continuing matters of urgency.
I know that the government has produced material from CSIRO that is simply statistical fact. It says that the 156,000-odd investigations to date may not represent the entirety of the figure. But that does not hide the fact that there is a risk that is germane and real to those who are conducting the inspections. The response to the government is summed up in the letter from the Secretary of the National Electrical and Communications Association, Mr James Tinslay, to the Independents. He wrote:
We believe there is a public interest issue in releasing the data on both safety inspection programs, not the reverse. The government has said that the figures could scare the public. However, not knowing how big the problem is—whether your ceiling could be electrified or if there is a potential fire hazard in your roof—is more concerning.
I would say with great respect to the Independents who are considering their position that this body, NECA, in addition to the master electricians, right from the outset warned of the dangers of a program which has produced 200-odd house fires, 1,500 electrified roofs, 200,000-plus dangerous or dodgy roofs and $2½ billion dollars wasted and which has been linked, above all else, with four tragic losses.
The organisations which made the warnings from the outset are making the warnings again and it would be folly to ignore their warnings on public safety. This is real and germane and important. It is also a principle of transparency. We were told that this parliament would be about letting in the sunlight. Right now is the moment to choose whether or not we let in the sunlight to disclose the figures, which are simply being covered up because they are embarrassing to the government. I say this to all of those involved. To the government: release the figures and end the cover-up. To the Independents: consider the principle of transparency and above all else consider the principle of public safety, which has been set out in writing to you by the very people who warned of all of the dangers of this program right throughout the uncovering and unfolding disaster—which they predicted, which they warned of, which they identified and which they are again identifying. That is why this motion must be supported.

"Oakeshott, Rob, MP",IND,2011-02-10,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following reports: Report 418: Review of Auditor-General’s reports Nos 4 to 38 (2009-10); Report 419: Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997; and Report 420: Annual report 2009-10, with executive minutes received by the committee.
Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.
—by leave—These reports are tabled on behalf of the committee of the previous parliament, which undertook all of the work for the inquiries, including the conduct of the public hearings and the preparation of the reports.
With regard to report 418, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as prescribed by its act, examines all reports of the Auditor-General and reports the results of the committee’s deliberations to the parliament. This report details the findings of the committee’s examination of nine performance audits tabled in 2009 and 2010. As usual, these reports cover a range of agencies and highlight a number of areas of concern, in particular grants administration, the implementation of new technology, risk management and data integrity.
The committee reviewed the administration of grants by the National Health and Medical Research Council. The committee acknowledged the benefits to Australian health flowing from research supported by the NHMRC grants system. The committee also noted the upheaval caused by the NHMRC’s recent separation from the Department of Health and Ageing and its move to a statutory agency. The committee recognised that the NHMRC is still consolidating its new status but was pleased to see evidence of a tightening in administrative practices, processes and procedures.
The committee examined the implementation of the Change Program by the Australian Taxation Office. While the committee noted the significant productivity gains within the tax office, it expressed concern about the extent of ongoing client dissatisfaction with the system and the undermining of confidence in the integrity of Australia’s taxation system. The incoming committee will continue to monitor this situation at the next biannual hearing with the Commissioner of Taxation and potentially do more on the back of that.
The committee also expressed concern over the long-term issue of staff churn at AusAID, particularly in light of the growing demands placed on the agency by Australia’s expanding aid program. The committee acknowledged that AusAID is taking positive steps to combat this issue and recommended that AusAID report back to the committee on its efforts to alleviate the problem.
The committee reviewed audit reports on a number of controversial topics including the National Broadband Network request for proposal process, the coordination and reporting of Australia’s climate change measures and the Building the Education Revolution program. The committee identified issues with risk management, data integrity and reporting processes and the effect these issues have had on implementation and delivery. Overall, the committee made four recommendations which, if implemented, will ensure ongoing improvement in public administration of government funds.
Turning to report 419, this report examines the Auditor-General Act 1997, which sets out the functions and powers of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The committee conducted this inquiry to assess whether the powers of the Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office remain adequate in the modern public sector environment. It has been nine years since the last such review by the committee.
The committee acknowledged the gap in accountability of Commonwealth grants to states and territories. In his evidence to the committee the Auditor-General indicated the difficulties his office experiences in ‘following the dollar’ with regard to Commonwealth funding for programs and projects administered by the states and territories. He told the committee that this has been demonstrated with regard to a number of recent programs including the BER. More recently, this could prove relevant to the implementation of flood reconstruction programs in Queensland. To improve accountability and transparency, therefore, the committee strongly supports changes to the act to enable the Auditor-General to access information and records relating to the use of Commonwealth funds and to audit that information under certain circumstances.
The committee also recognises the increasing use of contractors to implement government programs and services. While acknowledging the benefits of this practice, the committee is concerned about the potential undermining of ministerial responsibility and parliamentary oversight. The committee wants to see more accountability in this area and accordingly wants the Auditor-General to have the power to audit contractors delivering government programs and services.
The committee considers that the Auditor-General should have the statutory authority to address these issues. Accordingly, the committee has made 13 recommendations which, if enacted, will enhance the power of the Auditor-General, including:
giving the Auditor-General greater authority to ‘follow the dollar’ where non-government bodies, including contractors and agencies in other levels of government, are in receipt of Commonwealth funding;
removing outdated restrictions on the Auditor-General’s capacity to initiate audits of Commonwealth-controlled government business enterprises;
ensuring that the Auditor-General’s full information-gathering powers for traditional performance audits also apply to ‘assurance’ reviews the parliament might wish him or her to carry out; and
enhancing the Auditor-General’s role in reviewing the adequacy of agencies’ performance information.
The changes proposed by the committee will help ensure that Commonwealth funding is fully accounted for and that, in the end, the taxpayer is receiving full value for money in all programs delivered by the Commonwealth or by related agencies.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the previous committee, chaired by Sharon Grierson MP, for its work on these inquiries. The incoming committee recognises the important role of the Auditor-General and his office in holding the executive and its agencies to account and looks forward to continuing to work with the Auditor-General to strengthen accountability and transparency and public administration across the Australian government.
I commend the report to the House.

"Christensen, George, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—I rise to support the motion of condolence in relation to the natural disasters that our nation has faced this summer. I particularly want to offer my condolences to those impacted by the floods that swept across Queensland. Also, I want to place on record the impact that the extreme weather events in Queensland has had on the people of Dawson. Firstly I want to assure the victims of these floods that they are in the thoughts and prayers of the people of Dawson. I particularly want to extend my sincere and heartfelt sorrow and sympathy to those who have lost family and friends in that inland tsunami, as it has been called, that swept through Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley. As the member for Wright said earlier this week, the fact that those people had no warning of what was to come that day made it such a terrible tragedy. I also want to acknowledge the good work that the member for Wright has done in this difficult time and acknowledge the passion and commitment that he has displayed for his people. The electors of Wright could not have picked a better representative.
I happened to be in Brisbane when the flood waters reached Ipswich and Brisbane City. While I was in Brisbane I was able to participate in the clean-up efforts that happened directly after that. What I witnessed when that huge army of volunteers turned up to help clean-up the city is something that will stay with me for a very long time. It was heartening to see, especially after witnessing over the previous couple of days people having their possessions washed away in flood waters down the Brisbane River. I want to pay tribute to Lord Mayor Campbell Newman and his team at the Brisbane City Council who so competently coordinated the flood clean-up effort. It was really an amazing effort. Heaven forbid that a flood event of that nature should happen in the Mackay region or in the Dawson electorate, but I would say that the exemplary mobilisation effort that Brisbane City Council achieved could be used in the regions of other councils.
While much of the destruction in the south-east corner of Queensland was very well publicised through the media, I put on record some of the impacts that the extraordinary La Nina weather events this summer have had on the people in my electorate of Dawson. Some might say that the electorate of Dawson dodged a bullet because we are one of the few regions in Queensland that were spared from the extraordinary floods that happened, but towns and cities in the electorate of Dawson did receive record rainfall, which has impacted, and there was the impact of the two cyclones in the last fortnight. While we have not had the floods, this has been no normal wet season in the north. In fact, we have already had rainfall in some places that is more than double the annual rainfall.
I have spoken before in this House about the impact the record spring rainfall has had on the sugar industry. It is important to realise the impact the rain that fell before Christmas is having on the sugar industry in Dawson. The Mackay region has had over double its annual rainfall since January 2010. As a result of the spring rainfall, there are over 645,000 tonnes of cane left standing in the paddock that was unable to be harvested in 2010. That is cane that farmers, millers and local businesses in the Mackay region will not receive any payment for.
One of the cruellest effects on the sugar industry is that the rain has not only made it too wet to harvest this year’s crop but also has ruined much of the 2011 plant cane. To replace this plant cane will cost local farmers about $1,800 a hectare. So the economic impact of this unusual wet season is going to be felt for a very long time to come. Some cane growers in the Mackay region reported that they did not suffer any damage from either of the two cyclones, just more rainfall, as if they had not had enough. Other areas, such as Proserpine, have received 4,000 millimetres since January 2010, when the average rainfall is 1,500 millimetres a year. That has left them with $18 million worth of cane in the paddock. That is one of the regions that was also hit by Cyclone Anthony and received strong gales from Cyclone Yasi.
Farmers of the Burdekin region have probably been the hardest hit economically by these weather events, with over three million tonnes of cane left in the paddock. That is very damaging to that small town. The Burdekin region was also impacted by Cyclone Yasi, with most of the cane being lodged or blown over by strong gales. I drove through that area and it was an unbelievable sight. It is heartbreaking for some of those farmers. I will continue to call on the government to assist these people where possible.
I also want to make some special mention of the local governments and the professional way in which they prepared their communities when Cyclone Anthony and Cyclone Yasi were bearing down on the coast during the past weeks. As a former councillor from the Mackay Regional Council I know that local government is called upon to prepare the community for every cyclone season. I know the special effort that is put in by local mayors, staff and councillors to prepare for these cyclones. I want to make special mention, today, of Mayor Lyn McLaughlin and her councillors and staff at Burdekin Shire Council. It was very good to be with Councillor McLaughlin at the disaster management meeting when Cyclone Anthony was bearing down on the coast. It was actually heading right for their town at that point in time.
On the night that Cyclone Anthony was to cross the coast at that town, thinking I was doing the sensible thing, I tried to escape down to Bowen only to find that the cyclone had changed its trajectory and was now travelling south so that the eye of the storm would cross directly over Bowen. But Cyclone Anthony was a very mild cyclone. The damage was limited and the next day I made my way around the town. There were trees that were blown over and some damage to property. I spoke with locals but they weathered it fairly well.
I have to say that it was nothing compared to the storm that was Cyclone Yasi, which bore down on that town and others in the electorate of Dawson. Again, I stayed in Bowen on the night that that cyclone crossed the coast. It was horrendous. The wind was nothing like I have ever experienced. There were things flying through the air that should not have been flying through the air. The next morning, when I inspected the damage I was surprised that it was not worse, given the extent of that wind. Relatively, we were spared from any major destruction. Certainly the thoughts of people in Dawson were with those who were in the thick of it—in Cardwell, Mission Beach and other communities in that area—when Yasi crossed the coast.
The images of the destruction caused by the cyclone will serve as a warning to anyone living in North Queensland that we are at the mercy of Mother Nature and we must always be prepared. There is a growing concern in my electorate that we may not have been prepared as well as we could have been. Late on the Monday night before Yasi crossed the coast many in Mackay, in the ‘brown zones’ as they call them, received a text message and automated phone call—the sort that many people receive the night before an election, I suppose, from political parties. But this message said that those in low-lying areas should be prepared to evacuate. I am not sure whether it was a good idea to send a message to people at 10 o’clock at night when the cyclone was 1,700 kilometres off the coast, but that is going to be a matter for debate when the emergency response is reviewed.
What is troubling the people in my community is that although they were told to seek higher ground and evacuate their homes there is no evacuation centre in Mackay. In fact, there is no evacuation centre in the electorate of Dawson, which is one of the hotspots for cyclones. There is none in Bowen, the Whitsundays or in the Burdekin. This is something that needs to be addressed. Evacuation centres must be built or identified because it is something that the state government identified in the aftermath of Cyclone Larry. In fact, the issue pre-dates that. The chief executive officer of Burdekin Shire Council told me the other day that he recalled former Premier Peter Beattie telling local government officials gathered at a conference in 1997 that the state government would begin a process of gathering funding for, and rolling out, cyclone shelters in the north. This has not happened.
Another matter that troubled the local community in Mackay and the Whitsundays was that there was no local ABC radio broadcast to keep locals informed of what the local situation was. It was syndicated somewhere else. This meant that locals were hearing reports from south or further north, closer to the cyclone, and not getting the relevant local information. The local ABC radio station in Mackay is only rated for a category 3 cyclone and because Cyclone Yasi was a category 5 it meant that our area received the broadcast from elsewhere, although it was quite obvious that the cyclone was not bearing down on the Mackay region. On top of the category 3 cyclone rating of the radio station building, it is also located in a flood zone. So there is some sense to what the ABC did but there could have been broadcasts from other places within the city. As the Mackay Regional Council Mayor Col Meng said, this really questions the ability of ABC to call itself the state emergency broadcaster. These are issues that will have to be addressed, hopefully by next year’s wet season and cyclone season.
Community radio stations such as SweetFM, run by David, Merle and the crew in the Burdekin, did stay on air in the thick of it, supported by other volunteers bringing in food and stuff for them. That was absolutely fantastic. Even our commercial radio stations—Scotty on Sea FM, Cliffo on Hot FM and Hammo on 4MK all did their bit to inform the local communities of what was going on.
I also want to place on record my appreciation for Mayor Col Meng and his team at Mackay Regional Council, Mayor Brunker and his team at Whitsunday Regional Council, Mayor McLaughlin and her team at Burdekin Shire Council and Mayor Les Tyrell and his team at the Townsville City Council. Their efforts over the last couple of months recovering from the record rainfall and preparing for and leading up to Cyclones Anthony and Yasi are to be commended.
As I mentioned, I spent the night that Yasi hit in Bowen. The next morning I toured Bowen and, as I said, I was very surprised at the low level of destruction, given the level of the winds the night before. I ventured north from there to inspect the towns of Home Hill and Ayr in my electorate and the suburbs of Townsville that are in my electorate. Unfortunately for me I could not get through as the Bruce Highway was cut just before Home Hill. I understand it was cut just above Brandon, as well. Basically, that blocked the whole town in.
What I saw were dozens and dozens of vehicles waiting, stranded. They belonged to people waiting to return home. They had evacuated the cyclone zone and they had to wait an entire day not knowing whether their homes were still there. They may have had loved ones that they needed to contact and could not. It was a tragic thing for me to see and there were people who were quite distressed about not being able to get back to their homes. To me, that shows that there is a definite need for Bruce Highway funding, particularly funding for flood-proofing areas, to be kept in place.
I eventually did get to the Burdekin, to the towns of Home Hill and Ayr, a day and a half later. There was enormous damage, with trees down everywhere, but the community have rallied to clean up the place. There is no extensive damage to homes. In some cases, you could put that down to divine intervention. I saw two big trees which, if they had fallen a particular way, would have basically flattened Home Hill State School or one of its buildings. Another tree, instead of falling on the kids’ play equipment, fell on a fence. It is unbelievable to see the near misses there. There were, as I said, a few victims who sustained damage to their homes, and that is tragic.
Up in Townsville, we have had the same situation—a lot of trees have been blown over. It does look like a bit of a war zone, but the council, the community and the ADF based up there have been making a tremendous effort to get Townsville back on track. I understand there are some Townsville residents who are still waiting for electricity to be connected. They have been a week without power, so I suppose things are getting a tad tedious in that regard.
There are calls to look at undergrounding power lines in the north, and that is something that the state government is going to have to focus on. I know that would be a very expensive exercise but, looking at the disruption to people’s lives and businesses and the cost to the state of the constant repairs when these things strike towns every year, there could be a cost benefit in undergrounding.
I will close by saying to the people in my electorate, and to those elsewhere in the state and the nation who have suffered loss because of the natural disasters this summer, that I join the House in offering them my sincere condolences.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"D’Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in continuation on this condolence motion. I have already spoken in this House about those lost and those left behind grieving. We also need to acknowledge those people who have lost their homes and personal belongings, and the damage that is doing to them and their lives. Such disasters can result in not just physical damage but psychological damage.
I finished yesterday saying that the best way those in this House could try to understand what it was like to be one of the people who lost their belongings was to read the writing of someone whose home and family was in the Lockyer Valley about that fateful day in January in which they convey their experience in their own words. This gentleman, a father and husband, wrote these words for me and I would like to put them on the record:
On the evening of 11th January our home was inundated by the Lockyer Creek flood. All belongings were either washed away or destroyed, the flood leaving little but the shell of our house. After a 2 day wait to access the home we were left with the soul destroying job of emptying the remaining belongings for collection and disposal. We were alone, with no resources and exhausted by stress and a lack of hope. I saw little future for my 2 children, my wife and myself.
At the point where it appeared that it could not be worse a second flood arrived. This time it wore the orange uniforms of the Gold Coast SES. Kristy Heitmann led 3 units from Southport, Carrara and Runaway Bay. Seeing the distress in the eyes of my family they insisted that we stepped back and allowed them to do all the work. Their compassion and understanding went well beyond the call of duty at a time when we were on the edge of breakdown.
Enormous effort went into searching through the wreckage for any items salvageable, items we would never have found in our state. A donation from the Gold Coast residents and Council was made of a simple clothes basket, containing towels, soap, toothbrushes, coffee and many other simple luxuries that are taken for granted in normal times. There are moments in life when even simple actions can change lives. Their timely arrival, sympathy and understanding as well as their plain hard work allowed us to stand back, reassess our situation and begin the path to recovery.
Leaving our home Kristy and her orange army went on to help many others in our area and I know they are now working in Cairns at Tully and Mission Beach helping more families, tirelessly and selflessly. I cannot imagine how many more people have been helped by them and all the volunteers involved in this disaster recovery, to the Army, State and Federal Authorities, individual volunteers and especially the SES thank you from my family.
Those words come from a man called Brett. Brett is my brother. They lost everything. But they picked themselves up and they are moving on. I cannot imagine what they went through. I have seen some of the footage. When they tried to get back to the house the first time, we saw a massive river flowing extremely fast and a roof sticking out of the middle of the river—and that was their home.
The second lot of footage showed the days after and the destruction in the home. The fridge had been lifted off the floor and was sitting sidewards on the kitchen bench, half hanging in mid-air. Belongings were taken from one side of the home to the other. There were toys in my niece’s bedroom, but they were not her toys; they were toys from some other home that had been pushed into her bedroom. They were amazing scenes. There were many sentimental items lost that day—items sentimental to our whole family. These included my mother’s ashes. But those losses mean nothing, because my brother Brett, his wife Jenny, my niece Shawnee and my nephew Robbie are safe.
We have seen a lot of good come out of this. My brother told me the story of when they turned up at the evacuation centre. They walked in looking absolutely devastated and a very large gentleman standing at the door put his hand out to my brother and said, ‘What happened to you guys?’ and my brother told him. This large gentlemen shook my brother’s hand and said, ‘You are coming home with us.’ I want to acknowledge Mick—‘Mick the truck driver’—and Shelly who have taken in my brother and his family. They offered them a place to stay for as long as they need. They bought the children new school uniforms. They did not know my family, but they put out a helping hand.
That is just one story, but there are so many stories out there. We have heard so many people, in speaking to this motion today, talk about the complete strangers who just came out to help. It was absolutely incredible. It is a sight that we have never seen in this country before. We know that in times of disaster Australians stand up and help each other. We have seen that time and time again. But I have never seen it to the extent that we saw it in January. I know that those in Central Queensland and Rockhampton, who went through those floods in December and early January, also saw that incredible spirit. We heard from the member from Capricornia that they all got together and they filled those sandbags and they protected their town and each other. It was just incredible to see.
My electorate of Petrie is one of the very fortunate electorates in Queensland that has remained relatively untouched as far as floodwaters. There was minor flash flooding here and there and a bit of damage—not to in any way take away from the damage that was received in some community sporting organisations and so forth that are still trying to recover—but we did not lose lives or homes. But I do not know of too many people who do not know someone who has been affected. My community have come out with absolute strength and have fundraised, baked, sewn, knitted and collected. They have not stopped from day 1. They have jumped on buses to help. Businesses have put backhoes on trucks and have gone into industrial areas and have helped dig mud out to help other businesses and homes. It has been incredible. As I said, I think my diary is full of fundraising events coming up. I do not know when it is going to stop.
I spoke to a lovely lady recently. She is a pensioner in one of our local retirement villages. She rang after the government mentioned the flood levy. She wanted to know how long the Premier’s flood relief fund was going to go for because, as a pensioner, she will not be paying the levy and she wanted to know how she could donate $20 a month for the next 12 months so that she could do her share. She was very worried that the Premier’s fund might not continue for 12 months and wanted to know how she could get this money to us because she could not pay it all at once and needed to pay it monthly. I am sure that there are many, many people out there like that who are helping.
One area that has been talked about a bit—certainly by the member for Blair and some of the other members whose electorates have been significantly affected—is our schools and how many schools have been affected. I thought that this was one area where I could help in my electorate by gathering our schools together and helping them—and they were eager to help—to make sure that what they were fundraising was getting to the right schools and that we were getting the right stuff to the right schools. We have heard from some members that sometimes our hearts lead our generosity. We race out and donate clothes, fridges and everything else but we need to stop and say, ‘Is this what they need?’ They may already have five fridges, but they might need some clothes, a bed or something else. We need to make sure that our generosity is matching the needs in the community.
I started with a list of 120 schools that were impacted by the floods and we now have it down to about 50 schools that still need assistance. We are matching up schools; they are adopting each other. They are doing fundraising and the kids are becoming pen pals and building those personal connections. I will talk in much more detail at another time in this chamber about the schools and how they are progressing in that program, but I would like to acknowledge some schools now. Aspley East State School has adopted Ipswich East State School. Ipswich East State School has 580 students. One-third of those students have lost their homes. In addition, the Ipswich East State School was significantly damaged. Water went through their science room, their special education room and their music room. The whole of the outside-school-hours care, which is run by the P&C, has lost absolutely everything.
Aspley East State School, which has adopted Ipswich East State School, did a ‘free dress, gold coin’ donation the other day, where a teacher did a chalk mural on the ground that showed the Brisbane River and the mountains all the way through to the city and then out to Moreton Bay and coins were laid on the lines of the mural. They raised $1,329 that day. I know Ipswich East State School is very grateful for that. A local individual from my electorate, Terry Skinner, rang me up after hearing Ipswich East State School’s story and he is donating an electric piano, which we are dropping down there next week. The music teacher is very grateful for that wonderful donation by Terry.
St Paul’s School, after seeing the list of schools, said they could not just adopt one. They adopted Arcadia Valley State School, two hours north of Roma. It is a little school that probably no-one has ever heard of—it has only five students. The principal only moved to the school this year. His home has been flooded out. He is living in a shed with his wife while it gets repaired. The principal is also the groundsman, as would be the case in most very small schools. His wife is the cleaner for the school. The water went through the one and only classroom. They have lost their early learning childhood books and toys for the kids—the box of Lego is gone—and those sorts of things. St Paul’s School of Bald Hills has adopted this school. They have donated $1,000. It is a permanent adoption and they will be doing a lot more for them. They have also given a financial donation to Brassall State School, which we heard about yesterday. This school was significantly damaged. They have one phone line now and the internet connection is very poor, so they are hard to get through to. They will get $2,500. St Paul’s has also adopted Milpera State High School, which predominantly takes new refugee migrants. They have given them $6½ thousand to begin with and will be doing a lot more work for them.
These are just some of the stories. Bounty Boulevard State School, Deception Bay North State School, Grace Lutheran Primary School, the Lakes College and Taigum State School have all put their hands up and said ‘Yes, we want to adopt and help these other schools.’
Unfortunately, just as I was finalising the list of the schools that still need help from the floods, I got the new list of schools that have been affected by Cyclone Yasi. That is a long list, including Tully school which needs to be bulldozed and rebuilt. So there are many schools that are damaged because of the cyclone as well and we will endeavour to help them.
Our hearts go out to all the people who have been affected by these floods and the cyclone. I know the members for Blair, Oxley and Wright have worked extremely hard. It has been devastating for them to see the effect on their communities and the lives lost, but these members are working day in and day out to help rebuild them. I am sure their communities would not mind if I spoke on their behalf to say thankyou to those federal members for what they are doing for their communities. I echo the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in the debate on this condolence motion. It has been a difficult time for Queensland, it will continue to be a difficult time in the reconstruction, but the Australian people are strong and resilient. They are kind and compassionate. They will rebuild their lives and they will do it with our help.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"O’Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—At the outset of my contribution to the debate on this condolence motion on the natural disasters, I acknowledge the very moving speech by the member for Petrie and also the speech before her by the member for Dawson. We in this House cannot be anything but moved when we hear the personal stories that have been so eloquently told to us in this place.
I join with my colleagues on both sides of the House and the crossbenches to add my condolences, along with those of the people of Higgins, to the people whose lives will be forever scarred by these disasters.
The past two months have been a most extraordinary period for Australia, one which we will never forget and hope never to relive.
While the floods, cyclones and fires have directly affected communities in the states of Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, all Australians, regardless of where they live, mourn their loss, understand their pain, pay tribute to their courage and celebrate the uniqueness and generosity of the Australian spirit—a fighting spirit that will not be broken, no matter how hard Mother Nature may try.
We have been in awe of the events that have hit both our cities and our regions and, like all disasters, they have been totally arbitrary in where and who they strike.
This motion was originally intended as a condolence motion for those affected by the floods and Cyclone Yasi in Queensland and Victoria; yet, even while the clean-up continues in those states and the reconstruction commences, only this week we hear of more homes lost to bushfires in Western Australia. We also offer our sympathy and support to them, and I am sure the member for Pearce will speak of this later.
I particularly acknowledge the tragedy of 35 lives lost. So many of us were moved to tears listening to Scotty Buchholz, the member for Wright, as he spoke of the people in his community who did not make it. Words do not do justice to the unimaginable grief that their families, friends and colleagues must be experiencing. What these tragedies have proved is that we are a united people and our sense of who we are is not determined by state boundaries. We have pulled together for a common cause: to help rebuild communities in disparate regions of our continent, even those regions separated by great distance.
It was the pre-eminent historian Geoffrey Blainey who referred to the ‘tyranny of distance’ as a defining feature of Australia’s history and a constant obstacle to our development. With Federation, we made our first concerted attempt to overcome this obstacle. Since that time our identity has only become stronger. While we may live great distances from one another, our generosity is not confined to such geographical limitations, nor is our sense of nationhood diminished. This is most evident during tragedies such as these.
The charity we have observed from our fellow Australians, and the mindfulness they have shown towards those who are suffering and destitute, has been inspiring. If there is any comfort to be found in these horrible events it is that Australians have confirmed their commitment to one another in the most spectacular way. The images we have seen on our televisions, and the stories we have read in newspapers and heard in this House, tell of large-scale suffering and loss but also of courage and kindness. It is a testament to the will and endurance of Australians that those affected have dealt with this situation with such grace.
The fallout from these disasters is immense. It is not just the lives lost, but the permanent setbacks so many now face as they struggle to rebuild their lives. Businesses have suffered, workers have suffered, and basic goods and services are in scarce supply, forcing up the cost of living. Economic recovery will be a slow process, and for many it will be years before they can rebuild their lives.
On 7 February Victoria commemorated the second anniversary of the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, during which a horrific 173 people were killed. While much of the infrastructure building has been completed, the task of rebuilding lives is ongoing. This will be true of the floods as well.
I want to offer my sympathy and condolences to those in my home state of Victoria who have been affected by the floods that struck the western and central areas of our state. It is incredibly lucky, and due in no small measure to the work of emergency services and volunteers, that there were no fatalities in Victoria. Yet recovery is no less difficult for those whose livelihoods have been wiped away. The damage caused to property, as well as to vital infrastructure and amenities, has been significant. In particular we offer our sympathy to the people of Kerang, Horsham, Pyramid Hill, Quambatook, Allansford, Wycheproof, Panmure and Culgoa, who were the hardest hit by the flooding. We are inspired by their courage and fortitude in the face of such widespread destruction.
Although the events in Queensland meant that the floods in Victoria were not given as much airtime, it is important for the nation to reflect upon the many personal stories in the south as well as in the north.
We are grateful to our state emergency service volunteers, police and emergency workers for the remarkable job they have done and we thank them. Their dedication and year-round training ensure that our state is prepared for these terrible events. The losses incurred would undoubtedly have been much higher were it not for their efforts.
We thank the many Australians, including so many from my own electorate of Higgins, for their generosity in donating money and goods to their fellow Australians and for their willingness to help. It will be a long road to recovery. To all those people who are being touched by these disasters our prayers are with you, as is our support. You must know that you are not alone.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I rise to speak in support of the Prime Minister’s condolence motion on the natural disasters which have occurred over the summer. On 16 January this year I spoke at an ecumenical service that was pulled together by Father Kevin Dillon in Geelong. I thank Father Kevin Dillon for pulling together that service, which I think was an important occasion for the people of Geelong to express their grief and their solidarity with the people of Queensland and, of course, a growing number of people in Victoria.
During the ecumenical service, I spoke of a story which had been reported in the Courier Mail and referred to in the Prime Minister’s contribution on this motion earlier this week. It was the story of a young pregnant woman who was swept from her home by the wall of water in Grantham. As she was swept away she was able to grab hold of a downpipe while holding onto her young baby, but from there she lost her grip and was swept to a nearby railway line where her foot was caught by a sleeper. And from there she was literally in a struggle against the force of nature, a struggle which she could not win. Her baby was torn from her arms, and it is thought that her baby is the youngest victim of these terrible floods. She herself would have been a victim but for the fact that a few minutes later she was saved by a helicopter pilot whose story also featured in the Prime Minister’s contribution on this motion.
You can look at all these statistics, as terrible as they are, around this tragedy. Almost all of Queensland was affected, more than 10,000 people were evacuated and more than 30,000 homes were affected. There were record flood levels in Victoria. I echo the comment by the member for Higgins that some of the events and stories that have occurred in Victoria have not received the same airplay given to the events that occurred in Queensland. But there are enormous difficulties being experienced by people in parts of Victoria associated with these floods. Indeed, within my own region, in the Barwon area there were 500 calls made to the SES associated with local flooding. Of course, in our region it was nothing like it was in other parts of Australia.
You can look at all of that, and you can look at the 35 people who have lost their lives. But to truly understand the significance of these floods, you have to think of that young woman who a month ago held her baby safely in her arms but is now faced with an unimaginable pain for the rest of her life. Whilst this was a moment of incredible tragedy, it was also a story of tremendous courage. That helicopter pilot I mentioned, Mark Kempton, and his crew plucked 28 people from the raging waters. I am sure that many of their lives were saved by the actions of Mark Kempton and his crew.
You can look at the selfless actions of Pauline Magner, who perished in these floods in Grantham but, it is thought, in the process was able to put her grandson Jacob in a position of relative safety within their house such that Jacob was able to survive the floods and is alive today. You can look at the courage of Rob and Jim Wilkin, again from Grantham, who saw this unprecedented wall of water coming towards them. They had the opportunity there and then to get to higher ground themselves but in that moment decided instead to take the time to warn their neighbours about what was coming and to get them out so that they could reach higher ground as well. When the wall of water came through they then got in their boat and managed to pluck a number of other people from the torrent. It is thought that their actions, in the space of just a few moments, were the difference between life and death for another 16 people. And, of course, you can look at the amazing story of Jordan Rice, which has been spoken of by many people in this debate. He asked rescuers to save his younger brother first but, unfortunately, they were unable to save Jordan.
This is also an extraordinary story of Australians pulling together in a really tough time. The number of volunteers who put their hands up to help in the clean-up and rebuilding of Queensland in the immediate aftermath of the floods was truly amazing. Tens of thousands of people registered to provide their assistance in the clean-up. In the days immediately after the floods went through Brisbane, we were all struck by the visions on the television of queues in excess of one kilometre long of people registering to volunteer to help clean up. Of course, across the nation, in a very short period of time indeed, $180 million has been raised by ordinary Australians to help their fellow Australians in a really difficult time of need.
In all of this, one group, from my electorate, have not had their story told and I would like to spend a moment describing their contribution in the last few months. Centrelink’s emergency call centre in Geelong is our country’s only 24 hours a day, seven days a week emergency call centre operated by the Commonwealth. I was glad to see that the Minister for Human Services in her contribution to this debate specifically mentioned this call centre. As it happens, the call centre is located just around the corner from my electorate office in the centre of Geelong and it is designed to be the first to go into action when natural disasters such as bushfires and floods occur. It gives the Australian government an immediate response capacity, not to replace 000 calls but to offer information on evacuation options and recovery plans, to deal with requests for financial assistance and to cope with the overflow of calls being made to state and local emergency services.
One can imagine that these are very difficult calls to deal with. In my time I have had a bit to do with call centre workers and I think it is hard to imagine more difficult calls to have to deal with than those coming into Centrelink’s Geelong emergency call centre in recent times. These calls would be emotionally taxing and would have to be handled with the utmost sensitivity and professionalism.
During the floods, more than 100,000 calls were made to Centrelink’s Geelong emergency call centre. They included calls from people who had lost their homes or businesses and people who were unable to locate their families and friends. Four teams of 10 people worked rotating 12-hour shifts in the call centre and it was in constant operation during this crisis. So I would like to place on the record the appreciation of the Australian people for the work of the staff of this call centre. They did great work for their country and they certainly made their community very proud. Today it is my honour to acknowledge them as being part of the local Geelong contribution to the events of the last month or so.
Many emotions are felt in the context of natural disasters. We feel an enormous sense of grief for those who have perished, and today during this debate we think of their families and friends. We stand in solidarity with all of those Australians who have been affected by these natural disasters. We let them know, as the member for Higgins stated in her contribution, that they are most definitely not alone. I think it is also appropriate that, as a result of this crisis, Australians feel a quiet sense of pride in the amazing coming together of the community and the nation. People really pulled together as one, in the most Australian way, in the most difficult of times.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—With the advent of the 2011 new year came floods, fires, cyclones and storms across the country. The ferocity of these events and the damage they wrought over several states shocked and distressed many. I think there was hardly a dry eye in this House when the member for Wright shared with us the grief of his community, which perhaps sustained the greatest loss of life. We understand their pain, as my colleague the member for Higgins said, and we pay tribute to their courage. We have been touched by other accounts in the media and in this place of the acts of heroism and the generosity of spirit of the Australia community. From beyond our shores have come messages of support and comfort.
In dozens of evacuation, recovery or disaster control centres, from Grantham and Murphys Creek to Emerald, to Rochester, to Echuca, to Grafton or the Brisbane showgrounds, thousands of people, mostly volunteers, have been striving around the clock to help Australians who have suffered terrible loss. In places such as Toowoomba, Bundaberg, Dalby, Horsham and Dadswels Bridge, people devastated by the loss of homes and businesses have been buoyed by the support they have had from good Samaritans who turned up when they were needed most. Battalions of people, including my friend and former colleague the former member for Riverina, the Hon. Kay Hull, were cleaning out homes and shops as soon as the floodwaters had sufficiently receded. Most had no special connection but they had come in their dozens with broom, mop, shovel and sometimes gurneys and even bobcats and trucks to lend a hand and to make a difference. It was a time, as someone observed, that we experienced the ‘worst from Mother Nature but the best from human nature’.
The devastating floods are a sobering reminder of our vulnerability to unforeseen events. We have become accustomed, regrettably and unfortunately, to natural disasters that occur every year, whether they be bushfires or cyclones, floods or drought. In my home state of Western Australia, following on from the disastrous fires that burned so many homes in Toodyay on the eve of the new year in 2009, we again experienced, this year—just over a week ago—a freak storm in the Avon and terrible bushfires, while recovery efforts continued following floods in Carnarvon and the Gascoyne River in the electorate of Durack.
Emergency services across Australia have been stretched, and I would like to comment, as others have done, on the extraordinary effort made by these extraordinary people who conducted the search, rescue and recovery effort across Australia. Our emergency crews performed magnificently. This fact was brought sharply into focus again when cyclonic winds devastated part of my own electorate of Pearce. The towns of York, Northam, Toodyay and Beverley were all hit on 29 January by winds that ripped the roofs off houses, felled powerlines and trees and left much of the Avon region without power for several days, and were responsible for the death of a local identity.
I am very grateful to the President of the Shire of York, Mr Pat Hooper, and the President of the Shire of Northam, Mr Steve Pollard, for the briefing on recovery efforts they gave me, and in particular to York shire chief executive officer Ray Hooper and to President Pollard for making time to assist me with a visit to many of the damaged properties and town infrastructure, including the Avondale Primary School in Northam. My thoughts are with those families and businesses and with the many elderly people who were particularly affected, and those who have sustained severe damage. For one family I visited, almost the entire roof had been ripped off their house and the beams of the roof snapped like matchsticks. The children were terrified and traumatised to the extent that they did not want to go back inside the house. So it will take time—many months indeed—to restore their homes and the business premises, and I wish them a speedy recovery. But, above all, for all of those who are victims of these catastrophic events, it is usually once the initial requirements have been attended to that much later on reaction sets in—and I know that with the Toodyay fires it was some months afterwards that the depression and sadness set in. This is the time when people need our continuing support, assistance and grief counselling.
I want to record my admiration and thanks for the tremendous work done in my electorate by FESA, especially incident controller Paul Leiper, to Julie and her team from DCP, the local police, the York Health Services and Centrelink, who once again performed speedily and magnificently. There was also the York Country Women’s Association, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross and the many individuals who responded to that particular crisis. The speedy declaration of the national disaster and the support offered by Premier Barnett and the Western Australian government was very much appreciated. I was grateful also for the timely advice and assistance from the federal Attorney-General, the member for Barton, who provided information for the affected area.
Just weeks after these storms, Pearce and the neighbouring electorate of Canning were hit by severe bushfires, the horrific images of which I am sure many of you have seen. In Pearce, approximately 1,170 hectares has been burnt throughout the areas of Brigadoon, Baskerville, Millendon, Red Hill and Herne Hill, and some parts of the Shire of Chittering. But I am very pleased that on this occasion no houses were lost. Nevertheless, many people were required to evacuate their homes and to endure a very anxious wait.
The risk of bushfires is a constant concern to people living in many parts of the Pearce electorate and almost every summer there is a serious incident. The people of Pearce understand the threat and they can sympathise with the people of Roleystone and Kelmscott as they face the terrible loss of property from the recent fire. I am sure that residents of Pearce would join me in wishing the people of Canning a speedy recovery from their heartbreaking losses.
From speaking to my parliamentary colleagues in Queensland in the days following the floods, I know that they have also seen the emergency services putting in similarly extraordinary efforts to those I have witnessed in my own electorate. There is little doubt that a highly professional response to the initial emergency saved many lives and provided effective support to many thousands of victims. The challenge will be maintaining that ‘can-do’ attitude after most of the volunteers have gone home, when residences are still uninhabitable, the railway lines are still out and the legalism is beginning to trump common sense.
However, the emergency services personnel who put their lives at risk, the residents who faced disaster without panic and their loss with brave spirits, the volunteers who pitched in without being asked or told to help are representative of Australians at their best. It is important not just for us as a country but for those people in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, and particularly in the Durack, Pearce and Canning electorates, whose lives have been irrevocably changed by catastrophic events well beyond their control.
My staff and I extend our best wishes for the recovery effort and we stand ready to assist our colleagues in any way that we can.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—We have begun yet another parliamentary year with the spectre of tragedy and a pall of grief hanging over our deliberations. Only two years ago we stood in this place reflecting on the devastation of the Black Saturday fires. With those tragic stories still in our minds, we now confront the destruction wreaked by floods and fires across this nation. The natural disasters of the summer, particularly in Queensland, northern New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, have underlined both the harsh brutality of the Australian landscape and the inherent compassion and generosity of the Australian people. Even for those communities who were far removed from the events in Queensland and the other regions that were most badly affected by flood and fire, these were disasters that struck a blow at all of us as a nation.
Like most Australians I watched as great swathes of Queensland and Victoria were submerged by floodwaters, and we have seen homes burn in Western Australia. I heard the stories of those who did not survive or those whose loved ones were swept away or lost to fire. It has been a summer of extraordinary catastrophes that seemed to cascade one on top of the other, and with each expression of natural force came more homes, more property, more businesses destroyed, more lives lost. The tragedies of this summer will linger in our collective memories for many decades to come. For those who lived and survived these tragedies I can barely begin to imagine the horror that they have faced or the dark days that are still to come.
I take this opportunity to acknowledge the many fine contributions to this condolence motion. In particular I wish to acknowledge those members who have spoken with such force about their own personal circumstances, who have spoken with force about the impact of these natural disasters on their communities. It is in moments such as these that we see the great power of representative democracy, where individuals can come forward and not just advocate for the interests or the demands of the communities that they represent but reflect and amplify the feeling, the loss, the suffering, but also the hope, of their communities.
I can stand here today with the great fortune of not having been personally affected by these tragedies but, as I said earlier, I think as Australians we have all been greatly affected by what we have seen. But I do stand here today to ensure that it is recorded in the Hansard that the people of my community, in the Lindsay electorate, wish to acknowledge that they too grieve and wish to show their compassion and empathy towards those who have been affected by these events. My community is divided by the mighty Nepean River, part of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment. With the Nepean River running through the heart of our electorate, ours is a community that is no stranger to flooding; indeed, much of the electorate of Lindsay is located on the flood plain. I have no doubt that that is in the minds of those locals who remember the flood events our community has experienced in the past and that is why so many members of my community have mobilised to contribute, to raise funds and to show their expressions of support for those who have been affected by these natural events.
I wish to take a few moments now to record just a few examples of some of the individuals and groups in my community that have made a contribution to the collective national fundraising effort and to the collective national effort of extending sympathy and assistance to those in need. I wish to acknowledge the 10 Penrith Panthers players who travelled to Ipswich to help out with the recovery. Captain Petero Civoniceva has a special connection with Ipswich, having played as a junior in the district. He told our local paper, the Penrith Press:
I just don’t think the vision of the floods we saw on television gave it justice. It was just utter devastation and for two days we helped people in any way we could. We just moved from house to house offering our help, and ended up with shovels and wheelbarrows on the first day and knocking out gyprock walls and ceilings on the other.
It just really made me think if this had happened to me what I would do.
I think that for Australians, as we spent summer, the time that so many of us enjoy spending with our families, as we looked on, that was a question we all asked ourselves: ‘What would I do if this happened to me?’
I also wish to acknowledge local entertainers who teamed up with the many clubs, pubs and restaurants in my local community that hosted and held fundraising events, some of which included the Penrith Paceway, the Penrith RSL and the Log Cabin. I also acknowledge the Red Cross volunteers in my local community who have worked tirelessly to raise funds for the relief effort. In particular, I acknowledge those women who were involved on Australia Day, battling what was oppressive heat in Penrith, out at the Penrith Lakes walking around with their tins, raising money for this cause. I acknowledge our local Bunnings stores who, through their barbecue stalls and donations from customers, raised more than $8,000 for the Premier’s flood appeal.
I acknowledge a local small-business person, Rob Gibson. I know that there are many others, but I record his contribution to also recognise the efforts of those who have equally made such a contribution. Rob Gibson, who runs a business, CleanOff High Pressure Service, spent a week helping to clean homes in Queensland that had been affected by the floods. Now, having done that, he is donating 10 per cent of the proceeds from all of the jobs that he completes until the end of March to the flood appeal.
I acknowledge the Penrith City Council, which has offered technical assistance to a number of the Queensland local government authorities. Those authorities are under enormous strain at the moment and are trying to continue to deliver the very basic services that communities affected require. I know that nine of our local SES volunteers have also travelled to flood and cyclone affected areas in Queensland to lend their expertise.
Last Sunday I attended a fundraising relief concert held at the Blacktown Bowman Hall organised by the New South Wales Philippine Community Council. I know many local residents were in attendance at that event and I understand that, in total, approximately $20,000 was raised at that event. It struck me that many people who were involved in that concert from the local community that were of Filipino background showed a particular empathy having come from a country that faces many of these natural disasters and has done so on a great scale in recent times as well. I acknowledge their contribution as Australians of Filipino background towards the relief effort.
These are just a few examples, and I know that there are so many more in my community, but I wanted to record them to ensure that it is known that our community stands side by side with those other communities who are now seeking to rebuild themselves out of the debris that these natural disasters have left behind.
I thank all of these people and acknowledge the efforts they have contributed in their time, their strength and their money. I know there are also many people in our community who have prayed for those who have been affected by these natural disasters.
Many communities have been wiped out physically by these natural disasters, but the spirit that binds those communities remains. I believe it is out of this spirit that we as a nation, determined to demonstrate our resilience, our compassion and our mateship, will begin the process of helping those in these affected communities to rebuild the infrastructure that they need and to rebuild their communities.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—I commend the contribution by the member for Lindsay to this debate on the condolence motion on the natural disasters. From time to time, we experience significant events that become etched into our national memory. The flash flood that ripped through Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley on 10 January 2011 was such an event. The torrent was so unexpected in its arrival, so brutal in its power and so terrible in its destruction that we will remember it forever.
In the days that followed that terrible event, Australians watched the crisis unfold as floodwaters spread from the mountains down towards Brisbane. We watched as homes and businesses were flooded. We watched as businesses were literally washed down the river and smashed against bridges. We watched as a tug boat operator carefully guided huge chunks of debris past bridges and wharves to the relative safety of Moreton Bay. We will never forget those images.
Every Australian will remember the floods in a different way, but we all share deep and heartfelt sympathy for those who have lost loved ones, homes and businesses. And our sympathy extends to those Australians who have suffered through Cyclone Yasi and the Brisbane floods as well as the flooding in Central Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and the bushfires in Western Australia.
In the face of these extraordinary natural disasters, Australians have demonstrated extraordinary resilience, courage and generosity. While the floodwaters roared through Toowoomba, brave emergency crews and bystanders plucked stranded motorists from their cars and saved people desperately clinging to trees and debris. Sadly, one hero, teenager Jordan Rice, made the ultimate sacrifice—losing his own life after insisting that his younger brother be rescued first. By the time his rescuers returned, Jordan was gone. Once the water began to recede, Australians responded by giving millions of dollars to the Premier’s flood appeal and by arriving in Brisbane by their thousands to help with the clean-up.
In my electorate, numerous local clubs, pubs, community groups, churches and individuals have held fundraisers and made substantial donations to the flood victims. Entertainers have donated their services to help at fundraising events. Local performing arts groups have held a variety show and raised thousands to support the flood appeal. Rotary clubs throughout the mid-North Coast region have been working to raise money and provide emergency assistance.
In Brisbane, thousands of Aussies arrived at volunteering centres. Some even drove from Sydney to help. Armed with shovels, mops and gum boots, they set off to spend a day helping total strangers clean mud and debris from their homes and businesses. Australians can truly be proud of the way they responded to the flood crisis.
Although spoken over 300 years ago, the words of French moralist Bruyere describe perfectly the response of the Australian public to the flood crisis when he said:
There exist some evils so terrible and some misfortunes so horrible that we dare not think of them, whilst their very aspect makes us shudder; but if they happen to fall on us, we find ourselves stronger than we imagined, we grapple with our ill luck, and behave better than we expected we should.
The floods in Toowoomba and Brisbane reminded us of the awesome power of nature, but they also reminded us that Australians can be counted on to help when disaster strikes.
In my own electorate of Cowper we did not escape unscathed from the flooding, with much of the Clarence Valley experiencing significant inundation. The towns of Ulmarra and Maclean, Minnie Water and Wooli were isolated for some days. We saw inundation in areas around these towns but, fortunately, the levee system held to prevent major damage to these centres. Unfortunately, many local farmers and business owners have experienced significant disruption and damage as a result of this flooding.
The Leader of the Opposition was kind enough to visit the region and he saw firsthand the impact that these floods had on local businesses and particularly on primary producers in the area. In particular, we saw significant destruction of the local sugarcane crop, with a loss of new plantings and young crops, which will certainly manifest itself in a very low yield in around 2012, when the crop for that year should be down by as much as 50 per cent. Our local fishing industry suffered badly. Having suffered difficulties in recent years, these latest floods set the industry back further. Local dairy farmers also suffered the impact of this local disaster.
It is worth noting that almost every corner of my electorate has been affected by flooding at some stage in the past two years—from the Macleay valley in the south through the Nambucca and Bellinger valleys, Coffs Harbour, the Orara Valley and of course the Clarence valley. Natural disasters have become an expected part of life on the mid-North Coast. But, despite the fact that we expect floods to come, the damage is never easy to repair and the lost wages and income are gone forever.
One aspect of natural disasters that is often overlooked is the impact of infrastructure damage on local councils. Local councils are responsible for most of the roads, bridges, footpaths, sewerage systems, drainage and other local facilities. At the best of times, councils struggle to pay for the maintenance and repair of these facilities. When natural disasters strike, finding the money to pay for reconstruction and repairs is almost impossible. Even with Commonwealth and state government assistance, some important local infrastructure simply cannot be properly repaired within a reasonable time frame, if at all. Damaged in the devastating floods in 2009 in my electorate, some rural bridges and roads have only just been reconstructed, and at least one important regional road link is not yet fully repaired. These local pieces of infrastructure are vital to regional communities, and the reconstruction task force in Queensland must ensure that local councils have sufficient resources to quickly repair and rebuild the roads, bridges and other facilities damaged by the floods.
The scale of the natural disasters that we have experienced in the past few months is unprecedented. Seventy-five per cent of Queensland is a declared natural disaster area. Much of northern New South Wales has been declared a natural disaster area, plus areas of western New South Wales that perhaps will not see flood peaks until late March. Victoria has suffered through widespread floods. Western Australia, as I have said, is struggling with bushfires.
In the face of these daunting challenges, Australians have shown the world that we will not be defeated. No matter what nature throws at us, we will rebuild. We will help our mates through tough times. We will come back bigger and stronger than ever. On behalf of my electorate, I would like to make it clear to the people of Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales that we feel your pain, we will support you through these most difficult times and we will be there to help in the future.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—The sheer scale of the natural disasters that have affected so many parts of Australia but most particularly Queensland is, quite simply, unparalleled. Floods, cyclones and fires have all done their utmost to wreak far too much havoc across the nation. We know that three-quarters of Queensland has been declared a disaster zone, but I want to make it clear today that the effects, the grief, the shock and the empathy have been felt far, far more widely than that. Like all Australians, my thoughts remain with those who have lost so much in these tragedies—those who are still dealing with the daily grief of having lost family members or friends and the thousands who have suffered shattering effects. Across Queensland, people are already starting the mammoth task of cleaning their properties and reconstructing their homes, businesses and lives. I stand here today to assure them that they will not do so alone.
Whilst in Adelaide we may be far, geographically, from the devastation of the floods, in all other senses we have been right there. We have felt the pain, we have grieved the loss and we have resolved to rebuild alongside our fellow Australians. I rose to speak in the chamber today because I wanted to highlight to those affected the truly remarkable and generous solidarity that I have witnessed in the community that I am lucky enough to represent in this place. The overwhelming message that we send you is to reassure you that we will stand with you in your time of need. I also wanted to place on record my gratitude to those who have stood up as local heroes within the portfolios that I represent and the fact that we will use these portfolios to help ease the recovery process and help the long process of rebuilding.
I cannot explain the generosity that I have witnessed firsthand in my local community. Like so many other members in this place, my office and I have worked hard to assist with fundraising. Standing outside various shopping centres with a bucket in my arms, I cannot tell you the number of times that total strangers who were walking past placed money—in some cases loose coins and in many cases the last note out of their wallet—in that basket whilst remarking: ‘I have already given, but I can’t forget those pictures. I can’t forget the images, the stories I’ve heard, and I’m more than happy to give again.’ We kept hearing this, time and again, in all different parts of the electorate. We heard it from people who had a lot but also from people who had very little but who were more than willing to donate that little.
There were a group of dedicated Adelaidians who organised, wrote, directed and pulled together a charity ‘SA 4 QLD’ pantomime within just a week or so. I must say that the embarrassment and humiliation that I personally felt by taking part in said pantomime was well worth the over $100,000 that was raised in that one night by that one group of South Australians.
My electorate office has become a collection point for the Shoe Boxes of Love initiative, with over 200 shoeboxes being donated from across South Australia. People are bringing these boxes to do anything and give anything that they can to help the pain of total strangers on the absolute other side of our continent. So, to those of you who are affected, I can say with absolute confidence that you are not alone, and the people of Adelaide most certainly stand right with you.
Just as the community will not walk away from the recovery task, neither will the government. Over the previous weeks we have heard some amazing stories of courage. We have heard of some remarkable heroes—from the rescuers, from the SES personnel, from the Army and from a whole range of different service organisations—but there are also thousands and thousands of untold stories of local heroes, of people doing small things within their community and standing up and being counted when it really mattered. I think it is really important that we hear some of these stories too. I would like to take a little bit of time to share with you some of the stories of courage and generosity that I have been lucky to hear from within the portfolios of child care and employment services as well as to inform the parliament what we will be doing in those portfolios to assist with the recovery.
On the days when the floodwaters were at their highest there were a number of instances throughout Queensland of parents physically not being able to collect their children from child care because of localised flooding. One can only imagine when going through these sorts of ordeals how much harder it gets knowing that you cannot be there with your young child during what is a terrifying experience for you both. One such case was at the long day care centre at Withcott. It had become completely isolated. The centre could not be reached by parents; the children could not be reached by their parents. That was on the first night.
That evening staff members went above and beyond the usual call of duty, caring for five very anxious and very scared little people throughout the night because they could not be with their parents. Although I would expect nothing less from the hardworking and dedicated early childhood care staff throughout this country—we are so lucky to have them—this was obviously a particularly difficult day on the job. It was handled with the utmost calm and professionalism. It was done without expectation of thanks or recognition. Today I give credit to the staff members of the Withcott Early Childhood Centre for that extraordinary contribution.
Some 21 Queensland long day care centres have been identified as having significant flood damage that will require medium and in some cases longer term remediation. Nine outside school hours care services have been affected seriously, with most of these services located on the grounds of local primary schools. In addition, 36 family day care services have been affected by floodwaters. Significant damage has occurred in at least 17 of these cases. You can only imagine the double tragedy of losing your house and your business in the same go, because of course that is where they work from.
Many more childcare services have been both directly and indirectly affected. In the case of these services the damage means so much more than a badly damaged building. It means challenges for families in finding alternative care arrangements for their children. It means the loss of a business, which in some cases provides the income for an entire family. It means children losing a home away from home, one which they have formed a personal attachment to and become comfortable in.
There are some remarkably heart-warming responses from local communities, giving all they can to help affected childcare services. In addition to government support to get these centres repaired and back up and running, there has been a tremendous response from communities right across Queensland. The Riverhills Childcare Centre and Kindergarten suffered major flood damage. After the inundation, a volunteer who had come to the area to assist in the clean-up saw the damage and reported it to their church and then arranged for members of that church to become involved. Pretty soon there were over 100 volunteers involved in the clean-up and in donating toys and books so that the centre could recommence operation.
The church assisted in getting the service up and running. They are now planning the next steps of the rebuild. While the children are currently in alternative care and the rebuild will take some time, all associated with this service are determined to get it up and running as soon as possible. A huge amount of progress has been made as a result of the local contributions. The walls are already going up on the rebuild.
Like those communities, the Australian government has acted to provide immediate assistance to childcare services and families using child care in flood affected communities. Measures under local emergency provisions have included providing favourable treatment for absences of care or due to service closure. This decision alone has allowed families and childcare services to access an additional $12.4 million in childcare benefit fee relief just during this emergency period.
Families experiencing financial hardship as a result of the flood disaster have also been able to more readily access the special childcare benefit, which covers the full cost of child care. As at 30 January 2011, around $1.1 million in special childcare benefit entitlements had been provided to affected families. Rules relating to operational subsidies will also be relaxed for eligible childcare services under the Community Support Program to smooth out potential decreases in funding where fewer children have been placed in child care during the emergency period.
As in child care, we will ensure that within employment services we step up to look out for those fellow Australians who have been affected. As always, it is the case with large-scale disasters that those who are hardest hit are often those who can least afford it. There are more than 73,000 unemployed Queenslanders living in flood affected areas and their resources to cope have been sorely tested over the past weeks. I wish to assure the people of Queensland, and indeed all Australians, that all the necessary assistance has been provided to these job seekers and to the employment services that support them.
To ensure that much needed income support has continued to flow to job seekers who have been affected by the floods, Centrelink has implemented a number of measures. Flood affected job seekers are eligible for an exemption of up to 13 weeks from their usual participation and job search requirements. This means that those who have been hardest hit will continue to receive payments from the government without having to actively look for work or take a job if one is offered when they are working on their own rebuild and putting their lives back together. It will allow these individuals to concentrate on rebuilding their lives and supporting their family through the difficult time in the immediate aftermath of the flooding. Activity and personal contact interview rules have also been relaxed, and Centrelink staff have been asked to review any penalty decisions that were made immediately prior to the floods.
Of course, it is not just job seekers who have been affected as a result of the floods but also the hardworking staff who provide job services to the unemployed in these areas. There were 26 employment service providers across 112 sites that were impacted as a result of flooding in Queensland. To put this in context, those services were working directly with over 29,792 job seekers. Fortunately, once the floodwaters had receded and the necessary clean-up and repairs were completed, the majority of employment services were able to reopen and, in the spirit that characterises so many of the hardworking individuals who provide these support services, many immediately applied their minds, their money and their materials to ways that they could help their communities to recover.
One service provider, Mission Australia, established a temporary call centre to assist Volunteering Queensland to manage the many calls from the public wishing to volunteer for flood recovery tasks. Mission Australia volunteers handled over 1,000 calls on behalf of Volunteering Queensland. There was a clear need, and the agency used its organisational capacity and facilities to provide the rapid response that was required.
I should also add that it was not just employment service providers that were willing to pitch in. There were local job service providers who were inundated with calls from their clients asking for advice on how they could come and help, on how they could assist. Job seekers have assisted—whilst being under no formal obligation to do so and in receipt of no remuneration to do so—with cleaning, land clearing and fence repairs.
There have been countless stories, right across Queensland, of people stepping up when the community required them to do so. I want to put on the record just how proud of and grateful for all of those efforts I am.
Obviously, the reconstruction and recovery phase has begun and I believe that in the weeks and months ahead Queenslanders and other Australians will be well served by our employment services. Their priority will be for locals to secure the jobs that will flow during the next phase.
However, we also have to be realistic. The loss of housing and infrastructure, much of it essential to those local economies, has been absolutely incredible. The construction effort will require skills and labour—and, for some months and even years, much additional labour, which will not always be available across the vast distances which were affected by the floods. Acknowledging this, the Prime Minister has announced a doubling of the size of the relocation assistance pilot for people on income support and the directing of it to Queensland. This means that up to 4,000 eligible job seekers who want to get a job helping out with the reconstruction efforts will now receive financial support from the Australian government to move to Queensland with their families and assist with the rebuild.
The only thing that I think will linger longer in my memory than the images of beautiful, sunny Brisbane literally under water or some of those horrific images of cars floating down streets—images that you would never normally dream of seeing—is the strength and determination of Australians, including Queenslanders, in giving generously and in helping each other, their families and neighbours, to rebuild. On the days that the floodwaters peaked, I, like so many Australians, sat watching in awe of the utter devastation caused. It seemed unbelievable, and the task of recovery and rebuilding seemed so very great. But we are already seeing the spirit and the determination of so many to step up and make that a reality, and it is important that, as a parliament, we note that right around Australia there are people who are committed to helping out their fellow Australians during this very tough period.
Of the portfolios I hold, there is one that I have not mentioned yet today: that of the status of women. I want to place on record that I think there is nothing that embodied Australian generosity, and the resilience of Queensland, better than our two female leaders, Anna Bligh and our Prime Minister, doing an extraordinary job, standing up and coordinating these efforts to rebuild. They have done a tremendous job to date. I have every confidence that we will see a state rebuilt stronger and more beautiful than ever. I also want to place on the record my sympathies for and my heartfelt empathy with the people who have suffered during these national tragedies. But we endeavour to rebuild and recover together.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—On behalf of the people of Macquarie, I rise today to offer our deepest sympathies to all Australians affected by the natural disasters which have taken place across our nation in recent months. To all who have made a contribution to the relief effort, whether through donations or a simple hug, during these dramatic and testing circumstances: I acknowledge your selflessness. Australia is a nation with a huge heart where mates help their mates in a very practical way. Communities met and mastered challenges—and, of course, we all know there are more ahead—not with words but with conviction and compassion, by putting their commitment to care for their fellow Australians into action.
Across our nation, roads, bridges, rail lines, power, telecommunications and utilities were destroyed, damaged or cut off, homes and cars were destroyed and, sadly, Australian lives were lost in natural disasters that will live long in our memories. Few states were left untouched, with floodwaters also surging into New South Wales and Victoria, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. As rivers breached their banks and raging waters and flash flooding reached record levels, so too did the Australian spirit. Every day revealed a new challenge. The media coverage graphically displayed the tragedy as it unfolded, touching the hearts of all of us as we watched desperate acts of courage, and inconsolable despair and grief as communities mourned their losses and counted the personal cost. After the floodwaters had subsided, we were all inspired by the massive response of thousands of volunteers who rolled up their sleeves to lend a hand as the mammoth clean-up got underway.
The people of the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains are no strangers to natural disasters and can empathise with the flood and fire victims, having experienced the flooding of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers as recently as 1990, with peaks in excess of 13 metres. Fires also ravaged the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury in December 2001.
As recently as last week Sydney temperatures exceeded 40 degrees in a week-long heatwave that broke all living records. Fires in the Megalong Valley, Ebenezer, Blaxland Ridge and Mulgrave were brought under control by the hardworking Rural Fire Services brigades of the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains, avoiding what could have been another potential natural disaster.
I make a very brief mention of these events to highlight that there are many Australians who would feel a connection to those affected by the recent floods and fires, and with that connection come the understanding, support and mateship that are necessary in the emotional recovery and rebuilding process.
In the Hawkesbury local resident Toni Walker was responsible for organising the Shoe Boxes of Love campaign that saw locals buying items that would be appreciated in the flood ravaged areas of Queensland, using a shoebox as the packaging, wrapping them and then dropping them into either the Hawkesbury Community College or my office. Over 300 boxes were collected from Hawkesbury residents in just two weeks from the start of our project—a great achievement. The boxes were transported to Queensland by Robert and Paul Campbell’s Charter Refrigerated Transport, while Hawkesbury Self Storage in South Windsor donated the packing boxes for transport and the University of Western Sydney Hawkesbury campus gave us the use of a van and a driver to get the boxes to Charter Refrigerated Transport. It was a great team effort.
I have lifelong friends in Gatton. They have a business in Laidley. I have chatted to them in recent weeks and during the tragedy. In fact, I spoke to my dear friend while she was sweeping out the business. At that point in time she was still standing knee-deep in water. She described how, while some of the businesses there would be able to start again and it would be a long road ahead to rebuild, there would be many that would be unlikely to recover and start off again.
In Central and South-East Queensland in excess of 17,500 homes were flooded or isolated by floodwaters, along with 3,000 business premises. In Far North Queensland, Cyclone Yasi damaged homes and businesses, flattening fields of sugar cane and destroying approximately 80 per cent of the banana crop, as well as leaving nearly 200,000 people without power at times last week.
In New South Wales, Weddin, Wellington, Warrumbungle, Cootamundra, Coonamble, Harden and Young shires were all declared natural disaster zones. In Victoria thunderstorms and flash flooding left 25,000 without power. In Tasmania heavy rain and flash floods ravaged the northern coastal areas, while Western Australia is battling fires that, as of Monday, had seen 59 homes razed.
Our hearts go out to all who have lost loved ones and personal possessions. It is vital that we acknowledge the efforts of all of the hardworking men and women from the emergency services organisations—the fireys, the police, SES workers—and the countless volunteers who worked day and night across affected states to answer the calls of those in need. Their work and service continues. I understand some of the SES volunteers from Macquarie dived in and went to help our neighbours in northern New South Wales. In that same vein 1,200 Australian troops were called to action, providing much-needed expertise, strength and emotional support to those in need.
During the floods three C130 Hercules from the Richmond RAAF Base aircraft and mobile air load teams were active throughout Queensland for Operation Queensland Flood Assist. Their tasks included delivering groceries to Charleville and Bundaberg, delivering rations to Mackay for use in Rockhampton and dispatching more than 100 tonnes of groceries from RAAF Richmond to RAAF Townsville, where they were then trucked south.
On New Year’s Eve a C130 Hercules transport aircraft with Defence staff on board took off from the RAAF Richmond airbase with a flexible habitat—a 100-person purpose-built temporary accommodation for residents of Emerald, 900 kilometres north of Brisbane. On Tuesday, February 1, two C130 Hercules from RAAF Base Richmond headed to Cairns with an aeromedical evacuation team to evacuate hospital patients before Cyclone Yasi hit. This highly successful operation saw 173 patients transferred from Cairns area hospitals to Brisbane. What made their effort even more courageous was that it took place in the dead of the night and was organised with very little notice. A C130 transported 40 litter patients, 13 walking patients and one family member as an escort, while another C130 took 32 litter patients, 10 walking patients and one family member. Two C17A Globemasters from RAAF Base Amberley also assisted in the operation, transferring another 101 patients.
RAAF Base Richmond’s cyclone support did not stop there. They have been supporting Operation Yasi Assist consistently since the cyclone hit the North Queensland coast last Wednesday night. On Thursday and Friday last week a pair of C130 Hercules flew into Cairns with mobile air load teams and forklifts from Richmond and Amberley. Their task was to unload cargo from the aircraft and break down that cargo at the destination. On Saturday, 5 February they sent one Hercules with communications equipment, water and food to Innisfail via Townsville. They also sent two Hercules loaded with groceries, one carrying 11 tonnes and the other with 13 tonnes, to Cairns from Richmond. Once in Cairns, the groceries were used to stock shelves for local residents. They did the same again on Sunday. The presence of an Australian uniform provides hope, comfort and strength. These men and women do us proud. To you all, we offer our gratitude and sincere thanks.
It is vital that we not lose sight of the fact that this rebuilding process is as much about healing the hearts and minds of the flood and fire victims as it is about rebuilding roads, power lines and bridges. It is important to pause and pay our respects to the victims of the floods and cyclone in Queensland and their families and, in so doing, to also reflect on the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of lives that were saved by the collective efforts of professional and well-trained emergency services personnel, police and volunteers.
I again extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who lost loved ones, and to the people who have lost their homes, their livelihoods and their personal treasures. May you be comforted by the spirit of community and mateship so remarkably demonstrated by the unflinching courage of the rescuers, the professional management of the emergency response teams and the army of volunteers who spread to all regions during the crisis and clean-up. It is a long road ahead. It is at times like these that the Australian spirit inspires us to action, and this action will be required for a long time ahead.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I too wish to add my sincere condolences to those who have had loved ones ripped from their arms by the terrible events of the last few weeks, to those who are still suffering and still recovering from the floods, the fires and the cyclone that have devastated so many parts of Australia this terrible summer. It is very clear that the worst of times bring out the best in us. We have seen evidence of that by the truckload over the last few weeks.
We have seen it from the men and women of the Defence Force on the ground and in the air, from those who have been maintaining our Black Hawks, our Chinooks, our Sea Kings, our C130s and C17s and our Bushmasters. We have seen it in the incredible work of all of the emergency services personnel, local counsellors and frontline healthcare workers, and people—and they have been mentioned previously in this debate—who volunteered their time to set up emergency facilities and feed people. We have seen it in the work of the people of Brisbane, people who have opened their arms—who have picked up brooms, shovels and mops—to help out total strangers whose homes have been damaged by the floods.
We are a good people in an unforgiving land. When bad things happen we are capable of doing some amazing things. We saw evidence of that not just in the streets of Brisbane or the streets of Rockhampton or Tully or elsewhere; we also saw it many miles away in the streets of my electorate, in the streets of Bankstown. We felt it through our television sets. We sat glued, night after night, in disbelief when we saw floodwaters rising through Rockhampton and then through the CBD of Brisbane. We were shocked at the sight of cars being washed through the streets of Toowoomba by raging floodwaters. I remember thinking, as I was going to bed on 2 February, the night before Cyclone Yasi came through Far North Queensland: ‘What will happen when I wake up? Will the people of Far North Queensland still be alive when I wake up tomorrow morning?’
Our response so many miles away has been one of incredible and overwhelming generosity. On 14 January, I went to my local train station, Bankstown train station, with some local SES volunteers to raise some money for the victims of the floods. I was hoping that between 6.30 and 8.00 we would raise around $500. I was stunned when we raised more than $3,000 in just those 2½ hours. So we decided, ‘That’s not good enough. Let’s keep going.’ We went to Bankstown Centro, our local shopping centre, and we had people throwing $50 notes at us. We had one man give us $500 cash. There were lots of people emptying their purses, giving us every coin they had in their purse. There were lots of mums and lots of grandmothers who would give a two-dollar coin or a five-dollar note to their grandchildren and ask them to come up to us and put that money in our tin. Others apologised that they did not have any money to give.
I think people were so generous in large part because they were so affected by what they had seen on television. Another reason they came up to us was that standing next to me were men and women in orange uniforms, the men and women of the SES. That is why they reacted in such a powerful way. It reminded me of the respect that the community has for the people of the SES.
I would like to use this opportunity to mention some of those men and women who helped me over the course of those three days: Michelle Niven, Denise Lynch, David Johnston, the incredible Jordan Ross, who got one donation for $500, Eileen O’Hea, Kathleen O’Hea, Stuart Miller, Carol Bassam and David Drake. Carol and David are not in Bankstown anymore.  They are up in Far North Queensland helping out with the clean-up after Cyclone Yasi. They will be joined by four others from Bankstown SES.
This is just one example of the generosity of spirit of the people of my community. There have been many others. Many organisations have put together fundraisers at short notice. It is not unique to Bankstown—I am sure many members have had the same experience in their own communities—but I want to pay tribute to them, to their generosity and to the time they have taken. The Lebanese Muslim Association raised $15,000; Bankstown City Council gave a cheque for $20,000; Bankstown Sports Club came forward with a cheque for $25,000 and $20,000 worth of furniture; Bunnings at Bankstown raised $3,900 through a sausage sizzle; Bankstown Lions Club, about $5,000; the United Muslim Women Association, $10,000; Bankstown RSL, $8,000; Auburn Gallipoli Mosque, $12,000; and Vietnam Sydney Radio, $45,000. I spent two hours on the radio urging people to donate. We got $10,000 in two hours. One little girl, who was eight years old, rang up to donate $50. I asked her why she was donating, and she said: ‘Well, it’s what I saw on television. I need to help people like me,’ and I thought that was really touching.
The Vietnamese-Australian Charity Organisation held an event called the Golden Heart charity dinner. They have done this before. The Golden Heart charity dinner was first held after the bushfires two years ago, and they raised $50,000 that night. This time, the call went out, the invitations went out, and 1,000 people responded to that invitation within three or four days. It was all sold out. They had 200 or 300 people that they could not fit in—people said they just wanted to stand at the back of the room. They raised $145,000 in one night. Let me use this opportunity to thank the man who organised that, Dr Vinh Binh Lieu, who subsequently was named the Bankstown Citizen of the Year.
I also thank the Chinese association of Western Sydney. They held a similar event and raised more than $120,000 in one night, including one donation from a gentleman named Henry Ngai, the owner of a company called ABC Tissues. His donation was $50,000. I went to a Chinese lunar new year event hosted by the Indo-China Chinese Association New South Wales last Saturday. It was a week after Cyclone Yasi had torn through Far North Queensland. I told them that that cyclone hit Far North Queensland about midnight on 2 February. That is an important date, because it is also New Year’s Eve for our Chinese and Vietnamese friends. It meant that we were moving from the Year of the Tiger to the Year of the Rabbit. The Year of the Tiger is supposed to be a ferocious year; the Year of the Rabbit is supposed to be one that is calmer. Certainly the Year of the Tiger has been a very ferocious year. I told them that I would like to think that that cyclone was not as deadly as we feared that it might have been because, just as it struck, we moved from the Year of the Tiger to the Year of the Rabbit. I do not know if that is true or not, but I hope it is and I hope that we have a calmer year after the ferocity of the last few months. That day they raised another $20,000.
There are many other organisations who I have not mentioned or whose work I am not aware of at the moment, but what I do know is that the people of Bankstown and the people of Cabramatta already have raised close to half a million dollars for their fellow Australians, and we are not a wealthy community. I am proud of the way Australians have responded in the worst of times over the last few weeks, this terrible summer, and I am proud of our community for the way that we have responded.
Debate (on motion by Mr Clare) adjourned.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Christensen, George, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—I rise to support the motion of condolence in relation to the natural disasters that our nation has faced this summer. I particularly want to offer my condolences to those impacted by the floods that swept across Queensland. Also, I want to place on record the impact that the extreme weather events in Queensland has had on the people of Dawson. Firstly I want to assure the victims of these floods that they are in the thoughts and prayers of the people of Dawson. I particularly want to extend my sincere and heartfelt sorrow and sympathy to those who have lost family and friends in that inland tsunami, as it has been called, that swept through Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley. As the member for Wright said earlier this week, the fact that those people had no warning of what was to come that day made it such a terrible tragedy. I also want to acknowledge the good work that the member for Wright has done in this difficult time and acknowledge the passion and commitment that he has displayed for his people. The electors of Wright could not have picked a better representative.
I happened to be in Brisbane when the flood waters reached Ipswich and Brisbane City. While I was in Brisbane I was able to participate in the clean-up efforts that happened directly after that. What I witnessed when that huge army of volunteers turned up to help clean-up the city is something that will stay with me for a very long time. It was heartening to see, especially after witnessing over the previous couple of days people having their possessions washed away in flood waters down the Brisbane River. I want to pay tribute to Lord Mayor Campbell Newman and his team at the Brisbane City Council who so competently coordinated the flood clean-up effort. It was really an amazing effort. Heaven forbid that a flood event of that nature should happen in the Mackay region or in the Dawson electorate, but I would say that the exemplary mobilisation effort that Brisbane City Council achieved could be used in the regions of other councils.
While much of the destruction in the south-east corner of Queensland was very well publicised through the media, I put on record some of the impacts that the extraordinary La Nina weather events this summer have had on the people in my electorate of Dawson. Some might say that the electorate of Dawson dodged a bullet because we are one of the few regions in Queensland that were spared from the extraordinary floods that happened, but towns and cities in the electorate of Dawson did receive record rainfall, which has impacted, and there was the impact of the two cyclones in the last fortnight. While we have not had the floods, this has been no normal wet season in the north. In fact, we have already had rainfall in some places that is more than double the annual rainfall.
I have spoken before in this House about the impact the record spring rainfall has had on the sugar industry. It is important to realise the impact the rain that fell before Christmas is having on the sugar industry in Dawson. The Mackay region has had over double its annual rainfall since January 2010. As a result of the spring rainfall, there are over 645,000 tonnes of cane left standing in the paddock that was unable to be harvested in 2010. That is cane that farmers, millers and local businesses in the Mackay region will not receive any payment for.
One of the cruellest effects on the sugar industry is that the rain has not only made it too wet to harvest this year’s crop but also has ruined much of the 2011 plant cane. To replace this plant cane will cost local farmers about $1,800 a hectare. So the economic impact of this unusual wet season is going to be felt for a very long time to come. Some cane growers in the Mackay region reported that they did not suffer any damage from either of the two cyclones, just more rainfall, as if they had not had enough. Other areas, such as Proserpine, have received 4,000 millimetres since January 2010, when the average rainfall is 1,500 millimetres a year. That has left them with $18 million worth of cane in the paddock. That is one of the regions that was also hit by Cyclone Anthony and received strong gales from Cyclone Yasi.
Farmers of the Burdekin region have probably been the hardest hit economically by these weather events, with over three million tonnes of cane left in the paddock. That is very damaging to that small town. The Burdekin region was also impacted by Cyclone Yasi, with most of the cane being lodged or blown over by strong gales. I drove through that area and it was an unbelievable sight. It is heartbreaking for some of those farmers. I will continue to call on the government to assist these people where possible.
I also want to make some special mention of the local governments and the professional way in which they prepared their communities when Cyclone Anthony and Cyclone Yasi were bearing down on the coast during the past weeks. As a former councillor from the Mackay Regional Council I know that local government is called upon to prepare the community for every cyclone season. I know the special effort that is put in by local mayors, staff and councillors to prepare for these cyclones. I want to make special mention, today, of Mayor Lyn McLaughlin and her councillors and staff at Burdekin Shire Council. It was very good to be with Councillor McLaughlin at the disaster management meeting when Cyclone Anthony was bearing down on the coast. It was actually heading right for their town at that point in time.
On the night that Cyclone Anthony was to cross the coast at that town, thinking I was doing the sensible thing, I tried to escape down to Bowen only to find that the cyclone had changed its trajectory and was now travelling south so that the eye of the storm would cross directly over Bowen. But Cyclone Anthony was a very mild cyclone. The damage was limited and the next day I made my way around the town. There were trees that were blown over and some damage to property. I spoke with locals but they weathered it fairly well.
I have to say that it was nothing compared to the storm that was Cyclone Yasi, which bore down on that town and others in the electorate of Dawson. Again, I stayed in Bowen on the night that that cyclone crossed the coast. It was horrendous. The wind was nothing like I have ever experienced. There were things flying through the air that should not have been flying through the air. The next morning, when I inspected the damage I was surprised that it was not worse, given the extent of that wind. Relatively, we were spared from any major destruction. Certainly the thoughts of people in Dawson were with those who were in the thick of it—in Cardwell, Mission Beach and other communities in that area—when Yasi crossed the coast.
The images of the destruction caused by the cyclone will serve as a warning to anyone living in North Queensland that we are at the mercy of Mother Nature and we must always be prepared. There is a growing concern in my electorate that we may not have been prepared as well as we could have been. Late on the Monday night before Yasi crossed the coast many in Mackay, in the ‘brown zones’ as they call them, received a text message and automated phone call—the sort that many people receive the night before an election, I suppose, from political parties. But this message said that those in low-lying areas should be prepared to evacuate. I am not sure whether it was a good idea to send a message to people at 10 o’clock at night when the cyclone was 1,700 kilometres off the coast, but that is going to be a matter for debate when the emergency response is reviewed.
What is troubling the people in my community is that although they were told to seek higher ground and evacuate their homes there is no evacuation centre in Mackay. In fact, there is no evacuation centre in the electorate of Dawson, which is one of the hotspots for cyclones. There is none in Bowen, the Whitsundays or in the Burdekin. This is something that needs to be addressed. Evacuation centres must be built or identified because it is something that the state government identified in the aftermath of Cyclone Larry. In fact, the issue pre-dates that. The chief executive officer of Burdekin Shire Council told me the other day that he recalled former Premier Peter Beattie telling local government officials gathered at a conference in 1997 that the state government would begin a process of gathering funding for, and rolling out, cyclone shelters in the north. This has not happened.
Another matter that troubled the local community in Mackay and the Whitsundays was that there was no local ABC radio broadcast to keep locals informed of what the local situation was. It was syndicated somewhere else. This meant that locals were hearing reports from south or further north, closer to the cyclone, and not getting the relevant local information. The local ABC radio station in Mackay is only rated for a category 3 cyclone and because Cyclone Yasi was a category 5 it meant that our area received the broadcast from elsewhere, although it was quite obvious that the cyclone was not bearing down on the Mackay region. On top of the category 3 cyclone rating of the radio station building, it is also located in a flood zone. So there is some sense to what the ABC did but there could have been broadcasts from other places within the city. As the Mackay Regional Council Mayor Col Meng said, this really questions the ability of ABC to call itself the state emergency broadcaster. These are issues that will have to be addressed, hopefully by next year’s wet season and cyclone season.
Community radio stations such as SweetFM, run by David, Merle and the crew in the Burdekin, did stay on air in the thick of it, supported by other volunteers bringing in food and stuff for them. That was absolutely fantastic. Even our commercial radio stations—Scotty on Sea FM, Cliffo on Hot FM and Hammo on 4MK all did their bit to inform the local communities of what was going on.
I also want to place on record my appreciation for Mayor Col Meng and his team at Mackay Regional Council, Mayor Brunker and his team at Whitsunday Regional Council, Mayor McLaughlin and her team at Burdekin Shire Council and Mayor Les Tyrell and his team at the Townsville City Council. Their efforts over the last couple of months recovering from the record rainfall and preparing for and leading up to Cyclones Anthony and Yasi are to be commended.
As I mentioned, I spent the night that Yasi hit in Bowen. The next morning I toured Bowen and, as I said, I was very surprised at the low level of destruction, given the level of the winds the night before. I ventured north from there to inspect the towns of Home Hill and Ayr in my electorate and the suburbs of Townsville that are in my electorate. Unfortunately for me I could not get through as the Bruce Highway was cut just before Home Hill. I understand it was cut just above Brandon, as well. Basically, that blocked the whole town in.
What I saw were dozens and dozens of vehicles waiting, stranded. They belonged to people waiting to return home. They had evacuated the cyclone zone and they had to wait an entire day not knowing whether their homes were still there. They may have had loved ones that they needed to contact and could not. It was a tragic thing for me to see and there were people who were quite distressed about not being able to get back to their homes. To me, that shows that there is a definite need for Bruce Highway funding, particularly funding for flood-proofing areas, to be kept in place.
I eventually did get to the Burdekin, to the towns of Home Hill and Ayr, a day and a half later. There was enormous damage, with trees down everywhere, but the community have rallied to clean up the place. There is no extensive damage to homes. In some cases, you could put that down to divine intervention. I saw two big trees which, if they had fallen a particular way, would have basically flattened Home Hill State School or one of its buildings. Another tree, instead of falling on the kids’ play equipment, fell on a fence. It is unbelievable to see the near misses there. There were, as I said, a few victims who sustained damage to their homes, and that is tragic.
Up in Townsville, we have had the same situation—a lot of trees have been blown over. It does look like a bit of a war zone, but the council, the community and the ADF based up there have been making a tremendous effort to get Townsville back on track. I understand there are some Townsville residents who are still waiting for electricity to be connected. They have been a week without power, so I suppose things are getting a tad tedious in that regard.
There are calls to look at undergrounding power lines in the north, and that is something that the state government is going to have to focus on. I know that would be a very expensive exercise but, looking at the disruption to people’s lives and businesses and the cost to the state of the constant repairs when these things strike towns every year, there could be a cost benefit in undergrounding.
I will close by saying to the people in my electorate, and to those elsewhere in the state and the nation who have suffered loss because of the natural disasters this summer, that I join the House in offering them my sincere condolences.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"D’Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in continuation on this condolence motion. I have already spoken in this House about those lost and those left behind grieving. We also need to acknowledge those people who have lost their homes and personal belongings, and the damage that is doing to them and their lives. Such disasters can result in not just physical damage but psychological damage.
I finished yesterday saying that the best way those in this House could try to understand what it was like to be one of the people who lost their belongings was to read the writing of someone whose home and family was in the Lockyer Valley about that fateful day in January in which they convey their experience in their own words. This gentleman, a father and husband, wrote these words for me and I would like to put them on the record:
On the evening of 11th January our home was inundated by the Lockyer Creek flood. All belongings were either washed away or destroyed, the flood leaving little but the shell of our house. After a 2 day wait to access the home we were left with the soul destroying job of emptying the remaining belongings for collection and disposal. We were alone, with no resources and exhausted by stress and a lack of hope. I saw little future for my 2 children, my wife and myself.
At the point where it appeared that it could not be worse a second flood arrived. This time it wore the orange uniforms of the Gold Coast SES. Kristy Heitmann led 3 units from Southport, Carrara and Runaway Bay. Seeing the distress in the eyes of my family they insisted that we stepped back and allowed them to do all the work. Their compassion and understanding went well beyond the call of duty at a time when we were on the edge of breakdown.
Enormous effort went into searching through the wreckage for any items salvageable, items we would never have found in our state. A donation from the Gold Coast residents and Council was made of a simple clothes basket, containing towels, soap, toothbrushes, coffee and many other simple luxuries that are taken for granted in normal times. There are moments in life when even simple actions can change lives. Their timely arrival, sympathy and understanding as well as their plain hard work allowed us to stand back, reassess our situation and begin the path to recovery.
Leaving our home Kristy and her orange army went on to help many others in our area and I know they are now working in Cairns at Tully and Mission Beach helping more families, tirelessly and selflessly. I cannot imagine how many more people have been helped by them and all the volunteers involved in this disaster recovery, to the Army, State and Federal Authorities, individual volunteers and especially the SES thank you from my family.
Those words come from a man called Brett. Brett is my brother. They lost everything. But they picked themselves up and they are moving on. I cannot imagine what they went through. I have seen some of the footage. When they tried to get back to the house the first time, we saw a massive river flowing extremely fast and a roof sticking out of the middle of the river—and that was their home.
The second lot of footage showed the days after and the destruction in the home. The fridge had been lifted off the floor and was sitting sidewards on the kitchen bench, half hanging in mid-air. Belongings were taken from one side of the home to the other. There were toys in my niece’s bedroom, but they were not her toys; they were toys from some other home that had been pushed into her bedroom. They were amazing scenes. There were many sentimental items lost that day—items sentimental to our whole family. These included my mother’s ashes. But those losses mean nothing, because my brother Brett, his wife Jenny, my niece Shawnee and my nephew Robbie are safe.
We have seen a lot of good come out of this. My brother told me the story of when they turned up at the evacuation centre. They walked in looking absolutely devastated and a very large gentleman standing at the door put his hand out to my brother and said, ‘What happened to you guys?’ and my brother told him. This large gentlemen shook my brother’s hand and said, ‘You are coming home with us.’ I want to acknowledge Mick—‘Mick the truck driver’—and Shelly who have taken in my brother and his family. They offered them a place to stay for as long as they need. They bought the children new school uniforms. They did not know my family, but they put out a helping hand.
That is just one story, but there are so many stories out there. We have heard so many people, in speaking to this motion today, talk about the complete strangers who just came out to help. It was absolutely incredible. It is a sight that we have never seen in this country before. We know that in times of disaster Australians stand up and help each other. We have seen that time and time again. But I have never seen it to the extent that we saw it in January. I know that those in Central Queensland and Rockhampton, who went through those floods in December and early January, also saw that incredible spirit. We heard from the member from Capricornia that they all got together and they filled those sandbags and they protected their town and each other. It was just incredible to see.
My electorate of Petrie is one of the very fortunate electorates in Queensland that has remained relatively untouched as far as floodwaters. There was minor flash flooding here and there and a bit of damage—not to in any way take away from the damage that was received in some community sporting organisations and so forth that are still trying to recover—but we did not lose lives or homes. But I do not know of too many people who do not know someone who has been affected. My community have come out with absolute strength and have fundraised, baked, sewn, knitted and collected. They have not stopped from day 1. They have jumped on buses to help. Businesses have put backhoes on trucks and have gone into industrial areas and have helped dig mud out to help other businesses and homes. It has been incredible. As I said, I think my diary is full of fundraising events coming up. I do not know when it is going to stop.
I spoke to a lovely lady recently. She is a pensioner in one of our local retirement villages. She rang after the government mentioned the flood levy. She wanted to know how long the Premier’s flood relief fund was going to go for because, as a pensioner, she will not be paying the levy and she wanted to know how she could donate $20 a month for the next 12 months so that she could do her share. She was very worried that the Premier’s fund might not continue for 12 months and wanted to know how she could get this money to us because she could not pay it all at once and needed to pay it monthly. I am sure that there are many, many people out there like that who are helping.
One area that has been talked about a bit—certainly by the member for Blair and some of the other members whose electorates have been significantly affected—is our schools and how many schools have been affected. I thought that this was one area where I could help in my electorate by gathering our schools together and helping them—and they were eager to help—to make sure that what they were fundraising was getting to the right schools and that we were getting the right stuff to the right schools. We have heard from some members that sometimes our hearts lead our generosity. We race out and donate clothes, fridges and everything else but we need to stop and say, ‘Is this what they need?’ They may already have five fridges, but they might need some clothes, a bed or something else. We need to make sure that our generosity is matching the needs in the community.
I started with a list of 120 schools that were impacted by the floods and we now have it down to about 50 schools that still need assistance. We are matching up schools; they are adopting each other. They are doing fundraising and the kids are becoming pen pals and building those personal connections. I will talk in much more detail at another time in this chamber about the schools and how they are progressing in that program, but I would like to acknowledge some schools now. Aspley East State School has adopted Ipswich East State School. Ipswich East State School has 580 students. One-third of those students have lost their homes. In addition, the Ipswich East State School was significantly damaged. Water went through their science room, their special education room and their music room. The whole of the outside-school-hours care, which is run by the P&C, has lost absolutely everything.
Aspley East State School, which has adopted Ipswich East State School, did a ‘free dress, gold coin’ donation the other day, where a teacher did a chalk mural on the ground that showed the Brisbane River and the mountains all the way through to the city and then out to Moreton Bay and coins were laid on the lines of the mural. They raised $1,329 that day. I know Ipswich East State School is very grateful for that. A local individual from my electorate, Terry Skinner, rang me up after hearing Ipswich East State School’s story and he is donating an electric piano, which we are dropping down there next week. The music teacher is very grateful for that wonderful donation by Terry.
St Paul’s School, after seeing the list of schools, said they could not just adopt one. They adopted Arcadia Valley State School, two hours north of Roma. It is a little school that probably no-one has ever heard of—it has only five students. The principal only moved to the school this year. His home has been flooded out. He is living in a shed with his wife while it gets repaired. The principal is also the groundsman, as would be the case in most very small schools. His wife is the cleaner for the school. The water went through the one and only classroom. They have lost their early learning childhood books and toys for the kids—the box of Lego is gone—and those sorts of things. St Paul’s School of Bald Hills has adopted this school. They have donated $1,000. It is a permanent adoption and they will be doing a lot more for them. They have also given a financial donation to Brassall State School, which we heard about yesterday. This school was significantly damaged. They have one phone line now and the internet connection is very poor, so they are hard to get through to. They will get $2,500. St Paul’s has also adopted Milpera State High School, which predominantly takes new refugee migrants. They have given them $6½ thousand to begin with and will be doing a lot more work for them.
These are just some of the stories. Bounty Boulevard State School, Deception Bay North State School, Grace Lutheran Primary School, the Lakes College and Taigum State School have all put their hands up and said ‘Yes, we want to adopt and help these other schools.’
Unfortunately, just as I was finalising the list of the schools that still need help from the floods, I got the new list of schools that have been affected by Cyclone Yasi. That is a long list, including Tully school which needs to be bulldozed and rebuilt. So there are many schools that are damaged because of the cyclone as well and we will endeavour to help them.
Our hearts go out to all the people who have been affected by these floods and the cyclone. I know the members for Blair, Oxley and Wright have worked extremely hard. It has been devastating for them to see the effect on their communities and the lives lost, but these members are working day in and day out to help rebuild them. I am sure their communities would not mind if I spoke on their behalf to say thankyou to those federal members for what they are doing for their communities. I echo the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in the debate on this condolence motion. It has been a difficult time for Queensland, it will continue to be a difficult time in the reconstruction, but the Australian people are strong and resilient. They are kind and compassionate. They will rebuild their lives and they will do it with our help.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"O’Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—At the outset of my contribution to the debate on this condolence motion on the natural disasters, I acknowledge the very moving speech by the member for Petrie and also the speech before her by the member for Dawson. We in this House cannot be anything but moved when we hear the personal stories that have been so eloquently told to us in this place.
I join with my colleagues on both sides of the House and the crossbenches to add my condolences, along with those of the people of Higgins, to the people whose lives will be forever scarred by these disasters.
The past two months have been a most extraordinary period for Australia, one which we will never forget and hope never to relive.
While the floods, cyclones and fires have directly affected communities in the states of Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, all Australians, regardless of where they live, mourn their loss, understand their pain, pay tribute to their courage and celebrate the uniqueness and generosity of the Australian spirit—a fighting spirit that will not be broken, no matter how hard Mother Nature may try.
We have been in awe of the events that have hit both our cities and our regions and, like all disasters, they have been totally arbitrary in where and who they strike.
This motion was originally intended as a condolence motion for those affected by the floods and Cyclone Yasi in Queensland and Victoria; yet, even while the clean-up continues in those states and the reconstruction commences, only this week we hear of more homes lost to bushfires in Western Australia. We also offer our sympathy and support to them, and I am sure the member for Pearce will speak of this later.
I particularly acknowledge the tragedy of 35 lives lost. So many of us were moved to tears listening to Scotty Buchholz, the member for Wright, as he spoke of the people in his community who did not make it. Words do not do justice to the unimaginable grief that their families, friends and colleagues must be experiencing. What these tragedies have proved is that we are a united people and our sense of who we are is not determined by state boundaries. We have pulled together for a common cause: to help rebuild communities in disparate regions of our continent, even those regions separated by great distance.
It was the pre-eminent historian Geoffrey Blainey who referred to the ‘tyranny of distance’ as a defining feature of Australia’s history and a constant obstacle to our development. With Federation, we made our first concerted attempt to overcome this obstacle. Since that time our identity has only become stronger. While we may live great distances from one another, our generosity is not confined to such geographical limitations, nor is our sense of nationhood diminished. This is most evident during tragedies such as these.
The charity we have observed from our fellow Australians, and the mindfulness they have shown towards those who are suffering and destitute, has been inspiring. If there is any comfort to be found in these horrible events it is that Australians have confirmed their commitment to one another in the most spectacular way. The images we have seen on our televisions, and the stories we have read in newspapers and heard in this House, tell of large-scale suffering and loss but also of courage and kindness. It is a testament to the will and endurance of Australians that those affected have dealt with this situation with such grace.
The fallout from these disasters is immense. It is not just the lives lost, but the permanent setbacks so many now face as they struggle to rebuild their lives. Businesses have suffered, workers have suffered, and basic goods and services are in scarce supply, forcing up the cost of living. Economic recovery will be a slow process, and for many it will be years before they can rebuild their lives.
On 7 February Victoria commemorated the second anniversary of the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, during which a horrific 173 people were killed. While much of the infrastructure building has been completed, the task of rebuilding lives is ongoing. This will be true of the floods as well.
I want to offer my sympathy and condolences to those in my home state of Victoria who have been affected by the floods that struck the western and central areas of our state. It is incredibly lucky, and due in no small measure to the work of emergency services and volunteers, that there were no fatalities in Victoria. Yet recovery is no less difficult for those whose livelihoods have been wiped away. The damage caused to property, as well as to vital infrastructure and amenities, has been significant. In particular we offer our sympathy to the people of Kerang, Horsham, Pyramid Hill, Quambatook, Allansford, Wycheproof, Panmure and Culgoa, who were the hardest hit by the flooding. We are inspired by their courage and fortitude in the face of such widespread destruction.
Although the events in Queensland meant that the floods in Victoria were not given as much airtime, it is important for the nation to reflect upon the many personal stories in the south as well as in the north.
We are grateful to our state emergency service volunteers, police and emergency workers for the remarkable job they have done and we thank them. Their dedication and year-round training ensure that our state is prepared for these terrible events. The losses incurred would undoubtedly have been much higher were it not for their efforts.
We thank the many Australians, including so many from my own electorate of Higgins, for their generosity in donating money and goods to their fellow Australians and for their willingness to help. It will be a long road to recovery. To all those people who are being touched by these disasters our prayers are with you, as is our support. You must know that you are not alone.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I rise to speak in support of the Prime Minister’s condolence motion on the natural disasters which have occurred over the summer. On 16 January this year I spoke at an ecumenical service that was pulled together by Father Kevin Dillon in Geelong. I thank Father Kevin Dillon for pulling together that service, which I think was an important occasion for the people of Geelong to express their grief and their solidarity with the people of Queensland and, of course, a growing number of people in Victoria.
During the ecumenical service, I spoke of a story which had been reported in the Courier Mail and referred to in the Prime Minister’s contribution on this motion earlier this week. It was the story of a young pregnant woman who was swept from her home by the wall of water in Grantham. As she was swept away she was able to grab hold of a downpipe while holding onto her young baby, but from there she lost her grip and was swept to a nearby railway line where her foot was caught by a sleeper. And from there she was literally in a struggle against the force of nature, a struggle which she could not win. Her baby was torn from her arms, and it is thought that her baby is the youngest victim of these terrible floods. She herself would have been a victim but for the fact that a few minutes later she was saved by a helicopter pilot whose story also featured in the Prime Minister’s contribution on this motion.
You can look at all these statistics, as terrible as they are, around this tragedy. Almost all of Queensland was affected, more than 10,000 people were evacuated and more than 30,000 homes were affected. There were record flood levels in Victoria. I echo the comment by the member for Higgins that some of the events and stories that have occurred in Victoria have not received the same airplay given to the events that occurred in Queensland. But there are enormous difficulties being experienced by people in parts of Victoria associated with these floods. Indeed, within my own region, in the Barwon area there were 500 calls made to the SES associated with local flooding. Of course, in our region it was nothing like it was in other parts of Australia.
You can look at all of that, and you can look at the 35 people who have lost their lives. But to truly understand the significance of these floods, you have to think of that young woman who a month ago held her baby safely in her arms but is now faced with an unimaginable pain for the rest of her life. Whilst this was a moment of incredible tragedy, it was also a story of tremendous courage. That helicopter pilot I mentioned, Mark Kempton, and his crew plucked 28 people from the raging waters. I am sure that many of their lives were saved by the actions of Mark Kempton and his crew.
You can look at the selfless actions of Pauline Magner, who perished in these floods in Grantham but, it is thought, in the process was able to put her grandson Jacob in a position of relative safety within their house such that Jacob was able to survive the floods and is alive today. You can look at the courage of Rob and Jim Wilkin, again from Grantham, who saw this unprecedented wall of water coming towards them. They had the opportunity there and then to get to higher ground themselves but in that moment decided instead to take the time to warn their neighbours about what was coming and to get them out so that they could reach higher ground as well. When the wall of water came through they then got in their boat and managed to pluck a number of other people from the torrent. It is thought that their actions, in the space of just a few moments, were the difference between life and death for another 16 people. And, of course, you can look at the amazing story of Jordan Rice, which has been spoken of by many people in this debate. He asked rescuers to save his younger brother first but, unfortunately, they were unable to save Jordan.
This is also an extraordinary story of Australians pulling together in a really tough time. The number of volunteers who put their hands up to help in the clean-up and rebuilding of Queensland in the immediate aftermath of the floods was truly amazing. Tens of thousands of people registered to provide their assistance in the clean-up. In the days immediately after the floods went through Brisbane, we were all struck by the visions on the television of queues in excess of one kilometre long of people registering to volunteer to help clean up. Of course, across the nation, in a very short period of time indeed, $180 million has been raised by ordinary Australians to help their fellow Australians in a really difficult time of need.
In all of this, one group, from my electorate, have not had their story told and I would like to spend a moment describing their contribution in the last few months. Centrelink’s emergency call centre in Geelong is our country’s only 24 hours a day, seven days a week emergency call centre operated by the Commonwealth. I was glad to see that the Minister for Human Services in her contribution to this debate specifically mentioned this call centre. As it happens, the call centre is located just around the corner from my electorate office in the centre of Geelong and it is designed to be the first to go into action when natural disasters such as bushfires and floods occur. It gives the Australian government an immediate response capacity, not to replace 000 calls but to offer information on evacuation options and recovery plans, to deal with requests for financial assistance and to cope with the overflow of calls being made to state and local emergency services.
One can imagine that these are very difficult calls to deal with. In my time I have had a bit to do with call centre workers and I think it is hard to imagine more difficult calls to have to deal with than those coming into Centrelink’s Geelong emergency call centre in recent times. These calls would be emotionally taxing and would have to be handled with the utmost sensitivity and professionalism.
During the floods, more than 100,000 calls were made to Centrelink’s Geelong emergency call centre. They included calls from people who had lost their homes or businesses and people who were unable to locate their families and friends. Four teams of 10 people worked rotating 12-hour shifts in the call centre and it was in constant operation during this crisis. So I would like to place on the record the appreciation of the Australian people for the work of the staff of this call centre. They did great work for their country and they certainly made their community very proud. Today it is my honour to acknowledge them as being part of the local Geelong contribution to the events of the last month or so.
Many emotions are felt in the context of natural disasters. We feel an enormous sense of grief for those who have perished, and today during this debate we think of their families and friends. We stand in solidarity with all of those Australians who have been affected by these natural disasters. We let them know, as the member for Higgins stated in her contribution, that they are most definitely not alone. I think it is also appropriate that, as a result of this crisis, Australians feel a quiet sense of pride in the amazing coming together of the community and the nation. People really pulled together as one, in the most Australian way, in the most difficult of times.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—With the advent of the 2011 new year came floods, fires, cyclones and storms across the country. The ferocity of these events and the damage they wrought over several states shocked and distressed many. I think there was hardly a dry eye in this House when the member for Wright shared with us the grief of his community, which perhaps sustained the greatest loss of life. We understand their pain, as my colleague the member for Higgins said, and we pay tribute to their courage. We have been touched by other accounts in the media and in this place of the acts of heroism and the generosity of spirit of the Australia community. From beyond our shores have come messages of support and comfort.
In dozens of evacuation, recovery or disaster control centres, from Grantham and Murphys Creek to Emerald, to Rochester, to Echuca, to Grafton or the Brisbane showgrounds, thousands of people, mostly volunteers, have been striving around the clock to help Australians who have suffered terrible loss. In places such as Toowoomba, Bundaberg, Dalby, Horsham and Dadswels Bridge, people devastated by the loss of homes and businesses have been buoyed by the support they have had from good Samaritans who turned up when they were needed most. Battalions of people, including my friend and former colleague the former member for Riverina, the Hon. Kay Hull, were cleaning out homes and shops as soon as the floodwaters had sufficiently receded. Most had no special connection but they had come in their dozens with broom, mop, shovel and sometimes gurneys and even bobcats and trucks to lend a hand and to make a difference. It was a time, as someone observed, that we experienced the ‘worst from Mother Nature but the best from human nature’.
The devastating floods are a sobering reminder of our vulnerability to unforeseen events. We have become accustomed, regrettably and unfortunately, to natural disasters that occur every year, whether they be bushfires or cyclones, floods or drought. In my home state of Western Australia, following on from the disastrous fires that burned so many homes in Toodyay on the eve of the new year in 2009, we again experienced, this year—just over a week ago—a freak storm in the Avon and terrible bushfires, while recovery efforts continued following floods in Carnarvon and the Gascoyne River in the electorate of Durack.
Emergency services across Australia have been stretched, and I would like to comment, as others have done, on the extraordinary effort made by these extraordinary people who conducted the search, rescue and recovery effort across Australia. Our emergency crews performed magnificently. This fact was brought sharply into focus again when cyclonic winds devastated part of my own electorate of Pearce. The towns of York, Northam, Toodyay and Beverley were all hit on 29 January by winds that ripped the roofs off houses, felled powerlines and trees and left much of the Avon region without power for several days, and were responsible for the death of a local identity.
I am very grateful to the President of the Shire of York, Mr Pat Hooper, and the President of the Shire of Northam, Mr Steve Pollard, for the briefing on recovery efforts they gave me, and in particular to York shire chief executive officer Ray Hooper and to President Pollard for making time to assist me with a visit to many of the damaged properties and town infrastructure, including the Avondale Primary School in Northam. My thoughts are with those families and businesses and with the many elderly people who were particularly affected, and those who have sustained severe damage. For one family I visited, almost the entire roof had been ripped off their house and the beams of the roof snapped like matchsticks. The children were terrified and traumatised to the extent that they did not want to go back inside the house. So it will take time—many months indeed—to restore their homes and the business premises, and I wish them a speedy recovery. But, above all, for all of those who are victims of these catastrophic events, it is usually once the initial requirements have been attended to that much later on reaction sets in—and I know that with the Toodyay fires it was some months afterwards that the depression and sadness set in. This is the time when people need our continuing support, assistance and grief counselling.
I want to record my admiration and thanks for the tremendous work done in my electorate by FESA, especially incident controller Paul Leiper, to Julie and her team from DCP, the local police, the York Health Services and Centrelink, who once again performed speedily and magnificently. There was also the York Country Women’s Association, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross and the many individuals who responded to that particular crisis. The speedy declaration of the national disaster and the support offered by Premier Barnett and the Western Australian government was very much appreciated. I was grateful also for the timely advice and assistance from the federal Attorney-General, the member for Barton, who provided information for the affected area.
Just weeks after these storms, Pearce and the neighbouring electorate of Canning were hit by severe bushfires, the horrific images of which I am sure many of you have seen. In Pearce, approximately 1,170 hectares has been burnt throughout the areas of Brigadoon, Baskerville, Millendon, Red Hill and Herne Hill, and some parts of the Shire of Chittering. But I am very pleased that on this occasion no houses were lost. Nevertheless, many people were required to evacuate their homes and to endure a very anxious wait.
The risk of bushfires is a constant concern to people living in many parts of the Pearce electorate and almost every summer there is a serious incident. The people of Pearce understand the threat and they can sympathise with the people of Roleystone and Kelmscott as they face the terrible loss of property from the recent fire. I am sure that residents of Pearce would join me in wishing the people of Canning a speedy recovery from their heartbreaking losses.
From speaking to my parliamentary colleagues in Queensland in the days following the floods, I know that they have also seen the emergency services putting in similarly extraordinary efforts to those I have witnessed in my own electorate. There is little doubt that a highly professional response to the initial emergency saved many lives and provided effective support to many thousands of victims. The challenge will be maintaining that ‘can-do’ attitude after most of the volunteers have gone home, when residences are still uninhabitable, the railway lines are still out and the legalism is beginning to trump common sense.
However, the emergency services personnel who put their lives at risk, the residents who faced disaster without panic and their loss with brave spirits, the volunteers who pitched in without being asked or told to help are representative of Australians at their best. It is important not just for us as a country but for those people in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, and particularly in the Durack, Pearce and Canning electorates, whose lives have been irrevocably changed by catastrophic events well beyond their control.
My staff and I extend our best wishes for the recovery effort and we stand ready to assist our colleagues in any way that we can.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—We have begun yet another parliamentary year with the spectre of tragedy and a pall of grief hanging over our deliberations. Only two years ago we stood in this place reflecting on the devastation of the Black Saturday fires. With those tragic stories still in our minds, we now confront the destruction wreaked by floods and fires across this nation. The natural disasters of the summer, particularly in Queensland, northern New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, have underlined both the harsh brutality of the Australian landscape and the inherent compassion and generosity of the Australian people. Even for those communities who were far removed from the events in Queensland and the other regions that were most badly affected by flood and fire, these were disasters that struck a blow at all of us as a nation.
Like most Australians I watched as great swathes of Queensland and Victoria were submerged by floodwaters, and we have seen homes burn in Western Australia. I heard the stories of those who did not survive or those whose loved ones were swept away or lost to fire. It has been a summer of extraordinary catastrophes that seemed to cascade one on top of the other, and with each expression of natural force came more homes, more property, more businesses destroyed, more lives lost. The tragedies of this summer will linger in our collective memories for many decades to come. For those who lived and survived these tragedies I can barely begin to imagine the horror that they have faced or the dark days that are still to come.
I take this opportunity to acknowledge the many fine contributions to this condolence motion. In particular I wish to acknowledge those members who have spoken with such force about their own personal circumstances, who have spoken with force about the impact of these natural disasters on their communities. It is in moments such as these that we see the great power of representative democracy, where individuals can come forward and not just advocate for the interests or the demands of the communities that they represent but reflect and amplify the feeling, the loss, the suffering, but also the hope, of their communities.
I can stand here today with the great fortune of not having been personally affected by these tragedies but, as I said earlier, I think as Australians we have all been greatly affected by what we have seen. But I do stand here today to ensure that it is recorded in the Hansard that the people of my community, in the Lindsay electorate, wish to acknowledge that they too grieve and wish to show their compassion and empathy towards those who have been affected by these events. My community is divided by the mighty Nepean River, part of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment. With the Nepean River running through the heart of our electorate, ours is a community that is no stranger to flooding; indeed, much of the electorate of Lindsay is located on the flood plain. I have no doubt that that is in the minds of those locals who remember the flood events our community has experienced in the past and that is why so many members of my community have mobilised to contribute, to raise funds and to show their expressions of support for those who have been affected by these natural events.
I wish to take a few moments now to record just a few examples of some of the individuals and groups in my community that have made a contribution to the collective national fundraising effort and to the collective national effort of extending sympathy and assistance to those in need. I wish to acknowledge the 10 Penrith Panthers players who travelled to Ipswich to help out with the recovery. Captain Petero Civoniceva has a special connection with Ipswich, having played as a junior in the district. He told our local paper, the Penrith Press:
I just don’t think the vision of the floods we saw on television gave it justice. It was just utter devastation and for two days we helped people in any way we could. We just moved from house to house offering our help, and ended up with shovels and wheelbarrows on the first day and knocking out gyprock walls and ceilings on the other.
It just really made me think if this had happened to me what I would do.
I think that for Australians, as we spent summer, the time that so many of us enjoy spending with our families, as we looked on, that was a question we all asked ourselves: ‘What would I do if this happened to me?’
I also wish to acknowledge local entertainers who teamed up with the many clubs, pubs and restaurants in my local community that hosted and held fundraising events, some of which included the Penrith Paceway, the Penrith RSL and the Log Cabin. I also acknowledge the Red Cross volunteers in my local community who have worked tirelessly to raise funds for the relief effort. In particular, I acknowledge those women who were involved on Australia Day, battling what was oppressive heat in Penrith, out at the Penrith Lakes walking around with their tins, raising money for this cause. I acknowledge our local Bunnings stores who, through their barbecue stalls and donations from customers, raised more than $8,000 for the Premier’s flood appeal.
I acknowledge a local small-business person, Rob Gibson. I know that there are many others, but I record his contribution to also recognise the efforts of those who have equally made such a contribution. Rob Gibson, who runs a business, CleanOff High Pressure Service, spent a week helping to clean homes in Queensland that had been affected by the floods. Now, having done that, he is donating 10 per cent of the proceeds from all of the jobs that he completes until the end of March to the flood appeal.
I acknowledge the Penrith City Council, which has offered technical assistance to a number of the Queensland local government authorities. Those authorities are under enormous strain at the moment and are trying to continue to deliver the very basic services that communities affected require. I know that nine of our local SES volunteers have also travelled to flood and cyclone affected areas in Queensland to lend their expertise.
Last Sunday I attended a fundraising relief concert held at the Blacktown Bowman Hall organised by the New South Wales Philippine Community Council. I know many local residents were in attendance at that event and I understand that, in total, approximately $20,000 was raised at that event. It struck me that many people who were involved in that concert from the local community that were of Filipino background showed a particular empathy having come from a country that faces many of these natural disasters and has done so on a great scale in recent times as well. I acknowledge their contribution as Australians of Filipino background towards the relief effort.
These are just a few examples, and I know that there are so many more in my community, but I wanted to record them to ensure that it is known that our community stands side by side with those other communities who are now seeking to rebuild themselves out of the debris that these natural disasters have left behind.
I thank all of these people and acknowledge the efforts they have contributed in their time, their strength and their money. I know there are also many people in our community who have prayed for those who have been affected by these natural disasters.
Many communities have been wiped out physically by these natural disasters, but the spirit that binds those communities remains. I believe it is out of this spirit that we as a nation, determined to demonstrate our resilience, our compassion and our mateship, will begin the process of helping those in these affected communities to rebuild the infrastructure that they need and to rebuild their communities.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—I commend the contribution by the member for Lindsay to this debate on the condolence motion on the natural disasters. From time to time, we experience significant events that become etched into our national memory. The flash flood that ripped through Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley on 10 January 2011 was such an event. The torrent was so unexpected in its arrival, so brutal in its power and so terrible in its destruction that we will remember it forever.
In the days that followed that terrible event, Australians watched the crisis unfold as floodwaters spread from the mountains down towards Brisbane. We watched as homes and businesses were flooded. We watched as businesses were literally washed down the river and smashed against bridges. We watched as a tug boat operator carefully guided huge chunks of debris past bridges and wharves to the relative safety of Moreton Bay. We will never forget those images.
Every Australian will remember the floods in a different way, but we all share deep and heartfelt sympathy for those who have lost loved ones, homes and businesses. And our sympathy extends to those Australians who have suffered through Cyclone Yasi and the Brisbane floods as well as the flooding in Central Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and the bushfires in Western Australia.
In the face of these extraordinary natural disasters, Australians have demonstrated extraordinary resilience, courage and generosity. While the floodwaters roared through Toowoomba, brave emergency crews and bystanders plucked stranded motorists from their cars and saved people desperately clinging to trees and debris. Sadly, one hero, teenager Jordan Rice, made the ultimate sacrifice—losing his own life after insisting that his younger brother be rescued first. By the time his rescuers returned, Jordan was gone. Once the water began to recede, Australians responded by giving millions of dollars to the Premier’s flood appeal and by arriving in Brisbane by their thousands to help with the clean-up.
In my electorate, numerous local clubs, pubs, community groups, churches and individuals have held fundraisers and made substantial donations to the flood victims. Entertainers have donated their services to help at fundraising events. Local performing arts groups have held a variety show and raised thousands to support the flood appeal. Rotary clubs throughout the mid-North Coast region have been working to raise money and provide emergency assistance.
In Brisbane, thousands of Aussies arrived at volunteering centres. Some even drove from Sydney to help. Armed with shovels, mops and gum boots, they set off to spend a day helping total strangers clean mud and debris from their homes and businesses. Australians can truly be proud of the way they responded to the flood crisis.
Although spoken over 300 years ago, the words of French moralist Bruyere describe perfectly the response of the Australian public to the flood crisis when he said:
There exist some evils so terrible and some misfortunes so horrible that we dare not think of them, whilst their very aspect makes us shudder; but if they happen to fall on us, we find ourselves stronger than we imagined, we grapple with our ill luck, and behave better than we expected we should.
The floods in Toowoomba and Brisbane reminded us of the awesome power of nature, but they also reminded us that Australians can be counted on to help when disaster strikes.
In my own electorate of Cowper we did not escape unscathed from the flooding, with much of the Clarence Valley experiencing significant inundation. The towns of Ulmarra and Maclean, Minnie Water and Wooli were isolated for some days. We saw inundation in areas around these towns but, fortunately, the levee system held to prevent major damage to these centres. Unfortunately, many local farmers and business owners have experienced significant disruption and damage as a result of this flooding.
The Leader of the Opposition was kind enough to visit the region and he saw firsthand the impact that these floods had on local businesses and particularly on primary producers in the area. In particular, we saw significant destruction of the local sugarcane crop, with a loss of new plantings and young crops, which will certainly manifest itself in a very low yield in around 2012, when the crop for that year should be down by as much as 50 per cent. Our local fishing industry suffered badly. Having suffered difficulties in recent years, these latest floods set the industry back further. Local dairy farmers also suffered the impact of this local disaster.
It is worth noting that almost every corner of my electorate has been affected by flooding at some stage in the past two years—from the Macleay valley in the south through the Nambucca and Bellinger valleys, Coffs Harbour, the Orara Valley and of course the Clarence valley. Natural disasters have become an expected part of life on the mid-North Coast. But, despite the fact that we expect floods to come, the damage is never easy to repair and the lost wages and income are gone forever.
One aspect of natural disasters that is often overlooked is the impact of infrastructure damage on local councils. Local councils are responsible for most of the roads, bridges, footpaths, sewerage systems, drainage and other local facilities. At the best of times, councils struggle to pay for the maintenance and repair of these facilities. When natural disasters strike, finding the money to pay for reconstruction and repairs is almost impossible. Even with Commonwealth and state government assistance, some important local infrastructure simply cannot be properly repaired within a reasonable time frame, if at all. Damaged in the devastating floods in 2009 in my electorate, some rural bridges and roads have only just been reconstructed, and at least one important regional road link is not yet fully repaired. These local pieces of infrastructure are vital to regional communities, and the reconstruction task force in Queensland must ensure that local councils have sufficient resources to quickly repair and rebuild the roads, bridges and other facilities damaged by the floods.
The scale of the natural disasters that we have experienced in the past few months is unprecedented. Seventy-five per cent of Queensland is a declared natural disaster area. Much of northern New South Wales has been declared a natural disaster area, plus areas of western New South Wales that perhaps will not see flood peaks until late March. Victoria has suffered through widespread floods. Western Australia, as I have said, is struggling with bushfires.
In the face of these daunting challenges, Australians have shown the world that we will not be defeated. No matter what nature throws at us, we will rebuild. We will help our mates through tough times. We will come back bigger and stronger than ever. On behalf of my electorate, I would like to make it clear to the people of Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales that we feel your pain, we will support you through these most difficult times and we will be there to help in the future.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—The sheer scale of the natural disasters that have affected so many parts of Australia but most particularly Queensland is, quite simply, unparalleled. Floods, cyclones and fires have all done their utmost to wreak far too much havoc across the nation. We know that three-quarters of Queensland has been declared a disaster zone, but I want to make it clear today that the effects, the grief, the shock and the empathy have been felt far, far more widely than that. Like all Australians, my thoughts remain with those who have lost so much in these tragedies—those who are still dealing with the daily grief of having lost family members or friends and the thousands who have suffered shattering effects. Across Queensland, people are already starting the mammoth task of cleaning their properties and reconstructing their homes, businesses and lives. I stand here today to assure them that they will not do so alone.
Whilst in Adelaide we may be far, geographically, from the devastation of the floods, in all other senses we have been right there. We have felt the pain, we have grieved the loss and we have resolved to rebuild alongside our fellow Australians. I rose to speak in the chamber today because I wanted to highlight to those affected the truly remarkable and generous solidarity that I have witnessed in the community that I am lucky enough to represent in this place. The overwhelming message that we send you is to reassure you that we will stand with you in your time of need. I also wanted to place on record my gratitude to those who have stood up as local heroes within the portfolios that I represent and the fact that we will use these portfolios to help ease the recovery process and help the long process of rebuilding.
I cannot explain the generosity that I have witnessed firsthand in my local community. Like so many other members in this place, my office and I have worked hard to assist with fundraising. Standing outside various shopping centres with a bucket in my arms, I cannot tell you the number of times that total strangers who were walking past placed money—in some cases loose coins and in many cases the last note out of their wallet—in that basket whilst remarking: ‘I have already given, but I can’t forget those pictures. I can’t forget the images, the stories I’ve heard, and I’m more than happy to give again.’ We kept hearing this, time and again, in all different parts of the electorate. We heard it from people who had a lot but also from people who had very little but who were more than willing to donate that little.
There were a group of dedicated Adelaidians who organised, wrote, directed and pulled together a charity ‘SA 4 QLD’ pantomime within just a week or so. I must say that the embarrassment and humiliation that I personally felt by taking part in said pantomime was well worth the over $100,000 that was raised in that one night by that one group of South Australians.
My electorate office has become a collection point for the Shoe Boxes of Love initiative, with over 200 shoeboxes being donated from across South Australia. People are bringing these boxes to do anything and give anything that they can to help the pain of total strangers on the absolute other side of our continent. So, to those of you who are affected, I can say with absolute confidence that you are not alone, and the people of Adelaide most certainly stand right with you.
Just as the community will not walk away from the recovery task, neither will the government. Over the previous weeks we have heard some amazing stories of courage. We have heard of some remarkable heroes—from the rescuers, from the SES personnel, from the Army and from a whole range of different service organisations—but there are also thousands and thousands of untold stories of local heroes, of people doing small things within their community and standing up and being counted when it really mattered. I think it is really important that we hear some of these stories too. I would like to take a little bit of time to share with you some of the stories of courage and generosity that I have been lucky to hear from within the portfolios of child care and employment services as well as to inform the parliament what we will be doing in those portfolios to assist with the recovery.
On the days when the floodwaters were at their highest there were a number of instances throughout Queensland of parents physically not being able to collect their children from child care because of localised flooding. One can only imagine when going through these sorts of ordeals how much harder it gets knowing that you cannot be there with your young child during what is a terrifying experience for you both. One such case was at the long day care centre at Withcott. It had become completely isolated. The centre could not be reached by parents; the children could not be reached by their parents. That was on the first night.
That evening staff members went above and beyond the usual call of duty, caring for five very anxious and very scared little people throughout the night because they could not be with their parents. Although I would expect nothing less from the hardworking and dedicated early childhood care staff throughout this country—we are so lucky to have them—this was obviously a particularly difficult day on the job. It was handled with the utmost calm and professionalism. It was done without expectation of thanks or recognition. Today I give credit to the staff members of the Withcott Early Childhood Centre for that extraordinary contribution.
Some 21 Queensland long day care centres have been identified as having significant flood damage that will require medium and in some cases longer term remediation. Nine outside school hours care services have been affected seriously, with most of these services located on the grounds of local primary schools. In addition, 36 family day care services have been affected by floodwaters. Significant damage has occurred in at least 17 of these cases. You can only imagine the double tragedy of losing your house and your business in the same go, because of course that is where they work from.
Many more childcare services have been both directly and indirectly affected. In the case of these services the damage means so much more than a badly damaged building. It means challenges for families in finding alternative care arrangements for their children. It means the loss of a business, which in some cases provides the income for an entire family. It means children losing a home away from home, one which they have formed a personal attachment to and become comfortable in.
There are some remarkably heart-warming responses from local communities, giving all they can to help affected childcare services. In addition to government support to get these centres repaired and back up and running, there has been a tremendous response from communities right across Queensland. The Riverhills Childcare Centre and Kindergarten suffered major flood damage. After the inundation, a volunteer who had come to the area to assist in the clean-up saw the damage and reported it to their church and then arranged for members of that church to become involved. Pretty soon there were over 100 volunteers involved in the clean-up and in donating toys and books so that the centre could recommence operation.
The church assisted in getting the service up and running. They are now planning the next steps of the rebuild. While the children are currently in alternative care and the rebuild will take some time, all associated with this service are determined to get it up and running as soon as possible. A huge amount of progress has been made as a result of the local contributions. The walls are already going up on the rebuild.
Like those communities, the Australian government has acted to provide immediate assistance to childcare services and families using child care in flood affected communities. Measures under local emergency provisions have included providing favourable treatment for absences of care or due to service closure. This decision alone has allowed families and childcare services to access an additional $12.4 million in childcare benefit fee relief just during this emergency period.
Families experiencing financial hardship as a result of the flood disaster have also been able to more readily access the special childcare benefit, which covers the full cost of child care. As at 30 January 2011, around $1.1 million in special childcare benefit entitlements had been provided to affected families. Rules relating to operational subsidies will also be relaxed for eligible childcare services under the Community Support Program to smooth out potential decreases in funding where fewer children have been placed in child care during the emergency period.
As in child care, we will ensure that within employment services we step up to look out for those fellow Australians who have been affected. As always, it is the case with large-scale disasters that those who are hardest hit are often those who can least afford it. There are more than 73,000 unemployed Queenslanders living in flood affected areas and their resources to cope have been sorely tested over the past weeks. I wish to assure the people of Queensland, and indeed all Australians, that all the necessary assistance has been provided to these job seekers and to the employment services that support them.
To ensure that much needed income support has continued to flow to job seekers who have been affected by the floods, Centrelink has implemented a number of measures. Flood affected job seekers are eligible for an exemption of up to 13 weeks from their usual participation and job search requirements. This means that those who have been hardest hit will continue to receive payments from the government without having to actively look for work or take a job if one is offered when they are working on their own rebuild and putting their lives back together. It will allow these individuals to concentrate on rebuilding their lives and supporting their family through the difficult time in the immediate aftermath of the flooding. Activity and personal contact interview rules have also been relaxed, and Centrelink staff have been asked to review any penalty decisions that were made immediately prior to the floods.
Of course, it is not just job seekers who have been affected as a result of the floods but also the hardworking staff who provide job services to the unemployed in these areas. There were 26 employment service providers across 112 sites that were impacted as a result of flooding in Queensland. To put this in context, those services were working directly with over 29,792 job seekers. Fortunately, once the floodwaters had receded and the necessary clean-up and repairs were completed, the majority of employment services were able to reopen and, in the spirit that characterises so many of the hardworking individuals who provide these support services, many immediately applied their minds, their money and their materials to ways that they could help their communities to recover.
One service provider, Mission Australia, established a temporary call centre to assist Volunteering Queensland to manage the many calls from the public wishing to volunteer for flood recovery tasks. Mission Australia volunteers handled over 1,000 calls on behalf of Volunteering Queensland. There was a clear need, and the agency used its organisational capacity and facilities to provide the rapid response that was required.
I should also add that it was not just employment service providers that were willing to pitch in. There were local job service providers who were inundated with calls from their clients asking for advice on how they could come and help, on how they could assist. Job seekers have assisted—whilst being under no formal obligation to do so and in receipt of no remuneration to do so—with cleaning, land clearing and fence repairs.
There have been countless stories, right across Queensland, of people stepping up when the community required them to do so. I want to put on the record just how proud of and grateful for all of those efforts I am.
Obviously, the reconstruction and recovery phase has begun and I believe that in the weeks and months ahead Queenslanders and other Australians will be well served by our employment services. Their priority will be for locals to secure the jobs that will flow during the next phase.
However, we also have to be realistic. The loss of housing and infrastructure, much of it essential to those local economies, has been absolutely incredible. The construction effort will require skills and labour—and, for some months and even years, much additional labour, which will not always be available across the vast distances which were affected by the floods. Acknowledging this, the Prime Minister has announced a doubling of the size of the relocation assistance pilot for people on income support and the directing of it to Queensland. This means that up to 4,000 eligible job seekers who want to get a job helping out with the reconstruction efforts will now receive financial support from the Australian government to move to Queensland with their families and assist with the rebuild.
The only thing that I think will linger longer in my memory than the images of beautiful, sunny Brisbane literally under water or some of those horrific images of cars floating down streets—images that you would never normally dream of seeing—is the strength and determination of Australians, including Queenslanders, in giving generously and in helping each other, their families and neighbours, to rebuild. On the days that the floodwaters peaked, I, like so many Australians, sat watching in awe of the utter devastation caused. It seemed unbelievable, and the task of recovery and rebuilding seemed so very great. But we are already seeing the spirit and the determination of so many to step up and make that a reality, and it is important that, as a parliament, we note that right around Australia there are people who are committed to helping out their fellow Australians during this very tough period.
Of the portfolios I hold, there is one that I have not mentioned yet today: that of the status of women. I want to place on record that I think there is nothing that embodied Australian generosity, and the resilience of Queensland, better than our two female leaders, Anna Bligh and our Prime Minister, doing an extraordinary job, standing up and coordinating these efforts to rebuild. They have done a tremendous job to date. I have every confidence that we will see a state rebuilt stronger and more beautiful than ever. I also want to place on the record my sympathies for and my heartfelt empathy with the people who have suffered during these national tragedies. But we endeavour to rebuild and recover together.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—On behalf of the people of Macquarie, I rise today to offer our deepest sympathies to all Australians affected by the natural disasters which have taken place across our nation in recent months. To all who have made a contribution to the relief effort, whether through donations or a simple hug, during these dramatic and testing circumstances: I acknowledge your selflessness. Australia is a nation with a huge heart where mates help their mates in a very practical way. Communities met and mastered challenges—and, of course, we all know there are more ahead—not with words but with conviction and compassion, by putting their commitment to care for their fellow Australians into action.
Across our nation, roads, bridges, rail lines, power, telecommunications and utilities were destroyed, damaged or cut off, homes and cars were destroyed and, sadly, Australian lives were lost in natural disasters that will live long in our memories. Few states were left untouched, with floodwaters also surging into New South Wales and Victoria, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. As rivers breached their banks and raging waters and flash flooding reached record levels, so too did the Australian spirit. Every day revealed a new challenge. The media coverage graphically displayed the tragedy as it unfolded, touching the hearts of all of us as we watched desperate acts of courage, and inconsolable despair and grief as communities mourned their losses and counted the personal cost. After the floodwaters had subsided, we were all inspired by the massive response of thousands of volunteers who rolled up their sleeves to lend a hand as the mammoth clean-up got underway.
The people of the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains are no strangers to natural disasters and can empathise with the flood and fire victims, having experienced the flooding of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers as recently as 1990, with peaks in excess of 13 metres. Fires also ravaged the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury in December 2001.
As recently as last week Sydney temperatures exceeded 40 degrees in a week-long heatwave that broke all living records. Fires in the Megalong Valley, Ebenezer, Blaxland Ridge and Mulgrave were brought under control by the hardworking Rural Fire Services brigades of the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains, avoiding what could have been another potential natural disaster.
I make a very brief mention of these events to highlight that there are many Australians who would feel a connection to those affected by the recent floods and fires, and with that connection come the understanding, support and mateship that are necessary in the emotional recovery and rebuilding process.
In the Hawkesbury local resident Toni Walker was responsible for organising the Shoe Boxes of Love campaign that saw locals buying items that would be appreciated in the flood ravaged areas of Queensland, using a shoebox as the packaging, wrapping them and then dropping them into either the Hawkesbury Community College or my office. Over 300 boxes were collected from Hawkesbury residents in just two weeks from the start of our project—a great achievement. The boxes were transported to Queensland by Robert and Paul Campbell’s Charter Refrigerated Transport, while Hawkesbury Self Storage in South Windsor donated the packing boxes for transport and the University of Western Sydney Hawkesbury campus gave us the use of a van and a driver to get the boxes to Charter Refrigerated Transport. It was a great team effort.
I have lifelong friends in Gatton. They have a business in Laidley. I have chatted to them in recent weeks and during the tragedy. In fact, I spoke to my dear friend while she was sweeping out the business. At that point in time she was still standing knee-deep in water. She described how, while some of the businesses there would be able to start again and it would be a long road ahead to rebuild, there would be many that would be unlikely to recover and start off again.
In Central and South-East Queensland in excess of 17,500 homes were flooded or isolated by floodwaters, along with 3,000 business premises. In Far North Queensland, Cyclone Yasi damaged homes and businesses, flattening fields of sugar cane and destroying approximately 80 per cent of the banana crop, as well as leaving nearly 200,000 people without power at times last week.
In New South Wales, Weddin, Wellington, Warrumbungle, Cootamundra, Coonamble, Harden and Young shires were all declared natural disaster zones. In Victoria thunderstorms and flash flooding left 25,000 without power. In Tasmania heavy rain and flash floods ravaged the northern coastal areas, while Western Australia is battling fires that, as of Monday, had seen 59 homes razed.
Our hearts go out to all who have lost loved ones and personal possessions. It is vital that we acknowledge the efforts of all of the hardworking men and women from the emergency services organisations—the fireys, the police, SES workers—and the countless volunteers who worked day and night across affected states to answer the calls of those in need. Their work and service continues. I understand some of the SES volunteers from Macquarie dived in and went to help our neighbours in northern New South Wales. In that same vein 1,200 Australian troops were called to action, providing much-needed expertise, strength and emotional support to those in need.
During the floods three C130 Hercules from the Richmond RAAF Base aircraft and mobile air load teams were active throughout Queensland for Operation Queensland Flood Assist. Their tasks included delivering groceries to Charleville and Bundaberg, delivering rations to Mackay for use in Rockhampton and dispatching more than 100 tonnes of groceries from RAAF Richmond to RAAF Townsville, where they were then trucked south.
On New Year’s Eve a C130 Hercules transport aircraft with Defence staff on board took off from the RAAF Richmond airbase with a flexible habitat—a 100-person purpose-built temporary accommodation for residents of Emerald, 900 kilometres north of Brisbane. On Tuesday, February 1, two C130 Hercules from RAAF Base Richmond headed to Cairns with an aeromedical evacuation team to evacuate hospital patients before Cyclone Yasi hit. This highly successful operation saw 173 patients transferred from Cairns area hospitals to Brisbane. What made their effort even more courageous was that it took place in the dead of the night and was organised with very little notice. A C130 transported 40 litter patients, 13 walking patients and one family member as an escort, while another C130 took 32 litter patients, 10 walking patients and one family member. Two C17A Globemasters from RAAF Base Amberley also assisted in the operation, transferring another 101 patients.
RAAF Base Richmond’s cyclone support did not stop there. They have been supporting Operation Yasi Assist consistently since the cyclone hit the North Queensland coast last Wednesday night. On Thursday and Friday last week a pair of C130 Hercules flew into Cairns with mobile air load teams and forklifts from Richmond and Amberley. Their task was to unload cargo from the aircraft and break down that cargo at the destination. On Saturday, 5 February they sent one Hercules with communications equipment, water and food to Innisfail via Townsville. They also sent two Hercules loaded with groceries, one carrying 11 tonnes and the other with 13 tonnes, to Cairns from Richmond. Once in Cairns, the groceries were used to stock shelves for local residents. They did the same again on Sunday. The presence of an Australian uniform provides hope, comfort and strength. These men and women do us proud. To you all, we offer our gratitude and sincere thanks.
It is vital that we not lose sight of the fact that this rebuilding process is as much about healing the hearts and minds of the flood and fire victims as it is about rebuilding roads, power lines and bridges. It is important to pause and pay our respects to the victims of the floods and cyclone in Queensland and their families and, in so doing, to also reflect on the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of lives that were saved by the collective efforts of professional and well-trained emergency services personnel, police and volunteers.
I again extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who lost loved ones, and to the people who have lost their homes, their livelihoods and their personal treasures. May you be comforted by the spirit of community and mateship so remarkably demonstrated by the unflinching courage of the rescuers, the professional management of the emergency response teams and the army of volunteers who spread to all regions during the crisis and clean-up. It is a long road ahead. It is at times like these that the Australian spirit inspires us to action, and this action will be required for a long time ahead.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I too wish to add my sincere condolences to those who have had loved ones ripped from their arms by the terrible events of the last few weeks, to those who are still suffering and still recovering from the floods, the fires and the cyclone that have devastated so many parts of Australia this terrible summer. It is very clear that the worst of times bring out the best in us. We have seen evidence of that by the truckload over the last few weeks.
We have seen it from the men and women of the Defence Force on the ground and in the air, from those who have been maintaining our Black Hawks, our Chinooks, our Sea Kings, our C130s and C17s and our Bushmasters. We have seen it in the incredible work of all of the emergency services personnel, local counsellors and frontline healthcare workers, and people—and they have been mentioned previously in this debate—who volunteered their time to set up emergency facilities and feed people. We have seen it in the work of the people of Brisbane, people who have opened their arms—who have picked up brooms, shovels and mops—to help out total strangers whose homes have been damaged by the floods.
We are a good people in an unforgiving land. When bad things happen we are capable of doing some amazing things. We saw evidence of that not just in the streets of Brisbane or the streets of Rockhampton or Tully or elsewhere; we also saw it many miles away in the streets of my electorate, in the streets of Bankstown. We felt it through our television sets. We sat glued, night after night, in disbelief when we saw floodwaters rising through Rockhampton and then through the CBD of Brisbane. We were shocked at the sight of cars being washed through the streets of Toowoomba by raging floodwaters. I remember thinking, as I was going to bed on 2 February, the night before Cyclone Yasi came through Far North Queensland: ‘What will happen when I wake up? Will the people of Far North Queensland still be alive when I wake up tomorrow morning?’
Our response so many miles away has been one of incredible and overwhelming generosity. On 14 January, I went to my local train station, Bankstown train station, with some local SES volunteers to raise some money for the victims of the floods. I was hoping that between 6.30 and 8.00 we would raise around $500. I was stunned when we raised more than $3,000 in just those 2½ hours. So we decided, ‘That’s not good enough. Let’s keep going.’ We went to Bankstown Centro, our local shopping centre, and we had people throwing $50 notes at us. We had one man give us $500 cash. There were lots of people emptying their purses, giving us every coin they had in their purse. There were lots of mums and lots of grandmothers who would give a two-dollar coin or a five-dollar note to their grandchildren and ask them to come up to us and put that money in our tin. Others apologised that they did not have any money to give.
I think people were so generous in large part because they were so affected by what they had seen on television. Another reason they came up to us was that standing next to me were men and women in orange uniforms, the men and women of the SES. That is why they reacted in such a powerful way. It reminded me of the respect that the community has for the people of the SES.
I would like to use this opportunity to mention some of those men and women who helped me over the course of those three days: Michelle Niven, Denise Lynch, David Johnston, the incredible Jordan Ross, who got one donation for $500, Eileen O’Hea, Kathleen O’Hea, Stuart Miller, Carol Bassam and David Drake. Carol and David are not in Bankstown anymore.  They are up in Far North Queensland helping out with the clean-up after Cyclone Yasi. They will be joined by four others from Bankstown SES.
This is just one example of the generosity of spirit of the people of my community. There have been many others. Many organisations have put together fundraisers at short notice. It is not unique to Bankstown—I am sure many members have had the same experience in their own communities—but I want to pay tribute to them, to their generosity and to the time they have taken. The Lebanese Muslim Association raised $15,000; Bankstown City Council gave a cheque for $20,000; Bankstown Sports Club came forward with a cheque for $25,000 and $20,000 worth of furniture; Bunnings at Bankstown raised $3,900 through a sausage sizzle; Bankstown Lions Club, about $5,000; the United Muslim Women Association, $10,000; Bankstown RSL, $8,000; Auburn Gallipoli Mosque, $12,000; and Vietnam Sydney Radio, $45,000. I spent two hours on the radio urging people to donate. We got $10,000 in two hours. One little girl, who was eight years old, rang up to donate $50. I asked her why she was donating, and she said: ‘Well, it’s what I saw on television. I need to help people like me,’ and I thought that was really touching.
The Vietnamese-Australian Charity Organisation held an event called the Golden Heart charity dinner. They have done this before. The Golden Heart charity dinner was first held after the bushfires two years ago, and they raised $50,000 that night. This time, the call went out, the invitations went out, and 1,000 people responded to that invitation within three or four days. It was all sold out. They had 200 or 300 people that they could not fit in—people said they just wanted to stand at the back of the room. They raised $145,000 in one night. Let me use this opportunity to thank the man who organised that, Dr Vinh Binh Lieu, who subsequently was named the Bankstown Citizen of the Year.
I also thank the Chinese association of Western Sydney. They held a similar event and raised more than $120,000 in one night, including one donation from a gentleman named Henry Ngai, the owner of a company called ABC Tissues. His donation was $50,000. I went to a Chinese lunar new year event hosted by the Indo-China Chinese Association New South Wales last Saturday. It was a week after Cyclone Yasi had torn through Far North Queensland. I told them that that cyclone hit Far North Queensland about midnight on 2 February. That is an important date, because it is also New Year’s Eve for our Chinese and Vietnamese friends. It meant that we were moving from the Year of the Tiger to the Year of the Rabbit. The Year of the Tiger is supposed to be a ferocious year; the Year of the Rabbit is supposed to be one that is calmer. Certainly the Year of the Tiger has been a very ferocious year. I told them that I would like to think that that cyclone was not as deadly as we feared that it might have been because, just as it struck, we moved from the Year of the Tiger to the Year of the Rabbit. I do not know if that is true or not, but I hope it is and I hope that we have a calmer year after the ferocity of the last few months. That day they raised another $20,000.
There are many other organisations who I have not mentioned or whose work I am not aware of at the moment, but what I do know is that the people of Bankstown and the people of Cabramatta already have raised close to half a million dollars for their fellow Australians, and we are not a wealthy community. I am proud of the way Australians have responded in the worst of times over the last few weeks, this terrible summer, and I am proud of our community for the way that we have responded.
Debate (on motion by Mr Clare) adjourned.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Condolences,11,2
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—by leave—Over the last several weeks, we have faced a consular crisis in Egypt that has been highly complex and highly unpredictable. Our first responsibility as a government is to do whatever is possible to maximise the safety of Australians. This is invariably a challenging task given that at any one time we have more than a million Australians abroad. This has been doubly challenging given the fluid state of Egyptian politics.
From midnight Friday, 28 January, and into the early hours of Saturday, 29 January, consular staff were called into Canberra to deal with the rapidly unfolding crisis. DFAT’s Crisis Centre was activated 24 hours later and has operated on a 24-hour-a-day basis since. On 30 January we also raised the level of alert to ‘Do not travel’—I am advised ahead of all of our like-minded consular partners around the world. The government announced the first Qantas charter flight on 31 January. Two Qantas charter flights carrying a total of 294 passengers (30 of whom were foreign nationals) departed on 2 and 4 February. With the support of the Australian government, another 54 Australians and their dependants departed on five Canadian charter flights. The Australian embassy set up five locations to support Australians in Egypt: at the embassy itself, at the Conrad hotel, at the Novotel hotel, at Cairo airport and at Alexandria airport. In all those locations, except at Alexandria airport, we maintained a 24-hour presence for most of the week.
As the security situation deteriorated, the practical problems faced by our consular staff on the ground became more complex, challenging and at times dangerous. Roadblocks set up on the main routes to the airport created safety and security concerns for our staff—including one group of staff who were detained for several hours until the ambassador negotiated their release. These staff were doing their duty—verifying the safety of the route before we dispatched Australian citizens to the airport that day. Back in Canberra, over 300 officers were involved in the government’s response. Our crisis centre took over 4,000 calls and our operators made over 7,500 calls to confirm the safety and welfare of Australians. In Egypt we deployed 45 officials to support our embassy and another 12 to Frankfurt to assist Australians with onward travel.
Several Australian journalists were also detained while covering these events. I spoke twice to the Egyptian foreign minister to convey the government’s strong concerns for the safety of Australian journalists and other foreign journalists and our expectation of all possible assistance from the Egyptian government to ensure their wellbeing. The Australian ambassador also made early and persistent representations to seek the release of the Australian journalists who had been taken into incarceration, and the embassy has remained in close contact since to confirm their ongoing safety and wellbeing.
I would like to pay special tribute to all our public servants and local staff who worked tirelessly around the clock in Canberra and in Egypt, together with our friends in Qantas, to ensure that Australians were evacuated as quickly and safely as possible in an extremely volatile environment. For example, Tricia Martino was our regional consular officer in Dubai and one of the first on the ground in Egypt. She worked for three days straight at Cairo airport, in chaotic conditions without even having time to go back to the embassy to get a change of clothes. Tricia was one of those detained with a group of Australian officials while scoping routes to the airport and held for several hours.
Mahmoud Tawab, a driver at the Australian embassy in Cairo, deployed to the airport for more than a week, despite having to leave his wife and two children, who were restricted to the Cairo suburb of Maadi after curfew. Mahmoud tirelessly delivered food to stranded Australians within the airport premises, within the terminals, and shielded small children and elderly Australians through the at times violent scrum of passengers trying to get onto planes.
Tricia and Mahmoud are just two examples of the outstanding dedication of our staff on the ground in Egypt, under the leadership of our ambassador, Stephanie Shwabsky. I spoke to Stephanie practically every day during the height of the crisis, sometimes several times, and I can confirm to the House that our ambassador represented the absolute best traditions of the Australian diplomatic service in her handling of this crisis.
I personally spoke to a group of Australians who had been evacuated from Egypt. Some were highly traumatised by their experience, and had seen violence first hand; bullets flying and dead bodies on the ground. But they were grateful for the support the Australian Embassy had provided. Joanne Burgess of Epping, who was one of the participants on one of the evacuation flights, described our diplomatic and consular officials in the following words:
I cannot speak too highly of your staff. Each and every one of them deserve not just my personal thanks, but as a nation we can be proud that these people are representing us overseas and here in Australia.
The trauma of dealing with what we saw and experienced in Cairo and other parts of Egypt was so much easier to deal with, because DFAT and Qantas staff had organised and planned for every contingency.
…            …            …
The whole team looked after us so well, it was hard to believe that they don’t do this sort of evacuation more often. The evacuation was carried out professionally, but also with characteristic Aussie humour. … At the Airport, your staff had to deal with many big and small issues, like babies and Egyptian husbands without Australian Immigration visas, unaccompanied minors, young Aussie/Egyptian men being pulled out of the final passport check queue by Egyptian police to check if they had done their military service, before they were allowed to leave the country … all of this, under a growing hostile Egyptian police presence. Your staff were calm cool and determined. Their presence helped and reassured us through those final minutes in Cairo.
…            …            …
It is such a small thing to say thank you to those men and women in Cairo and in Canberra for all they did for us on Thursday 3rd and Friday 4th of February 2011. What they did for us went far beyond just doing their job. They had been working tirelessly around the clock not just for our flight but for the previous flight the day before. They always put our comfort ahead of their own. These are wonderful people … I was never more proud to be an Australian. So my sincere thanks go to each and every one of your DFAT staff and to our Prime Minister. I am so glad to be home ... thank you.
There is a firsthand testimony of the work done by our diplomatic and consular staff on the ground. These were difficult and challenging times; not everything would have gone to plan—not everything could have gone to plan. But I salute our staff and the excellent work that they did on the ground in the face of a crisis.
No-one predicted the scale and duration of this crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians turned to the streets of Egypt’s major cities demanding a more open and transparent society and greater economic opportunity. Late last year, I reiterated that the continuing global democratic deficit represented one of the great global challenges for the decades ahead. This deficit is particularly evident across the Middle East. Democratic transformation through properly elected democratic forces is also the best long-term underpinning of security and stability.
I have spoken to the foreign minister of Egypt several times during this crisis, most recently on Tuesday. I have also spoken to the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa. I have said that the Australian government’s position is that fundamental political reform in Egypt must begin now; that this should be achieved peacefully, that the security forces must refrain from violence, that the rights of people to protest must be protected, that the rights of journalists must be protected and that this expectation is shared by our friends and allies across the international community.
In the course of the last week, I have also discussed the wider ramifications of the crisis with the Quartet representative to the Middle East and former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the EU’s Special Representative, Catherine Ashton, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other foreign ministers attending the Munich Security Conference last weekend when the future of the Middle East was a primary subject of discussion.
The political situation in Egypt remains volatile. The political situation across the wider region is also fluid. This includes the current impasse in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The external strategic environment surrounding these negotiations is changing. It is in our view increasingly imperative that these negotiations be brought to a successful conclusion. We believe this course of action would best support the long-term security of the state of Israel, as the security of Israel remains of deep concern to the Australian government. It also would provide for an independent Palestinian state and the opportunity for stability and economic growth for the Palestinian people.
Conclusion
The Australian government will continue to support democratic transformation both in the Arab world and beyond. Australia holds democracy to be a universal value and a right of all peoples. And the promotion of democracy remains an important part of this country’s foreign policy objectives into the future.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Egypt</title>,Ministerial Statements,12,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—The world has watched developments in some countries of the Middle East and North Africa over the last few weeks with a mix of trepidation and guarded hope for the future. Ruled by authoritarian regimes, typically with close links to the military, many of these nations have been relatively stable for years—decades in some cases. That stability has come at a cost based on the oppression of opposition parties and individuals and a suppression of people’s desire for greater freedom.
It is often said that the nation of Egypt is pivotal, as the Arab world’s most populous nation, with more than 78 million people. While estimates vary, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Cairo, and other cities 17 days ago, demanding greater freedom and the resignation of President Mubarak. The situation quickly descended into running street battles between the police and the protesters. Concerns were raised for the estimated 700 Australians registered to be in Egypt at that time although it was believed that the real number could be several thousand more, including dual nationals.
I commend the efforts of our consular officials, who must have been overwhelmed by calls for assistance. Their work was further hampered by the decision of the regime to shut down communication networks in their attempts to prevent the growth and momentum of the protests. The Australian government responded to the crisis with increased staff. However, while the international airports remained operational, commercial flights were heavily disrupted.
I know that members of our parliament were contacted by Australians in Egypt and, from my experience, both the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did all they could to assist. Two Qantas charter flights were arranged which evacuated more than 350 Australians. One of these flights carried an Australian woman who contacted my office via friends in Australia. I spoke to a very emotional Roseanne at 4 am Egypt time and reassured her that every effort was being made to ensure her safe return to Australia. I maintained contact with her over the following few days. I put on the record that when her case was brought to the attention of the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs it was quickly resolved. I am pleased to report that she arrived home safely and I thank the foreign minister for his personal interest in that matter as well as many others—there were a number of similar instances. We hope and trust that all Australians are now safe from harm or, if they have chosen to remain in Egypt, are taking all necessary precautions for their safety. I acknowledge again the efforts of our diplomatic and consular officials in responding to the needs of Australian citizens at this time.
It has been widely reported that the Egyptian protests were instigated by the recent overthrow of the Tunisian government and that has been seen as the impetus for change in other nations. The Tunisian protests were sparked by the death of a young man who, forced to sell fruit on the street, set himself alight when his produce was confiscated. To put the Egyptian crisis in context, it is fair to assume that economic hardship and poor employment prospects, coupled with corruption under oppressive regimes that suppressed basic freedoms, are at the core of many of the grievances not only in Tunisia but also in Jordan, Yemen and Egypt, leading to calls for significant economic and democratic reform.
While the motivation for the protests is deeply complex, varying from nation to nation and often without apparent and visible leadership, the increasing cost of living is undoubtedly adding fuel to the anti-government fires. While food inflation and global food prices are not the underlying cause, they have been a potent trigger. There are parallels to the unrest with the food riots in 2007-08 that threatened the stability of government and societies in numerous countries around the world. At that time, record high food prices were described by World Vision’s Tim Costello as an ‘apocalyptic warning’ about food security. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation’s global food index recently passed the record levels of 2008 with the price of cereals increasing by almost 40 per cent last year and cooking oils up by 55 per cent. The FAO is warning governments against any action that could make the situation worse, such as stockpiling. However, this call is unlikely to be heeded by governments under massive pressure from protesters, and we have seen and read reports of Egyptians struggling to pay for basic food items.
It is with great sadness that we have read reports of deaths and injuries among the Egyptian people who have taken to the streets to have their voices heard. The protests have gone through distinct phases with a period of calm following the initial clashes with police and security forces. There were fears of the nation falling into chaos after the police were overwhelmed by the protests and they effectively abandoned their posts. This was followed by the deployment of the army, which was welcomed by the protesters. Fears of a massacre were raised after the pro-Mubarak forces appeared to launch attacks on the protesters and at times sustained gunfire could be heard. The army was criticised for not preventing this conflict and it moved to keep the two sides apart, thus restoring a semblance of relative calm. The army remains the critical player in the eventual resolution of the impasse.
The key demand of the protesters is that President Mubarak resigns from his office. Mubarak has offered up numerous concessions, including the appointment of a deputy president for the time, and he has appointed a new government. His vice-president has reportedly held talks with opposition figures, including representatives from the banned Muslim Brotherhood.
Many people around the world are hoping that Egypt can manage the peaceful transition to a new, more open government that provides its citizens with a genuine say in the running of their country. There are also great concerns that Egypt could follow the path of Iran, where a peaceful uprising against an authoritarian regime was quickly overwhelmed by radical Islamists, and that is why most attention rests on the Muslim Brotherhood. While it is generally accepted that the brotherhood represents only about 20 or 30 per cent of the population, it has managed to survive decades of repression by the Mubarak regime. This makes it by far the most organised and best equipped organisation to fill any vacuum in power. The respected US analyst organisation StratFor published a report on 5 February that ended with the following words:

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—Events often sweep us up so quickly we fail to appreciate the enormity of them at that particular point in time. It is only later, when we have the opportunity to assess what has occurred, that we are truly staggered by the impact of the events. I often reflect with constituents in the electorate that the amount of water that travelled through Queensland would have covered an area the size of France and Germany combined. When you look at the intensity of Cyclone Yasi, it was the same as that of Hurricane Katrina. Can you imagine these two events having an impact elsewhere? It would have rocked the attention of the world. In this case we had two major events affecting one state in one month, so I say again that the enormity of the events of the last month have been staggering. We stand now to console the grieving. We have solemn regard for the great sacrifice of self. We recognise the service of others and we join in a collective journey on a long path of recovery for Queensland.
Many were impacted this week by the Prime Minister’s words of Tuesday in marking our condolence. Reading her speech, in particular, has made an equal impact. I wish to quote her words:
Healing great pain requires both coming together as human beings and lonely moments of quiet reflection.
This is where we stand together as members today. Across the country Australia has been moved by these events, and we match the enormity of these events with our own generosity and the generosity of the Australian people. I am proud to see the way that residents in the Chifley electorate and across western Sydney have bound together to assist those in great need. This weekend alone, for example, there were a number of events. Mount Druitt Rotary Club, led by Lindsay Trevitt; and the Mount Druitt Standard, our local newspaper, with its editor, Steve Darcy, held a fundraising barbeque on Saturday. It was a very hot day, but the event was designed to catch the donations and generosity of the people in Mount Druitt. The Filipino community came together as one at an event called ‘Shine’ in Bowman Hall in Blacktown to raise funds for the premier’s relief effort. Later that day the Pakistan Association of Australia, chaired by Iftikhar Rana, held a special fundraising dinner as well, again designed to generate funds for our friends in Queensland. All through the weekend, through those three events alone more than $30,000 was generated for the premier’s relief fund. It is truly a great symbol of the effort and commitment to help those people in need, and it reflects greatly on people’s willingness to do so much to help others in great need.
I also wish to make particular mention of people within the Public Service within the electorate of Chifley, with particular regard to Mount Druitt Centrelink. A number of members of Mount Druitt Centrelink went very quickly to Queensland to assist in the overall effort of aiding people in need. I congratulate them and commend them. I also commend the people of the Mount Druitt area who have understood that taking quite a number of people out of the office at Centrelink will impact them in the short term. They appreciate that this is being done to help Queenslanders coping with truly terrible events. I would like in the debate on this motion to recognise their efforts.
The nation’s heart truly ached on a number of occasions through the last few weeks, but none more so than hearing the story of Jordan Rice. Such sacrifice—we cannot begin to imagine the strength within that young boy. To be able to do what he did impacted so many people and demonstrates the power of love and kinship. The impact of that event rippled across the world. I wish to draw to the attention of the House that this week the foreign minister of Bosnia visited Australia and was hosted by the government. He brought with him a special package. That was a series of letters that had been written by schoolchildren in Sarajevo of Bosnia-Herzegovina who had been so moved by the events of Queensland. They had taken the time individually to write and wished to pass their thoughts, their feelings and their condolences on to the family of Jordan. I was exceptionally moved by that. The Bosnian foreign minister handed that package to Foreign Minister Rudd, who is going to be delivering this to Mr Macfarlane as the responsible federal member to pass on to the family.
I do not believe it would be appropriate to read those messages at any great length here, because I think that they will want to convey those sentiments. I just want to make reference to one statement which I think, regardless of language and regardless of background, we would all truly be moved by. It reads as follows:
I hope that you will find comfort in the pride of having him for a son, the small boy who lived as a great man.
That statement was from one child to another across oceans, demonstrating the depth of human emotion and the bonds of kinship we feel regardless of country and regardless of distance. It is a truly moving sentiment and I wish to thank the Bosnian foreign minister, Sven Alkalaj, for delivering those letters to us.
I also want to extend my regard and deep thoughts for parliamentary colleagues from both sides of the chamber who have dealt with exceptionally difficult circumstances, not only in their electorates but also with their own families, having themselves as representatives of their communities worked tirelessly to assist those who required help and support, and just being there in many cases as a presence to deliver strength to people who were looking for some sort of help. They do that in a way—and I think it is important to note this in the chamber—that puts their own regard aside. They make sacrifice as individuals themselves to help out, and I wish to extend to them an acknowledgement of what they are doing in very trying times.
I have spoken to the member for Blair on a number of occasions, and he has been telling me of the impact on his electorate. Through the course of that he mentioned to me, being a Queenslander and being attached to sport—I think it is genetically imprinted in Queenslanders to have that deep love of sport—that the Ipswich Basketball Stadium had been devastated by the floods. He told me that five metres of water had swept through and ruined that stadium. It will cost about $800,000 to fix. I had occasion on Friday night to catch up with the chief executive of Basketball Australia, Mr Larry Sengstock, who is an NBL living legend and was part of the ferocious Brisbane Bullets. He has also made a great contribution to Australian basketball with the Boomers. He is a Maryborough boy, and he was telling me that there are a number of events in Queensland where Basketball Australia and representatives of the game are intending to help out wherever they can to raise funds. I mentioned to him about Ipswich and said that I hoped that he could help out. I am told by the member for Blair that basketball runs second to rugby league in terms of popularity within Ipswich and it would be a great deed if they were able to chip in and help out in an area where sport can help bring people together in a very powerful way. Hopefully they will be able to do something in the short term to assist.
I wish to leave my remarks at that but pass on deepest regards from the residents of Chifley, who are in their own way, along with residents across in the electorate of Greenway, trying to do whatever they can to raise needed funds to help our friends in Queensland get back on their feet and become the great state that it is again.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,15,1
"Vasta, Ross, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion of condolence in relation to the natural disasters that have so significantly impacted on so many communities across Australia this summer, particularly the natural disasters that have devastated my home city of Brisbane and my state of Queensland. Firstly, I would like to offer my sincere condolences on behalf of all the residents of Bonner to the families and loved ones of those whose lives were so tragically lost. In particular, I acknowledge my colleagues from both sides who lost members of their communities. I know that your communities will never be the same again. I also offer my sincere condolences to everyone who suffered throughout the recent floods and Cyclone Yasi—to those who lost their personal belongings, including many irreplaceable memories, and those who returned to find their home, their ‘castle’, devastated.
Unlike those of so many of my Queensland colleagues, my electorate of Bonner was not significantly impacted by the flood in Brisbane only a matter of weeks ago. This is somewhat miraculous, given that we border on the electorate of Griffith, which I know suffered significant loss. There was certainly concern raised for the suburbs of Murarrie and Hemmant in Bonner but, given the Brisbane River did not rise to the levels originally predicted, it seems that many families and homes in these suburbs were spared. However, as many in this House would know, the eastern border of my electorate is in fact Moreton Bay, the mouth of the Brisbane River. I have had a lot of people contacting me, voicing their concerns about the plume of mud and debris dispersing through Moreton Bay.
The enormous amount of water that flowed down the Brisbane River brought with it thousands of tonnes of silt containing pollutants which are now settling in Moreton Bay. The Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management, the Healthy Waterways partnership, the CSIRO and several Queensland universities have deployed research teams into the bay in the last couple of weeks so as to understand the dynamics of the flood plume and its likely effect on seagrass, fish, dugongs, turtles, coral and other marine flora and fauna. I am completely behind these efforts and thank the many organisations for their dedication and care. So many people’s livelihoods depend on the ongoing health of Moreton Bay.
Throughout the darkest days of the flood in Brisbane, my office was able to largely remain open to assist many of the residents with information and direct people to specialist assistance as required, but this was done by only one staff member and me. All the other members of my staff were forced to remain in their homes—most without power—because most of the major roads had either been cut off by floodwater or were required by emergency services. While I readily admit that this is no real impost compared to those who were evacuated or remained in their homes hoping to hold back the water, it does give this House a sense of the gravity of what occurred and that there are few people in Brisbane and across the state of Queensland who have not been touched in some way.
Given the scale of the disaster, what I have found incredible over the last few weeks has been the community compassion in Bonner for those who have been impacted. The community spirit that emerged in the face of this disaster was a true testament to the generosity and kindness of local residents. Never before have so many people offered their help and support to those in need. I know that many in my community assisted those threatened by flood waters by filling and moving sandbags and I know that so many offered their time to volunteer in the clean-up. I saw a legion of volunteers rise up with their rakes, buckets and shovels and line up at the Brisbane City Council volunteers stations. They worked tirelessly in the mud, moving tonnes of debris, bit by bit. At MacGregor State School, just outside my electorate, I was humbled and proud to witness the thousands of volunteers who lined up patiently to help those who had been affected. They were ordinary people who just wanted to help in any way they could to do their bit and get their fellow Aussies back on their feet. In my eyes they are extraordinary.
On another practical level, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all members of the local community who so generously donated goods for inclusion in special flood care packages. My office was overwhelmed by the community’s generosity in responding to the call for donations of hygiene products and other sanitary goods that are so often forgotten in care packages for those hardest hit. The local community was truly inspiring in their call to action. Thousands of much needed hygiene and basic sanitary products were received by my office and those were divided into over 100 care packages that were donated through the Red Cross to assist flood victims who lost everything. My electorate office has continued to collect donated goods for more care packages, including things such as deodorant, razors, shampoo, conditioner and other basic hygiene products, this time in conjunction with Liberal-National Party Women to support those affected by cyclone Yasi.
I would like to place on the record my admiration and appreciation for the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman. Lord Mayor Newman displayed incredible leadership throughout the ordeal faced by Brisbane residents, and I would like to say thank you. There is still a big job ahead in rebuilding Brisbane, but if anyone is up to that task it is Campbell. Also, I have organised a fundraising initiative, which I will talk about at another time, to assist the victims of the floods.
On a final note, I would like to thank all Australians who have so generously donated to the various flood appeals that have been organised over recent weeks. Your generosity is humbling and, as a Queenslander, I say thank you. Again, I reiterate that the thoughts of all members of the Bonner community are with those who have been affected by recent events.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Natural Disasters</title>,Condolences,15,1
"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—I rise, as many others have and very appropriately, to convey my condolences and that of the 140,000 people in my electorate to all of those who have been affected so badly by the floods and the cyclones—and the bushfires, for that matter—around this country over the last few months. Very fortunately, I represent an urban electorate on the bay in Melbourne. We have been removed from these events, although we got a small taste recently when the tail ends of two of the cyclones that had moved through Australia resulted in unusual and very strong rains. That saw flooding in some streets in my electorate, including near my house, and gave us some sort of insight as to how quickly these things can happen. It did not result in any significant damage but some inconvenience to some families in my electorate.
My electorate, like so many others, has in some respects being struck dumb by the extent of damage and destruction that has been wreaked by the floods and the cyclones throughout so many parts of Australia, including my home state of Victoria. Many people have given very generously to ensure that in some way they can play their part in the reconstruction and give the assistance that will be needed over a long period of time. From the floods and cyclones in the north to the floods in the south and the fires and floods in the west, these disasters have resulted in very far-reaching effects and have impacted families and businesses. The geographic reach of the disasters has been wide. It has also affected Tasmania. In nearly every corner of Australia we have seen the impacts of these natural disasters. I offer sincere condolences to all of those affected in so many places and in so many ways but particularly to the families of those who lost their lives or have been seriously injured in the various floods and Cyclone Yasi.
I also wish to express my enormous admiration and that of the people that I represent for the many thousands of volunteers and the many millions of Australians who have so generously donated. It has been a very uplifting experience that in the middle of such devastation we have seen the best of Australians.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—We have heard many poignant addresses to the House in relation to the natural tragedies which have befallen Queensland and other parts of the country. The Sunshine Coast fared rather better than many other areas in Australia, however I want to draw the attention of the House to the plight of the tiny hinterland community of Conondale, close to Maleny, which suffered considerable damage, including localised flooding, which is still impacting upon the community long after the floodwaters have subsided. Bridges and roads need attention and there have been considerable erosion and landslips. I inspected the area with the state member Andrew Powell and it was clear that much work needs to be done. It is important that the state and federal governments, when attending to the reconstruction of infrastructure, do not overlook small communities.
The Prime Minister’s office said that prioritisation has been delegated to the Queensland Premier’s office. I have contacted the Premier asking that the community of Conondale in the Sunshine Coast hinterland not be forgotten. It is an important community. (Time expired)

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—Over the last few weeks, every Australian has witnessed the devastation that so many regions of this country have suffered because of the summer of disaster. We have all seen the devastation. We have all felt for the people impacted. All of us, right around Australia, obviously want everything that is humanly possible to be done as quickly as possible to help those people bring their lives together again in the wake of these terrible disasters.
Everyone wants to see the reconstruction happen soon. Everyone wants to see the reconstruction happen right. Everyone wants to see the reconstruction properly funded. The difference between this side of the House and the other side of the House is that the government wants to see it funded through an unnecessary new tax and members on this side of the House want to see it funded through affordable, achievable, sensible savings from unnecessary government expenditure.
We have had a tough summer and we need a strong government to respond. A strong government should expect at least as much of itself as it does of its citizens. A strong and brave people, as Australians are, deserve a strong government not an indulgent one. That is why the Prime Minister should be putting her hand into the government’s pockets to meet the cost of flood reconstruction. She should not be putting her hand yet again deeper into the pockets of struggling Australian families.
But this is not the last raid on the Australian people that this government will be perpetrating this year; it is but the first attempt by this government to pick the pockets of the Australian people in what will be the year of the big new taxes, if this government has its way. There is the mining tax, there is the carbon tax and there is the higher tax on people with private health insurance. The Prime Minister says, ‘Oh no, you don’t need to worry, it’s just a temporary tax; trust me,’ just like she asked us before the election to trust her that there would be no carbon tax and to trust her that there would be a climate change people’s assembly. We simply cannot trust this government when it comes to tax because this is a government which cannot cut its own spending and, because it cannot cut its own spending, it now wants the Australian people to cut their spending. It is just wrong.
The Prime Minister was at pains to say that the cost of reconstruction would be very high, that the government was facing a very big bill—$5.6 billion. I agree: that is a big bill. But it is just 1½ per cent of the government’s annual income. It is about 10 per cent of what the government is gladly spending on the National Broadband Network. It is just 30 per cent of what the government has spent—and in many cases wasted—on the Building the Education Revolution program. In fact, the $1.8 billion that the Prime Minister’s new tax will raise is about the same as the cost blow-out that this incompetent and extravagant government perpetrated in the school halls program and it is even less than the $2.4 billion that the government completely wasted in the pink batts program. It did not hit us with a levy for the National Broadband Network. It did not hit us with a levy for the BER. Now it is hitting us with a levy because it has been so wasteful and extravagant in the past. The government should pay for its mistakes. It should not try to make the people pay for its mistakes, which is why we have this unnecessary new tax.
There have been cyclones before in this country, there have been floods before in this country, but never before has there been this kind of unnecessary new tax because there has never before been a government of quite this level of waste and incompetence. Why should the Australian people be hit with a levy to meet expenses which a competent, adult, prudent government should be able to cover from the ordinary revenues of government? It raises $350 billion a year and it cannot find $1.8 billion to meet what should be something that a prudent government could find out of its ordinary revenues.
There are people in Queensland and Victoria today—tens of thousands of them, in fact—many of them on low incomes, who have to spend tens of thousands of dollars just to make their flood and storm impacted homes habitable. They will get no insurance payouts. They will get precious little assistance from government. People earning less than $50,000 a year will be expected to spend far more than $50,000 just to make their homes liveable. They will not be putting their hand out to anyone else, yet this government cannot do the minimum that it is doing without putting its hand deep into the pockets of Australian taxpayers. This is a government with an income of $350 billion a year that cannot find $1l.8 billion without a new tax. To put that into perspective, it is like someone with $350 in his pocket who cannot find $1.80 for a good cause. The Australian people know what it is like to have to tighten their belts in tough times and they deserve a government which is capable of tightening its belt when it faces unforeseen extra expenses.
It is true that the Prime Minister did announce as part of this package some cuts. She announced cuts to programs that should never have been announced in the first place, like the cash-for-clunkers programs. She announced cuts to programs which the coalition had already committed to cutting and which it was roundly criticised for by the government. This government should not be given any credit for reversing decisions that should never have been made in the first place, and certainly this government should get no credit whatsoever for cuts to flood mitigation works on the Bruce Highway. What sort of a government, in responding to a flood disaster, would cut spending on flood mitigation works? At the heart of the government’s response is a new tax. This is not just any new tax. According to the Prime Minister in this very House this morning, the new tax at the heart of this government’s flood response is ‘an expression of goodwill between Australians’. This is a tax and a half—it is an expression of goodwill. It is ‘a way of honouring the dignity and resilience that Australians have shown throughout this ordeal’. Isn’t that fantastic! The next lot of people to get gongs will be hit with a new tax because that is how this government thinks you should honour people—by hitting them with a new tax.
I said this week that the Prime Minister has a decent heart, but I tell you what: she has got a tin ear. She sure does not understand anything about mateship, because if she understood anything about mateship at all she would know that mateship is not taxing people; mateship is helping people. She would know that mateship is not what you are taxed to give; mateship is what you choose to give. She would know that mateship does not come from governments; it comes from people and communities.
It is true, as the Prime Minister has also said, that the Howard government did impose some levies, but the Howard government did not turn a $20 billion surplus into a $50 billion deficit. People trusted the Howard government with money, and the only way the current government thinks it might be trusted with money is by appointing a Howard government minister to oversee it. The only person in the Gillard government who could be trusted with money was in fact the former member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, and he is gone because he did not trust the Prime Minister and he would not come back—and she would not even ask him to come back; instead, she turned to John Fahey.
We know that there is fat in this budget because the Prime Minister keeps telling us that if the bill is more than $5.6 billion there will be more savings. If more than $5.6 billion is needed, there will be more savings, she says, not more taxes. Well, if there are more savings to be had, let us take them now. If there are more savings to be had, let us take the fat off government, let us not take ‘the lean’ off citizens.
This week the shadow Treasurer and I put forward a raft of further savings, real savings over the forward estimates, real savings to eliminate the need for real tax increases. These are the proposals that I would like to sit down with the Prime Minister and discuss in a spirit of bipartisanship. These are the proposals that I would like to discuss with her in a spirit of national unity brought on by this flood crisis. If she really does want to bring the nation together—to ‘get them through this together’ as she said to the parliament today—she would take up this offer to sit down and negotiate savings in a spirit of national unity. If she has got more savings, if she has got better savings, I am only too happy to agree to those extra savings in a spirit of national unity. As things stand, people have suffered enough, and they do not deserve to suffer through a new tax. The one thing that they will never have to suffer under a coalition government is an unnecessary new tax, a tax that could easily be replaced by savings found from the budget.
I fear that we are already seeing signs from this government of the same kind of incompetence and ineptitude which blighted its delivery of so many programs in the past, such as the school halls and pink batts programs. The Treasurer says that his tax will raise $1.8 billion, but he cannot say how many people will actually pay it. The Prime Minister says that she will pay $5.6 billion out, but she cannot say what it will actually be spent on. The Prime Minister tells us that this new tax is just a cup of coffee a week, but what we heard today was that the cup of coffee a week becomes a coffee machine a week in the case of some taxpayers. The Prime Minister says that flood victims will not pay the tax. That is simply wrong. Donors will pay, volunteers will pay and victims will pay. People who have lost their businesses but not their homes will pay this new tax.
The task of government is to respond intelligently to the problems of the nation. The task of leaders is not just to feel people’s pain; it is to solve their problems. I hope that the Prime Minister, in the weeks and months ahead, can confidently address the people’s problems despite her previous failings, but I know that, unless she changes her mind, she will add to their pain with this unnecessary tax. As far as this government is concerned, 2011 is the year of new taxes; as far as this opposition is concerned, it should be the year in which governments finally start to live within their means.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Flood Levy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,25,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—We have been through a dreadful summer, a summer where Australians have turned to each other, a summer where Australians have shown that they want to look after each other. Australians have acted to help each other. Australians are now looking to this parliament to give them the leadership the nation deserves at this time. Australians know that the nation needs to rebuild from the devastating summer that was. When Australians turn to this parliament they do not expect to see this tragedy being used for cheap politicking. They do not expect to see this parliament degenerate into a rabble around what needs to be done to rebuild the nation. Instead, they expect decisions to be made and action to be taken, and as Prime Minister I am going to do just that.
That is why I have outlined a $5.6 billion funding package. That is why I have outlined plans to start the rebuilding now. That is why we are prepared to make a $2 billion payment available to Queensland. That is why we have set in place measures to make sure value for money is obtained, including a reconstruction inspectorate, including audited accounts, including a national partnership arrangement and including the involvement of people like Mr John Fahey and Mr Brad Orgill. We want to get on with the job of rebuilding the nation. That is what the national interest requires. And the national interest requires this burden to be shared. Yes, the government have to make room for it in their budget—and we have. We have done it through making some tough and difficult decisions. We have done it through reprioritising infrastructure to deal with questions of capacity constraints. We have done it by making sure we streamline the skilled migration we may need to build the nation. We have done it by making the decisions necessary to get unemployed people to step up to the jobs they can get in rebuilding the nation. We have put together a comprehensive package and, yes, it includes asking Australians for a contribution too. That is the right thing to do at a time when the nation needs it. At every point we have been motivated by the national interest.
Unfortunately, what we have seen on every occasion from the Leader of the Opposition is the national interest cast aside in pursuit of narrow political interests. At a time when Australians were turning to each other, urging each other to dig deeper for flood victims, the Leader of the Opposition was out there asking them to dig deeper to fund the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition is very keen to throw insults around; let me say this: I have never seen such a tin heart. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition may have been let down by his party organisation, but what he needed to then do was say they had done the wrong thing. But he was asked by Barrie Cassidy:
But to do it in that way, to attach it—
the fundraising request—
to a letter detailing information about the floods—you don’t think that was just a little insensitive and in poor taste on the part of the party?
And the Leader of the Opposition replied:
Well people will make their own judgements.
Never a truer word was spoken. People will make their own judgments on a man who did not condemn fundraising for the Liberal Party when the nation was turning to fundraising for flood victims.
On the question of the national interest versus narrow political interest, what we have seen on each and every occasion is the Leader of the Opposition out there seeking to pursue narrow political interest. Did you hear his speech at the Gold Coast to a group of Young Liberals, when the nation was still reeling from the shock of these natural disasters, before we were even touched by the cyclone and there was more devastation to come, when the people of Queensland and Brisbane were looking at their houses filled with filthy floodwaters and wondering how they were ever going to clean up? There was the Leader of the Opposition on the Gold Coast in front of the Liberal Party faithful, trying to work out how he could surf these floodwaters into Kirribilli. That was the main thing on his mind—all about his political interest. Could he use this somehow to put pressure on the Independents to make a different decision about the composition of the government? It is narrow political interest every step of the way.
I say to the Leader of the Opposition: people would take him more seriously if the narrow political interest had also not been on display in putting together his so-called alternative package. When we laboured over the $5.6 billion funding package, we laboured in the interests of the nation. The Leader of the Opposition and his team laboured over the reports of focus groups to help them work out what was in their political interest, as reported in the newspaper. Were they studying documents to work out the national interest or studying documents to work out his political interest? We all know the answer to that.
Let’s just go through the hypocrisy that is driving the Leader of the Opposition’s campaign. He is not opposed to tax. He was a member of a government whose tax as a share of GDP was as follows. The tax to GDP figure of the Howard government when they left office was 23.5 per cent.
—A record.
—This is a man who is not opposed to tax. Someone just said it was a record; actually, it was not the Howard government’s record, I dread to correct. Actually, the Howard government record was at 24.1 per cent. This is a man not opposed to tax. Currently, tax as a share of GDP is 20.9 per cent. This is a man not opposed to tax. The Leader of the Opposition is out there saying he cannot support the levy because he does not like burdens and he worries about all of this. That was his track record on tax when he was in government.
What is his track record on supporting levies? The most remarkable thing—or probably not the most remarkable; one of the most remarkable things—about the few weeks that have been is that, before I was talking about a levy, it was supported by members of the coalition. Senator Joyce and Senator Ron Boswell were out there supporting levies. As soon as I announced the levy, the coalition was opposed to it. What does that tell you? That is telling you it is all about them working out the politics, not working out the nation’s interest. When the Leader of the Opposition was in government, he was very, very pleased to support levies. He gave the superannuation surcharge levy the tick. He gave the gun buyback levy the tick, though someone on $60,000 paying that levy in 1996-97 was being asked for a bigger dollar contribution than we are asking them for today. Have a think about that—a bigger dollar contribution than we are asking them for today, but he gave that one the tick. He gave the stevedoring levy a tick, the milk levy a tick, the sugar levy a tick, the Ansett Airlines levy a tick and the proposed East Timor levy a tick. Indeed, he was so fond of levies that he went to the last election promising a $6 billion levy to fund his election promises.
Now, of course, he comes into this parliament and says he could not contemplate a levy to rebuild the nation. What hypocrisy is this? It was good enough for the Leader of the Opposition to propose a levy to fund his election promises but it is not good enough for him to support a levy to rebuild the nation. It is all about the political interest, not about the national interest—not at any point.
Then the Leader of the Opposition says, ‘Savings should be made on the budget.’ Savings have been made on the budget—hard savings; proper savings; properly costed savings. The Leader of the Opposition never understands that because he has never made a hard saving or a properly costed saving. We know one of the single biggest reasons he is sitting in the chair of the Leader of the Opposition is that, when he was called on to deal with financial questions during the election campaign, he created an $11 billion black hole. This is his track record when it comes to financial management questions: no expertise; no track record; no idea.
So, against this backdrop, you would have thought the Leader of the Opposition might have thought to himself, ‘It can be a bit hard to do all of this—work the budget out.’ But, no, he was out there on 27 January saying, ‘It’s easy enough to find savings; it’s easy enough.’ Then there were days and days and days and days of delay. What finally came out of the process, quickly cobbled together, with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition desperately fighting back against cutbacks she did not agree with? What has come out is a package that does not stand up to any scrutiny.
Let us just go through it. It delays funding under the BER. They want tradespeople to walk off half-completed jobs in schools. I say to that: give us the list. Let us know which schools. You should do that if you are a decent person. They, of course, have succumbed to an email campaign. So desperate were they for savings that someone scrabbled through their deleted emails and found a campaign about cutting $500 million to Indonesian schools, and they all looked at each other in their desperation and division and said: ‘That’ll be good enough. Why don’t we whack that in there?’ But no-one bothered to tell the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She knows this is wrong, she knows this is against the national interest and she should be saying it loud and long.
Then, of course, they said they are going to cut back water entitlement purchasing through the Murray-Darling Basin. What an act of contempt for the people of Adelaide! What an act of contempt to say that they are not worth the reform that the Murray-Darling Basin requires! The Leader of the Opposition has never found a good day to buy back water entitlements. When the river is in drought, no, you cannot buy them then, because the river is in drought. When the river is in flood, you cannot buy them then. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if we are going to do this long-term reform, we need to buy back water entitlements. He should not treat the people of Adelaide with this kind of contempt.
Then, of course, there are GP superclinics. The Leader of the Opposition has never found a healthcare cutback he did not love, so we are not surprised that is on the list. Then he wants to rip money off disadvantaged schools around the country. There’s a smart one: get the most impoverished kids with the fewest life opportunities in the nation and make sure they continue to have the fewest life opportunities in the nation! What an offensive suggestion from a man who was a member of a government that never bothered to do anything about disadvantage in schools! Of course, this list of shabby opportunism just goes on. It does not add up. It does not make sense.
Honourable members interjecting—
—I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he has the ability to show that he can rise above the persona that he has developed so far. He has the ability to show he can rise above the three-word slogans. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: now is the time to put down the polling. Now is the time to cut out the scare campaign. Now is the time to toss away the lines document his advisers have given him and do something in the national interest, and that is to support the government in rebuilding the nation, including the levy. That is the right thing to do. It is what people are looking at this parliament to do.
Honourable members interjecting—
—This levy is responsible, it is fair, it is temporary, it is in the national interest and I support it. I believe the Australian people will understand why we are asking them to make this contribution. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he should support it too. He has no alternative. He has no credibility. His own frontbench do not agree with the figures he put out earlier this week. In those circumstances, it is time for the Leader of the Opposition to say: ‘I made an error on this one, I am a man capable of acknowledging that and I will support the federal government’s levy. I will support rebuilding the nation.’ That is the right thing to do. It is what Australians are looking for. Do not go mining for the political interest; act in the national interests. Australians are better than the Leader of the Opposition thinks. They will support this levy—it is the right thing to do—and so should he. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—The Prime Minister continues to disappoint. She continues to disappoint those who expect better from the occupants of the high office of Prime Minister. At a time when this country is looking for leadership, the Prime Minister becomes a partisan point-scorer. We disagree on the tax; we disagree on how reconstruction should be funded; but we do not impute bad motives to the government. Yet the Prime Minister, in her speech to the House just now, made it personal. She suggested bad faith. She suggested bad motives. She has impugned the reputation of members on this side of the House. She continues to disappoint. She is unable to reach the high standard that is expected of a Prime Minister of this country.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I ask the speaker to refer to the Prime Minister as the Prime Minister.
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—I am sure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is aware of the provisions of standing order 64. The Prime Minister should be referred to as the Prime Minister.
—I do note that the Prime Minister now has a penchant for the personal pronoun at every turn.
May I suggest that it is time for the Prime Minister to take a reality check on the current debate in this country on how to fund reconstruction necessary after the recent natural disasters? There are three undeniable facts. First, it is true that an individual instance of a natural disaster may be unforeseen; that is a fact. However, secondly—and this is a very important point—natural disaster as a policy issue is not unforeseen. That, too, is a fact. We know that a natural disaster happens in some form, and probably occurs, every month of the year in Australia, whether it be drought, storms, floods or bushfires. You do not have to be Nostradamus to be able to predict that. Donald Rumsfield would probably call it, ‘an unforeseen foreseen event’.
That then leads to the third undeniable fact: governments should always be ready for natural disasters. Natural disasters are not uncommon in Australia. Indeed, every federal budget must make contingencies to meet the government’s obligations to rebuild in the face of natural disasters. However, the government—in the long tradition of Labor governments—has opted for the tax route—the lazy way out—to raise a special tax to undertake one of its core responsibilities. Instead of funding it from the money it has already extracted from the Australian people by way of taxes it is going to impose yet another tax.
It is a core responsibility of government to be ready for such events. However, because in the space of three years Labor have squandered the magnificent financial position created by the Howard government over 11½ years, they have to resort to a new tax. Previous governments did not require a new tax to fund the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy; the previous government did not need a new tax to repair the damage after Cyclone Larry; there was no special tax to fund the needs of a 10-year drought; and there was no special tax to deal with the floods of 1974. Good budget management tells you that you should not rely on one-off tax rises every time a natural disaster occurs.
It is like taking out insurance; it is a prudent financial decision that should be written into any risk assessment. Instead, the sad fact is that the government is still recklessly borrowing $100 million a day to feed its spending binge. As the shadow Treasurer said yesterday, the government is spending $45 billion on interest repayments over the next four years alone. That is $45 billion on the debt it has run up because it cannot manage a budget. It would not know a surplus if it fell over one. Over the next four years the government intends to spend $1.5 trillion, and we should not underestimate the long-term damage that Australians will have to wear because of Labor’s economic mismanagement.
It cannot organise itself, with the huge revenues it already collects, to finance one of its core responsibilities. Instead, Labor defaults to a new tax. It is part of its pavlovian response: tax and spend, tax and spend. Over the last three years Labor has increased taxes on cars, it has increased taxes on alcohol and increased tax on cigarettes. Its history of waste is just appalling. The waste flagship is the Building the Education Revolution. This Prime Minister’s legacy from her days as the education minister is billions of dollars wasted under ministerial incompetence that we have not seen before in this country. It is a shameful record. Then there were the home insulation programs—massive waste—the solar heating program and the laptops in schools program. Labor has wasted multiple times the amount of money it hopes to collect from the flood tax.
The government has a budget of $350 billion every year, but it cannot find $1.8 billion to repair the country after the natural disasters we have experienced. It cannot find $1.8 billion without Australians having to pay another tax. Labor has actually been exposed on this one because, in a moment of candour, the Prime Minister admitted that if the reconstruction costs were in excess of the estimate she could find the necessary cuts. We plead with the Prime Minister: identify those cuts now. It is not the time to raise the cost of living by slugging Australians with new taxes. People have been hit hard by the floods, Australians are already experiencing rising interest rates, the cost of living is on the rise, electricity prices are rising, schooling costs are rising, transport costs are rising, Labor’s National Broadband Network will result in higher costs for basic communications and the government plans to introduce this year not only a flood tax but a carbon tax and a mining tax.
What is quite extraordinary, though, is that yesterday in question time the Treasurer could not tell us how many people are going to be hit by the flood tax. He could come up with the final number of $1.8 billion but he had no idea how many people would be paying it.
—In question time yesterday he gave the answer.
—In question time yesterday he had no idea. This will be a kick in the guts to small business people. There are no exemptions for small business from the tax, even if their commercial properties were hit by the floods or cyclones. In a very telling exchange yesterday, the member for Brisbane noted that a small business in her electorate was flooded up to its ceiling, lost vital equipment, suffered $200,000 worth of damage and was out of business for two weeks but had to pay the tax. We asked the Prime Minister about it and her response was—and I ask members to listen to this:
On the question of payment of the levy, the exemptions for payment of the levy, because we are talking about personal income taxation, are being figured off the personal arrangements that we have under the Natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements—that is, eligibility for the emergency money under the Australian government disaster relief payment and associated payments.
And, this is the point:
So the aim here in making those exemptions has been to exempt from paying the levy people who have been immediately impacted personally by natural disaster.
Impacted personally—as a product of the Labor machine, the Prime Minister does not understand that when you are a small business person your business absorbs your life. You are impacted personally. In fact, the response from the Prime Minister just demonstrates that the Labor Party has no concept of small business and how they are constantly propped up by family budgets to keep those businesses afloat.
All in all, this tax is an increased cost burden on the Australian people and the government should be doing everything it can to relieve cost burdens on the Australian people. This is not leadership; this is a lazy response from a lazy government. Its first response is always a tax. It is a shame that the Labor Party does not have robust policy debates within its cabinet, but the self-described zombies accept the lazy public policy efforts of the Prime Minister, whose policy record is a shambles on Medicare Gold, on cash for clunkers, on the citizens assembly and on the East Timor processing centre. This Prime Minister has no public policy feel. Her response is a tax. The government is incapable of showing any discipline when it comes to fiscal management. It cannot manage the money it already extracts from the Australian people. It will not be able to manage the tax it raises from this levy. The government should show some discipline. The government should not impose a tax on the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I think from this matter of public importance we have just seen why Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, is not fit to be Prime Minister of this country— because he has failed the leadership test. At a time when the country is seeking unity after the greatest natural disaster ever to hit us, he seeks to divide the community for his own political ambition, not because he has a credible alternative but for his own grubby political ambition. That is not leadership; that is shameful.
This is a nation that is in mourning, it is a nation that has been devastated, but it is also a nation that came together when it mattered. It came together in grief, it came together in emergency, it came together in its relief efforts and it came together in the clean-up. What people expect of us as a parliament is that we come together in helping them to rebuild. That is why we have sought to get bipartisan support for this position. Those who are the victims and those who have helped would ask nothing less than for us as a parliament to demonstrate a preparedness to work together. Of the members that I have been around with who said that same thing to me on the ground when I visited their electorates, inspected the devastation and talked about the need for a partnership and urged me that we have to work together, I cannot believe that they have allowed their leader, with very little internal debate, as I understand it, to announce this decision to oppose the levy.
The truth is that this is going to require a massive rebuild. This is something the country has not experienced before and, quite frankly, if we can get our act together, we can generate opportunity, we can generate hope and we can generate a rebuild which is stronger than that which was devastated. But it does require us to do it together. Everywhere that I have visited I have heard positive responses to our calls for the need for a national partnership to be involved in this rebuild. With the mayors that I have spoken with and the involvement of the regional development bodies—I see a member of the opposition laughs at the suggestion of the mayors being involved—I made the point that the mayors have a critical involvement in this selection because they will help us determine the priorities. We need to have that local input, we need to have their engagement and we need to have their commitment. That is why we have been out there engaging with them to achieve that very purpose. But we also need cooperation across the shires. That is why we need to look at the impact, particularly of the infrastructure losses, to see how the communities can be connected.
We have talked about the partnership not just with local government but also with state government, because the national disaster relief arrangements require that partnership by legislation. But it also has to be a partnership that involves the private sector, the insurance sector and NGOs. If we are to drive the partnership, we have to show the leadership. That is what this exercise is about. It is about this government, our Prime Minister, demonstrating that we are prepared to stump up, that we do appreciate the magnitude of the problem and that we are prepared to make a commitment, but it is a commitment that has to be achieved through a number of different mechanisms from our point of view. One of them is the levy, but the levy involves in a two-to-one ratio what we are prepared to put in through savings in the budget. In other words, the savings measures that we have announced to fund this effort contribute twice as much as that which would be raised by the levy.
Let me come to the levy question. I have talked about the lack of leadership demonstrated by the Leader of the Opposition, but his hypocrisy is breathtaking. This is a leader and an opposition—and I heard the interjections across the table during question time, particularly from the shadow minister for finance—who say that tax is not leadership. I think you had better go and talk to the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer about that test. Weren’t they the ones that introduced to the nation the mother of all taxes, the GST, on the basis of their saying, ‘This requires leadership and we are showing leadership’? They criticised us as an opposition for opposing them and said that we would not join them in that leadership. What cant; what hypocrisy. So don’t come in here and talk about that.
Quite apart from the GST, the mother of all taxes in this country, we have six levies that they introduced, including an 11c levy on milk. That raised $2 billion whilst it was in operation. Milk is basic food and they put a levy on it to fund the restructuring of the dairy industry. They talk about us not planning properly for natural disasters. Who could have planned for the one of the magnitude we have just had, I might add. But what about planning for the restructuring of an industry as important as the dairy industry? What was the solution? A tax on every Australian for every litre of milk that they purchased.
Then there was a 3c levy on every kilogram of sugar. Why? Because they failed so miserably in their negotiations for a free trade agreement with the United States that they left sugar out, sold the National Party down the drain and made the Australian public pay for it. Then there were the guns levy buyback and East Timor levy, both of those precisely the same formula as the levy we are proposing. So, for all the argument about the superannuation and the compensation, the levy that you imposed for the guns buyback and the East Timor levy would have applied exactly the same way. Do not give us any more of your cant and hypocrisy.
Then we had a levy for the bailout of Ansett. They refused to step in and try to save the airline. When the thing collapsed in front of them because of inaction, they put another levy on. Then there was the levy for the response to terrorism—a levy on reinsurance. That is six levies and a GST. This was a government that, when it was in under John Howard, became the highest taxing government in the history of the country and still retains the highest tax-to-GDP ratio that this country has ever experienced. Do not talk to us about taxation. Do not talk to us about tax not being leadership. By your own definition you fail the leadership test. They should get out of the way of this initiative.
Then they go on to say that they can do this without the levy. They say that they can do it by further cuts to the budget. Let us go to that. First of all, they delayed their announcement of what the savings were because they could not get their act together. Then they had squabbling amongst themselves about what was in and what was out. When they turned up to announce it, it was attended by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer but not, I note, the shadow finance minister, who is back in the chamber. He would not give it ownership. He would not dignify it, because he knew it was shonky in the same way as when they went to the last election with the promises of savings and we exposed an $11 billion hole in those savings. Now they say they want to build on it. I tell you what. Of the savings they put out the other day, $700 million was double counted. They had pocketed the savings before and already spent them. There is a pretty fundamental message in this: when you are looking to pay for something, you cannot spend money twice. If you do not understand that, it is another reason why you do not deserve to be in.
Not only was there $700 million that was double counted, $480 million of it was opposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who just spoke in the seconding of it. This is an opposition that has no credibility whatsoever. This is an opposition that is hypocritical. This is an opposition that is divided. What we have is a Leader of the Opposition desperately scrambling to shore up his leadership credentials, but he is doing it to try to drive disunity in the Australian public. What this nation requires is unity. It wants us to pull together. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition should drop his opposition to this tax or, at the appropriate time when asked, maintain a dignified silence. (Time expired)

"Christensen, George, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—In the wake of the massive disasters that we have had in my home state of Queensland—disasters which have impacted or will impact on just about every Queenslander in one way, shape or form, the answer that this Labor government has given is an answer that only a Labor government could give: ‘Let’s have a tax to solve the problem.’ It comes on top of the mining tax that they plan to introduce, which is going to impact on Queensland, particularly regional Queensland, where the mining industry is most active in employment. It is also going to come on top of the planned carbon tax, a tax which will hit every family through the power point and a tax which will again impact on regional Queensland, where mining creates jobs.
This year is truly going to be the year of the big taxes under the Labor government. When people are doing it tough in the community with the rising cost of living, these guys are going to slug them yet again. This Labor government think that people are earning too much and have to be taxed to pay for the government’s stuff-ups eroding the surplus that this side of the House left them. The people do not have the spare change or time to buy the proverbial coffee or cake a week that these people talk about when they talk about this tax. They are too busy paying off bills. They are too busy dealing with price rises. They are too busy trying to make ends meet. But what I find very shocking is that this Labor government has tried to tie their planned flood tax to the human misery that is associated with the widespread flood disaster in Queensland and now the Cyclone Yasi disaster in north Queensland.
The Treasurer bumbled about yesterday but eventually admitted that not one cent of the money from this flood tax is going to fix destroyed homes or property. Despite this, there is no doubt that the Treasurer, like the rest of the tax peddlers opposite, were trying to promote this flood tax as something that was going to help families rebuild their homes. While he denied saying such a thing in this chamber yesterday, the quote was in black and white. It said, ‘as we rebuild infrastructure and homes’. ‘We’ was the word he said—the government, not anyone else. He has tried to make this inference in selling this tax. The problem is he knows that the disaster payments that flow that he bumbled on about yesterday always flow from the federal government in times of disaster without a need for a tax. He knows that disaster payments have the support of both sides of politics.
The fact is the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the rest of this Labor government have been out there trying to con Australians into believing this flood tax is all about mateship. But the people out there demonstrated mateship in the weeks preceding the Prime Minister’s announcement of a tax when they donated hand over fist for flood victims. People in my electorate responded overwhelmingly, turning up to hand over money at charity concerts, at small fundraisers or by donating directly to a flood appeal. The local newspaper, the Daily Mercury, on the inspiration of its editor, David Fisher, decided to forgo profits for one weekend, donating it all to the flood appeal. So we have demonstrated mateship ourselves without compulsion. But they think this tax is all about mateship. Really? This tax is about a ship, but it ain’t mateship. It is about the sinking ship of debt that this lot has racked up in the last three years, leaving this nation not a zack to pay for rebuilding after these natural disasters.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Flood Levy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,25,1

"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—Today Senator Nash’s private senators’ bill, which sought to address the unfair changes Labor made to the independent youth allowance criteria last year, was passed through the Senate. This has been a big win for so many in my electorate of Calare—in particular, students, families and communities in the inner regional areas: places like Orange, Bathurst, Lithgow, Oberon, Blayney and the east side of Molong. In fact, almost the whole of the electorate is classed as inner regional. Since 1 January my office has had numerous complaints from concerned students, families and educators regarding the changes to the criteria. The full reality of the impact the changes are having is now being realised and many are struggling to cope, struggling to plan and wondering how they will get to university. Even if you live in the regional towns of Orange or Bathurst, in most cases it is more than likely that you will have to live away from home to complete your tertiary education. This is not political. Independent youth allowance is a basic necessity for regional students who want to complete tertiary education. The independent youth allowance debacle has gone on long enough and I am pleased to hear that the Independents supported the coalition in the Senate to pass this bill. I hope that the Independents in the House of Representatives will also rise to support the bill and show their electorates that they have students’ interests at heart.
Moving into 2011, the Calare electorate has moved to the Western New South Wales Local Health Network, and I am very pleased to say that we have seen some exciting developments. Whether to do with the movement to the local health network or not, there are some great changes happening. St Vincent’s Private Hospital is set to reopen as Bathurst Private Hospital on the grounds of Charles Sturt University. We recently lost St Vincent’s, which was a tragedy for Bathurst and the whole region because of the area it helped the Bathurst Hospital to serve. Its not existing means overloading Bathurst Hospital and that the spillover from Lithgow cannot go there or anywhere else. To place the new private hospital at the university has obvious educational and other future benefits for us. The $7 million Wellness House for Bathurst is also in the works. It will provide a one-stop shop for health services in Bathurst.
In Orange, the new Aboriginal Medical Service, which I was pleased to attend the opening of, was the first centre of its type in the region, and the model of care is the only one of its type in Australia. We are a region that is really ahead on trying to get more people of Aboriginal descent in as nurses and doctors, particularly those with the ability to do nursing in Bathurst and Dubbo. The new Orange Base Hospital is presumably only six weeks out from opening. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that health services have become less accessible for people in rural and remote areas, with major deficits in primary, GP, diagnostic, specialist and out-of-hospital care. While the developments that are happening in the region, private or otherwise, are great, these findings certainly do make us realise that Orange is the only serious centre of health in Western New South Wales.
Mr Speaker, I am also very pleased to tell you that over the next month or so we will be opening an electorate office in Bathurst to better service the new parts of the Calare electorate—Bathurst, Oberon and Blayney. That will make the opportunity of the people of those areas to come to me and mine to communicate with them much better.
I must congratulate a Lithgow butcher from Sunnyridge Valley Meats on paying $283 for lamb—as far as I can see, an Australian record—at Rydal Show last Saturday. Well done.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—I wish to make a statement on the consequences for my constituents of the government’s ill-advised rush to increase public spending in response to the global financial crisis. We are all familiar with the Home Insulation Program, which resulted in 120 house fires, 1,500 potentially live foil roofs and 240,000 dangerous or potentially substandard non-foil roofs. That resulted in a $424 million safety program, a $56 million industry assistance program and an Auditor-General report showing that overpayments were around $82 million—waste, waste, waste. We are all familiar with the Building the Education Revolution Program in which many schools were forced to pay over the odds for facilities that they did not want or were not fit for the purposes they required. We have heard far less about the social housing initiative. This is what the then Minister for Housing, the member for Sydney, said about the initiative in a media release following her visit to inspect a property at Hervey Bay:
The program is delivering great value for money ... I am delighted that a local building company is doing the work on this project and that seven local tradespeople are employed on site. This shows how important the stimulus plan has been in supporting local jobs through the global recession.
The picture is rather different in Coffs Harbour, I might say. In my electorate there is a Housing New South Wales contract for three social housing projects. It was let to a company called Perle projects. Perle has now gone into administration with debts of $9.8 million. The administrators, Rodgers Reidy, have reported that they are only able to identify fixed assets by Perle of $104,372.
There are serious questions to be asked about how such contracts came to be awarded to this company under the stimulus package by Housing New South Wales. There were also other projects let under this program to the University of New South Wales, to the Catholic Education Office and to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. I suspect the answers lie in the Gillard government’s compulsion to be seen to be doing something and in the New South Wales government’s lack of due diligence. The result is that 58 local companies are facing the prospect of getting as little as 10c in the dollar on individual accounts running into hundreds of thousands of dollars. This government and the New South Wales government have done more damage to these small businesses and the families that depend on them than the global financial crisis ever could. Once again, we have seen their bungling hurt the very people that their actions were intended to assist.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Cowper Electorate: Government Programs</title>,Constituency Statements,28,1
"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—I rise to talk about the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The main purpose of this bill is to strengthen the powers of the Australian Crime Commission’s Chief Executive Officer in dealing with ACC employees who engage in serious misconduct or corruption, and to strengthen the powers of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies to gather, examine and use evidence in the investigation and prevention of criminal offences.
The bill will align the dismissal powers of the CEO of the ACC to deal with serious misconduct and corruption with those of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, provide more flexible arrangements for appointing ACC examiners and extend the application of certain search related provisions in the Crimes Act that apparently only apply to searches conducted under warrants in relation to premises so that they also apply to searches conducted under a warrant in relation to a person.
The bill will also insert rules to govern when documents are produced under the Crimes Act; streamline and extend provisions governing applications for and determinations of orders in relation to the Crimes Act; allow the AFP Commissioner to delegate responsibility for dealing with things seized and documents pursued, again under the Crimes Act; introduce a new standing power for the Australian Federal Police to take fingerprints and photographs of arrested persons when taking them into custody in relation to a Commonwealth offence; and amend the Australian Federal Police Act to enable the commissioner to authorise a payment in special circumstances that arise out of or relate to a person’s engagement as an AFP appointee.
To expand a little bit on the amendments made by the bill, it will make two sets of amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act. As mentioned in the bill’s explanatory memorandum, schedule 1 will amend the ACC Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 ‘to provide the ACC CEO with powers mirroring those of the AFP Commissioner to deal with serious misconduct and corruption’. The main effect of these changes is that the ACC CEO will be able to make a declaration that a staff member’s conduct amounts to serious misconduct and can therefore ‘disapply’ the Fair Work Act 2009 in order to dismiss that staff member. The explanatory memorandum goes on:
Schedule 2 will amend the ACC Act to allow for greater flexibility in the appointment of examiners. The ACC Act currently only allows the appointment of full-time examiners. This does not meet the operational needs of the ACC. The amendments will allow the ACC to utilise part-time examiners as well as full-time examiners.
The bill will make a range of amendments that improve the operations of the Crimes Act. The bill’s explanatory memorandum notes:
Part 1 of Schedule 3 will extend the application of certain search-related provisions in the Crimes Act that currently only apply to searches conducted under warrants in relation to premises so they also apply to searches conducted under a warrant in relation to a person. These amendments will help police deal more effectively with electronic equipment, such as laptop computers and smartphones, located during searches under a warrant in relation to a person.
Further amendments to the Crimes Act include the following:
Part 2 of Schedule 3 will make three sets of amendments to Part IAA … The first set of amendments will insert rules about when documents produced under Division 4B must be returned to the person who produced them or to the owner. The second set of amendments will streamline and extend provisions governing applications for, and determination of, various orders in relation to things seized and documents produced. The final amendment will allow the AFP Commissioner to delegate responsibility for functions related to returning things seized and documents produced to a Commonwealth officer if he or she is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the officer is able to properly exercise the relevant powers, functions or duties.
Part 3 of Schedule 3 will amend the Crimes Act to provide police with a standing power to take fingerprints and photographs of arrested persons. This amendment will assist police to confirm the identity of arrested persons, prove matters relating to identity in court … and maintain accurate records of arrests.
To expand on the amendments made to the AFP Act, schedule 4 will enable the commissioner to authorise a payment in special circumstances that arise out of, or relate to, a person’s engagement as an AFP appointee. This will bring the AFP into line with other Commonwealth agencies with respect to making payments to employees and other persons in special circumstances. It will also avoid the problems currently encountered with delays in obtaining approval for ex-gratia payments.
Moving to the end of the speech—clearly, things are under control! In the report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on the Australian Crime Commission annual report for 2007-08, there was the following recommendation:
The committee recommends that the Australian Government review existing arrangements for the suspension and dismissal of Commonwealth law enforcement agency employees believed on reasonable grounds to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption, and that the Government take action as appropriate, bearing in mind the need to respect the rights of employees.
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the ACC noted the dismissal power available to the AFP and stated:
… it is of concern to the committee that ACC employees suspected of serious misconduct or corruption remain within the organisation and may seek to jeopardise investigations, thereby potentially compromising the security of the ACC’s operations.
In its 2008 submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, ACLEI noted that in the context of its own establishment:
... there was no perception of a significant or systemic problem with corruption in either the ACC or the AFP. The possibility that corruption could develop is ever present particularly if sufficient deterrents and detection measures were not in place.
This bill addresses these important concerns and therefore has the support of the coalition.
It is always difficult to deal with matters of suspected corruption within law enforcement agencies in the same way that you might deal with other criminal offences because, clearly, it is very difficult to apply the rights that people enjoy through the court system, for instance, to policing agencies if there has been suspected corruption of officials within those agencies.
As has been noted in the submissions to the parliamentary joint committee, it is clear that there was some concern about some difficulties within the existing regime as to how officers within the ACC might be dealt with if they were suspected of corruption. Clearly, that is an important area to address. I am pleased this bill does that and it therefore enjoys the support of the opposition.",REPS,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—The member for Fowler will be making his contribution to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 [2011] debate a little later, and I thank the House for allowing me to make a contribution at this time. This bill will improve the Australian Crime Commission’s ability to deal with serious misconduct by staff and make a range of amendments to strengthen law enforcement agencies’ powers to gather, examine and use evidence to investigate and prevent the committing of criminal offences.
The amendments have been identified primarily through ongoing discussion with portfolio law enforcement agencies. The amendments are vitally important because I believe it is paramount that those agencies that the legislation will impact on can have ownership of the legislation. These discussions with the portfolio law enforcement agencies will ensure they have ownership and that the legislation is not just put in place without their feeling that they have had input into it. Amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 align the dismissal powers of the CEO of the ACC to deal with serious misconduct and corruption with those of the AFP commissioner and provide for more flexible arrangements for appointing examiners.
I am sure the member for Cowan will be making a contribution and supporting the member for Stirling’s position on this. I am sure the member for Cowan will shortly arrive in the chamber and make a contribution to this debate following mine.
Amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 will help the police deal effectively with portable electronic and data storage devices found when searching a person under warrant. Part 2 will insert rules to govern when documents relating to serious offences and serious terrorism offences should be returned. It will introduce a new standing power for the AFP to take fingerprints and photographs of arrested persons when taking them into custody in relation to Commonwealth offences. There are also amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to allow the Commissioner of the AFP to make a payment to an AFP appointee.
From the details I have read out you can see what an important piece of legislation this is. The Crimes Act will be strengthened and that will strengthen law enforcement agencies’ powers to gather and examine evidence, as I have already stated. The government very much appreciates that it has the full support of the opposition on this legislation. That shows that it is targeting the right place in relation to law enforcement agencies. When you have legislation of this type it is really important that you have the support of both sides of parliament. For it to successfully operate, you need that approach to the legislation.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—Today I will take this opportunity to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 but I will confine my comments to the matters concerning changes to the way the Australian Crime Commission can operate as foreshadowed in these amendments. I certainly have an interest in such matters, being a former member of the Australian Federal Police and a current member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.
As we know, the Australian Crime Commission took over from the National Crime Authority, and its primary purpose is the investigation of organised crime. Its current determinations, or work priorities, include the criminal intelligence examination of matters such as amphetamine-type stimulants and new synthetic drugs; child sex; cocaine; complex organised technology-enabled crime, including identity crime; established criminal networks in Victoria; high-risk crime groups and high-risk crime groups in South Australia; illicit firearm markets in New South Wales; Indigenous violence or child abuse; money laundering; people smuggling; serious organised crime penetration of the border; superannuation and investment fraud; terrorism and various other matters. In the last financial year, there were 433 examinations of such matters. When we look through this list of offences and situations, it is clear that there can be a large amount of money generated in committing these sorts of crimes. And with money comes organised crime: syndicates, collaborators, conspirators—all with the common purpose of generating money illegally, and always at the cost of the innocent and the weak.
In preparing for today, I suddenly remembered last night one of those definitions that were drummed into us at the Federal Police College back in 1986, that being the definition of an investigation. It was that ‘an investigation is a search for the truth in the interests of justice and in accordance with the specifications of the law’. That definition brings in a number of concepts, which include ethics, and that is what my fairly limited, short contribution today is about—the ethical behaviour of those charged with undertaking these investigations and these criminal intelligence examinations. It is certainly the case that, where there is big money and organised crime, there is also the potential for corruption.
We can look back at the 2004 detection and then subsequent convictions of ex-Victorian police officer James McCabe and New South Wales police officer Samuel Foster on matters relating to corruption and other serious misconduct. As encouraging as those sorts of past detections have been, the question that needs to be asked is: what more can still be done or needs to be done? It has always been my view that the likelihood of corruption is greater in the state police forces because of the frustrations with the legal and justice systems. The frequency of contact with criminals and the value to criminals of corrupting police do seem to be higher at the state level when these matters are combined. That of course does not preclude corruption taking place or not taking place among permanent Federal Police officers; but, for the reasons I have outlined, I believe that it is less likely.
Nevertheless, to deal with the very few that turn from the path of justice and truth, further options for appropriate action by the CEO of the ACC are required. I note that the provisions of the bill in this capacity were influenced by the 42nd Parliament’s Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The committee’s 23 February 2009 report on its inquiry into law enforcement integrity models included the following:
The committee recommends that the Australian Government review existing arrangements for the suspension and dismissal of Commonwealth law enforcement agency employees believed on reasonable grounds to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption, and that the Government take action as appropriate, bearing in mind the need to respect the rights of employees.
On 13 March 2009, the ACC Chief Executive Officer, John Lawler, responded to the recommendation when he said of the ACC:
Indeed, it has access to and the storage of, as I have spoken about, very significant intelligence holdings so the thresholds around accountability and integrity and responsibility are naturally higher with the ACC than they might be in other walks of life. My view is that, if we are entrusted with those powers, with those authorities or with that information, we need to have in place robust mechanisms whereby those people who would abuse those trusts can be dealt with in a way that protects the integrity of the organisation and what parliament designed for it. I have to say that some of the current arrangements do not provide the mechanisms to do that in the way that they should.
That brings me to the enhanced dismissal powers that the amendments in the bill provide to the CEO of the ACC. It allows termination in cases where there has been serious misconduct that is having or is likely to have a damaging—
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—Order! There being no quorum, the meeting of the Main Committee is suspended until further notice.
Sitting suspended from 10.49 am to 11.01 am
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—Order! A quorum having been formed, the proceedings of the Main Committee will resume.
—I do appreciate the opportunity to again make some comments about this bill. I want to go to the part of the bill dealing with amendments relating to the enhanced dismissal powers of the CEO of the Australian Crime Commission. The amendments allow for termination in cases where there has been serious misconduct or where there has been conduct which is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on morale or on the reputation of the Australian Crime Commission with the Australian public or other agencies, including overseas agencies. From the opposition’s perspective, in line with the usual bipartisanship that is associated with matters on which we have absolute common ground, we welcome these changes. The integrity and the standing of the Australian Crime Commission in its dealings with other agencies are sacrosanct.
In terms of intelligence, trust, as we know, is everything. Those organisations that may share information with the ACC must be confident in the commission’s ability to properly control that information; otherwise that information will not be shared in the future. That would make the Australian Crime Commission unable to properly pursue its priorities.
I will conclude my contribution by saying that I have complete confidence in the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Federal Police. Corruption is a very rare event, but precautions are always required to deal with such problems quickly and to ensure that the standing of these agencies remains high, because their standing is important and it is always in the national interest. I certainly endorse this bill as it stands.",REPS,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I am very happy to follow the member for Cowan, who I know to be a former police officer and also a former military police officer. I applaud his commitment to law enforcement.
I also lend my support to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. As has been indicated, organised crime and the threat to safety in our community are things that our government is certainly taking intensive action to detect, disrupt and deter, as all governments should do. The government has introduced and enabled a suite of legislation and technologies aimed at doing that—from phone tapping and interception powers through to provisions relating to unexplained wealth—which are, quite frankly, designed to deter organised crime from setting up business in our communities.
Organised criminal networks are extremely sophisticated. Any view to the contrary is just wrong. Organised crime should, in many respects, be looked at as a business—a nefarious business, granted, but still a business. We need to look at and address various areas of the business of organised crime, including the issue of profit motive. Ongoing challenges to our law enforcement agencies include how we gather intelligence, how we distribute that intelligence and how we engage with state and territory jurisdictions, with a view to setting aside some of the effects that organised crime has on our society. As I said, organised crime is a very sophisticated business. The Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework recognises that we must ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the powers that they need in order to combat criminal networks. I strongly support the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill, which amends the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, the Crimes Act 1914 and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979.
As you would appreciate, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have on many occasions expressed my respect and appreciation for the work of our police. They are often called upon to risk their lives in order to protect our communities. It is important that we recognise their endeavours in this respect. The bill will enhance the powers available to the Australian Federal Police and provide the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission—currently Mr John Lawler—with powers, similar to those of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, to appropriately deal with staff who engage in serious misconduct or corruption. I will speak a little more about that later on.
Given that organised crime reportedly costs the Australian community in the vicinity of $15 million each year, it has to be recognised that it is a significant national threat. The Prime Minister is certainly committed to doing whatever is possible to support and protect our community in that regard. The powers that the Australian Crime Commission staff have are quite extensive, including the power to collect information, accumulate intelligence, and the coercive power to force people to answer questions et cetera. They have those powers for a very good reason. But, where there are extraordinary powers of that nature, there also lies an extraordinary level of responsibility on the organisation and the people who work in that organisation. That is not to say that the staff of the Australian Crime Commission should be treated differently from other public servants in many respects, but, as with people who work in defence and intelligence organisations, they are privy to some of the most private information about people as well as to strategic information about crime itself and, as a consequence, they cannot be seen in all respects—whether they are staff or officers—just as employees for the purposes of various acts, including the Workplace Relations Act.
This bill will allow the commissioner of the Australian Crime Commission to act on issues of misbehaviour in a way that mirrors the abilities of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner and is similar, if not identical, to what applies in every other police jurisdiction in this country. I should say that bringing forward this bill follows a unanimous recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which sought to grant these powers to the commissioner of the Australian Crime Commission. People who are involved in these institutions need to understand not only the role that is given to them under the act but the trust that is put in them when the powers are conferred on those organisations with which they are involved. It is a special class of responsibility. If it were a normal police force all the people involved—staff and officers—would have taken an oath of office. In the police force, they are not classified as employees. They have an oath of office; they are in fact officers. This bill brings that sentiment on par as it applies to the Australian Crime Commission. It is not something foreign to most of the staff of the Australian Crime Commission, who are either seconded from police forces around the country or are former police officers themselves. Effectively, this piece of legislation does much to ensure the integrity of the organisation, an organisation in which we vest considerable powers. I think that is right and, as I say, it was subject to the unanimous recommendation of the parliamentary joint committee on law enforcement integrity.
As I said earlier, the Australian Crime Commission has the ability to use coercive powers to require people to answer questions, and the actual questioning in that area is undertaken by what are called the examiners. Presently there are a limited number of examiners in the authority and there is a lot of crime to detect and to investigate. This bill makes amendments to appoint part-time examiners. Given that the needs of examination can change from topic through to geography, it is appropriate that we have greater flexibility in the exercise of coercive powers and compulsory questioning by examiners. I think it is something that many of us associated with policing would say is overdue because of the amount of pressure that has been put on the Australian Crime Commission, but it is certainly very much a relief to those of us who take an interest in that organisation that this bill is going forward to bring about added flexibility in addressing the issue of part-time examiners to exercise those investigative powers.
The bill also amends the Crimes Act 1914. I believe it is necessary to adapt our laws to the rapidly changing technological advances in our society. As a matter of fact, I spoke briefly yesterday on some aspects of scams and phishing. A lot of these technologies are deployed in serious and organised crime, and these amendments will help police deal effectively with the increasingly popular electronic equipment, whether it is laptops, USB drives or flash drives, assisting them in locating and searching such equipment when undertaking investigations, subject to search warrants. Allowing police officers to seek an order from a magistrate to assist with assessing electronic data seized under a warrant will be pretty helpful in determining the value of evidence in matters that are being investigated. If an item is believed to be linked with a terrorist act or a serious offence, the magistrate will have power to make orders to prevent the return of such items to the people concerned, regardless of charges.
Measures have been taken to ensure that people’s rights are not abused. A procedure has been developed where, should an officer seek to exercise these powers, all reasonable steps will have to be taken to discover those persons who have an interest in the property or thing to be confiscated and to notify them of the purpose of the application. The person of interest will then have the opportunity to speak for themselves before the order is actually given.
The bill will also provide the Australian Federal Police with powers to take fingerprints and to photograph persons in lawful custody. The fingerprints and photographs will be taken only with respect to serious criminal matters or indictable offences, and that actually does bring the Commonwealth into line with the majority of state and territory jurisdictions.
In the short time I have available I take the opportunity to acknowledge the contributions of four local police commanders: Superintendent Peter Lennon, from Fairfield, Superintendent Danny Doherty, from Liverpool, Superintendent Ray King, from Cabramatta, and Superintendent Darrin Wilson, from Green Valley. Clearly these are very, very committed police officers, as are the men and women who serve under them. They do a sterling job in protecting the community and the safety of the people in my area.
I would like to particularly acknowledge Leading Senior Constable Tiffany Duane, from Fairfield Police Station, for her outstanding work and for the contributions she has made with respect to domestic violence. Tragically, although there has been an improvement in all other crime statistics, one statistic that remains stubbornly high is domestic violence. It is clearly a scourge on our modern society and something that has a cost not only to individuals and families but to a community as a whole. I do pay regard to the work that Tiffany has done. She has been recognised by being named the Rotary Fairfield Police Officer of the Year. I think that is a reflection of how important it is that we do have people prepared to go out there and champion the issue of domestic violence.
I have been advised that the four police commanders that I mentioned, from Green Valley, Liverpool, Cabramatta and Fairfield, took it upon themselves to take up the challenge of an interbranch competition to determine which region has the best record of blood donation. I think that is not a bad way for police officers to act. They are clearly committed in terms of fighting crime and what they do about public protection, but their generosity in participating in a blood donation competition shows to me and my community that the police genuinely do care.
Police officers and the police force generally protect our Australian community, and it is important that our laws give them the powers that they need and the tools that they need to do their jobs properly. As society evolves, particularly in relation to technological advances, and as time passes, organised crime networks are becoming more sophisticated. We have got to make sure that our law enforcement officers have the same degree of technology available to them to be able to combat crime and protect our communities. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"O’Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—in reply—I thank all members who have spoken on the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I thank the Government Whip and member for Fowler for his contribution. I know he is a very strong advocate not only for policing but for our doing more in the area of serious and organised crime. I would also like to thank the members for Stirling, Shortland and Cowan for their contributions and support for this bill.
As members know, organised crime inflicts substantial harm on the community, business, government and national security. This bill builds on a range of measures the government has implemented to prevent, disrupt and investigate organised criminal activity, including the two serious and organised crime acts passed by parliament last year. It reflects the government’s continuing commitment to strengthening our law enforcement agencies’ capability to fight serious and organised crime. For that and other reasons, I commend the bill to the House.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-02-10,"—I rise to add my voice to those of my fellow members and the many Australians who have also passed on their condolences for Corporal Richard Atkinson, who bravely lost his life during operations in Afghanistan. It was with deep sadness that I heard of the loss of Corporal Richard Atkinson, a 22-year-old constituent in my electorate of Solomon, in the Northern Territory.
Corporal Atkinson was posted to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, based at the Robertson Barracks in Darwin, after joining the Army in 2007. He completed his recruit and combat engineer basic training that same year, his first. Corporal Atkinson showed strong leadership and dedication to his role and, for his efforts, was promoted to lance corporal in 2009 and, further, rewarded with his promotion to corporal just prior to his section’s deployment to Afghanistan in October last year. Corporal Atkinson was leading his combat engineer section as a search commander when he was killed in action. He will always be remembered as a brave and dedicated soldier. His sacrifice for his country must never, ever be forgotten.
Corporal Atkinson leaves behind his parents, Ross and Kate; his brother, James, and his sister-in-law, Sumah; and his fiancee, Dannielle, a former neighbour of mine and constituent of my electorate. My absolute heartfelt and sincere condolences go out to her and Corporal Atkinson’s family, friends and comrades during this very sad time.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Atkinson, Corporal Richard Edward</title>",Condolences,30,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I very much thank the member for Lyons, who has kindly agreed to allow me to speak now, very briefly—

Mr Adams interjecting—
—The very, very good member for Lyons, I should say! I have some other commitments—not that I rank those other commitments as a priority over this condolence motion; I certainly do not. But I appreciate the member for Lyons giving way to me.
I am of course here to support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister—a condolence motion reflecting the life and good deeds of Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson. I did not know him, although it is possible I might have met him during my time as the Minister for Defence, but I do not need to have known him well to understand who he was and what he was. He would have been typical of those who serve in the Australian uniform on operations overseas.
He was a volunteer, of course. It is always very important to highlight that, because the Australian community does need to understand that people like Corporal Atkinson do what they do both voluntarily and enthusiastically. They know the very serious risks involved and the potential consequences of those actions. On almost every occasion, and no doubt it is the case in this instance, they do so with the full support of their family, friends and loved ones. I think that is a very important message for the Australian community as it begins, even more as time goes on, to question Australia’s participation in Afghanistan. These brave young Australians understand why we are there, and they understand the risks. We are there for a very important reason, and we in this place should not ever speak in a way which indicates that we ourselves question those very important reasons. These men are there to make the world a safer place and to make Australia a safer place. It has been said many times in this place that most of the terrorist attacks that have injured or killed Australians have had some link back to Afghanistan and training by Islamists in that part of the word—not just Afghanistan but the north-west frontier provinces in Pakistan on the border of Afghanistan.
So today we mourn him, but we thank him for what he has done for his country and we thank his family for allowing him to do what he obviously wanted to do, knowing the very great risk involved. It is also an occasion to reinforce the need for those of us in this place to understand that if we are going to send our troops into dangerous places we need to be properly resourcing them. I have no doubt that we are properly resourcing them. Questions have been asked about that from time to time. They even relate to some incidents that occurred in this place earlier in the week. We all need to remain vigilant, each and every one of us, in ensuring that government ensures on all occasions—without any question, without any exceptions—that our troops fighting in theatre have all the support and capability they need to do their job as effectively and as safely as possible. Again, to Corporal Atkinson I say: ‘Thank you for what you did and thank you for your sacrifices. We will never forget your deeds. Hopefully we will ensure that we follow our mission through in Afghanistan and in doing so ensure that your efforts were not given in vain.’",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Atkinson, Corporal Richard Edward</title>",Condolences,30,1
"Lyons, Geoff, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I rise on this occasion to pay tribute to Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson, a Tasmanian digger on his first appointment in Afghanistan. Corporal Atkinson was a brave young Australian serving his country, and his life has been cut short far too early. My heart breaks for his family—his dad, Ross, and his mum, Kate—and for his fiancée, Dannielle. I cannot imagine the anguish that they must feel at the loss of a son, brother and fiance. His death is a tragedy, and I extend my deepest sympathies to all who had the pleasure of knowing him.
Corporal Atkinson attended Launceston Church Grammar School in my electorate of Bass. His principal recently spoke highly of him, talking of his popularity and leadership within the school community. He was clearly a man who cared for his fellow man and for his country. These same leadership abilities Corporal Atkinson demonstrated while at school he exhibited in the Australian Defence Force. He was promoted to lance corporal in 2009 and by all accounts displayed strong leadership in bringing his section together during their preparation for operations in Afghanistan. His dedication to his section was rewarded with his promotion to corporal just prior to their deployment.
His death is the 22nd since our troops entered Afghanistan, and at age 22 he was far too young. At this sad time, fallen diggers’ families are no doubt remembering their men who have died or been injured supporting our nation. Lest we forget the great sacrifice they have made. May I also add that our thoughts and prayers are with Corporal Atkinson’s colleagues, who are also feeling this great loss. They have lost a mate and a strong member of their unit. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the soldier who was injured in this tragic event. May he soon recover.
Let me reiterate Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s sentiments. Our mission in Afghanistan is an important one. I am confident Australians are most proud of Corporal Atkinson and his dedication to his country. Corporal Atkinson and our other troops in Afghanistan are making a real difference. We have heard in media statements from family members and close friends that Corporal Atkinson was a family man with a great sense of humour and mateship. We have lost a true Aussie hero. Often it seems we take our military and the things it does on our behalf very much for granted. This has been a raw reminder of the sacrifices our Defence Force makes and a reminder of how lucky we are in Australia.
Major Cameron Ellis, who commands Australian Mentoring Taskforce 2, says the death of Corporal Atkinson was a tragic and ‘stark, knife to the guts reminder’ of how important their job is as well as an incentive for troops to continue their efforts. His death will not be in vain. Corporal Atkinson will be remembered as a brave young Australian who served his country well. His courage, loyalty, resilience and determination were the making of a fine soldier. The Atkinson family can be very proud of Richard. He will remain in their hearts and minds and in the hearts and minds of all Australians. Rest in peace, Corporal Atkinson. Your bravery and courage will not be forgotten. Lest we forget.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Atkinson, Corporal Richard Edward</title>",Condolences,30,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, this is the first occasion that I have had the opportunity to see you in the chair. A wonderful thing it is.
Can I follow on from my friend the member for Bass and offer my sympathy at the death of Corporal Richard Atkinson. I express my condolences to his fiancee, Dannielle; his parents, Ross and Kate; his brother, James; and sister-in-law, Sumah. I would also extend my thoughts to Corporal Atkinson’s comrades in the Australian Defence Force. I know that operational deaths are felt deeply across the wider defence family. As we know, Corporal Atkinson was born in Hobart in 1988, which is one year after I joined this parliament. He joined the Army in 2007 and he successfully completed his recruitment combat engineer basic training prior to being posted to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment based in Darwin. Corporal Atkinson was just 22 years old when he was killed as a result of an improvised explosive device in the Tangi Valley in the Deh Rawud region of Afghanistan. He was participating in a partnered patrol with the Afghan National Army. As a result of the IED blast, a second soldier was seriously injured, and he is in a satisfactory condition.
I was fortunate enough to visit Robertson Barracks, in Darwin, just as Corporal Atkinson and his colleagues were due to deploy to Afghanistan last year, following extensive preparation. More recently I was in Afghanistan—only a fortnight ago—with many of his comrades, prior to his unfortunate death. This week I contacted Brigadier Gus McLachlan, Commander 1 Brigade in Darwin. He assured me that he had made all the necessary support arrangements for the family of Corporal Atkinson.
I know that Corporal Atkinson displayed strong leadership in bringing his section together during their preparation for operations in Afghanistan. I know that Corporal Atkinson was an outstanding career soldier, and this has been testified to by Brigadier McLachlan on a number of occasions. He was also a decorated soldier, having been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp: International Coalition Against Terrorism, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO Medal with Clasp: International Security Assistance Force, the Australian Defence Medal and the Army Combat Badge.
Corporal Atkinson died serving his country and is owed a great debt of gratitude which we know can never be repaid. He has brought honour to our nation, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Army and, most especially, his family. While I know that I never met Corporal Atkinson, those who knew him describe him as a ‘funny man, always putting smiles on other people’s faces’, and a person with a real taste for adventure. Corporal Atkinson’s commanding officer, Major David French, spoke of his professionalism. He said in the eulogy at Tarin Kowt:
Akka was never happier than when he was on the job and he was bloody good at it …
A ramp ceremony will be held later today at RAAF Base Darwin to honour the arrival of Corporal Richard Atkinson back in Australia. He will be mourned but honoured by his colleagues, for whom he was a mate. On behalf of the government and myself, I offer whatever support I can provide to Richard Atkinson’s family and friends through this difficult time and assure him and them that the sacrifice of this astounding young soldier will be remembered. We will not forget him.
I will conclude by making an observation. I said at the outset that this young man was born one year after I was first elected to this parliament. I do not regard myself as being that old, but he was one year older than my son. When you visit and speak to Australian Defence Force personnel, these brave young men and women who serve this nation, you see that the cream of Australian youth have joined the Australian Defence Force to defend our nation and you see how proudly they wear that uniform, how justly proud they are of the job they do. The sacrifices they make on our behalf can never be underestimated and I do not think are often properly understood. They show enormous valour and courage.
Corporal Atkinson’s service to this nation epitomises the sacrifice that has been made by so many in the past for all of us, so when we mourn his passing we need to celebrate his life and the contribution he has made. It is no easy thing to say goodbye to your family, put on the uniform and carry a weapon, because immediately you do that it demands things of you that those of us not in uniform can never really contemplate. So I say to his comrades and to his family that we do appreciate and really value the service that he has given to our great nation. It should make us all the more determined to ensure that, as all of our Australian Defence Force members, wherever they may be, carry that uniform with such great pride, we take pride in making sure they have got the wherewithal to do the task that we require of them.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—I rise to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the condolence motion in honour of Corporal Richard Atkinson, who was tragically killed in action by a roadside bomb on 2 February 2011.
At just 22 years of age, Corporal Atkinson was on his first deployment to Afghanistan. Our thoughts are with his family—his mother and father, Kate and Ross; his brother, James; his sister-in-law, Sumah; and in particular his fiancee, Danielle. It is a time of great sadness for them. Whilst this condolence motion is in no way likely to ease their pain, we mourn the death of Corporal Atkinson, a brave young soldier who had so much life ahead of him and we wish those close to him courage and strength into the future.
Whilst Corporal Atkinson died tragically, he died with great honour serving our nation in the cause of making Afghanistan a place safer from terrorism. His sacrifice is not in vain. He also served in Indonesia in 2009 on Operation Padang Assist. We mourn with Corporal Atkinson’s colleagues in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment and the wider Australian Army. They have lost a mate and a fellow soldier. In particular our hearts go out to his comrade Sapper Rose, who was wounded in the same incident, and to his family and friends. I wish him well in his recovery. It is also a difficult time, I imagine, for the 21 families who have also tragically lost loved ones. They must sadly grieve for the loss of another Australian soldier.
Corporal Atkinson’s death is the 22nd loss our nation has faced in Afghanistan, and to date there have been 168 Australian Defence Force personnel wounded in Afghanistan, many grievously so. We make no mistake: deployment in Afghanistan is dangerous work. However, it is extremely important work that serves to make our world a safer place and that has the full support of the coalition. We support all of our soldiers, pray for them and give thanks for their individual efforts and sacrifices.
We will remember Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson as a hero of our nation. Lest we forget.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Atkinson, Corporal Richard Edward</title>",Condolences,30,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2011-02-10,"—I want to join the members for Lingiari and Aston in remembering Corporal Atkinson, at 22 a very brave and a very young man. He was a member of Darwin’s 1st Combat Engineer Regiment and he died when our enemies exploded an improvised device last Wednesday week.
Our thoughts are with Corporal Atkinson’s family and his fiancee, Dannielle. I am very pleased to hear that the Minister for Defence is ordering even more devices that can be used to combat these weapons used by the Taliban which have caused most of the casualties against our Australian service people who are fighting there. I will say something about that fighting in a minute and the justice of the cause, despite the difficulties, in Afghanistan. First of all, I want to associate myself with the comments of the Prime Minister about Corporal Atkinson’s fiancee. She said:
Her pain—
that is, Dannielle’s pain—
I believe, is almost beyond our imagining and we should not pretend that the uttering of words of condolence in this chamber today will ease that pain. But today we honour her sacrifice and we are united in wishing her the courage and the strength she will need for the future.
I was asked by the former defence minister, the member for Hunter, to be involved in a ramp ceremony for Private Greg Sher, one of our 22 heroes who have been killed in action in Afghanistan, and I have stayed in contact with the family since. In speaking in this chamber about his demise I said that as a member of parliament I do not think I had done anything as difficult as participating in the ramp ceremony, with the family standing opposite and the coffin holding his body coming off the plane that had arrived from Afghanistan. I will never forget seeing the faces of his parents standing opposite me. It makes all of us understand the true seriousness of our involvement in a war of any kind. The fact that we sit here in this Australian parliament, in the bubble in Canberra, and ask people to be involved in these very difficult circumstances on our behalf is really brought home to us by the honest representation that I think the leadership of this country on both sides undertakes when they participate in these very difficult funerals and ramp ceremonies, and the many ordinary members of parliament too who go along and do their best to assist the families. I think it really makes us understand the true seriousness of our involvement in Afghanistan.
Corporal Atkinson was a very dedicated soldier with long career aspirations. His major, Major French, said, ‘Akka was never happier than when he was on the job and he was bloody good at it.’ Corporal Atkinson is one of many thousands of heroic young Australians who have served with valour and skill in Afghanistan. A member of his family said: ‘Rich was the funny man, always putting a smile on people’s faces. He was hoping to start a family this year with Dannielle. He was a dedicated soldier with long career aspirations.’ Again, I think that is something that is important for us to understand. Although Corporal Atkinson was on his first deployment to Afghanistan, many of our people in the full-time military services have been on several deployments, including in East Timor, Iraq and particularly now in Afghanistan.
In my view, Corporal Atkinson is the real face of the Australian soldier. Both his regiment, the commando regiment formerly 4RAR, and the Special Air Service Regiment are doing magnificent work on this country’s behalf in Afghanistan. From a purely military point of view, if one is to read all of the current literature on the success of our forces in Afghanistan, it is clear that Corporal Atkinson and his mates are continuing to achieve the high standard of military professionalism that we have come to expect of our forces.
Indeed, it was interesting to read recently that Australian service personnel are finding these deployments more and more effective. They are being more militarily effective against the Taliban than they were in the past, and after all that is the reason we asked them to be involved. They are not simply involved in nation building. When I get emails from people questioning foreign aid to Afghanistan, I think of the important role that those young men and women out there in Afghanistan are fulfilling for this nation. They are preventing the kind of murderous activity we saw in Bali from coming here. It was wonderful to see our VC recipient, who I will be speaking about later, say that so clearly when he was interviewed about this. He knew exactly what he was doing and it is my experience that our young professionals in the armed services know exactly what they are doing there on behalf of Australia.
Corporal Atkinson’s contribution was for Australia’s sake and not simply for our good neighbourly intention of helping to reconstruct Afghanistan. He was there to make sure that the kinds of attacks that have occurred against Australians in Mumbai and in Bali do not come to mainstream Australia. Until Australia has an understanding and an assurance like all other countries represented in ISAF that the previous Taliban regime will not host al-Qaeda, which we all remember was the situation prior to the murder of 3,000 people on 11 September, we will be there. However difficult it is, the Taliban and their evil associates in al-Qaeda should understand that. Australians understand what they are about and, until we can be assured that these people will not be able to use that area to generate activity in our part of the world, Australia will be involved—and very effectively. I say this because I want the Atkinson family to understand that people across this country appreciate their sacrifice. As the Prime Minister said, we cannot pretend to understand the deep desperation that the family feels. But our service personnel are working in a just cause. They are working with full understanding and they are working with the backing of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people, even though we would prefer not to be there, not to be spending our blood and treasure in Afghanistan.
It was mentioned last weekend that the Taliban insurgents are losing their stranglehold over key southern provinces. Corporal Atkinson was killed by Taliban forces desperate to claw back control of the Tangi Valley in Afghanistan’s Deh Rawud region in the wake of a successful coalition effort to drive them into the mountains. This is helping to achieve security for people in the towns, villages and cities there. Corporal Atkinson made an incredibly valuable contribution, as do all our young men and women there.
I want to join with the minister, the member for Lingiari and the member for Aston and associate myself with our deep condolences to the family and our pride in the effort of Corporal Atkinson and his colleagues in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, our pride with the fellows in the 1st Commando Regiment, formerly 4RAR, and, of course, our pride in our people in the SAS, who are over there fulfilling the nation’s best intentions to assist the people of Afghanistan, but above all to prevent murderous attacks on civilians from coming here. I commend this motion and I honour the contribution of Corporal Atkinson.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Atkinson, Corporal Richard Edward</title>",Condolences,30,1
"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—I rise to join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many other colleagues in honouring the sacrifice of Corporal Richard Atkinson. Only 22 years of age, Corporal Atkinson was tragically killed while on combat operations in Afghanistan. A proud member of the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment and on his first deployment to Afghanistan, Corporal Atkinson will be sadly missed by his family, friends and a grateful nation. At this time our deepest thoughts and prayers are with his fiancee, Dannielle; his father and mother, Ross and Kate; and all their extended family.
Corporal Atkinson loved being in the Army and loved being with his mates. In his eulogy, at a special memorial service at Multinational Base Tarin Kowt, Major David French told of Corporal Atkinson’s cheeky nature, his commitment and professionalism to the task at hand and of his natural leadership abilities. ‘Akka’ he said, ‘was never happier than when he was on the job and he was bloody good at it. So farewell, Digger. While we mourn and miss you here, others who have gone before you will welcome you to the fold. Travel safely mate, we miss you.’ These powerful words were expressed by one soldier to another and say it best.
Let it be known that Corporal Atkinson’s ultimate service to his country was not in vain. His efforts in Afghanistan and those of his fellow service men and women are helping to make that country a better place and the world more secure. It is an international mission, in which Australia plays an important part, and is making a real difference. The mission in Afghanistan is and will be long, hard and painful. Twenty-two Australians have already been tragically killed and 168 wounded, including Sapper Rose, who was injured by the same improvised explosive device that took the life of Corporal Atkinson. We say to each of our fallen soldiers, fellow service men and women, and particularly today to the family and friends of Corporal Atkinson: our thoughts and prayers are with you always and a grateful nation will never forget.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Atkinson, Corporal Richard Edward</title>",Condolences,30,1
"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-02-10,"—I rise to honour and respect the life and sacrifice of Corporal Richard Atkinson on this day, which marks the final journey of his life. I offer my heartfelt condolences to the Atkinson family: his mother, Kate; his father, Ross; brother, James; sister-in-law, Sumah; his fiancee, Dannielle; and his extended family, their friends and his Australian Defence Force mates in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. I also honour and respect the sacrifice made by his family. Every day this fine young man will be in their thoughts and hearts. For his mum and dad, they will remember Richard as a baby—the little boy—his many antics, his achievements and his aspirations as a young man. His brother will remember all their fun and games and many adventures. His fiancee, Dannielle, will remember how much they loved each other and the dreams they had of the future that they would share. In spite of the terrible grief of the Atkinson family they will all know why Richard chose the path he did, why his personal qualities made him a leader, why he loved his job, why he was regarded as a great young solder with steely resolve and why he always wanted to do his job properly and lead from the front. They will know why the words of Major French, which we have heard today, are so relevant:
… as the search commander, Corporal Atkinson’s job was to direct from the rear.
“But he wasn’t that type of guy. He called his junior blokes back behind him, and with his best mate Rosey went forward to confirm the location of the device. I’ve got no doubt that as he did so, he had half a grin and a quick remark at the ready. Akka was never happier than when he was on the job …”
Major French went on to say:
… he was someone … who after his death would never have wanted anyone to do anything in his name, “but simply get the job done for the same reasons we always have—for each other, for our mates, for our mission.
He said:
And he was bloody good at it.
Richard epitomised the motto of his Combat Team Charlie—that is, ‘Never alone, fight together.’ That is something that Sapper Rose would know very directly at this moment.
I honour Richard Atkinson. As my colleague Stuart Robert said so eloquently, he fell fighting for freedom for the Afghani people and freedom for all Australians.
 (Ms K Livermore)—I understand that it is the wish of honourable members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

"O’Dowd, Ken, MP",NATS,2011-02-10,"—I rise to speak in the Main Committee today out of concern for those people in the community who have a disability or are on a pension or who are a carer for someone with a health problem or disability. I would also like to talk about a chap in my electorate who is raising and caring for his three sons who suffer from autism. The gentleman himself is receiving a disability pension. His sons are aged between 14 and 20. Some years ago his doctor advised him to take his sons from the city to live in the country to improve their quality of life and to raise them in a less stressful environment. He sold his home in Brisbane and moved to a rural community north of Bundaberg.
The proceeds from the sale of his Brisbane home amounted to $400,000. He paid $350,000 cash for farmland that allowed him to generate a small income by raising a family of pigs and a few cattle. Most of the remaining $50,000 was consumed by stamp duty and other costs associated with buying the property. He built a modest shed that has only three walls, with a tarp making up the fourth wall. The shed has a dirt floor. He generates his own electricity because the power authorities demanded an excessive fee to connect the power. His diesel generator runs eight hours a day on chicken fat that he buys from a local takeaway chicken shop; this way he is able to keep his fuel costs for his truck and generator to $12 per month. His property was recently flood affected and he lost one-third of his cattle, swept away in the floodwaters. He applied for flood relief but, because that little corner of the electorate where he lives was not declared, his claim was rejected.
He is not looking for a handout or compensation; he simply wants to borrow about $40,000 from a bank or a lending institution to install a solar electricity system to lessen the time he has to use his generator and to make some improvements to his less than acceptable living quarters. The really crazy part about this is that he had satisfied all the conditions for the old solar grant but, because he has no cash and cannot borrow, he cannot get the subsidy. Under the ruling of the national consumer credit code, which was updated as a result of the global financial crisis by the Rudd government and supported by the coalition, pensioners and people on disability assistance are finding it impossible to borrow money.
The chap I am representing here today is a thoroughly decent man with good intentions. He actually wants to save the taxpayers money by ensuring that his sons are raised with a good work ethic and skills given to them on the farm. He has set up a trust to ensure that, when he passes, his sons will each inherit a third of the land and, therefore, be independent and able to make a small living. Because of their disability, they are unable to handle the stress of being crowded by other people and it makes sense that they be able to stay in this environment that assists their quality of life.
This case is not an isolated one. My office has received many calls from people on pensions who are now not able to borrow because of this new ruling imposed by the national consumer credit code. There is something fundamentally wrong here with rulings in legislation that discriminate against battling Australians, and I ask the parliament do something to correct this imbalance. What is wrong with the federal government assisting by providing the necessary guarantees for pensioners and people with disabilities so they can obtain loans to improve their position and take pressure off them at times of great stress?
I implore the government to work with me to address this unfair situation and to give these people back their dignity. They have contributed to Australian growth and prosperity and it is time for us to give them a fair go.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Pensions and Benefits</title>,Adjournment,32,1
