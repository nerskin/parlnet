"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia and South Korea from 1 to 14 July 2001.
In the first two weeks of July, it was my privilege to lead a parliamentary delegation to Indonesia and South Korea. At the outset, I would like to thank our hosts, the Speaker of the DPR of Indonesia, the Hon. Akbar Tandjung, Dr Djoko Susilo of the DPR and Dr Suwardjo from the DPR who accompanied us. I would also like to thank the Speaker of the National Assembly of South Korea, His Excellency Lee Man-Sup and his staff Mr Joon Kim and Mrs Rijin Kim who also accompanied us during our stay. I would like to thank all members of the delegation, especially the delegation secretary, Ms Roxane Le Guen. I would like to thank the Parliamentary Relations Office, the Parliamentary Library and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their briefings prior to the delegation. Finally, I would like to thank Ambassador Ric Smith and his staff in Jakarta, Yogyakarta and Denpasar and Mrs Zorica McCarthy, the Australian Charge d'Affaires in Seoul, and her staff.
The visit to Indonesia came at a critical time. It was the first parliamentary delegation from Australia to Indonesia since our commitment in East Timor. Our visit came one week after President Wahid's historic visit to Australia and was overshadowed by an impeachment crisis. Despite this, in Jakarta we were fortunate to meet with President Wahid, Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, the Speaker of the DPR, the Hon. Akbar Tandjung, the Chairman of the MPR, Professor Dr Amien Rais, as well as many members of the DPR. We met with Australian mining companies and discussed the implications of Indonesia's new decentralisation legislation. We met with human rights groups and were able to question members of the government on the progress of prosecutions for those who committed human rights violations in East Timor.
Through our parliamentary visit, we continued to emphasise Australia's strong support for democratisation in Indonesia and put to rest the notion that Australia did not support legitimate Indonesian territorial integrity and sovereignty. The delegation noted that tourism and education are two areas which continue to grow and which encourage greater person-to-person links between Australia and Indonesia. We welcome this and encourage it.
In South Korea, we visited Seoul, Pohang, Gyeongju, Ulsan and Busan. South Korea is our fourth largest trading partner, and at POSCO, in Pohang, we visited the largest steel company in the world and Australia's single largest customer. We met with the Prime Minister, His Excellency Lee Han Dong, the Foreign Minister, the Hon. Han Seung Soo and the Speaker, His Excellency Lee Man Sup. We also visited Panmunjon in the demilitarised zone and saw into North Korea. On the final day, we visited the UN Memorial Cemetery, where 281 Australian soldiers from the Korean War are buried.
The delegation was also able to visit Hyundai Heavy Industry Shipyards, Hyundai Automobile Company and to participate in several activities with Meat and Livestock Australia, promoting Australian beef. Australia and South Korea are important trading partners and middle powers which have cooperated on regional fora such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum. The delegation was also able to emphasise Australia's support for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through support for President Kim Dae Jung's engagement policy. The delegation has made eight recommendations which resulted from our discussions.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia and South Korea from 1 to 14 July 2001</title>,Delegation Reports,0,1
"O'Keefe, Neil, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—As deputy leader of the delegation, I would like to endorse, on behalf of the members, the comments made by the member for Boothby and reiterate, from our side of the House, the comments he made about the people who hosted us, assisted us and made it an enjoyable visit in many ways. I would also like to support the recommendations—without going through them in detail, because time is very limited. Mr Speaker, those recommendations reflect the work being done by Australians in very difficult circumstances which has impressed us greatly. We think there is a case to provide more support, particularly in the case of Indonesia, to enable these activities and the relationship with Australia to be developed further. In particular, we did a lot of work with Indonesian politicians who are just embracing the concept of democracy and the way it works, and a number of our recommendations build on the way Australians—Australian parliamentarians and Australians in different situations—can help that process. I would like to thank all fellow members of the delegation for the effort and the work that they put in and, to the Australians who helped us and to our hosts, I reiterate what has just been said by the leader of the delegation. I will leave some time for other members of the delegation to make some supporting comments.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"—I also endorse the remarks of the member for Boothby and the member for Burke and congratulate them on the leadership they showed throughout the delegation. It was my first delegation, and I was very pleased with the way they handled themselves in a very diplomatic way. I also thank Ric Smith, the Ambassador to Indonesia, and Zorica McCarthy, the Australian Charge d'Affaires in Korea. I think they are wonderful examples of the expertise in our diplomatic corps. They did a wonderful job in looking after us and informing us of the issues. It was certainly a fantastic experience to meet with the then President Wahid and Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri. I think those experiences were very valuable. I recommend that people read the recommendations we have put up. I am certainly very pleased with recommendations 3, 6, 7 and 8, and I fully support them. In the interests of the other members of the delegation, I will leave it there.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia and South Korea from 1 to 14 July 2001</title>,Delegation Reports,0,1
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—In the brief time available, I would like to add my support to those who have already spoken. This was an important visit, and the reciprocal visit by Dr Amien Rais in recent days, which we have all taken part in, is indicative of how seriously Indonesian parliamentarians regard our relationship. These are difficult times, and it is extremely important that we are talking in a consultative fashion with our Indonesian counterparts. I strongly recommend that the government use less megaphone diplomacy and more consultative diplomacy. There are two recommendations in particular that are important and bear mentioning. One is the assistance in terms of civilian policing, which is a new initiative in Indonesia and extremely important. The second one, recommendation 3, relates to trying to help political parties build their democratic institutions. It was a useful delegation, and the report is well worth reading. I recommend it to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia and South Korea from 1 to 14 July 2001</title>,Delegation Reports,0,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—I would like to endorse the comments made by members of the delegation. I start by congratulating Dr Andrew Southcott, who led the delegation. I also pay tribute to the Australian Ambassador in Indonesia, Ric Smith and the deputy, Leslie Rowe. I especially mention Craig Chittick and Sam Zappia, and also Roxane Le Guen, the secretary of the delegation, who provided invaluable support. It was the first time I had been overseas, and it was a very moving experience for me, and certainly the highlight, to see the work of the World Food Program. The World Food Program in Jakarta provides assistance to very poor people living in slum conditions. The major donors are the United States of America, Australia and Japan. There is a need to continue this support to feed the starving and those who suffer from extreme malnutrition. Close to 40 million people eat less than 1,600 calories a day, and the malnutrition among children and women in Indonesia continues to be of grave concern. We should continue attempting to persuade the Indonesian government to develop programs to assist the poor and to see that they get sufficient nourishment. I am sure that such initiatives are important to help reduce tension in that country, which has never been greater. It is very important for our relationship with Indonesia.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I present the committee's report entitled The link between aid and human rights, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—In the 39th parliament, the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has examined three significant issues. The report that I have just tabled is the result of the third of those examinations.
The first was an investigation of freedom of religion and belief, tabled in November 2000, and the second was an examination of conditions in immigration detention centres tabled in June 2001—a report that generated a degree of interest. The terms of reference of this inquiry were narrow and specific. They asked us to focus on Australia's efforts to advance human rights in developing nations through the use of foreign aid in three specific areas: first, activities that have the advancement of human rights as their goal; second, the utility of differing instruments and channels for advancing those rights, and third, activities supported under the human rights program in the overall Australian aid program.
In all, this inquiry received 31 submissions from a variety of government and non-government organisations, as well as from two individuals. Their views on the general topic of advancing human rights in developing countries were valuable, as were their comments on the specific matters in the terms of reference.
The subcommittee was conscious that the terms of reference were restricted. It also knew that there were limitations on the time available to complete the inquiry and to table a report in this parliament. The subcommittee decided therefore not to hold a full program of public hearings to investigate and analyse the material it had received. Because it had not undertaken this process, it also believed that it would be inappropriate to make recommendations to the government.
A seminar was held on 5 July 2001, at which selected organisations were asked to participate. These bodies ensured that a cross-section of interests and views were represented, and I understand that everyone involved believed that it was a successful means of exchanging ideas on the topic. At this seminar, there was considerable discussion of a rights based approach to human rights. This issue had also been explored in a number of the submissions forwarded to the inquiry. Neither the seminar nor the subcommittee reached any conclusion about whether the poverty alleviation and sustainable development approach put forward by AusAID should be replaced by the rights based approach favoured by a number of NGOs. The subcommittee took the view that the discussion of these two views is evolutionary and therefore healthy for Australia's aid program.
The report therefore drew a number of conclusions from its examination of this topic, and these will be drawn to the attention of the minister and the Director-General of AusAID. They are: AusAID making additional efforts to ensure that its documentation is complete and easily available to those who are interested in its work; the convening by AusAID of seminars with Australian non-government organisations to discuss subjects of common interest, including specific linkages of aid and human rights; serious consideration by the Australian government of the cancellation of the debts of seriously indebted nations; the possibility of the Australian government taking the lead in convening an international conference on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, the HIPC initiative, to review the process of admission to that initiative, and continuation by AusAID of at least the current financial support to the Asia Pacific Forum of Human Rights Institutions, the Centre for Democratic Institutions and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
The subcommittee believes that acting on these conclusions would assist the debate on Australia's aid program. In particular, convening a program of seminars would formalise contact between AusAID and the NGOs with an interest in the aid program. If the HIPC initiative is not serving a wholly useful purpose, that of assisting indebted countries to deal effectively with their debts, the initiative needs to be rethought. An international conference is one way this process could begin. It could also be a means for Australia, as a middle-ranking power, to gain credit as one of the sponsors of the idea.
From the material we received during the inquiry, it is clear that the support given by AusAID to APF, CDI and UNHCR is crucial for the range of activities undertaken by these organisations. The subcommittee believes that this support should, if possible, be increased.
I would particularly like to thank the chair of the subcommittee, Senator Marise Payne. This inquiry was initiated by her because of her strong interest in the topic. My thanks also to the staff, particularly to Patrick Regan, who has now left the service of the secretariat. His work will be very much missed. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—On 31 August, I had the pleasure to attend the Theodore Preschool Dedication to Dad Art Exhibition. What a wonderful evening it was. Susan Jones, Leanne Laurence, Liz Nagaiya—and a special mention to Patricia Warren—the teaching staff, Morag Annetts and Cheryl Wood, and all the other people involved in Theodore Preschool, should be very proud of themselves. It was a very successful fundraiser. It was a joy to walk through the art exhibition that night and hear parents—particularly the dads—acknowledge the artistic talents of their preschoolers. It was also lovely to see so many members of the parent community enjoying each other's company in a social atmosphere. I understand that, as a result of this successful art exhibition by these wonderful little preschoolers, the Tuggeranong Arts Centre has also exhibited their pieces of work. 
I thank the preschool very sincerely for the book they have given me as a thankyou. It involves children from the Comets, Stars, Rockets and Treasures—all groups within the Theodore Preschool. They are a very important part of my community. The preschool community put a lot of work into the `Dedication to Dad Art Exhibition'. They are to be commended very sincerely for putting together such a wonderful social school atmosphere that evening.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Canberra Electorate: Theodore Preschool's Dedication to Dad Art Exhibition</title>,Statements by Members,2,1
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the committee entitled Competing interests: is there a balance? Review of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission annual report 1999-2000, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report I present to you today is again a unanimous report of the House economics committee. This report reviews the performance of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over the past year. It focuses on the operations of the ACCC and relevant legislation, particularly mergers, cartels, misuse of market power by large companies against small businesses, and prices oversight matters.
We are all intimately aware of the significant impact that competition policy, and the ACCC, has on the Australian community. The ACCC has been in existence now for some six years. It has shown itself to be a very powerful but effective regulator. This was particularly evidenced by the ACCC's handling of its responsibilities relating to the introduction of the new tax system. It is essential that Australia has a good competition regulator, one that is not only fair and balanced in its decision making but also seen to be fair and balanced. Maintaining this balance is always a challenge.
Questions have been raised about the approach the ACCC takes to business, in particular its tactics, including on occasions comments in the media. Some of the concerns raised include: implying the ACCC's views are `law' when it really means seeking a court ruling; emphasising the threat of penalties; requiring voluminous disclosure from companies without always detailing the ACCC's concerns; and leaving the impression publicly that a party has breached the law before it is proven. Many of these allegations to the committee arose from the ACCC's application of its powers in relation to price exploitation, telecommunications and mergers. The committee believes that if the public, or a business, considers that there is a problem with the ACCC, it needs to be dealt with by the commission in a positive way. In other words, it is a reasonable expectation that the ACCC adopts a balanced approach to its responsibilities.
The committee's report also looks at the call for strengthening the Trade Practices Act in the following three areas: giving the court the option of applying jail sentences for participants in cases of hard core cartels; the addition of an `effects' test to strengthen section 46 on the misuse of market power; and the power to issue `cease and desist' orders to enable the ACCC to quickly halt illegal activity pending legal action. Of the three matters raised, the committee was only inclined to support the first—the imposition of a penalty for participants in hard core cartels. However, even on that matter we believe that there is a need for more research before recommending the implementation of such a penalty. 
Since its inception the ACCC has received many new powers and roles. The committee questioned whether the ACCC has too many divergent roles—as price setter, competition enforcer, adjudicator and arbitrator—and whether competition might be better served by separating some functions into another body. Questions also have been asked about whether these roles have been thrust upon the ACCC or whether some have, or are being, sought by it. The committee believes that the future role of the ACCC needs considerably more thought and debate.
The issues that the committee has raised in this report are important. Further investigation of some of these issues is required, and there are a number of Productivity Commission reviews on aspects of the ACCC's operation and its guiding legislation that are not yet publicly available. Accordingly, the committee sees this report as not only significant but also part of an ongoing effort to maintain the balance between consumer protection and good business practice. We plan to look at this again in the next parliament. We encourage others to involve themselves in this debate.
In undertaking its work to date the committee appreciates the cooperation and assistance it received from the ACCC. I also thank all of the members of the House economics committee, particularly the deputy chairman, the member for Chisholm, the committee secretariat, and Mark Tapley from the Parliamentary Library for their contributions to this inquiry and report. I commend this report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,7,1
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—I also welcome the report of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Competing interests: Is there a balance? Review of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission annual report 1999-2000. The appearance of the ACCC before the committee is one of the major elements of the commission's accountability to the federal parliament. This process of open reporting ensures that the operations of Australia's major competition watchdog and consumer protection agency are transparent.
The committee started the normal process of reviewing the annual report with a public hearing with the ACCC. This raised more questions than answers, so it was determined to progress our inquiry with submissions and private briefings. Among these submissions and presentations was work by Professor Pengilley which presented a critical view of the ACCC and, most particularly, its method of operation. The committee has begun a process of awareness raising into the powers and operations of the ACCC. Time, as you can appreciate, was against us, so our report does not draw solid conclusions or make recommendations but should be seen as the beginning of a discussion into the workings of the ACCC. 
While the ACCC plays a vital role in consumer protection and has performed this role most effectively, there has been some disquiet about its method of operation. It has been seen as regulating by media release and arm-twisting and, while known as a friend to small business, has become the bogyman at the end of the garden, particularly in relation to the implementation of the GST. Many small businesses felt that they had to absorb the costs associated with the GST because of the methodology of the ACCC's press releases.
This then was an important time to review the ACCC most closely. The additional powers given to the ACCC with the introduction of the GST—or, as the government prefers to call it, the new tax system—brought the operation of the ACCC to public attention. The ACCC came under criticism far and wide for its heavy-handed approach in respect of the price monitoring of the introduction of the GST. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, normally supportive of the ACCC, has raised its concern about the introduction of the GST and price monitoring in particular. This has been echoed far and wide, and I am sure everybody in this House has had constituents, particularly those in small business, who were concerned about the heavy-handed approach of the ACCC. As we stated in the report:  
... the heavy-handedness that caused a lot of fear amongst small businesses? They are now saying they have absorbed ... a lot of the price impact of the GST, that we will not really see some of the flow-through of that until next year, and that it has had, in some respects, some negative impact on many small businesses who are going under because they have had to absorb such a lot of the GST load.
In addition, the ACCC used the media extensively to highlight its powers in respect of price exploitation and the GST. At all stages the threat of the $10 million penalties was prominent in ACCC press releases. In a submission to the committee, Professor Pengilley I think correctly stated:
The ACCC also said in its Press Releases that no prices could rise above 10 per cent because its Guidelines, and thus the law, so provided. This was notwithstanding the fact that the preceding day, the Chairman of the ACCC conceded in Senate Committee Hearings that the 10 per cent price cap had no legislative backing. Finally, the ACCC wrongly proclaimed that it, rather than the courts, had the power to fine people $10 million per offence. Professor Fels claims that no one but me—
that is, Professor Pengilley: 
would have read this claim. It was, however, in an ACCC publication entitled “Special GST Issue.”
I can assure you that many others had read this statement, particularly people on this side of the House. Professor Pengilley points out the case in respect of Video-Ezy—one I well remember. He states in his submission:
The actuality of the ACCC's price exploitation “arm twisting” can be seen in its first price exploitation notice. Proceedings were taken against Video-Ezy with a trumpeting by Press Release that it had been guilty, in the ACCC's view, of price exploitation in 21 of its stores, and that its general manager, a company director and a senior manager were party to price exploitation. The Press Release noted that fines of up to $10 million per offence was the price of company sin and that senior managers involved in corporate decisions could face fines of up to $500,000. The Press Release also noted the failure of discussions with Video-Ezy and that the alleged misrepresentations were not the invention of junior staff but reflected the reasons for price increases given by Video-Ezy management to junior staff. Thus the ACCC had been forced to take Video-Ezy to court.
The matter was settled. No penalty was sought. 
That was one example of where the price exploitation had been excessive. In the report, I and other members of the committee brought to the attention of the ACCC concerns with the smash repair industry, particularly in respect of large insurers—the RACV and NRMA. We were concerned that the ACCC seemed to be giving glib responses to the concerns raised by individuals, and that again there was a concern about ACCC's approach. The report also looked into price monitoring and there are grave concerns here. I recommend the report to the House and thank the committee secretariat. (Time expired)

This process of open reporting ensures that the operations of Australia's major competition watchdog and consumer protection agency are transparent.
The committee started the normal process of reviewing the annual report with a public hearing with the ACCC. This raised more questions than answers, so it was determined to progress our inquiry with submissions and private briefings. Among these submissions and presentations was work by Professor Pengilley which presented a critical view of the ACCC and, most particularly, its method of operation. The committee has begun a process of awareness raising into the powers and operations of the ACCC. Time, as you can appreciate, was against us, so our report does not draw solid conclusions or make recommendations but should be seen as the beginning of a discussion into the workings of the ACCC. 
While the ACCC plays a vital role in consumer protection and has performed this role most effectively, there has been some disquiet about its method of operation. It has been seen as regulating by media release and arm-twisting and, while known as a friend to small business, has become the bogyman at the end of the garden, particularly in relation to the implementation of the GST. Many small businesses felt that they had to absorb the costs associated with the GST because of the methodology of the ACCC's press releases.
This then was an important time to review the ACCC most closely. The additional powers given to the ACCC with the introduction of the GST—or, as the government prefers to call it, the new tax system—brought the operation of the ACCC to public attention. The ACCC came under criticism far and wide for its heavy-handed approach in respect of the price monitoring of the introduction of the GST. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, normally supportive of the ACCC, has raised its concern about the introduction of the GST and price monitoring in particular. This has been echoed far and wide, and I am sure everybody in this House has had constituents, particularly those in small business, who were concerned about the heavy-handed approach of the ACCC. As we stated in the report:  
... the heavy-handedness that caused a lot of fear amongst small businesses? They are now saying they have absorbed ... a lot of the price impact of the GST, that we will not really see some of the flow-through of that until next year, and that it has had, in some respects, some negative impact on many small businesses who are going under because they have had to absorb such a lot of the GST load.
In addition, the ACCC used the media extensively to highlight its powers in respect of price exploitation and the GST. At all stages the threat of the $10 million penalties was prominent in ACCC press releases. In a submission to the committee, Professor Pengilley I think correctly stated:
The ACCC also said in its Press Releases that no prices could rise above 10 per cent because its Guidelines, and thus the law, so provided. This was notwithstanding the fact that the preceding day, the Chairman of the ACCC conceded in Senate Committee Hearings that the 10 per cent price cap had no legislative backing. Finally, the ACCC wrongly proclaimed that it, rather than the courts, had the power to fine people $10 million per offence. Professor Fels claims that no one but me—
that is, Professor Pengilley: 
would have read this claim. It was, however, in an ACCC publication entitled “Special GST Issue.”
I can assure you that many others had read this statement, particularly people on this side of the House. Professor Pengilley points out the case in respect of Video-Ezy—one I well remember. He states in his submission:
The actuality of the ACCC's price exploitation “arm twisting” can be seen in its first price exploitation notice. Proceedings were taken against Video-Ezy with a trumpeting by Press Release that it had been guilty, in the ACCC's view, of price exploitation in 21 of its stores, and that its general manager, a company director and a senior manager were party to price exploitation. The Press Release noted that fines of up to $10 million per offence was the price of company sin and that senior managers involved in corporate decisions could face fines of up to $500,000. The Press Release also noted the failure of discussions with Video-Ezy and that the alleged misrepresentations were not the invention of junior staff but reflected the reasons for price increases given by Video-Ezy management to junior staff. Thus the ACCC had been forced to take Video-Ezy to court.
The matter was settled. No penalty was sought. 
That was one example of where the price exploitation had been excessive. In the report, I and other members of the committee brought to the attention of the ACCC concerns with the smash repair industry, particularly in respect of large insurers—the RACV and NRMA. We were concerned that the ACCC seemed to be giving glib responses to the concerns raised by individuals, and that again there was a concern about ACCC's approach. The report also looked into price monitoring and there are grave concerns here. I recommend the report to the House and thank the committee secretariat. (Time expired)

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—The first task of a government is to provide for the security of the communities they serve, not simply when a crisis erupts or when a political opportunity presents itself; it is a permanent task of government. Security of the nation these days— especially since the terrible events of 11 September—has to be conceived of in a broad way. National security is not simply a matter any longer of preparing to fight against other states or securing international arrangements with other states. It is also about protecting communities from threats which have no clear state base. We need new agencies and structures to deal with the more sophisticated security problems we face this century. That is why I rise today to introduce the Australian Coast Guard Bill 2001. As I speak, there is no single agency with the core role of law enforcement and border protection in Australia's maritime jurisdiction. 
The Howard government has refused to accept the need for an Australian coastguard for too long now. Labor proposed it nearly two years ago. It would have been well and truly established if the government had listened to us. The government says that Coastwatch is adequate for the task, yet the Prime Minister has had to call on the Australian Defence Force to strengthen patrols in our northern waters. The Prime Minister claims falsely that a coastguard would cost too much. Yet the government is spending more than $3 million a day to provide the flotilla of expensive Defence assets currently patrolling our northern waters—an operation which would not be necessary if we had an Australian coastguard to do the job. This $3 million a day operation is on top of the existing costs of the Navy's Fremantle patrol boat operations in our northern waters. The significance of that is that Navy's patrol boat operations are regarded as a coastguard type function. The $3 million a day that we are talking about comes in on top of the contribution they make.  
The Australian Coast Guard will be our maritime police force. It will be our cop on the beat, 52 weeks a year, not just for a few weeks on the eve of an election. For the first time, Australia will have a dedicated agency with full-time responsibility and capability to protect Australia's sea borders and maritime interests. When we have a coastguard, our Defence Force can stop playing policeman and get on with the job it is supposed to do: defending Australia from attack and preparing for war when called to do so. I do not know what commitment will be invited of us by the United States, but when those propositions come before us for a contribution to the affairs that are now taking place in Afghanistan, they will find that the Army in this country is substantially locked into critical commitments in Timor, Bougainville and the Solomons. The commitment in Timor will not go away. It is going to be a powerful influence on the structure and activity of the Australian Defence Force for some years to come. They will also find a Navy many of whose heavy ships are now deeply committed to the essential coastguard task in our northern waters. That is an interesting and inevitable prioritisation. You can draw attention to two operations of the Australian Navy at present, one operating in our northern waters with five ships and one which has had an extended tour of duty in the Persian Gulf associated with the immediate events. That shows the extent to which this commitment to deal with illegal immigration is tying down our heavy ships. The other element of our capital ships engaged in the defence of this country are the submarines. While they are enormously suitable as a strike weapon associated with the defence of Australia, they can play a role in neither of those contingencies.
There has been a massive lock-in of assets into the coastguard function at a point in time when it most exposes to public view— and to allied view—the fact that we have a substantially overstretched capability. For the first time, should our bill go through, Australia will have a dedicated agency with full-time responsibility and capability to protect Australia's sea borders and our maritime interests. When we have a coastguard, our Defence Force can stop playing policeman and can defend us against attack. We propose to establish the Australian Coast Guard through integrating and rationalising existing coastal surveillance and response assets currently spread across a number of Commonwealth agencies. This will achieve considerable economies of scale through streamlined administrative arrangements, resource sharing and operational coordination.
There is currently an ongoing cost of at least $220 million spent every year on an uncoordinated coastal surveillance and response system. Add to that the cost of the military mission currently operating in our northern waters and it becomes patently apparent that an Australian coastguard is not an exorbitantly expensive initiative, as Peter Reith, in his last few weeks in parliament, would have you believe. In fact, it is a much more economically responsible initiative than anything that the Howard government has come up with. Just as importantly, it is a necessary initiative for protecting Australia's borders from criminal activity and unlawful incursions.
Threats to Australia's sovereignty, economic interests and national wellbeing are greater today than ever before. Many of these threats come from criminal activity; many from organised, transnational criminal organisations which exploit the vulnerable for pure profit. People-smuggling is the most visible case in point, but also involved are drugs, illicit arms shipments and other incursions. I suppose the influence on this debate in recent days has been our experience with the Tampa and illegal immigration to this country. But the reality is that the Coast Guard is just as important in dealing with issues such as the importation of illicit drugs, in operating quarantine services, in protecting our fisheries and dealing with illicit arms shipments. We have a coastline which is not difficult to penetrate for illegal purposes. We need a force dedicated to dealing with those who would attempt to penetrate it. 
During 1999-2000, 76 suspect vessels entered Australian waters carrying 4,100 people. Many of these people had been exploited by professional people smugglers and organised crime syndicates. Organised crime syndicates have started to bring drugs into Australia via our southern waters. Australian fisheries in the southern oceans and other Australian interests beyond our shores are largely unmonitored and unprotected. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority has to charter a ship to patrol our deep southern oceans because Coastwatch does not have the capacity to do it. When this charter ends in 2003, it will leave Australia unable to control fishing in our exclusive economic zone and in the high seas. 
Despite these threats, Australia's coastal surveillance remains uncoordinated, resources are duplicated and competing priorities of different agencies are not adequately met. Because Coastwatch does not have the responsibility for all maritime policing, it cannot develop a coordinated strategy to respond to the changing surveillance environment and the increasing threats to Australia's borders and interests. Because Coastwatch does not have total ownership of the coastal surveillance budget, it cannot ensure that this budget is spent in the most effective way. Because Coastwatch activities are restrained by the priorities of its client agencies, it cannot undertake activities if these client agencies disagree or refuse to pay. These arrangements do not sufficiently serve the competing demands of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Australian Quarantine Service, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority or the Australian people. 
The Australian Coast Guard Bill 2001, which I am introducing today, sets out the framework for the establishment of the Australian Coast Guard—a statutory agency with responsibility for developing effective and efficient systems to respond to the changing coastal surveillance and enforcement environment. It will be Australia's maritime police agency. Coast Guard officers will have all of the powers and duties which are currently spread across Customs officers, Immigration officers, Fisheries officers, and Australian Federal Police agents in relation to search and seizure; pursuit, boarding, detention and transfer of aircraft and ships; and the questioning, detention and arrest of persons. Coast Guard vessels and officers will be armed.
Under this bill, the functions of the Australian Coast Guard include: the provision of border protection and police services upon Australia's coastal area, territorial waters, contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone in relation to laws of the Commonwealth; property of the Commonwealth; safeguarding of Commonwealth interests; functions previously undertaken by the Coastwatch arm of the Australian Customs Service, including surveillance of Australia's coastal area territorial waters, contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone; coordination of search and rescue operations in maritime zones which fall under the responsibility of Australia; response to oil spills and other environmental incidents upon Australia's territorial waters, contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone; and other functions as prescribed. In times of war or declared defence emergency, the Australian Coast Guard will come under the direct command of the Australian Defence Force. I will return to the operational relationship between the Coast Guard and the Navy in a moment.
This bill provides that details of administrative and employment arrangements and the arming of Coast Guard personnel and vessels are to be presented to the Australian parliament for approval via regulations. One of the prime benefits of bringing our coastal surveillance and response assets into one agency will be improved intelligence on movements in our maritime areas.  
The Australian National Audit Office recently found that Coastwatch has not developed an adequate intelligence collection and management system. Intelligence about criminal activity is one of the most important elements of an effective coastal surveillance and response system. Creating a focal point for coastal surveillance and response in the form of a coastguard will make it easier to fuse the data generated by Australia's considerable intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems into one maritime picture, which will be available to the Coast Guard through highly-secure, high-speed information systems. This means consolidated data from satellite systems, radar systems, maritime surveillance and early warning aircraft, SIGINT systems—combined with the Coast Guard's own information sources and data bases—can be made available in one place to guide the efforts of those protecting our sea borders. At present this capability does not exist.
The Fremantle patrol boats are scheduled for replacement. This presents a unique opportunity to purchase a fleet of purpose-built civil standard patrol boats which will have the capacity to operate in our northern and southern waters. The government has recently entered the request for tender stage of the replacement of these vessels. The contract is not scheduled to be entered into until next year. The tender for this replacement should be—and, under a Labor government, will be—given in the context of establishing the Australian Coast Guard. The significant difference between civil and military construction standards and systems will allow for a significant upgrading of our Coast Guard fleet without additional cost.
It is also important to note that while the Navy and other defence components have been doing a sterling job in assisting with the patrolling of our maritime approaches, this is primarily a job for a coastguard service operating as a maritime police force. The establishment of the Australian Coast Guard will free up the Navy from this policing role and allow it to focus on its primary job: training and preparing for the military defence of Australia. Notwithstanding this, Labor envisages that there will be very close links between the Navy and the Coast Guard. In addition to combining their intelligence and surveillance data, as I have already mentioned, it is proposed that Navy personnel be posted to Coast Guard vessels for tours of duty for operational purposes as well as for training in basic seamanship and navigation. There will be other links between the services, including command cross-postings.
Our nation faces an uncertain challenge ahead. We need to commit to this struggle; we have no alternative. If we are committed to democracy and freedom, this very uncertainty means that we have to do everything within our means to prepare our nation for a struggle which has no clear shape and a challenge which has no clear timetable. We have to get, effectively, all our ducks in a row. The Defence Force is doing what it needs to do. The maritime policing force is effectively doing what it needs to do. The intelligence and surveillance capability that we have is coordinated in a way that serves both purposes. If we have an Australian coastguard, as this bill will establish, we will have that capacity. Without it, we simply will not. This is too dangerous an age to let this sort of opportunity go.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Does the Leader of the Opposition have an explanatory memorandum?
—Yes, that has gone with it as well.
Bill read a first time.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—A private member's bill is one of the few ways an opposition has to try to force a government to do its duty; in this case, to ensure, through legislation, that workers can get what is owed to them when their employer becomes insolvent. We want the government to legislate to prevent companies from rearranging their corporate structures so as to avoid having to pay what they owe their employees. For reasons that can only be guessed at, the government has refused to do this. This refusal has been to the great cost of working people and their families. So, for the 11th time over two parliaments, the opposition is once again proposing legislation to help deal with this ever-growing problem. 
This bill proposes basically that, when a company is being wound up in insolvency, the court may make an order that a related company should pay the entitlements of the employees affected. It proposes that it would be up to the related or parent company to demonstrate why such an order should not be made. We are proposing that the provisions of the bill be backdated to 12 September 2001—the day that Ansett collapsed and the entitlements of at least 16,000 people were thrown into jeopardy. On this last point, I understand that some in the coalition are unhappy about the idea of retrospectivity. Let me make this clear: if retrospectivity is good enough in legislation to deal with asylum seekers, it should be good enough in legislation to protect Australian workers and their families. 
In short, this bill proposes to outlaw the kind of behaviour that was pioneered in the Patrick-MUA dispute—and encouraged avidly by this government and the then minister for workplace relations—and has been used in cases of corporate collapse ever since. The idea that government should allow or even encourage companies to restructure so as to avoid their obligations to their employees would have been totally unacceptable only a few years ago. It should be unacceptable now. The fact that it is not says all that needs saying about the agenda and standards of this government.
The government has another bill coming into the House, a bill which will allegedly place workers in a position where they stand first in line, when a company collapses, among a company's creditors. What is the point of that bill if the company has restructured so there is nothing in the employing vehicle at all? There is no point whatsoever. It is a very pyrrhic victory for ordinary Australian workers. This election campaign is going to be about security—security abroad and security domestically—and I am going to say a bit more about that later. There is no question at all that, if what you want to do is protect the security of employees' entitlements, you must do two things and, if you do not do them, there is no security. The first of those is this bill. This means that you can pursue, through a complex set of company structures into related companies, a capacity to get at assets transferred out of the operation, often usually in anticipation of just such a collapse and a willingness on the part of the owners in those circumstances to see employees go to the wall. So you pass this bill. The second bill that you must pass—and we will pass it on assuming office—is one that puts an obligation on all employers to contribute to a universal scheme that protects workers' rights.
This bill gives the government the opportunity to change its mind and stop behaviour that is a major factor in why the entitlements issue is so serious. If it will not act, be absolutely clear: we will do so as a matter of the highest priority. We have been encouraged to anticipate bipartisan support in this by some remarks by the Treasurer about the Ansett case on the ABC's Lateline last week. He was asked about Air New Zealand directors putting themselves at arms-length from their directorships of Ansett. He answered:
Let's go to this arm's length. So arm's length that the same directors of Air New Zealand were directors of Ansett. So arm's length that the CEO of Air New Zealand was the CEO of Ansett. So arm's length that it appears that there was interchangeability of aircraft and parts of aircraft. Now, if you look at those indications, it's a pretty short arm, but the legal question will be how long that arm was and whether the arm reaches back for liability.
This bill deals with liability. I doubt that the Treasurer will sit with us when it comes to a vote. But he obviously understands the nature of the liability problem. Let us see how he goes when the question is put by a Labor government.
Corporate misbehaviour is one aspect of this issue. The other is the crying need for a system with a structure to protect entitlements as they accrue. We all know how this problem has been growing. Oakdale, Cobar, Braybrook, STP, Woodlawn, Merrywood, Exicom, National Textiles, Grafton and Scone Meatworks, Parrish Meats—there is not a member in this House who would not know immediately what these names meant. Just recently, we have seen the demise of HIH Insurance and Ansett. 
The issue is getting bigger. The number of workers who have been victims of it—and have often been ruined by it—is getting bigger. In a couple of cases, the employees got back most of what they were owed, thanks mainly to their unions. In one case, the government made sure that the employees got all they were owed. That was National Textiles, where the Prime Minister's brother was a director. In most cases, the employees have come out of it very badly.
In all this time, the government has come up with seven different attempts to answer the problem—seven different attempts; making it up as it goes. At no time has it ever tried to deal with the problem at source. Since the National Textiles case, the government has been promoting the Reith scheme, the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme. In this arrangement, employees received limited compensation. The taxpayers had to find the money for what compensation was offered. The Reith scheme had no structure. It was not legislated, though the then minister promised that it would be. It was unfunded beyond 2003. Employers, who share at least some of the responsibility for losing their employees' entitlements, were not asked to contribute one cent. It was not surprising, therefore, that the states declined the government's invitation to put their money into it.
The Reith scheme was never going to work. Even the government has admitted that, by replacing it with what it calls the General Employee Entitlements Redundancy Scheme. It is not legislated, which means that governments can turn it on and off, just as the Reith scheme was not legislated. Taxpayers are forced to find the money for it. Again, employers escape their share of the responsibility for dealing with the problem. Again—and most importantly, whatever the minister says—it does not give 100 per cent protection of workers' entitlements.
It proposes, for example, that workers who lose their jobs will be able to claim up to eight weeks redundancy entitlements `as per community standard'. What is that community standard? Eight weeks was established 17 years ago by the Industrial Relations Commission in a case argued in the old centralised system; that is, 10 years before the move to enterprise bargaining enabled workers in various industries to negotiate various kinds of agreements involving trade-offs and productivity agreements. By plucking it out of the past and putting it into its latest scheme, the government is very carefully imposing the greatest penalty on the workers who have given their employer the greatest loyalty—and at a stage in their lives when they have the least chance of getting other jobs.
The major tragedy in company breakdowns like Ansett's is not that of the worker who is owed $2,000 or $3,000. It is that of the worker who has served for 15 or 20 years. My colleague the member for Brisbane has reminded me of the case of George Kerry, who worked for Ansett for 29 years. Under the government's new scheme, Mr Kerry will lose nearly $87,000. He will get only about 20 per cent of what he is owed.
Federal and state ministerial councils go to great lengths to avoid dissent in their communiques. The minister for workplace relations went to his minco last week to explain his new scheme. `A lengthy discussion ensued,' the communique said. You can bet your bottom dollar on that. `Some Ministers expressed reservations and pressed for a national scheme funded by a levy on employers.' I'll bet they did. It is what state government, employees, unions, the Labor Party and even some employers have been pressing for: a scheme that is national, structured, legislated, funded and fair.
The Labor Party has put forward just such a scheme. I can assure honourable members that we will be hearing a lot more about it as we get nearer the election. In summary, it envisages an insurance scheme provided through the superannuation system, which would protect 100 per cent of employees' entitlements. Ours would be a truly national system which would not need complicated Commonwealth and state negotiations. As in the government's option, our system would exempt small business, their contribution being met by government. Thus, the cost would be shared between the government and larger employers—compared with the government's decision that it should be borne by taxpayers alone. Employers whose arrangements achieve the same objectives will be exempt from involvement in our system. 
Our scheme will provide that employers should make their superannuation guarantee payments every quarter instead of only once a year, as happens now. It will also provide essentially what is proposed in this bill: it will stop companies restructuring so as to avoid paying employee entitlements. The objectives of our proposal are simple, clear and fair. Workers should receive all that they are owed. The responsibility for achieving this should be equitably shared. This bill is an attempt by the opposition to get the government to accept the urgency of the need to resolve a problem which is growing and imposing ever greater burdens on working people and their families.
As the election approaches, two things are going to be clear—as I pointed out before. The issues of the day, as far as we are concerned, are these: security at home and security abroad. I guess if I wanted two bills to symbolise that approach, I could not have wanted for better than these two. One deals with security abroad: how you get your Navy free to do the things they need to do further than the Australian immediate coastline; how you get them to prioritise their defence role rather than assume a policing role for which they are essentially not trained; how you put in place a decent intelligence gathering system, an information system, associated with an organisation which is the focal point of what are now a multiplicity of agencies capable of substantially, because of that rationalisation, enhancing its ability to protect our borders—that is a classic piece of ensuring Australia's security abroad.
Then we get to the question of security at home. The emerging issue in this election campaign, apart from those security issues— or at least a feature of those security issues— is job security. The Treasurer stands in this place day after day with mournful demeanour, telling us how badly the economy is going and what a pity, when it was going so well over the course of the last year or two under his benevolent tutelage. That is a desperate attempt to create an alibi. There is no doubt at all that we are going to be hit hard by the consequences of any international recession. But there is also no doubt we are going to be hit harder than we would have been if the Labor Party's pattern of growth had been sustained and the government had been able to sustain that for its first few years of operation. And then growth, courtesy of the GST, was cut to one-third of what it has been. The Treasurer stands in this place and says, `We lead the world.' In that year, we came 24th out of 30 in the OECD on that front. If the government's predictions for the next year had been correct on growth, we would not have gone to the best position, we would have gone to 9th—considerably better than 24th, I do concede. But there is now a huge question mark over that growth figure. In any case, that growth figure would in no way, shape or form have taken us to the top of the chart—that is the simple fact of the matter.
So in these circumstances, security of entitlements and job security are going to be a critical part of our election campaign—and jobs as well. Employees these days know, particularly if they happen to be in late middle age or middle age, that if they lose their jobs they are unlikely to get as remunerative full-time jobs again—or many of them will not. Their entitlements are absolutely critical to their lifestyle and their capacities to pay off mortgages, their capacities to enjoy decent retirements. They also know that they need a government devoted to full-time jobs, which this government has lost—we have lost 80,000 of them in this community since the GST was introduced. These are the critical things which, when we get clear air in the course of this next election campaign, we will ride home to victory. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)

 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! In accordance with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND EMPLOYMENT SECURITY BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—I commence my comments today by mentioning that on Friday night I attended the annual dinner of the Glenorchy State School Old Scholars Football Club, which was part of a function of the Glenorchy Football Club preparing for their grand final. I do so because it puts in context what I want to say, because two things happened on that night. Firstly, the guest speaker could not come because the Ansett dispute meant they were unable to arrive in Tasmania. Secondly, I had the occasion to sit next to many people, many of them World War II veterans, who had made very significant contributions to their local community. All of them were sensing a great perception that the community that they had worked so hard to build and had given so much great sacrifice for was becoming unravelled. They were angry about corporate greed. They were angry about their government's indifference to public good. They were very concerned about the approach of their national government to the Ansett dispute—an approach which appeared to them to be, `Hands off and hang the consequences, and who cares about the lifeblood of the many people whose employment is thereby affected.' They were talking about nationalism. They were concerned about the future of Australia. The voice that I heard was expressing the view that true Australian nationalism involves not only credible defence against external aggression but also internal cohesion and a resolve that we can build a better future together.
The Leader of the Opposition has just introduced two pieces of legislation—the first would introduce a coastguard and the second would secure the employment benefits of those who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. There are large issues of national security that we have to comprehend. We do need a whole of government response to those who are engaged in criminal activity. We need to see law enforcement now—at a time of growth in international organised crime and terrorism—as also having a national security component. All those issues are ones which Labor has been raising not recently but for a very significant period of time, to the indifference of a government that simply believed they could proceed with business as usual.
But our security abroad and security against criminal threats also requires attention to the insecurities that exist at home. There are many in our community who are wracked by deep feelings of uncertainty. There has been an unravelling of confidence that the future will be better than the past; that we are a united community; that we can rely on public institutions, particularly public education and health; that our jobs are secure; that our old age will be comfortable; that our savings and investments will be safe; that our nation is secure; that our homes and personal security is guaranteed; and basically that there will be a fair go for all.
Superimposed on all of this is the uncertainty that flowed from the external threats so vividly demonstrated by the destruction of the twin towers in New York. We are committed to an approach which will commit Australia to participate in a global response to that terrorism. In the short term, it is no easy task. Governments for some time have sought to identify this as a strategic objective. Within one week of assuming office, Ronald Reagan declared, `Let terrorists beware. When the rules of international behaviour are violated, our policy will be one of swift and effective retribution.'
No-one begrudges the right of the United States to take that effective action. Indeed, we on this side of the House endorse it. But we also do so with that degree of caution that is necessary for the internal cohesion of those things that we hold to be of value. We take the warnings of some who would warn that the greatest danger to that internal cohesion comes from our willingness to demonise those within on the basis of race, ethnicity or religion, and the warning that we must make sure that our political responses are no greater threat to democracy than those that are posed by the terrorists themselves. In the long term, as Robert Manne said in the Age today, we have to address some of the international phenomena that concern us. He said: 
In the end, in my opinion, the contemporary politics of Western self-absorption—the belief that we will be able to continue in comfort while much of the world struggles to survive—is not only immoral but also unlikely to succeed. It is not true that the clear and present danger of terrorism can be overcome by a long-term change of attitude with regard to Third World needs. It is, however, true that indifference to these needs does provide the ideological soil in which anti-Western and anti-American fanaticism and hatred take root.
The same point that Mr Manne makes with respect to a need for broadening a response internationally also goes to our need to broaden our response in relation to security domestically. It is not going to be sufficient to respond to the challenges we face by strengthening the institutions of law enforcement if we do not look to those institutions that are necessary to ensure security in the broader sense. We need a better approach to combating threats to Australia's social and economic security.
Real security for all Australians demands a lot more than measures to combat terrorism and external threats—vital as those measures are. We must also address the grave insecurity posed by unemployment, attacks on our public health and education systems and corporate collapses. We also must defend those elements which are essential for the cohesion of our society, because we are rightly admired throughout the world for our willingness to accept people of different colours, creeds and political beliefs. We have shown in the past that political differences need not produce violent divisions. Now at this difficult time we must rise to meet our own standards. True Australian nationalism does require of us those responses.
Finally, we also have to look at those larger issues of globalisation. They now lead us in some circumstances to situations where, instead of governments having authority, decisions are imposed by remote and unaccountable international institutions or left simply to the market. The events of the last few weeks certainly show that leaving these issues to the market alone is not going to be sufficient. We do need to develop a public response and a public commitment, a willingness to take responsibility and not simply leave things to remote and unidentifiable forces. This of course is nothing new. In its assessment of the impacts of globalisation, the OECD issued an important warning in a landmark study called `Global markets matter', when it said:
There is a presumption that in most instances the overall gains accruing from market liberalisation outweigh the disruptive effects. But that only guarantees that an economy's average standard of living rises. The problem is that an economy's median standard of living, that at which most middle-class income earners can be found, may not rise. Hence the importance of addressing the question of how to ensure that the gains from global integration are diffused as broadly as possible ...
The key is for societies to strike internal bargains which allow those at risk from open markets to be compensated ... For market liberalisation to enjoy broader and continued support, it is important not only that compensation be available but that it actually takes place. 
Five decades of multilateral trade diplomacy suggest that similar bargains are required for spreading gains across countries... Without such compensatory bargains, the gains to the small number of large gainers could be too large relative to those of the large number of small gainers and the few losers. The end result would be similar to that observed domestically: namely the risk of seeing support for further liberalisation eroded. 
That is, not only for liberalisation but for democracy, and the threat to erode that foundational basis for supportive democracy is very real.
What those people at the Glenorchy dinner were saying is that the polarisation and division between those of growing affluence and those without is too great, that a national government that ignores those who are the losers out of the system is unworthy, that governments of regions that are not dealt with in an appropriate way when their circumstances become less attractive because of the impacts of globalisation should be thrown out of office, and that we do need a new sense of responsibility, a new sense of commitment to nationalism and a sense that that involves all of us in commitments to a real and growing equality.

The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 2) 2001 makes consequential amendments to certain offence provisions in the legislation administered by the Treasurer to reflect the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995 to existing offence provisions from 15 December 2001. The amendments to this bill moved by the government in the Senate relate to the interaction between the Criminal Code and the proposed Financial Services Reform Act. The amendments ensure that the Criminal Code does not apply to offences against certain provisions that are being repealed or amended by the proposed Financial Services Reform Act and that are not compliant with the Criminal Code.

I have had the opportunity to have a detailed briefing on this matter, and I understand, as the minister has outlined, that these are essentially temporary or transitional arrangements based on the fact that the date of the implementation of the Financial Services Reform Act has been shifted out from 1 October this year until 11 March next year.
I think the government was rather anxious that any compliance issues that might arise from the Financial Services Reform Bill not come during the October period and that they be pushed out into a post-election environment from March next year. Given that that will occur, it does seem to us appropriate that provisions in this bill are amended accordingly to reflect that change of date and that we do not get into a situation where one piece of legislation is producing certain outcomes and the Financial Services Reform Act is producing different outcomes. Against that background, the opposition supports the amendments which the government has moved.

The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 is essentially a finetuning bill. It is the kind of finetuning which is necessary from time to time to ensure that the Commonwealth Comcare scheme is one of the best performing workers compensation schemes in the country; it is the kind of housekeeping which needs to be done. While the Senate did not accept all of the measures which the government had proposed, I am happy to tell the House that, on the whole, the bill does represent a significant improvement in benefits for workers and a responsible approach by the government to managing costs. I think the amendments, many of which were accepted unchallenged by the Senate, will significantly improve the operation of the Comcare scheme.
Overall, the legislation is a worthwhile package. It represents a reasonable balance between the efficient management of the scheme and providing access to fair compensation for workers. I thank opposition members, both here and in the Senate, for the constructive approach they have taken to this particular piece of legislation.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—When the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill was in this place for its second reading, I made the comment that the Commonwealth scheme was indeed one of the most, in fact arguably the most, efficient scheme in the country: its premiums were low, its claims rate was low by comparison with others and it performed very well by any measure. We were concerned in the House and the Senate to make some improvements to the bill which the government had proposed. I am delighted that the Senate chose to accept the bulk of the amendments that we proposed, although not all the amendments that we sought to have adopted in the Senate were agreed to—and that may well be an issue we return to, in government, after the election. But the bill does provide enhancements for employees and, given the amendments that have been made to it in the Senate, does form an improvement in the operations of the compensation scheme for employees of the Commonwealth.
I take the opportunity to record my thanks to the Labor senators for the work that they did, of necessity in detail, in the Senate. I particularly thank Senator Jacinta Collins for her carriage of the matter in the Senate.

That the bill be now read a second time.
This bill, the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, is an important measure to enhance the effectiveness of the National Crime Authority in combating organised crime.
In particular it will create a significant deterrent to those who seek to obstruct and frustrate the authority's hearing process.
At the same time, the bill contains important accountability measures, notably a role for the Ombudsman and clearer reporting requirements to the parliamentary joint committee on the authority.
The National Crime Authority was established in 1984 as a national law enforcement agency whose purpose was to combat serious and organised crime without the limitations imposed by jurisdictional boundaries.
The continuing support for the activities of the authority from Commonwealth, state and territory governments reflects the important role played by the authority.
The problems caused by serious and organised crime operating across jurisdictional boundaries continue to exist at all levels of society, and it is essential that the authority has sufficient legal authority and operational flexibility to enable it to perform its functions without being hindered or hampered by those whose very conduct the authority is trying to investigate.
It is also essential that the authority is able to operate in an environment that enables the greatest possible flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that the authority remains accountable and responsive.
This bill has been framed to:
implement the government's response to the third evaluation of the National Crime Authority by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, and
address a number of matters relating to the administration and operations of the authority.
The bill was amended in the Senate in response to recommendations from an inquiry into the bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority.
I wish to pay tribute to the late Peter Nugent MP, who chaired that committee most efficiently and effectively.
While the government disagrees with some of the amendments made in the Senate, it will accept all of them, in the interests of securing the enactment of this important legislation.
The authority's task in investigating organised crime has been particularly difficult because of the way persons under investigation have manipulated existing legal rules and procedures to defeat the investigation.
If a person refuses to answer a question in a hearing, it has been possible for that refusal to be litigated through the courts, with delays of months or even years.
In the interim, an investigation might be entirely frustrated, such that when proceedings are concluded and questioning can continue, the criminal trail has gone cold.
It was for this reason that the bill that was introduced in the other chamber also contained a contempt regime.
The government considers that this would have been an immediate, fair and effective means for deterring and punishing deliberate obstruction of NCA hearings.
However, these provisions were removed in the Senate and the government will not pursue them at this time.
Even worse, penalties for failure to answer a question at an NCA hearing have regularly been very modest—a few hundred dollars.
This is not much of a deterrent where obstructing the authority can impede an investigation that might have led to a person being jailed for years for a serious offence such as drug trafficking.
Accordingly, the maximum criminal penalty for failing to answer a question at a hearing will be substantially increased under the bill, from six months prison and a $1,100 fine to five years imprisonment and a $20,000 fine.
Other criminal penalties relating to non-compliance with the authority's investigatory powers will be increased to the same level. 
The bill will also allow an investigatory body to derive evidence from self-incriminatory evidence given by a person at a hearing, and for a prosecuting authority to use that derived evidence against the person at a later trial.
In other words, a person's self-incriminatory admissions will not themselves be able to be used as evidence against that person, but will be able to be used to find other evidence that verifies those admissions or is otherwise relevant to proceedings.
However, the bill will specifically provide that once a witness has claimed that the answer to a question might tend to incriminate him or her, then any evidence that the person gives cannot be used against the person in any later trial.
The existing mechanism for a special undertaking by the DPP will not be required as this protection will be clearly set out in the legislation.
In addition, the bill will remove the uncertain defence of `reasonable excuse' for conduct such as failing to answer a question, and replace it with more clearly defined Criminal Code defences such as intervening event and sudden emergency.
The removal of the defence of `reasonable excuse' will also mean that a witness is no longer able to delay the authority's hearing process by challenging, in the Federal Court, the authority's decision that he or she did not have a reasonable excuse for, amongst other things, failing to answer a question.
The provisions that remove the defence of reasonable excuse, remove derivative-use immunity and increase the penalties for non-compliance with the NCA act are intended to enhance the overall effectiveness of the authority.
It is important therefore to ensure that the amendments have had the desired effect and to this end the bill provides for a review of the operation of these provisions after they have been in force for five years.
This is an important mechanism for assessing the continuing appropriateness of these provisions.
The administrative matters addressed by the bill are designed to improve the operational effectiveness of the National Crime Authority.
The scope of references will be expanded to enable the authority to investigate offences that occur after the date of the reference.
The role of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in relation to access to information held by the authority will be clarified, as will the ability of the authority to disseminate information to overseas agencies.
In addition, the maximum term of appointment of members of the authority will be increased from four to six years, to increase continuity in relation to matters dealt with by the authority.
As a result of a further amendment in the Senate, the class of persons who may issue search warrants will be expanded to include federal magistrates but not state and territory magistrates.
Again, the government will not pursue its preferred option, in the interests of securing the enactment of this legislation.
The bill will introduce the concept of hearing officers, who will be appointed by the Governor-General on the unanimous recommendation of the Inter-Governmental Committee of the National Crime Authority.
The hearing officers will only be empowered to conduct hearings on behalf of the authority, thereby increasing the investigatory capacity of the authority but without expanding the category of `members'.
The bill will also clarify a number of matters such as:
the power of the authority to control who may be present at hearings;
the application of legal professional privilege;
the use of reasonable force in the execution of a warrant; and
the fact that a prohibition on disclosure relating to the authority's process overrides any contrary requirement under the Privacy Act 1988 for so long as the prohibition remains in force. 
In relation to the last issue, the bill will insert a note into the Privacy Act 1988 to alert the reader of that act to the requirements of the NCA act.
Minor administrative matters include:
adopting the definition of `document' from the Evidence Act 1995;
including the offences of `money laundering' and `perverting the course of justice' in the definition of offences that the authority may investigate;
replacing references to the chairperson and chairman of the authority with references to `chair' of the authority;
—That is very important.
—Indeed. Those matters also include:
repealing ambiguous provisions; and 
enabling the chair of the authority to delegate certain powers.
In terms of the authority's accountability, a fundamental reform proposed in the bill concerns the mechanism for investigating complaints.
The bill will amend the Ombudsman Act 1976 to extend the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to deal with complaints against the authority.
The amendments will deem the authority to be a prescribed authority for the purposes of the Ombudsman Act.
This will have the effect of enabling the Commonwealth Ombudsman to deal with complaints against the authority, members of the authority, and members of the staff of the authority.
The amendments will also give the Commonwealth Ombudsman discretion to transfer a complaint to a more appropriate authority (for example, a state agency for a complaint against a state officer) and enable joint investigations.
State and territory authorities will be able to exercise their full powers under governing state and territory laws.
Both are matters within the powers of the Ombudsman in relation to complaints against other authorities or departments.
The amendments made by the bill will result in a more effective and efficient National Crime Authority to grapple with the ever-increasing complexities of organised and serious crime.
This is an important measure, prepared in consultation with states and territories, and which reflects the results of two inquiries by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority.
The bill will enhance our capacity to address serious and organised crime at the national level whilst operating within a properly accountable framework.
I commend the bill to the House and I present the revised explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—I rise to speak on the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for her contribution and for her acknowledgment that this legislation has been the product of cooperation and discussion between the government and the opposition. In a somewhat self-serving way, I note the fact that the bill adopts a number of amendments which were first put forward on 13 March 2000 in the form of a private member's bill which I introduced. At that time, the government did not endorse those proposals, even though the case at that time was compelling. Plainly, the government now accepts that they are both necessary and appropriate. However, it is a shame that it took 12 months before the substantive reforms were put in place.
On this basis, the opposition supports the principal thrust of this bill in seeking to improve the National Crime Authority's efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, we accept the need to amend the National Crime Authority Act to remove the defence of reasonable excuse in the provision of answers to inquiries by the authority, to remove the derivative use immunity and to increase penalties. However, the opposition is acutely aware that there is always a fine balance to be struck between giving law enforcement agencies effective investigation tools and protecting the rights of individuals. The civil liberties of all Australians are fundamental to the concern of this parliament and cannot be overlooked. For this reason, the opposition moved a number of amendments in the Senate which were adopted. They make sure that this bill now commands bipartisan support, and I am very pleased that the government has decided not to press a number of its original proposals which were the subject of amendments in the Senate. 
Turning to the main provisions of the bill, it became almost a matter of notorious fact to those who came before the National Crime Authority or those who were advising potential witnesses to such a hearing that those who were called on to provide information to the National Crime Authority could effectively avoid the consequences of the provision of testimony by using one of two routes: they could either make a frivolous claim for immunity on the basis that an answer might incriminate them; or they could simply refuse to answer such a question at all, knowing that the penalties—if any—that would be imposed when the matter was prosecuted were on the very minor scale of criminal responsibility. Over time, that became an almost insurmountable impediment to the National Crime Authority, which is, of course, tasked with investigating serious and organised crime. The private member's bill which I introduced addressed those particular issues of concern, because in a number of court cases there had been what effectively amounted to trivial penalties imposed by magistrates when those asked or required to provide testimony to the National Crime Authority either frivolously sought to make a claim on the basis that the answer provided might incriminate them, or they refused to answer at all. In those instances, we found that effectively the will of the parliament, which had been to give to the National Crime Authority the power to compel witnesses to give testimony, was being overborne.
At the moment, witnesses who appear before NCA hearings are able to refuse to give evidence if they assert that they have a reasonable excuse to do so. If a witness refuses to answer questions on this ground, the only way that the National Crime Authority is able to pursue the evidence is to obtain a court order requiring the witness to give the answer. The principal claim that justifies the claim of a reasonable excuse is that it would tend to incriminate them. In practice, this is a time consuming and costly process which is rarely pursued by the National Crime Authority. As a result, even if there is no proper basis for claiming any immunity, witnesses at hearings have often been able to frustrate a National Crime Authority investigation by refusing to answer questions. 
During the joint parliamentary committee hearings on this bill, the former chair of the National Crime Authority cited a case where a witness before the National Crime Authority refused to confirm a family relationship on the grounds that to do so would be self-incriminating. In other words, when asked whether that person was a brother or sister of a particular person, the person refused to answer that question on the grounds that it would be self-incriminating. Plainly, that is not an excuse available to law. There is no way that such an answer would be self-incriminating, but at that point the proceedings had to terminate and the only way in which that witness could be dealt with was to take the matter to court to seek an order. Court delays are extensive and a witness who went through that process could turn up to the National Crime Authority again, having been through those hearings, perhaps answer that question and then refuse to answer another question on the grounds of self-incrimination and go through the process again. Alternatively, that person could simply refuse to answer, knowing that the worst thing that would happen is that they would be prosecuted in a magistrate's court, and if so proceeded against, would be liable for a very trivial fine. That would completely defeat the purpose of the law enforcement's capacity to obtain from that witness the key materials they required to investigate serious and organised crime.
This bill removes the ability of witnesses to refuse to answer a question based on reasonable excuse. The defence of reasonable excuse will be removed and replaced with the defences set out under the Criminal Code. The reason for removing the defence of reasonable excuse and replacing it with the Criminal Code defences, such as intervening event or sudden emergency, is to deny a witness the opportunity to delay the National Crime Authority's hearing processes by challenging in the Federal Court the National Crime Authority's decision that he or she did not have a reasonable excuse for failing to answer a question. 
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—Before the dinner break, I was reflecting on the provisions that currently exist which provide relatively minor inconvenience to a witness who declines to provide information to a National Crime Authority hearing. If I might turn to the existing rules regarding self-incrimination, currently a witness before the National Crime Authority who raises a reasonable claim that the answer to a question or the production of a document may tend to incriminate him or her is entitled to refuse to answer the question or to produce the document or thing that he or she is asked to produce unless he or she receives an undertaking from the appropriate Director of Public Prosecutions that the answer, document or thing, or anything derived therefrom, will not be used as evidence against the person in any later proceeding. I have discussed previously the circumstance where a person makes an unmeritorious claim that an answer might incriminate them, in practice seeking to defy the powers of compulsory taking of evidence before the National Crime Authority; but under the current law, even in instances where a proper objection is taken, the objectives of the National Crime Authority are made considerably more difficult by the existing law.
The bill removes the derivative use immunity. Under the amendments contained in the bill, a witness who does raise a claim of self-incrimination will nonetheless be required to answer the question or present the document, and it will be an offence if he or she fails to do so. That does not entirely mean that we ride roughshod over circumstances where previously the law allowed a claim to be made on the basis of self-incrimination. Where evidence is required to be given, notwithstanding an objection on the basis of self-incrimination, the evidence then given will not be admissible in any future court proceedings, and no undertaking from the Director of Public Prosecutions will be required. In other words, the law itself that we are passing will mean that, where somebody does provide evidence in circumstances where they have properly raised a claim of possible self-incrimination, that evidence will not be admissible in any future proceedings.
However, importantly, evidence derived from the evidence given can be used. That means, for example, if somebody is asked to provide evidence regarding a suspicious death in which a person might have been peripherally involved, that person previously could have refused to give evidence unless the relevant Director of Public Prosecutions had provided a certificate. And even if, as a result of the giving of evidence, some other material was found—for example, as a result of that information provided to the National Crime Authority, let us assume that a blood stained knife is found—the fact of the finding of that knife and the circumstances would not be admissible in a proceeding against that person, because of the derivative use immunity. That obviously imposes significant discounts on the effectiveness of an investigatory agency. What we will now find is that, although the oral evidence given at the time by the person, to the effect that a blood stained knife was secreted by Bill Smith or indeed by himself in some particular place, that evidence would not be admissible; but the fact that a blood stained knife was found and that it had fingerprints on it which corresponded to Bill Smith's, or indeed to those of the person who was compelled to give evidence, would be admissible in those future proceedings. So the abolition of the derivative use protection is an important one.
This is not unique. It simply brings the National Crime Authority legislation and powers into line with the law as it exists and applies with respect to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Com-mission and the New South Wales Crime Commission. Indeed, many members of this House might wonder that circumstances have evolved to such an extent that we recognise the need to deal with the problems of derivative use immunity and compulsory providing of testimony in those other contexts but not in the instance of the National Crime Authority—which, after all, is an agency of this parliament and other parliaments around Australia devoted to the specific task of investigating serious organised crime. So we have given these powers in the past to, for example, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, but we have not seen fit until now to provide them to the National Crime Authority. This bill does address those particular issues. 
Given these changes, leaving the existing penalties for refusing to provide answers to inquiries by the National Crime Authority would be foolish. Already there are instances where some of the harder-headed persons coming before the National Crime Authority simply thumb their nose at the authority and defy the authority to take them to court and proceed against them. Under the current legislation, the penalty for refusing to answer a question in a NCA hearing is a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment for six months. That is hardly a deterrent to somebody who is making huge profits from illegal activities. First offenders will usually be expected to be penalised at the lower end of what is a relatively light sanction. When faced with a choice between paying a small fine—or, at worst, a very short period of imprisonment— and giving evidence which may lead to conviction for a very serious offence either against themselves or against their colleagues, not giving evidence is far too easy an option.
An effective deterrent to failing to answer or giving misleading answers will substantially improve the National Crime Authority's ability to investigate the activities of serious criminals and the people who work for them. The bill will increase these penalties to a fine of $20,000 or five years imprisonment. None of the amendments contained in this bill are uncontroversial; they make substantial changes. However, if we want to have law enforcement that can combat sophisticated criminals and the threat of organised crime, we must give the NCA the tools they need. That said, there are limits to the powers that we should give to any law enforcement agency, even to the specialised National Crime Authority.
When this bill was presented to the Senate there were a number of provisions that went beyond what the opposition regarded as appropriate limits and, in the course of negotiations and in the debate, we were able to persuade the government—and I thank the Democrats also for their contribution to this process—that the opposition amendments substantially improved the bill. As such, they were adopted. The opposition amendments that were adopted in the Senate include, firstly, limiting the courts that can issue search warrants. The bill proposed to extend to state and territory magistrates the authority to issue search warrants sought by National Crime Authority members and certain staff members under sections 22 and 23 of the National Crime Authority Act. The opposition put the case that it was not appropriate that state and territory magistrates have the authority to grant warrants for National Crime Authority activities. An opposition amendment that limited the extension to federal magistrates only was passed in the Senate.
Some might fail to understand the importance of this, but the truth is that such authorisations should not be given lightly. They are not to be issued capriciously and it should not be an occasion for the National Crime Authority to approach these instances other than in the utmost of seriousness. There have been instances in the past, regrettably, where state and territory magistrates have, in a sense, given a rubber stamp to the issue of warrants by police and other agencies. With all the weight that it bears, the National Crime Authority going before a state or territory magistrate and claiming that a warrant is in the national interest in response to serious and organised crime is likely to be somewhat overinfluential in terms of that law office's responsibilities. Some might dismiss this as speculative on my part and on the part of the opposition, but we believe that it is important to confine those powers to a relatively limited group. The existing powers to issue warrants will be extended but they will be extended, in this instance, only to federal magistrates. They are, under the constitutional framework of Australia, chapter III, `The judicature', appointed until the formal age of retirement under the Constitution and entirely aware of the significance of their constitutional responsibilities under federal law. 
Secondly, the government proposed a new contempt regime for the National Crime Authority. This is not the occasion to canvass all of the details proposed, but, essentially, the opposition felt that having firstly dealt with the issues that went to the capacity of people who refused to testify—increasing the penalties, making sure that we dealt with the issues of derivative use immunity and making certain that people could be compelled to give answers, notwithstanding alleged claims that that would infringe against their rights in respect of self-incrimination—we were going one bridge too far in also introducing a contempt regime. What a contempt regime would have purported to do would be to enable the almost instant imprisonment of somebody for a refusal, a circumstance or an action taken in defiance of the National Crime Authority.
Having made all these significant changes that addressed what we understood to be the principal claims of the authority in the past— and I have been the minister responsible for justice, and we had evidence from former members of the National Crime Authority and from current members of the National Crime Authority—our view was that a contempt regime was inappropriate. It tended also to conflate the National Crime Authority with the court. Courts have precisely such powers. If you act abusively in the face of the court, the court can instantly deal with that matter by way of a contempt proceeding. But, of course, the National Crime Authority is not a court. Indeed, this parliament can also exercise such contempt powers but, in its wisdom now, generally—while I think that, under the standing orders, it would still be available to us to proceed in such a way— since those Browne and Fitzpatrick cases this parliament has thought wiser of any instance of proceeding in such a manner and would proceed in the normal way to have that conduct punished through the ordinary court system. The National Crime Authority is not a court and conflating it, in the way in which the legislation proposed with the powers and the kinds of responses available to a court, appeared to us to be wrong in principle. Even the majority report of the committee, made up of government members, expressed reticence about this proposal. Unfortunately, in our view, it then took the soft option of agreeing to its implementation for a trial period.
In contrast, the opposition shared the concerns which were expressed by the Hon. Trevor Griffin, the Attorney-General of South Australia, and Mr John Broome, the former National Crime Authority chair. Both Mr Griffin and Mr Broome essentially argued two things: firstly, that as a matter of general principle, it was inappropriate to liken an investigatory body like the National Crime Authority to a court; and, secondly, that the contempt provisions were unnecessary if the other proposals in the bill in relation to removal of the reasonable excuse concept and the substantial increase in penalties were enacted. I think it is self-evident, although it needs assertion from time to time, that the National Crime Authority is not a judicial body. Although the law does facilitate and allow for a judge to be appointed as chair of that authority, it is not a judicial body; it is an investigative agency of the executive government. 
Therefore, in our view, it is a seriously flawed breach of the separation of powers to imply that hindering or obstructing an investigatory body should be treated in the same way or in an equivalent manner to a contempt of court. On those grounds, the opposition in the Senate rejected the inclusion of the contempt regime that was proposed. We think that this is actually an improvement in the legislation. As the parliamentary secretary indicated, the provisions in this bill will be monitored and there will be a report to the parliament in five years time. If there are any deficiencies that arise in respect of the powers that have been granted to the National Crime Authority, either by way of excess or by way of inadequacy, they can be addressed. Indeed, they need not wait five years, if they become transparent in either direction. So there will be an occasion to revisit this issue should it be thought appropriate. But, certainly, as a matter of principle, it is important for us not to violate the separation of powers, and most of us at least adhere to that in a rhetorical sense—and the opposition does more than adhere to these things in a rhetorical sense. 
There were also provisions in the bill that we have rejected regarding proposals to give the chair of the National Crime Authority the power to employ persons outside the Public Service Act. The justification for seeking those additional powers was that the chair of the National Crime Authority perceived a need for more flexibility than the act provided in relation to terms and conditions of employment. Mr Crooke argued that much of the organisation's funding is directed to specific operations and that, as they unfolded, he wanted the flexibility to employ or deploy persons in particular areas or suddenly engage persons with particular expertise for short-term appointments. The opposition had no quarrel with the NCA's need for flexible employment provisions, but pointed out that those provisions already exist in the National Crime Authority's current legislation and in the Public Service regulations. The chair of the National Crime Authority already has the power to employ consultants on such terms and conditions as he or she determines under section 48 of the NCA Act. While we would not be keen to see the overuse of this power, the employment of persons with particular skills for the short term is authorised under that section and the use of consultants is a more accountable process than that proposed by the bill, given that the NCA's annual report is required, as a matter of government policy, to list all consultancies to a value of $10,000 or more.
If the NCA needs to employ persons to meet short-term requirements in `a proper employment relationship and not as a consultant coming on board', the Public Service regulations introduced in 1999 make ample provision for just that situation. Regulation 3.5 of the Public Service Regulations 1999 allows for the engagement of non-ongoing employees for the duration of a specific task, with no specific time limits applying. The only requirements the agency must fulfil are to make a reasonable estimate of the duration of the task and to ensure that ongoing employees with appropriate skills are given an opportunity to apply and be considered for the position. I do not think that those requirements should be regarded as constraints. They are entirely proper to meet the needs of the National Crime Authority and all other agencies in the Australian government sector. So the opposition rejected those provisions, and I think we were correct in doing so.
There are two other points that I should conclude on. The first is oversight. This bill remedies a longstanding defect in our law. It has been recognised by almost everybody who has looked at the National Crime Authority that there is no effective and independent scrutiny or oversight of its conduct—and it can be fairly asked: who polices the police? That does not reflect on the integrity of the National Crime Authority or suggest that corruption within the authority exists. But history has shown that it is simply naive to leave police or investigating organisations to supervise themselves. This weakness has been recognised in principle since the time of the former Labor government and there have been a variety of different solutions proposed. 
There is no shortage of people who have raised allegations concerning the operations of the National Crime Authority. For an organisation placed in the kind of spotlight of public attention which the National Crime Authority is placed, it is surprising that the government has left in place for so long the law as it stands. The Ombudsman would have been established as the oversight body for the National Crime Authority over 12 months ago if the government had moved to support my private member's bill which I mentioned previously. Unfortunately, again, politics got in the way of good policy. After considerable negotiation with the government, this bill allows the Ombudsman Act to be extended to enable complete powers to review the conduct and operations of the National Crime Authority, subject only to proposed paragraph 9(3)(e) of the Ombudsman Act, which would extend the grounds on which the Attorney-General may issue a certificate to prevent the Ombudsman from requiring a person to provide information in those instances when the Attorney certifies that access may endanger the life of a person or create a risk of serious injury to a person. There will be such instances that emerge from time to time, and it is appropriate that such an exception be provided. 
My private member's bill, I think, has been the impetus for this legislation. It is a rare occasion when an individual member can come before the House and take credit for the passage of law which is shaped in the form that they have suggested, other than through a process initiated by a government minister. One small matter of regret that I have is that we still do not have a joint parliamentary committee for the oversight of Commonwealth law enforcement. There really does need to be a more comprehensive overview of law enforcement that involves scrutiny by this parliament. I think it commands the support of the oversight committee, the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, of which I am a member. This is the third time we have given the government the opportunity to support the establishment of such an important committee, but again, for whatever reason, the government has not supported it. Certainly, in office, we will do so.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"—I am pleased to rise to contribute to this discussion, following the member for Denison who, like me and the two other speakers, the member for Cowan and the member for Cook, is a very active member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. The role of the committee at about this time last year, in discovering the parameters of the legislation proposed by the government and taking evidence in the public arena, from law enforcement agencies and other interested persons, about the ramifications of it, has led to the refined version of the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 before us. The member for Denison noted various negotiations and discussions which occurred, but I think that this legislation is, in fact, in itself testimony to the effectiveness of this parliament to always debate and discover good ideas and better ideas in what I believe to be one of the most critical areas of legislation: our responsibility to legislate to protect innocent people against those who do the wrong thing.
Let us face it: at this particular time we need the National Crime Authority and its coordinating role of various law enforcement agencies perhaps more than we have at any time during its existence and, indeed, at any time during our nation's fairly young history. At the moment, we have in this country an assault on our citizenry through the trade in human misery in the form of the importation into this country of illegal narcotics, handled all too often by the same crime gangs that are importing illegal arrivals who demand their right to stay in this country. This legislation is certainly all about ensuring that the National Crime Authority continues to have the tools it needs to get on with the job, but always being subject to the accountability that I believe all people in Australia would expect it to have. The principles that underscored why the National Crime Authority was convened included to coordinate the effort to break down the jurisdictional barriers that were feeding in, with great convenience, to the criminal element in our community. It needs to have the tools required to get on with the task of policing our country and discovering those who are organising criminal activities to the detriment of our nation and our citizenry.
This legislation is certainly welcomed by me. Without wanting to detract from the very learned observations of the former justice minister, the member for Denison, I have to say that this sort of legislation is welcomed even at the local Neighbourhood Watch level. The grassroots fighters against crime in my own electorate need to know that at this level of national responsibility tools are being given to the professional law enforcement agencies. It is important for people to know that the conditions that are now placed in law, which have come as a result of recommendations of the parliamentary committee, look at ways of stopping the criminal elements from using all sorts of means of slowing down the discovery by the NCA of their activities, their knowledge of activities or their contribution to activities. I think the member for Denison put the case very well that someone could appear before the NCA and find a reason, under the derivative use immunity or the reasonable excuse defence, to avoid answering questions. In fact, once they had answered one question—a process forced upon them because a legal action was taken through a court of law to answer a question asked of them by the NCA—they could simply move on and refuse to answer the next set of questions. We see these sorts of things happening through tribunals sorting out those who claim to be refugees. In other forums, we find exactly the same kind of practice taking place now. One family member may be put forward to be, if you like, the weathervane of one particular family's contention that they are refugees and, once that particular weathervane has been proved not to have been a legitimate refugee, another family member applies. That is why other legislation introduced by this government to try and correct those matters is equally as important as the matters contained within this bill.  
The bottom line is that we cannot allow witnesses found by the National Crime Authority to continue to frustrate the processes of the NCA in the very important tasks that it is charged with. What is good about what we have before us is that, as I said, so much of it has come as a result of the committee's own role. The original set of legislative parameters that was introduced in the form of a bill last year, on 7 December, on behalf of the then Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Vanstone, caused the inquiry that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority undertook. Ironically, that legislation resulted from a previous report by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. Before those listening to this debate think that there is a never ending circle of committee recommending, government acting, committee recommending, government acting, at the end of the day the process always has to be very deliberative. There always has to be a very deliberate step by step approach taken because that, after all, is what responsible governments do.
Unfortunately, the criminal element never stop to wait for legislation to plan their next response, and the old adage about being one step ahead of the law was never more true than it currently is. As other committee reports have highlighted, the use of technology and so forth to try to profit even far more greatly from crime or to hide the proceeds of crime even more so means that we as legislators are always playing catch-up. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, though, has continued to take its obligation of seeking accountability from the National Crime Authority very seriously in its attempts to report to the parliament to highlight what we believe are ways to improve the legislation which underpins the NCA, and that is what you have here today.
The fact that the NCA targets people who are facing penalties of many years imprisonment or fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars for serious offences such as drug trafficking you would have thought would have been in itself some sort of penalty, but we are talking about people who are making tens of millions of dollars and who see the concept of fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars as not being much of an impediment to their particular activities. In fact, even though there are some significant incentives in one sense to try to obstruct the investigation, nevertheless many of them are not all that threatened. So the bigger the stick that we can carry in a lot of cases, the bigger the sanction that we can enforce in so many ways, which is all to the better as far as I am concerned.
But in the end this legislation is about removing some of the incentive to obstruct the process of the National Crime Authority. The National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 introduces several major initiatives which are intended to strengthen the NCA's investigative processes. It is intended to make it far more difficult for those who are involved in criminal activities who are questioned by the NCA to avoid the opportunity to actually answer questions. It also ensures that the NCA can get on with the job of rooting out the people they ultimately want to deal with and to refer those matters on to the courts and other law enforcement agencies. 
The government is committed to the capacity of the NCA improving in relation to pursuing those involved in serious organised crimes, especially drug trafficking and the trade in the other form of human misery, those involved in the illegal arrivals. This is a trade which is far more contemporary in people's minds than perhaps drug trafficking, which is an ongoing major crisis in this country. The government has continued to provide, and does through this bill, enhanced law enforcement legislation to combat drug trafficking. It is a government priority. The bill before us balances powers and accountability. It improves the complaints possibilities for those who feel they have been unfairly treated by the National Crime Authority in its eagerness to get to the bottom of criminal activity by altering the respective acts governing the role the Commonwealth Ombudsman to allow complaints to be referred there. This is subject to the caveat that, should any particular complaints made to the Ombudsman which trigger their own form of inquiry place certain people under investigation by the NCA under some sort of life-threatening difficulty, the Attorney-General will have some final say on some of those matters. I do not think anybody fairly could think that that is an unreasonable caveat to introduce.
The government has continued to show, through its time in office, greater support for the effectiveness of the National Crime Authority than has the opposition, which unfortunately has sought to try to finetune things in other ways. The removal of the contempt regime that the member for Denison talked about in his contribution is a matter of disappointment to the government. The provisions allowing the employment of non-Australian public sector employees is another matter that the government believes reduces some of the flexibility that the NCA would like to have and that the government would certainly like to give. However, in the interest of getting the glass more full than it is empty, in the interest of negotiation, the government has accepted a great range of the observations of the committee, including the minority report recommendations.
As I said at the beginning, this in itself is a positive proof of the role of this parliament in sorting through the various arguments. There is no hard partisanship—apart from occasional comments from me and others— on dismissing out of hand a recommendation that may come from an observation, well-intentioned of course, by the member for Denison and others in the opposition. The government has accepted some of the minority report recommendations, in particular the matters relating to the Federal Magistrates Court being empowered to issue search warrants in lieu of state and territory magistrates. While it may in fact confine some of the flexibility the government was seeking, it is better to get the bulk of this bill passed and through its various stages. As I said, the real test of where this government is is the fact that it has continued to look for new ways to support the National Crime Authority and law enforcement agencies in general in their efforts to fight against the importing of drugs and the importing of human beings by criminal elements both within and beyond our shores.
I would suggest that it will not be long before the National Crime Authority becomes completely involved, completely immersed, in pooling all of its various contacts and all of the various liaison points that it has to deal with the thousands of illegal migrants who are arriving here, trying to arrive here or are already here and in finding the people smugglers. They will face up to 20 years in prison or a fine of $220,000. Before long the National Crime Authority will continue to expand its role into those sorts of areas, because they are areas of criminal activity that are having far-reaching effects across the Australian population. In my own electorate, people who have come through the legitimate channels as legitimate refugees to this nation strongly support the moves by this government to bring about a far more effective regime in that regard. They are greatly offended by those who are involved in criminal activities, smuggling people at thousands of dollars a head to bring them to this country. To try to bring about a result there is something that even the most recently arrived real refugees support. 
I raise this because, at the end of the day, part of the National Crime Authority's role is to look at these sorts of criminally based, organised crime activities; to look at ways in which the Australian community is burdened, as far as the effect of these activities is concerned; to realise that Australian taxpayers are affording the fight against these sorts of activities; and, at the same time, to look for ways to try and penalise those who are involved in them. When you consider that the same gangs which are involved in the transportation or the attempted transportation of human cargo are also involved in the transportation of drug cargo to our nation, to try and invade the lives of young Australians—those who perhaps are far more vulnerable and less capable of making their own decisions—you realise that the National Crime Authority, as a lead agency in intelligence gathering and coordination of various law enforcement agencies across the country, needs as many tools as it can get. To make our community safer, we need to be tough on drugs; we need to be tough on the criminal elements, those who are importing human misery—either drugs or illegal arrivals. We need to send clear messages that our drug problem needs to be taken seriously. Mick Keelty, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, just last month said `the reality is that the seizures we have had in the last two years particularly demonstrate quite clearly that we are having an effect in the supply reduction strategy, and we are having an effect which is creating a heroin drought'. In the Herald Sun on 16 August, he said:
Our intelligence is showing us that there are indications from drug source countries now that they do not want to send drugs to Australia and that is directly as a result of what we are achieving through these large seizures.
When you consider this, you realise the role of the National Crime Authority as a lead agency is in fact starting to bring home the bacon, as far as their efforts are concerned.
The contrast with the Australian Labor Party on those sorts of matters is startling. With their soft-on-drugs approach and their policy on backing heroin injecting rooms they are sending the wrong messages to young Australians and to people involved in Neighbourhood Watch who are trying to stop the criminal activity at the local level, which is of course costing the community and so many people daily. They are sending the wrong messages to the criminal elements offshore that, should there be a change of government, there will be a softening of attitude as far as drug importation defence is concerned and that there will be a softening of matters as far as the treatment of illegal arrivals is concerned. Those sorts of matters are important to be brought out and discussed in the context of the role of the National Crime Authority.
As I said, this government has been about giving more tools to the trade to fight crime; this government has been about giving more strength to the role of the National Crime Authority. That the Australian Labor Party should be crowing tonight about the fact they have been able to pull back and frustrate some of the government's determination to give to the National Crime Authority the real flexibility sought is, I guess, unfortunate; but it is a way, if you like, of colouring the facts to suit the argument.
At the end of the day, this government's determination will remain unwavering. This government is rock solid on protecting Australia's borders. This legislation is proof positive of our best efforts to get ahead of the criminals—but we are always mindful of the fact that they tend to always be one step ahead of us. No matter how many times the Australian Labor Party may suit themselves and try to water down and prevent the flexibility the government seeks, this government will keep rising to the occasion to reintroduce legislation to toughen up the stand against the drug traffickers and the illegal migrant-traffickers, to ensure all Australians feel very sure and confident that their government is protecting them by the way it legislates. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—I listened with interest to the previous speaker, the member for Moreton. I thought he was going pretty well, until he started to inject that note of party politics into a debate which does not really need party politics. It is unfortunate, because I thought a number of the points he made were quite good but, in the end, he really showed himself up for what he is: a person who is desperate to win a seat in an environment where that is very unlikely. But I do not want to be too hard on him, because he made a number of good points, one of which was that the National Crime Authority in recent times has worked pretty well. This is due to the balance and the wisdom of people like the member for Denison, who has been a great contributor—probably one of the best contributors—to the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in recent years. He has contributed over a long period of time. 
I came to the joint parliamentary committee as a former Minister for Police in Western Australia, and I have seen the politicisation of that committee, of which I am a member. The states in frustration almost pulled the pin and walked away from it because of its politicisation. It would have been a great pity if that had happened, because the NCA relies on the other jurisdictions in this nation, as it should. As no jurisdiction is a single or separate entity in this nation in the fight against crime, equally it is true that every jurisdiction or agency must rely on one another and must work together—they must share intelligence, information and a common goal—to catch criminals. As I said, I am a member of this committee, as is the previous speaker, the member for Denison, and as is the next speaker, the member for Cook, who is the chairman. This committee has an important role to play in setting a non-political lead and in endeavouring to put forward legislation that addresses inquiries and reports and enhances the capacity and the capability of our law enforcement officers to deal with organised crime in this nation.
I want to refute a couple of things the previous speaker said. We are not soft on drugs in the ALP. What we want to be is hard on the drug dealers. I sit on another committee, which put forward a report today. We put it forward on a very strong bipartisan basis. One of the things we said in unison was that there needs to be—indeed, the community should demand—a bipartisan approach to the issue of drugs and drug abuse in this nation. I am really disappointed at the concluding comments of the previous speaker. They were not based on fact; they were simply based on a wont of politics. Having pointed that out, I want to move on.
I want to try to bring a human side to this debate. A couple of weeks ago I went to a funeral in Perth. It was a big funeral, attended by many thousands of police officers—police officers who need the support of the National Crime Authority and who need the support of federal and state parliaments around Australia. I will read a eulogy given by Mike Dean, the Chief Executive Officer of the WA Police Union, at the funeral. Mike Dean said:
It is a difficult and humbling task to present a fitting eulogy for such a unique and special person, Donald Leslie Hancock. Don was a very special person. His death shocked and stunned us all. It was sudden and unexpected, an outrage against Don and his family and the community as a whole. I know that when I heard the news that night, I was shaken and angry. Such crimes have no place in our society. I know that Don trusted and respected the principles of law, and I know that Don was very proud of the professionalism and commitment of the people of his Criminal Investigation Branch. He would have been very proud to see the effort of his brothers and colleagues over the last nine days.
In any tribute to a man, it is important to consider what you most admired—the friendliness, the compassion and consideration for others, the earthiness, the quiet strength, the tremendous commitment and the charismatic nature of true leadership. Rare qualities. This man was a true friend and confidante to the youngest police officer, the oldest prospector, the sandalwood cutter, the horse trainer, the Queen's Counsel and the member of parliament. His intelligence, strength and character attracted people of diverse backgrounds and stature. He always had time to listen and offer a friendly word to all.
As Commander of the Criminal Investigation Branch, Don's personal ambitions were truly fulfilled. He brought an attitude that serious crime must be solved, and I know that he believed that it was his personal responsibility to the victims and to the people of Western Australia. His work ethic and dedication set a personal example to his troops.
Commander Hancock's career was noteworthy, and he participated in the investigations of some of the most infamous crimes of the day. These inquiries covered almost the full scope at every level of the criminal justice system. His friends and colleagues would be aware that his Kalgoorlie days as a police officer held very fond memories for him. 
Of the many great men and women who have served in the Western Australian Police Force, very few have achieved the level of respect and admiration from their colleagues through their careers that Commander Donald Hancock received. When I ask myself why he was held in such high esteem, I put it down to his unique qualities. He respected all people, refused to judge others and freely offered his friendship. The hundreds of men and women who worked with him are better people for the experience.
In summation of his career, I know that the greatest compliment you could give him would be to say, “Don, you were a great detective.”
...				...				...
On reflection, Don Hancock was one of the most satisfied men I have ever met. He loved and adored his wife and children. They were his strength and he was always so very proud of them. He enjoyed his country and city lifestyles and his diverse friends. Truly he achieved in his life what many others never will; he was a contented man, very happy with his lot in life.
The many challenges and trials of Don's life were accepted by Don as part of the job. Part of being a police officer. The last 11 months has certainly been a trial for him and his family. It was unjust and unfair, but no complaint ever came from Don. Commander Don Hancock, on behalf of your family and friends, I salute you. You will be missed but I will remember the good times. They were very good times.
That was a eulogy delivered by Mike Dean. Mike Dean was joined by others, including Jim King, a former copper who served with Don Hancock and others who attended that funeral that day. When I walked behind the coffin that day and looked at those many hundreds of police officers, I saw a very steely determination in their eyes, which will eventually see the perpetrators of that horrific murder—that horrific assassination— brought to trial. We in this place must reflect and share that steely determination to deal with crime and to deal with those who trade in drugs, death and misery. That is why we need to work on a bipartisan basis as much as we can in this parliament. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority has an important but often underestimated role as far as that goes. As long as we can bring to bear the human side of the police officers, who are our frontline, and those people who are caught up in drugs— the victims—we will be continually reminded of the need for us to work on that bipartisan basis. It is a good committee.
Earlier this year we unfortunately lost a person who I thought was a very good committee chairperson. He had a good feel for the committee and the work that we were doing. He also had a good understanding of the need for there to be flexibility: for there to be a hardness on the issues of crime but also a balance and accountability which are necessary in our legislation for protecting the public and protecting the crime fighters. So there is nothing soft about the ALP in its approach to crime, to those who deal in drugs and to those who engage in other sorts of crimes, whether it be people-smuggling, gunrunning or whatever. We have a very firm attitude and a very firm approach, but I would also like to think that we have a very balanced approach.
I know that the next speaker, the member for Cook, who has taken over as chair of this committee, will probably have something to say. I hope they are not of a political nature. This is important legislation. We might not have the balance right and we can probably argue about a few things, but I do not think there is a political nature to these arguments—I would hope not—and I would hope that people on both sides of this parliament would reflect the steely attitude of those police officers that I saw and other crime fighters in Western Australia.
Don Hancock was assassinated by people who need to feel the full brunt of the law. We cannot allow them to be brought before a court or investigatory body and escape by saying that they have some `reasonable excuse' for not wanting to answer questions. This legislation deals with that. I guess it could have been dealt with 12 months ago when the member for Denison brought in a private member's bill. We can argue about why it was not dealt with then—perhaps there is good reason why it was not—but the fact is that it is here today and it needs to be supported in a bipartisan way. 
There is a very serious problem in our community. The issue of drugs is a major challenge for governments—state and federal—jurisdictions, agencies, police forces and police officers, and it must be dealt with in a bipartisan way. Above all, just as we must deal with the issues of terrorism that we saw in America a couple of weeks ago, so too must we deal with the issues of terrorism which we saw perpetrated in the streets of Perth almost one month ago. Hopefully, this legislation will help to do that. I think this legislation has the true support of members of parliament from both sides. I hope that in some way it might help bring to justice the people who commit crime in our society and those who caused the death of Don Hancock. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"—I join the member for Cowan in commending the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 to the House. It is an appropriate piece of legislation. In my role as Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I regard it as a significant step forward and one which is supported by all members of that committee. The bill will ensure that law enforcement and investigative bodies are given the appropriate power to pursue those who are involved in organised crime in this country, and it will do much to improve the level of penalties that exist so that we do not have this evasion of responsibility to provide information that we have seen in the past. It is worth while and it is something which the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Gary Crooke, has been pushing for some time in various committees: I remember when I was a member of the Attorney-General's committee, he came before us and explained his position. The National Crime Authority is an organisation which evolved from debates that occurred in the 1970s about organised crime developing in the country and the need to do something about it. We had royal commissions, one under Justice Moffitt, and finally in December 1982 the National Crimes Commission was created. It soon became evident that there was a lack of an effective role for the states and territories in the new body and in 1984 the National Crime Authority Act received royal assent as well as there being corresponding legislation in all states and territories.
The NCA has been with us for 17 years now and we have reached the point where we are discussing legislation to reform the National Crime Authority and to address some of the more recent problems. It has been pointed out that a number of people under investigation by the authority have been able to frustrate or stall inspections by refusing to answer questions at NCA hearings and allowing proceedings to go to court litigation. Many prefer to accept the relatively low penalty of a $1,100 fine or may use the `reasonable excuse' defence at NCA hearings. The result of this stalling is that investigations can lose their momentum and fail. 
There is no more important task in relation to crime in this country than that those involved in organised crime should be required to provide the evidence that is necessary for the NCA to be able to uncover the networks that exist and those who are running the crime mafias in this country and to pursue them relentlessly.
We only have to see the toll of drugs in this country to recognise the damage caused by people who distribute drugs. We also see the toll in this community caused by those who are involved in money laundering and those who are involved in organising major crime. We only have to look at the illustration of the recent horrendous crimes in the United States to see the necessity for information to get to the core of those malevolent forces in our community, and this legislation will attempt to move one step closer to that.
This bill has not been without its controversy. Following its introduction into the Senate, it was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on the NCA, and a number of recommendations were made. Some of its provisions were changed by the Senate, including the planned contempt regime that would enable a court to more rapidly deal with conduct that interfered with an NCA investigation. That did not proceed, which is somewhat unfortunate. 
Apart from that, there are a number of important aspects to the bill. I will go through them seriatim. Firstly, penalties are increased. Instead of having a fine of $1,100 and six months jail for refusing to answer questions, the penalty has now being increased to five years jail and a $20,000 fine. The recommendations here are obviously significant. Five years jail is going to provide some degree of intimidation for the witnesses, and they will not so easily dismiss the requirement to answer questions.
Secondly, in relation to self-incriminatory evidence, the bill removes immunity from derivative use—that is, when a person gives evidence that is incriminating to them. In the past, this could not be used in prosecution against them. This will disallow an incriminating statement during an investigation being used against the person, but the statement will be able to be used to piece together other evidence that may verify an incrimination. This is also most important. The NCA committee has recommended that this provision be approved, subject to being reviewed after five years and reporting to parliament. I believe that is appropriate.
The third aspect of the legislation is the issue of reasonable excuse. This has been exploited by witnesses who claim they have some reasonable excuse because of their relationship to various individuals. During the hearings of the committee, the example was given of witnesses appearing before the NCA who failed to even confirm a family relationship with another person on a reasonable excuse basis that the evidence may incriminate them. That contention then had to be tested in a court, frustrating the NCA's proceedings. The removal of the reasonable excuse defence is consistent with the government's move to synchronise all types of defence under chapter 2 of the new Commonwealth Criminal Code, which comes into effect on 15 December this year. Reasonable excuse is being replaced with more clearly defined defences, such as sudden emergency or intervening event. So removing that aspect, which many of those being compelled to answer simply use to escape their responsibilities, is important.
The fourth part of the legislation is NCA accountability, which is also significant. While we recognise and applaud the role the NCA have in our community, it is important that they are accountable to the public. The legislation will submit the NCA to being a `prescribed authority' as defined in the Ombudsman Act 1976. This means that the Commonwealth Ombudsman will be able to deal with complaints by members of the public against the authority. This is a significant step forward in terms of accountability.
Fifthly, there are minor housekeeping changes. They include: the extension of the maximum term of appointment of members of the authority from four to six years, thus ensuring continuity; the inclusion of money laundering and perverting the course of justice in the definition of relevant offences that the NCA can investigate; and the third part of this minor amendment, which will make a large number changes to various acts, is to replace the word `Chairperson' with `Chair'.
In conclusion, this is a significant piece of legislation. It has the full support of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority. It moves us further in the pursuit of those involved in organised crime in this country. I am certainly aware that in my electorate crime is one of the biggest issues of concern to the community. The fact is that major figures involved in crime simply seem to elude us when they are pursued by using all the legal mechanisms and excuses available to them. This bill will cut off many of their retreats and will push them further into providing the type of evidence that we would seek. We would like to see the NCA pursuing those in this country involved in organised crime, money laundering and the distribution of drugs. It is a very important piece of legislation. I am very glad to see that it has bipartisan support within this House, and I certainly commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"—in reply—In summing up this debate, I would like to thank all members for their contribution. The National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 has received close scrutiny and the opinions expressed are indicative of the fact that the bill addresses a number of matters that are of serious concern to all members of this House. I would also like to thank those who sought personal briefings on the complex issues addressed by the bill before determining their position on it. 
The member for Denison, who was the first of the opposition speakers, was very happy to reflect that this bill picks up on Labor's private member's NCA Bill 2000 introduced by him. Indeed, both bills draw on the recommendations made by the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the NCA in its third evaluation of the National Crime Authority. The extra time spent on the government's bill involved addressing and including additional reforms sought by the NCA and consulting the states and territories. As well, the processes of this parliament included the review of the bill by the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the NCA.
Among the additional important features in this government's bill are complete removal of reasonable excuse defences and application of the Criminal Code, and provision for the NCA to employ hearing officers. We think they are very important aspects of the bill. The member for Denison, however, felt that the government had failed to take up Labor's proposition for a law enforcement oversight committee. The government does not favour the law enforcement oversight committee suggested by the member for Denison. The government considers that the focus on the NCA by the existing parliamentary joint committee has been appropriate and a proper reflection of the special function and powers of the authority. The responsibilities and jurisdiction of agencies like the Defence Force, the quarantine service and the Federal Police are too diverse to be sensibly brought within the purview of a single committee. We think its focus would have been lost.
The honourable member for Cowan spoke of attending a funeral just two weeks ago in Perth for Donald Hancock, a Western Australian police officer who, as we all know, died under very sad circumstances; indeed, to use the word `assassination' would not be inappropriate. I thank the member for Cowan for referring to the very difficult task we place in the hands of police. It is important that we acknowledge that. The death of a police officer in the course of duty is a very tragic event and reminds us of the commitment and sacrifice that the community receives from its law enforcement officers. I endorse the comments of the member for Cowan. These strategies underline the importance of giving appropriate tools, in particular legal tools, to law enforcement and the NCA.
The bill is an important measure to enhance the effectiveness of the National Crime Authority in fighting organised crime. In particular, it will create a significant deterrent to those who seek to obstruct and frustrate the authority's hearing process. At the same time, the bill contains important accountability measures, notably a role for the Ombudsman and clearer reporting requirements to the parliamentary joint committee on the authority. The continuing support for the activities of the NCA from Commonwealth, state and territory governments reflects the important role played by the authority. There is no doubt, however, that the problems caused by serious and organised crime in its operations across jurisdictional boundaries continue to pervade all levels of society. This reinforces the need for a national law enforcement agency such as the National Crime Authority. 
It is essential that the authority has sufficient powers to enable it to performance its functions without being hindered or hampered by those whose very conduct the authority is trying to investigate. It is also essential that the authority is able to operate in an environment that enables the greatest possible flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that the authority remains accountable and responsive. I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that this bill proposes amendments to the A New Tax System Act 1999 and calls on the Government to take this opportunity to include further improvements in the legislation that would:
(1)	remove the GST from the price of women's sanitary products;
(2)	remove the GST from funeral expenses;
(3)	remove the GST from fees paid by long-term caravan park and boarding house residents;
(4)	compensate charities for the extra burden imposed by the GST; and
(5)	simplify the GST for small businesses”.
I want to spend a bit of time talking about that part of my amendment which goes to removing the GST from funeral expenses. Recently, the Labor Party received a submission from the Australian Funeral Directors Association which indicated, amongst other things, that in their role as the industry's peak body they had recently conducted a 12 months review of the GST regime in order to assess its impact on their members and clients. Based on this review, the association submitted that the GST has had a detrimental impact on funeral directors and their clients, and therefore sought the removal of the GST on funerals and related services on a number of grounds. Their submission noted that the GST was introduced on 1 July 2000 with certain transitional provisions concerning the funeral industry which were effective from 1 December 1999.
Since the introduction of the GST, the association, their members and allied industries have fielded numerous concerns and complaints from their respective clients regarding the impact of the GST. The common theme of this feedback is that the GST is perceived by consumers to be akin to the reintroduction of a death duty. It is said that in life nothing is certain but death and taxes; in the case of the GST, this government has managed to ensure that death goes with taxes. The association says it is clear from their review that Australian people resent the fact that someone who has worked hard and paid taxes throughout their life is also taxed upon their death via the GST imposed on funerals and related services.
The Australian people perceive that the GST unfairly taxes the aged when they are the population demographic least able to afford the additional tax. The paper included some statistics concerning older people's income and life expectancy which indicate why the community would be reasonably entitled to hold those views. Essentially, people see GST on funerals and related services as the ultimate insult. As has been widely commented on in the media, the small business sector has been particularly hurt by GST compliance costs and the time consuming and cumbersome business activity statement system. Like other industries that are predominantly small business, family owned and operated, the Australian funeral industry has been very much affected by these issues. In addition, due to the general resentment of GST in the community, consumer anxiety and anger are being expressed to the funeral provider. This often places funeral directors and association members in the very difficult situation of explaining the workings of the GST to elderly and anxious consumers who are already experiencing difficulties in coping with the loss of a loved one. The association's submission points out that, human nature being what it is, the explanation generally comes down to a broad statement to the effect that you can blame it on the government. 
The 12-month review also indicates that for many families, and particularly the elderly, funerals and related services are an unbudgeted and high-ticket purchase relative to most products and services affected by the GST, and the additional costs brought about by the GST have caused many to rationalise the choice of products and services they would normally consider in order to honour and memorialise their loved ones. As they say in their submission, it is tragic that something as sacred as a funeral ritual, which after all is the oldest of humanity's rituals, is being impinged upon in this way by government policy.
A Beazley Labor government will abolish the GST on funerals. Services provided by funeral directors which go towards a funeral service will be made GST free. This includes, for example, the funeral notice, venue hiring, securing a grave or memorial plaque, the celebrant, coffins, wreaths and floral tributes. Labor will also refund the GST already paid on prepaid funerals where the service has not been delivered by the time the GST is removed from funerals. This is another instalment of Labor's plan to take the GST off some essential goods and services to ease the pressure on Australian families. Imposing a GST on funeral expenses is an unfair burden on Australian families, especially the elderly. It is the equivalent of a death tax. It is a terrible time in any family when someone loses a life partner, and it is particularly tough on older Australians, and the last thing they need is to be slugged with a tax on top of that. People bear it in the same way in which they have to bear their grief, but it is a burden that they should not have to bear. Under a Labor government they will not have to bear that burden. Labor will get rid of John Howard's death tax.
The unfairness of imposing a GST on funerals is raised regularly with Labor members by older Australians, their families and the people who provide a funeral service. It is worth pointing out that before the GST was introduced the service component of funerals was untaxed and specific items such as coffins and wreaths were wholesale sales tax exempt. Now, almost all funeral costs are subject to the GST, which has forced significant price rises. Making funeral services GST free will allow funeral directors to lower the funeral expenses faced by families in their hour of need and it will lower their administrative burden without complicating it for anyone else. It is further evidence of Labor's belief that the GST can be made fairer and simpler. Labor will work closely with Australian funeral directors and other interested parties to settle the fine detail of this important measure to ensure that it delivers maximum simplicity and fairness. I call on members on the other side to support the idea of removing the GST from funerals.
Taking the GST off funerals is just one way that Labor will deliver a GST tax cut for families. It is one of a number of reforms that we have already announced in which we will remove the burden of John Howard's unfair GST from Australians whom it hits hardest. We will make it fairer by taking it off funeral services; we will make the GST fairer by taking it off caravan park site fees, an issue on which my colleague the member for Grayndler has campaigned vigorously. Labor will make the GST fairer by taking it off women's sanitary items, and Labor will make the GST fairer by compensating charities for the cost of the GST when they help the poorest Australians. Like our other plans to remove the GST from some of life's essentials, making funerals GST free is permanent. Once it is taken off, it will not be put back and it will not be eroded by inflation. We can make the GST fairer and simpler, but only Labor is prepared to do it.
I also refer to that item of my amendment which talks about compensating charities for the extra burden imposed by the GST. This is another issue which my colleague the member for Grayndler is very familiar with and interested in. For example, he recently highlighted the report released by the Salvation Army, Stepping into the breach, which points out that the burden faced by charities has been increased—exacerbated—by the Howard government's breaching regime and the unfair GST. The Howard government's breaching policies have seen a 189 per cent increase in unemployed people being fined. Those people have to live somehow, so they then go to charities such as the Salvation Army for help, but they find that these organisations have less available in the way of emergency funds on account of the impact of the GST. The Salvos have suggested that the Howard government is trying to cost shift. That is exactly right; they have hit the nail on the head. The report, Stepping into the breach, reveals that more than 50 per cent of people now seeking emergency relief from the Salvos do so because of the government's breaching policies. However, you then have the GST clawing back a total of $15 million every year from emergency relief agencies like the Salvos, and that clawback of funding means that 900 agencies like Anglicare, St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army have less to give to the growing number of people who are struggling to survive. 
Kim Beazley indicated in his budget reply earlier this year that we are committed to relieving the pressure on charities arising as a result of the GST. Labor will provide an additional $45 million of emergency relief funding over three years, a 57 per cent increase, to return the amount of GST lost as a result of the government's GST slug on front-line charitable activities. This payment will be funded by limiting the tax deduction for political donations to just $100 instead of the Howard government's policy of a $1,500 limit on such tax deductions. This achieves two worthwhile purposes, the first of which is helping the charities and ensuring that their funds for emergency relief are not impacted on by GST. Secondly, it keeps Australia's political processes clean in that it does not allow people to influence the policies of political parties via tax deductible donations. The Prime Minister has been heard to say that there is no finer organisation than the Salvation Army. That kind of observation would have more credibility if the Salvation Army was not battling under the impost of GST, the government's breaching policies and the like.
The issue of the impact of the GST on charities is one of the terms of reference of Labor's inquiry into the business activity statement, which I have had the honour of chairing. An area of particular concern to our business activity statement committee has been to hear of the impact of the GST and business activity statement compliance obligations on not-for-profit or community groups. It is particularly ironic that, in the International Year of Volunteers, we learned that the task of attracting and retaining volunteers has become more difficult than ever as a result of the GST workload burden. Office bearers are proving harder to come by. Labor's candidate for the electorate of La Trobe, Phil Staindl, pointed out to me that the tax office had sent to the treasurers of community organisations a guide to dealing with the GST which was in the form of three volumes and hundreds of pages. If you are a volunteer treasurer, things like that can often be the last straw.
—I know members opposite do not care about voluntary organisations. They simply treat the work of voluntary organisations with contempt. They have done a great deal to damage voluntary organisations with their GST and business activity statement workloads.
Similar problems were reported to our inquiry by community organisations in Perth, including by a local community radio station. We saw the intricacies of calculating GST input credits and whether GST was payable on cups of tea and coffee provided to staff as opposed to visitors. This led the elderly volunteers at the Bundaberg and District Historical Society to give up selling tea, coffee and biscuits to visitors to that historical centre. The value of work of volunteers in organisations like that is inestimable. They are essential to the health of our cultural life, and it is simply not good enough for the business activity statement and GST to carve a swathe through these important activities. When the inquiry visited Lismore in the federal electorate of Page, we heard from Miss Hazel Bridget, the past president of Northern Rivers Legacy, of the problem of GST on payments made by Legacy to widows. This is exactly the sort of problem that Kim Beazley's budget reply announcement would address as it would involve compensation for charitable payments made in these circumstances. That is one of the things that a Labor government would do to make the GST simpler and fairer. 
Regrettably, we have a government which is out of touch with ordinary Australians, has no idea how much ordinary people are hurting and how the GST has made families worse off and is not listening to ordinary Australians. In particular, its treatment of older Australians and low income earners indicates just how out of touch the government is. It is happy looking after the better off, while ordinary Australians are doing it tough. Those Queensland Liberals who indicated that this was a government which was mean and tricky are absolutely right. The GST wiped out most of the families' promised tax cuts; pensioners had their GST compensation clawed back; and, while the GST has been making it ever harder to make ends meet, the Prime Minister has broken that promise that no-one would be worse off under the GST. We see millions of Australians now under more financial pressure with the GST increasing the cost of living, hurting small business, costing jobs and putting millions of Australian families under financial pressure.
There was some talk earlier this year of tax cuts from this government. The Prime Minister ought to have been laughed out of town. Just like the last tax cuts, any tax cuts that John Howard promises will be taken away by the GST and increased costs of living. We were never, ever going to have a GST. Nobody was going to be worse off. Now he says that the rate is not going to go up beyond 10 per cent. Frankly, that is about as credible as his previous promises. You will find tax cuts for the rich being paid for by ordinary Australians with an increase in the GST.
Having made those remarks in relation to my amendment, I want to turn to a discussion of the specific provisions of the legislation. The first item I want to refer to is the income tax exemption for local government businesses. Schedule 2 to this bill amends the income tax legislation to extend income tax exemption to businesses that are owned or controlled at the local government level. That measure was announced in the Treasurer's press release of 19 June 2000, and the amendments apply to income derived after 30 June 2000. The exemption is unlikely to involve any loss of Commonwealth revenue, because municipal corporations and local governing bodies are currently exempt under section 50-25 of the Income Tax Act 1997. The amendment is designed to assist local government bodies which seek to restructure their activities in order to improve their business efficiency. This amendment simply treats local government in the same way that state governments are treated, and it is supported by Labor.
The second item I want to refer to concerns superannuation fund residence requirements. Schedule 3 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 by amending the definition of `resident superannuation fund' and also by replacing the definition of `active member' with new definitions of `active member' and `non-active member' respectively. The amendments will allow a fund, in particular a self-managed superannuation fund, to retain its residency status while the trustees and/or members of the fund are temporarily overseas, so long as certain conditions are met. That measure was announced in the Assistant Treasurer's press release of 4 October 2000. It adds some clarity to the law in this area. It is a sensible reform that will benefit self-managed funds, we would expect, and it is therefore supported by Labor.
I mention in passing that the Howard government has a very poor record on self-managed funds and, indeed, on small business generally. It introduced a range of changes to what were known as do-it-yourself superannuation funds but are now referred to as self-managed superannuation funds, involving transfer of regulation from APRA to the tax office, and a new definition of self-managed superannuation funds whereby they must have fewer than five members where all the members are trustees and there are no other trustees. Labor had to amend some of the requirements here so that employees could not be members of a self-managed fund unless they are related to the employer sponsor. They also tightened the investment rules on all superannuation funds, to restrict holdings in certain asset classes to no more than five per cent; however, funds may be able to purchase up to 100 per cent of real business assets. Funds not complying had until 30 June 2001 to comply with the new investment rules. Changes to the investment rules for self-managed superannuation funds cost these funds thousands of dollars to unwind current investment arrangements in a short time. It was another significant cost in time and money—and, once again, this from a government that had promised to reduce red tape for small business. 
The next area of the bill I want to talk about is schedule 4 and the issue of tax relief for shareholders in listed investment companies. Schedule 4 provides shareholders in listed investment companies with the benefit of capital gains tax discount on the eligible gain component of a dividend paid to shareholders. That measure was announced in the federal budget this year. Broad details of the concession can be found in the Treasurer's press release of 22 May this year. The measure contained here provides taxpayers with greater access to the benefits of the capital gains tax discount. It has support from industry. We would expect that the net benefit of this change is the diversification of investment available for Australians choosing to invest. It will result in a cost to revenue of an estimated $20 million, except for this first year, for which I understand the estimate is around $5 million. I did receive some letters concerning taxation treatment of capital gains made by investment companies, as distinct from other forms of collective investments, such as public unit trusts. There have been discussions about the effect of this policy on the share prices of listed investment companies; and various organisations, such as the Australian Foundation Investment Corporation, have been making submissions to government concerning these issues. The amendments in the bill are regarded by us as appropriate, and we accept them.
I also want to refer to the part of the bill that goes to petroleum resources rent tax. The petroleum resources rent tax imposes a secondary income tax on the profits of oil producers. It is aimed at taxing the economic rent—that is, the profits above the level of profit needed to actually undertake the project—associated with petroleum products production. This was first introduced by Labor back in 1983-84. This kind of legislation is an economically efficient method of ensuring that the Australian people gain a fair share of the value of Australian petroleum production, without interfering in the incentives for efficient exploitation of the resource. The bill purports to remove the uncertainty surrounding the determination of a price for gas produced in integrated gas-to-liquid projects. There are not any projects of this kind operating at the moment, but it is suggested that some certainty is needed and is important in a potentially critical area for development of the industry. The act is being amended to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the determination of a price for gas produced in such integrated projects. The amendments provide for a new methodology to determine the price of gas where there is no comparable uncontrolled price and there is not a sale at the taxing point, or where there is a sale at the taxing point but the sale is not at arms-length.
What has been said to the parliament with regard to this bill is that the new methodology will be incorporated in regulations. Unfortunately, the bill only provides the framework for determining the rules concerning the pricing of gas for petroleum resources rent tax purposes. The actual rules are to be made by regulation. The industry, which is supportive of ending the uncertainty—for obvious reasons—is pretty nervous about what will be in the regulations and is anxious for the draft regulations to be made public prior to passage of the legislation, with some reasonable period to allow for informed comment from the stakeholders. Labor thinks that is a quite reasonable position. Accordingly, Labor will not be opposing these provisions in the House. But we do call on the government to release draft regulations as soon as possible so that stakeholders, including the Senate, can consider the bill properly when it gets there. I understand that the industry supports the other measures in the bill.
There is also a part 2 of schedule 1 to the bill, which amends the petroleum resource rent tax legislation to modify the operation of what is known as the five-year rule. Broadly, the five-year rule applies to classifying expenditures for the purpose of calculating petroleum resource rent tax liability. The amendments change the date used for classifying these expenditures, from the day the production licence is issued to the day the government has received sufficient information to determine the successful production licence application. This is something that will result in a small but unquantifiable cost to revenue. 
The legislation also makes some changes to issues to do with personal services income. I do not have time to go right through the amendments that are made here, but I have to say that the government's latest backflip on the alienation of personal services income suggests, once again, that we have an extremely incompetent Treasurer. This is a government that has messed up tax reform and it has messed up alienation of personal services income. We support moves to protect genuine contractors and the self-employed while, at the same time, meeting the original purpose of the legislation to crack down on sham contractors and not erode the revenue base. It is extraordinary that the Treasurer and Prime Minister claimed that they were going to look after genuine contractors; their handling of this issue resulted in a set of complex arrangements that hurt genuine businesses and tied them up in a new mountain of red tape.
I would just make the observation in passing that what the government has done is move the situation much more in the direction of self-assessment. Those of us who follow the tax legislation a little will know that there is an ongoing issue in relation to mass marketed tax schemes, in which self-assessment is at the heart of a lot of grief on the part of those who have engaged in self-assessment only to have the tax office come back several years later and say, `No, you're wrong. We're not going to allow these deductions and we're going to hit you with penalties and interest.' I say to some of those who are engaged in personal services income that self-assessment does not necessarily resolve a lot of the problems in this area. It may simply be a matter of the government seeking to postpone this problem and get it away until after the election, and it can be a problem for people in years to come.
The other area of the legislation that I want to refer to is the HIH rescue package. Schedule 5 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that the income tax consequences of payments under the HIH rescue package are the same as if those payments had been made directly by HIH and exempts the HIH trust from income tax. The government's handling of the HIH collapse was absolutely appalling. It is a matter I have referred to in the parliament frequently. We have had eerie reminders of this in the last week in the shape of the Ansett collapse—an almost identical fact situation in a number of respects: the government ministers are alerted to a developing crisis, a developing catastrophe, and they sit on their hands during, in the case of the HIH collapse, the largest financial collapse in Australian history, and in the case of Ansett, I expect, the largest industrial collapse in Australian history. On this government's watch we have seen failures—HIH, One.Tel and Ansett—this year on a scale we have never seen before in the life of this country. The government's handling of these matters has been appalling. For those who think that this government has been a good economic manager, you ought to ask a policyholder at HIH, a worker at Ansett or a customer at One.Tel just what they think.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"— Last year Paul Kelly wrote in the Australian:
The strategic issue is whether Labor has spent too long deluding itself about the GST as a political saviour not only to find it miscalculated but to confront a deeper issue—that it has not sufficiently addressed its own policy direction. This is the decisive question and Hobart should offer some answers. 
Tonight's debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 indicates that the Labor Party has not learned or done anything within that 12-month period. The previous speaker, the opposition spokesman on financial matters, Mr Kelvin Thomson, has moved an amendment to this legislation that outlines the changes, the so-called `roll-back provisions', that the Australian Labor Party wants to put into the goods and services tax.
Just looking down the five or six points made by the previous speaker, one would have to say that the changes are so loose, so poorly defined and so ill informed that they will create huge turmoil and definitional problems should they ever be introduced. All of those small businesses that the Australian Labor Party have suddenly found they want to represent would be thrown into chaos as they tried to readjust their databases, as they tried to rewrite their MYOB and Quicken software packages to take into account all the changes that the Australian Labor Party want to make to the goods and services tax. It would throw the whole industry, the whole record keeping process of small businesses, into absolute confusion.
What the Labor Party have failed to understand is that what they consider to be a simplification, a change or a roll-back— whatever you want to call it—is a change that creates difficulty of definition and uncertainty as to whether goods are in or out of the goods and services tax. Some of the problems created by the Australian Democrats in the definition of what food was— whether it was fresh or not fresh, whether it was ready to eat or was not ready to eat— when the goods and services tax was introduced are very obvious when one goes to the supermarket or goes shopping. All the chaos, the difficulty and the problems of management which were created for retail grocers and small shopkeepers are going to be multiplied many times over should the Australian Labor Party ever be given the opportunity to implement some of these proposed changes in what they call a simplification or a roll-back. They will find some nice soft words for it, but what it means is continuing change to the goods and services tax—something that not one single small business in Australia wants. Small businesses want to get on and accept things as they are, and not have changes, adjustments and modifications that will create further complexity, difficulty and additional cost for them.
The Australian Labor Party, in developing these policies, have to demonstrate that they have moved ahead of where they claim they stand on the goods and services tax and that they will not plunge Australia into debt. The Labor Party claim that a reduction in the goods and services tax will not create a problem for the budget. They claim that they are going to collect less tax but they are not going to raise any more debt. They claim that they are going to create a roll-back and lessen the amount of money that they take in, but they are not going to put Australia into debt and that they will, in fact, increase the surplus. So we have a confusion of ideas about how they can actually reduce the amount of money that the government takes in taxation but not have a deficit—in fact, they claim they will have a larger surplus. The Labor Party claim they are not going to put Australia into debt—as one would think would happen if they collect less tax. They claim they are going to collect less tax but have a larger surplus. The sums do not add up. 
The Australian people saw those sorts of calculations when the Australian Labor Party were previously in government, and they were not at all persuaded that the clever words of people like Paul Keating were an adequate explanation for the huge debt that Australia racked up—a debt of $90 billion, two-thirds of which is now thankfully paid back. I realise that the people of Australia are not too worried about debt provided it is under control, but to quickly move to such a huge debt, as the Australian Labor Party did, and to allocate so much taxation to repaying the interest charges and repayments of that $90 billion debt did worry people. It worried them greatly, and it was one of the reasons that the Australian Labor Party were voted out. This government has brought the debt under control and is managing the debt. It has reduced the debt by two-thirds. That is the sort of management that gives confidence to the Australian people. The Australian people want to see a government which, if in debt, has a plan to manage that debt. We are managing that debt. Within the short period of five years, we have brought the budget deficit under control, we are running surpluses and we have been able to pay off the Australian Labor Party's debt. 
When one looks at the proposed amendments to the legislation that we are dealing with tonight, one can only be amazed that the Australian Labor Party have learned so little in the past 12 months. The Hobart conference of the Australian Labor Party demonstrated that they had no wish to cope with what they thought was the main issue and they found no reason to move on. There has been a continuing commitment to domination of the Australian Labor Party by the trade union movement. The Labor Party are the captive of the union movement. Even though only 25 per cent of our community are members of the union movement, 60 per cent of the delegates at the Labor Party conference have to be members of the union movement. The Labor Party must have a biased and prejudiced outlook of Australia if two-thirds of the delegates to the Australian Labor Party annual conference have to be drawn from the union movement. What a very limited and very precious approach that offers of Australian society. I am really bitterly disappointed that there has not been a better approach to the true needs of Australia and the true needs of Australian families.
This legislation moves ahead and makes some significant changes. Briefly, the changes are: amendment to the income tax law to provide shareholders in listed investment companies with the benefits of the capital gains tax discount on certain capital gains made by those companies—a further modification of the capital gains tax, which was introduced by the Australian Labor Party; a change to remove the tax distortion on indirect investment choices for investment and to allow shareholders the benefit of the GST discount; and, following the Ralph review, there are provisions to deal with the alienation of personal services income—that obnoxious area about which Simon Crean said, `We will do better; we will change that.' The Labor Party will not stand for the definitions of small business, private operators, contractors and subcontractors offered by this government. Instead, Simon Crean said that they would go harder, they would make it tougher. There is $700 million that he wants to get, and he will go after it to make it tougher for the subcontractors, the battlers and the hard workers who keep Australian industry moving. Then, of course, we have the process of self-assessment, and the scorn that has been poured on this process by the Australian Labor Party and the shadow Treasurer in particular.
In this legislation there are also provisions associated with the financial collapse of HIH. The proposal is to establish a scheme to assist certain qualified individuals and small businesses who experience financial hardship as a direct result of the collapse—to assist those in need. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 contains measures to ensure that there are no unintended income tax or GST consequences arising from transactions occurring as a result of an HIH rescue package—again, a thoughtful consideration. It is a tragedy that this should occur. It is a tragedy that it was not spotted, that the views held in the industry that HIH—and FIA before that—was a problem were not noted and not acted on. That process is going to be dealt with by the royal commission, which has just commenced its hearings. However, this government is moving to change tax law tonight to make sure that there are no unintended consequences for small businesses or individuals suffering direct financial hardship as a result of the collapse. There is also a provision to remove the uncertainty surrounding the price of gas produced in integrated gas to liquid projects. This is an amendment which will continue the government's role of conservation of fuel and of giving better flexibility in the choice of fuel types.
Finally, in schedule 3 of the bill there is an amendment to the residency rules for superannuation funds. It will allow funds—in particular, self-managed superannuation fun-ds—to retain their residency status while their trustees are temporarily overseas for up to two years. That is a typical situation when a person with a superannuation fund is called to employment overseas or when they go on an extended holiday but wish to retain their superannuation. It is not a process that I see in any way avoiding an Australian's responsibility to pay tax, prepare for their retirement or make a contribution to our society. It is nothing like the situation we saw under the Australian Labor Party, when people gained access to benefits and were able to leave Australia and live on Australian benefits for protracted periods. This government has sought to change that, to modify that process, and it is fair. There are now bilateral agreements with various countries from which people come as migrants so that we can make sure that the exchange of benefit is fair to all concerned. This provision is not in those terms; it relates purely to those people who fund their own superannuation and who have built up an asset over a period of time so that they may be free of government contribution on their retirement. 
I want to look at, in particular, the alienation of personal income services. This legislation provides for people in certain categories who have had difficulty fitting within the Australian Taxation Office's definitions. Over a period of time, a person has had to make their own judgment about whether they are self-employed or whether they work for somebody else. This has created a difficult situation. The people in the electorate of Mitchell and I admire the skill and energy of people who are self-employed. It is a goal of many of the young people in our district to gain self-employment. They are not interested in working for somebody else but want to establish the freedom and opportunities that self-employment gives. The definition of self-employed has been a test for the Australian Taxation Office and is a factor in industrial relations laws. The Taxation Office and the Treasurer felt that it was necessary to find a definition, instead of leaving it to people to declare themselves self-employed. Attempts have been made and, gradually, having listened to the needs of the Australian community, this government has moved close to what I believe is a fair assessment as to who is self-employed.
The legislation contains provisions to deal with the alienation of personal services income. It is directed at people who earn income as individuals but who claim to be self-employed so as to avoid paying income tax at individual rates. This applies to people who may work for set hours, are paid at an hourly rate, have their superannuation paid and have some holiday paid, but are declared by their employer to be contractors. BHP at one stage this year declared 1,200 of its employees to be self-employed and asked them to create companies or independent corporations so that they could be declared self-employed. That may be an accurate description of their work; it may be a process that is of greater advantage to BHP than to the people involved. One of the key factors that has driven this process over the last five or six years has been the onerous imposition of the unfair dismissal proposals, first introduced by Laurie Brereton and the Labor Party. Companies did not want to continue with permanent employment for their staff if they could avoid it, so they required them to become self-employed by establishing a company, or they declared them to be contractors. The costs and the risk attached to the termination of an employee are so great that many small businesses have not employed the staff that they would have employed. Small business organisations have estimated that the number of people who could be employed but who are not employed, simply because of the impact of the redundancy requirements of unfair dismissal, could be as many as 50,000. 
The on-costs of employment are also factors that have encouraged employers to change their view on who is employed and who is self-employed. The government has moved to clarify that. Whilst in my opinion it is not yet quite where it could be, it is a very reasonable approach to what has been a vexed question. In particular, the areas of concern to the government were independent contractors in the building industry and those who were providers of services, particularly financial advice services. Another area that needed attention was the courier owner drivers. The commissioner has confirmed that the standard industry contract meets the independent contractor test for the courier owner drivers. In the construction industry, all taxpayers who are part of the prescribed payments system are subject to transitional arrangements, and then after that they are declared to be open for the self-assessment process that previously applied to them. The rules for financial advisers have also been changed so that those who give financial advice who, at first blush, appear to earn all their income from a particular finance company or insurer are in fact regarded as self-employed. They are in fact working for clients, delivering to clients the best financial advice that they can put together. They are truly independent, self-employed businesspeople. 
This is an interesting piece of legislation. It brings to mind the capital gains tax introduced by the Australian Labor Party and the denials by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating that that would ever happen. It is interesting to read the transcripts of this parliament as, day after day, they denied that the capital gains tax would be introduced and then, lo and behold, with one meeting it came into the parliament and, for the first time, Australia had a capital gains tax. Those two said that it would not produce much revenue at all; in fact it is producing massive revenue and is a real detriment to the life and energy of Australia. But this government has gradually reduced it, and I am pleased to support the legislation.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001. While I support the legislation before the House, I also support the second reading amendment by the shadow Assistant Treasurer to allow a general taxation debate on the GST and other taxation issues. I also specifically support his amendments to this legislation to remove the GST from long-term residents of caravan parks and boarding houses, women's sanitary products and funeral expenses. I notice that the member for Mitchell was complaining about the Democrats making the GST more confusing. The Democrats supported our condemnation of the Howard government's attempt to impose a GST on food. Does this mean that the member for Mitchell wants to extend the GST to food after the next election if the government is returned?
This legislation is urgently required to repair the way the alienation of personal services provisions applies to certain agents. This legislation will allow taxpayers earning personal services income to use the results test to self-assess whether they are independent contractors or employees. The need for these changes after the introduction of the alienation of personal services income rules is another example of the government's mismanagement of tax reform. When the GST was introduced, the government did so by legislating a framework, a skeleton, which it then handed over to the Australian Taxation Office to fill in the detail. This indolent government lay back waiting for the millions of dollars from the new tax to roll in. The tax office, endeavouring to maximise the tax take, set about applying the GST to every form of taxable life in this country. Since July of last year, the sound of protesting taxpayers, especially businesses and contractors, became so loud and persistent that even this arrogant government could no longer ignore their protests. With this legislation, it is obvious that the government has finally woken up to the electoral consequences of ignoring these concerns.
First, the business activity statement reporting requirements were substantially revised by the tax office. This was followed by the justified complaints of approximately one million independent contractors, angry because they were threatened with PAYE taxation rates through the alienation of their personal services income. Again, the government took an eternity to intervene in the formulation of the tax office rulings. This government, which prides itself on the introduction of the GST, lazily left the detail and the implementation of the GST to the bureaucrats and, as usual with this government, the devil was in the detail. A crusading tax office, armed with a new weapon with which to bludgeon Australian taxpayers, then assaulted the taxpayers of Australia. The government's response was simply to forsake Australian taxpayers to the new tax.
Now we have before us tonight another backflip on the GST, the so-called `perfect tax'. The way the government has failed to pay proper attention to the detail from its own changes is shameful. The introduction of anything new, taxes or otherwise, requires extra attention and concentration, not indolence, to ensure that the implementation can be as smooth as possible and that there are no unintended consequences. That is a key responsibility of any government, but it is one this government has failed to properly manage. It still has not fulfilled its responsibility. Individuals, estimated to number in excess of 160,000, who earn personal services income in the information technology industry are just one example of the business activity that remains exposed to the anomaly the government is trying to attend to in part of this legislation. 
However, one area that seems beyond this government is tax avoidance. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the tax office had been in pursuit of numerous members of the legal profession for either avoiding tax or, despicably, paying little or no tax at all. The tax office seemed to be hopelessly unsuccessful until February this year, when the Sydney Morning Herald began a series of articles which included `tax office research' to the effect that some 20 per cent of the legal profession was involved in tax rorts of one kind or another. This figure was 10 times more than for the rest of Australian taxpayers. In March 2001, the Australian Tax Office announced that, as part of its investigation into tax avoidance, approximately $8.5 billion in taxes was still owed by Australians. Lawyers, accountants and company directors led the way in comprehensive tax avoidance.
Paul Barry in the Sydney Morning Herald, in a report published on Monday, 26 February 2001 under the heading `Bankrupt in Paddo: barrister's $3m unpaid taxes', identifies an example of the disgraceful tax avoidance the government is continuing to ignore. He reports that Sydney barrister Stephen Archer is a specialist in bankruptcy law and at the same time a serial bankrupt. Mr Archer's conduct is a monumental triumph for hypocrisy and double standards. This morally bankrupt parasite and his corrupt wife participated in the worst type of complicity visited on the long-suffering taxpayer. Incredibly, this bludger is still allowed to practise and is still at large; and he and his wife continue to live a life of luxury. Ordinary taxpayers, those not earning six- or seven-figure incomes, are outraged at the Howard government letting this go unchallenged.
How incredible it is that, in a period of large scale corporate collapses—totalling $11 billion when only adding up the HIH, One.Tel, Pasminco and Ansett catastrophes—those corrupt professionals so heavily involved in dishonest tax avoidance schemes should be those same professionals the community looks up to to uphold good corporate governance! These are the people to whom shareholders, increasingly coming from the PAYE population, entrust their retirement savings, either directly or through their superannuation schemes. At the same time the government is encouraging investment in shares as a means by which average wage and salary earners can supplement their savings plans and retirement futures. But we find that many of these investments made in good faith by PAYE investors are being managed by sharks and tax avoidance specialists who ignore the rules of corporate governance and also break the law.
How has this been allowed to happen? We have ordinary citizens so clearly being ripped off by failed corporate managers and tax cheats. These criminals and their slippery legal and accounting advisers escape justice through liquidation and bankruptcy, as exposed graphically by Paul Barry. But where does the PAYE investor find any relief when their savings and retirement funds disappear before their very eyes? Certainly not from the Howard government. The answer from this government is to sing the praises of the market while crying crocodile tears over so-called isolated failures of the market that have brought calamity and insecurity to small shareholders and people whose superannuation has been slaughtered by these corporate failures. This can never be good enough.
While tax avoidance flourishes in Australia amongst those most directly charged with the responsibility for corporate governance, taxpayers are entitled to doubt the credibility of the regulators, who only seem to watch the cheats get away with it. Overwhelmingly, PAYE citizens only have their labour to sell to secure their retirement incomes, either by way of savings or superannuation or both. When these savings and superannuation funds are lost to the corporate cowboys, these citizens are faced with the real and immediate threat of a crash in their living standards to poverty levels and even with the prospect of losing their homes. 
People in my electorate of Lowe have had enough of the tired and arrogant responses from the government and regulators. The government and regulators must become activists and interventionists in the name of good corporate governance, in order to protect the integrity of the savings and retirement plans of ordinary PAYE Australians. Nothing less is good enough. The government must do all it can to ensure good corporate conduct. The government has not really been interested. Before coming to office, the coalition was loud in proclaiming its intention to wage war on the tax avoidance industry. The government also was loud in defence of the GST, saying that it would wipe out the cash economy. The coalition was very quick to give up on both tax avoidance and the cash economy. It took a rigorous investigative journalist like Paul Barry to bring the issue of tax avoidance by members of the legal profession to public notice. Incredibly, the response from the government was not a crackdown on the legal profession but a directive—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have listened for some time to the member for Lowe, and he is really making the whole of his speech on tax avoidance, which we all know went on for years under the previous government—
 (Mr Nehl)— What is your point of order?
—The question is that the bill is about personal services income, listed investment companies and the HIH rescue package. It does not deal with the whole tax avoidance regime that the member is talking about.
—I thank the honourable member for Cook. The member for Lowe will of course direct his remarks to the contents of the bill. I know he sometimes finds that difficult, but tonight would be a good time to start.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, with great respect, there have been amendments which you might not be aware of but which were moved in this House, before you arrived here, by the shadow Assistant Treasurer; and the member for Cook was not in the chamber when they were moved. They allow a general discussion. I thought he would welcome, being a senior member of the government, my bringing these issues before the parliament and would not deny me this opportunity, because they are relevant to the amendments before the House.
Incredibly, the response from the government was not a crackdown on the legal profession but a directive that lawyers who have been made bankrupt would not be allowed admission to any work made available by the government. It did not even bother to order that the tax office audit all lawyers to ensure that each one has an ABN number. The modus operandi of these tax cheating lawyers is to have themselves declared bankrupt and therefore avoid all their financial obligations to the tax office. The ABS recently found that the average annual earnings for a legal counsel with 10 years experience were just under $228,000. At the top rate of taxation, 48.5 per cent, that would mean, without concessions or deductions, a tax payment of approximately $110,000. Based on a working life of 30 years, that income equates to over $3 million owed to the tax commissioner. This is not an insignificant sum, and ordinary payee taxpayers are entitled to know why these lawyers—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a further point of order. I have now had the opportunity to see the amendments that the member for Lowe has referred to. I cannot see on any of them the question of tax avoidance. So the question of tax avoidance, which has occupied the member for Lowe for the past 12 minutes, is not in the provisions of the bill and it is not in the amendments proposed by the opposition. I would ask that you rule him out of order. 
—I thank the honourable member for Cook. In response to his point of order, I cannot really rule the member's speech out of order. But the member for Lowe, in his intervention following the original point of order, did suggest that the chair was not aware that amendments had been moved. The chair was aware, but was not aware of the great detail. I have now seen the amendments, I have read them in detail and I would certainly uphold the member for Cook's point of order. I would suggest, member for Lowe, that you speak to the bill.
—I believe I am speaking to the bill, and I think the member for Cook, like you and everyone else in this House tonight, Mr Deputy Speaker, should be concerned about tax avoidance. We are looking at the revenue that is derived from all sources, and the government has introduced a GST that hits home at those people who can least afford to pay the taxation. It savagely affects those who earn the least amount of income because it is a regressive flat tax. The very wealthy—the privileged people I am talking about like barristers and lawyers—pay very little or no tax. That has been detailed by Paul Barry in the Sydney Morning Herald.
—They may be friends of the member for Cook.
—I do not know whether the member for Cook is trying to protect the barristers and lawyers who are not paying very much tax, but I ask this House tonight, for the benefit of the member for Cook, just how many lawyers and barristers have used the escape route of insolvency, tax avoidance and bankruptcy to escape their liabilities. I would like someone to come back to the House and say how many barristers and lawyers are paying the top marginal rate of tax. We have read so often in the newspapers and in the media about wealthy barristers—it is not only barristers, but I am talking about barristers and solicitors—who manage to serially go bankrupt on a regular basis, yet their wives manage to hold all the assets. When the taxation commissioner comes after them to get the taxation that is due to the tax office and the tax commissioner, there is nothing there.
Tax avoidance is a hole in the revenue stream for the programs and services of public good and the community that we stand up here day in and day out to support. There are many people in this country—certainly some very privileged people like barristers and lawyers—who are not paying their fair share of tax. That is why I think it is so relevant. Those who seek to live in the black hole of tax avoidance deserve to be deprived of the programs and services to which they do not contribute and which they actively seek to avoid.
The most urgent taxation reform that needs to be done is to reconstitute the board of taxation as an entity with its own secretariat, which could properly and effectively advise the board and the Taxation Office of the policies, issues and implementation strategies of taxation reform. The board of taxation should be equipped with the necessary authority and interventions to be able to avoid the calamities and debacles that typify the government's record so far. If this government had trusted the Australian people, had explained the need for taxation reform and had set out to create a genuine bipartisan approach to taxation reform, whatever reforms might have been agreed upon would have been implemented with the cooperation of an informed public.
Any further taxation reform must include a reconstitution of the board of taxation so that it can truly function as a means by which all the best advice can be brought to bear and can be tested, evaluated and exposed to the Australian people for comment and consultation. Unfortunately, the government is too often only interested in short-term political advantage and not the public good. The public good is often forgotten by the government, which instinctively aligns itself with the big end of town. A recent study by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling revealed that one in eight Australians—that is, 12.5 per cent, more than two million Australians—do not have the money to provide themselves with the basics of life: food, clothing and shelter.
This government does not want to deal with the tax avoidance industry because it would mean tackling their corporate mates who keep the donations rolling in. For the Australian people, tax avoidance results in their paying more tax than they should. Before we talk about tax cuts, let us talk about everyone paying their proper share of tax. Let us make sure that the tax office pursues its responsibilities to make that happen. Taxation is each citizen's financial contribution to Australia. It is an obligation of citizenship. A perfect example of the taxpayer making their contribution is the rescue of the policyholders of HIH Insurance. The downside is that HIH Insurance was run by company rorters who were not interested in their policyholders, only in themselves. So obsessed were they that they brought the company down and the public had to rescue the policyholders. 
Under the Howard government, the regulators were hopelessly inadequate. They failed the policyholders and the Australian people miserably as a result. Now the taxpayers are being asked to carry the burden of the Ansett collapse for the survival of the employees, the regions and passengers. Again the failed managers look like escaping from their responsibilities. The government were asleep and, even when woken up and told in June-July, they stayed in bed. In this regard, the government have failed everyone except their corporate mates. The government has watched while billions of dollars were lost from HIH, One.Tel and now Pasminco and Ansett. The government has watched as thousands of workers lost their jobs. They slept while thousands of contractors, suppliers and small businesses were decimated by these corporate failures and regulatory negligence.
The government refuses to accept there was a role for it to intervene before disaster struck, yet it wants the public to be grateful for responding when it was too late. This government expects the taxpayer to pay twice: firstly, to pick up the pieces from corporate collapses arising from the government's negligence; and, secondly, to rescue all the other victims. This government truly has had its head in the clouds during these debacles. Our country deserves much better than that. I am sure that the public will have the opportunity when the election is held on 17 November to do something about this. Before the member for Cook speaks, I ask him this: does he support the tax avoidance industry? I will be happy to table in this House Paul Barry's articles. It is a serious matter that the so-called people who are supposed to uphold the law are setting an example by not paying their tax. Little wonder the government has argued—and it is fair for it to argue—that it needs to broaden the tax base. There are bludgers who are well paid, who pay little or no tax and, with the very clever setting up of trusts and discretionary trusts, avoid paying their fair share of tax. When they get into deep water, they transfer their assets to their spouse and use the escape route of bankruptcy so they do not have to pay any tax to the taxation commissioner.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-09-24,"—It is very interesting to follow the member for Lowe. Good guy though he might be, I am sure that he did not read what the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 was about before he came into the House. He did not address one issue in the bill. He talked about tax avoidance. If anybody wants to know what tax avoidance is about, they should talk to the Labor Party. For 13 years they presided over the biggest number of tax avoiders that you have ever seen. They went to their corporate functions—and they still do. When Bill Clinton was out here they all paid a million dollars to go along and add to your slush funds. 
—We are very happy any time you stand to your feet. All it does is revive those years of Labor and Labor's corporate mates and their tax avoidance background and history. It is all there and you did not address one aspect of it in relation to this bill. This is a significant bill, and it is with great regret that the member for Lowe has not bothered to read it. 
Firstly, this bill is about personal services income, which a lot of people in Lowe would be very concerned about; in particular, the question of the alienation of personal services income. Changes were made because it was felt that some people were avoiding their tax responsibilities. They were setting up their own companies even though they were employed by one organisation or one company and then claimed that they were separately contracting out. The government attempted to sort it out. This bill defines how people can self-assess and so determine whether they are due to come under the province of this legislation. 
The bill contains important improvements to the measure, which will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. I thought the member for Lowe would be interested in reducing the cost of compliance for the taxpayers of Lowe, but, of course, he is not—he is more into rhetoric. The bill provides that all taxpayers earning personal services income will be able to self-assess whether they are independent contractors against the results test. If the results test is passed, then they are not affected by the alienation measure. Under provisions of this bill, such independent contractors will be allowed to self-assess their status. They will not have to seek a determination. Even when 80 per cent or more of their income comes from the same entity, they can self-assess as a personal business where they derive income from producing a result, where they supply their plant equipment or tools of trade, if required, and where they are liable for rectification.
The announcement was greeted with quite a lot of support in my electorate, because there are a whole number of people who were caught up in this legislation. They are very pleased with the ability to self-assess, and it was a considerable step forward. 
—I am glad the member for Lowe is still in the chamber, because he might find out about the bill on which he was supposed to be speaking. Secondly, the bill addresses the issue of listed investment companies. As announced in this year's budget, the government will provide capital gains tax relief for shareholders in listed investment companies. In particular, this bill will amend the income tax law to provide shareholders in listed investment companies with the benefit of the capital gains tax discount on certain capital gains made by these investment vehicles.
Thirdly, the bill addresses the issue of the HIH insurance rescue package. The bill includes provisions associated with the financial collapse of the HIH group of companies. The Commonwealth has established a scheme to assist certain qualifying individuals and small businesses that experience financial hardship as a direct result of the collapse. This bill contains measures to ensure there are no unintended income tax or GST consequences arising from transactions occurring as a result of the HIH rescue package. 
Schedule 5 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that the income tax consequences of payments under the HIH rescue package are the same as if those payments had been made directly by HIH and exempts the HIH trust from income tax. The bill also amends the GST act to ensure that the GST provisions relating to insurance apply to transactions between an HIH rescue entity and either HIH policyholders or third parties making claims under HIH insurance policies. Put simply, this bill seeks to simplify the taxation position of payments made from the HIH support trust and other support schemes and aims to place payments from the schemes in the same position as if they had received the payments from HIH. 
This bill contains three important provisions: first, as I have said, it clarifies the situation for people involved in personal services income—for those who have their own company and where more than 80 per cent of their income comes from one organisation; second, it sets out the requirements for listed investment companies to clarify some of the taxation provisions; and, third, it sets out the HIH insurance rescue package. These three provisions are most important at this time of uncertainty and this bill provides clarification. It is a great pity that the member for Lowe did not consider the concerns of the members of his electorate. This is an excellent bill and I am very pleased to commend it to the House. It will be well received by the people of the electorate of Cook.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I was being totally misrepresented. I was sticking up for my electorate, because my electorate— 
—The member for Lowe will resume his seat. The member for Lowe is well aware that misrepresentation is not of itself a point of order. If he has been misrepresented, he should seek a personal explanation and I will accommodate him tomorrow if that is necessary.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 6) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-09-24,"— Next Sunday, history will be made. Even if the Prime Minister calls an election, I can assure you that it will pale into insignificance compared with the victory that the Knights will inflict on the Eels. Having been born and bred in the Hunter, having lived and worked there most of my life and having reared my family there—just as the member for Hunter here at the table has—I am very proud of the achievements of the Hunter. People who do not even follow rugby league will have heard of the Newcastle Knights. This was a team that gave our region a great lift in 1997, beating, against the odds, a much more fancied Manly. That was the year that the announcement had been made to close the BHP plant. The Knights certainly brought about a revival of spirit, and we soaked up the greatness of that first victory.
Already grand final mania is taking hold in the Hunter. Red and blue will feature prominently for months to come, particularly when we do beat the Parramatta Eels on Sunday. To those people who are not Hunter residents, it may be hard to comprehend the loyalty we have for our region. I believe it originated with our working-class background and with the way our community supports local industry, local service and, of course, the local team. Our commitment to sport is second to none. Junior and senior sport are well catered for, and the loyalty we give our teams is legendary. When Joey Johns leads the Knights on to the ground at Stadium Australia next Sunday, they will have at least half a million fans willing them to win. We may not be there in body, but we will all be there in spirit, urging on Joey and the boys.
—I'll be there!
—Fortunately, the shadow minister at the table will be there, and I envy him greatly. We will be willing them on to make history again—this time for the Telstra Cup. And it has been a complete competition, with all of the teams having competed. There has been no diminishment here because of Super League.
There is an element of sadness for Knights' supporters. Despite our loyalty and despite the fact that the Knights consistently attract the greatest number of attenders at games, our ground is an embarrassment. There has been no $14 million federal pork-barrelling or, I must admit, state pork-barrelling, as there was for the North Power Stadium to relocate the Northern Eagles. This could now be called the white elephant stadium, with the demise of the Eagles.
Football is an industry in the Hunter. It creates jobs and it ignites a community; yet we still have the highest rate of unemployment in the state. If the government were fair dinkum about rewarding effort, loyalty and achievement, they would meet with the management of the Knights and establish a funding program to give the people of the Hunter the football stadium they deserve. It will create jobs, it will generate goodwill, and I assure you we will fill it to capacity on a regular basis. All I ask is that there be a special place where the Telstra Cup can be placed, because I am sure it is going to be housed there for many years to come.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Newcastle Knights Rugby League Team</title>,Adjournment,18,1
