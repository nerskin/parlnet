"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-09-14,"—Pursuant to contingent notice and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Evans, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from making the statement.
What an abuse of Senate power we are seeing today. We have a government out of control, drunk on power, that is determined to abuse the Senate chamber, abuse the parliamentary process and abuse the Australian public. What do we know? We know that Senator Joyce is being gagged. We know that Senator Nash raised concerns yesterday. We are not allowed to have a committee process. We are not allowed to get to the bottom of what is in the legislation. We are not allowed to have a debate on the second reading. We are going to gag the committee process. We are going to gag the third readings. This is a government drunk on power. This is a government that promised after the election: ‘We won’t abuse our control of the Senate. We won’t take our position for granted. We’ll continue with the process.’
Senator Boswell, I see you are here again. I remind you of some very important words that you said on The 7.30 Report when you were asked about the abuse of Senate process. You said, ‘I think that the system works pretty well.’ I thought, ‘Good on Senator Boswell. He is true to his profession, true to his calling.’ But no, the first two or three opportunities to prove those words, to prove those sentiments meant anything, Roll-over Ron Boswell is in here gagging debate, gagging committees, gagging process, abusing the government’s power.
What is this government hiding? Why do we have this rush? It became clear yesterday as Telstra were forced to admit that they have created a redundancy fund. It is in the Age if you want to read it, Senator Joyce or anybody else. That is the admission. They are going to be involved in mass sackings after this bill is passed this week. They are pushing back the date of the review. They do not want Sol Trujillo’s review to possibly become public before this chamber has to vote because they know that they are going to be engaged in mass sackings. They put out a very mealy-mouthed statement yesterday to the Stock Exchange: ‘We don’t know anything about a 104-page document that canvasses cuts of that magnitude.’ All right, Telstra, they might not be 14,000, they might not be 10,000, but are they 8,000? Are they 5,000? Because, Senator Joyce, we know where these cuts are going to be. They are going to rip the guts out of Telstra Country Wide. They are going to take all these people out there. All these techs—they are going to be gone. And you are going to say, ‘How on earth are they going to meet all these community requirements that we’ve negotiated so toughly for? How on earth are we going to make them keep their word?’ I have got news for you, Senator Joyce: there is no chance. Read Ross Gittins today. If you want a picture of what is going to happen after you vote for this, you read Ross Gittins today, because that is what is going on.
The Prime Minister and Senator Hill do not want the truth to come out. They are engaged in a deceit of the Australian public, a deceit of this parliament and a deceit of this chamber. That is what is going on here. The PM does not want the truth out. We have seen some extraordinary scenes in the last few weeks. Senator Joyce has been followed round by members of the National Party, members of the government. It is quite embarrassing and demeaning. He has been physically intimidated by Senator Heffernan. I witnessed the exchange in the hall outside. I saw Senator Heffernan front Senator Joyce. Senator Boswell, you were there as well. To be fair to you, Senator Boswell, you were trying to protect him from Senator Heffernan, but I witnessed it.
—Senator Conroy, through the chair.
—I accept your admonishment, Mr President. Now the government are going to gag Senator Joyce, but the worst part is you are voting to gag yourself. It is quite embarrassing. Is it so demeaning to have to stand up and tell the chamber what you think and raise your concerns?
—Senator Conroy, through the chair.
—I was not addressing any individual senator then, but I accept your admonishment yet again. So let us be clear: we have a senator who has been dragged from room to room, taken into meetings and pressured, who has had the president of the National Party announce publicly how he is going to vote. The president of the Queensland National Party has stood up and said: ‘I know how Senator Joyce is voting. This is how he’s going to vote.’ (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I wish to speak against the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and related legislation before us today. I am mindful that other people want to speak about this bill in the very short period of time we have left to speak about it, so I just want to put on the record that Labor is opposed to the sale of Telstra. We voted against it five times before and we are going to vote against it again. I am a new senator and I am absolutely appalled by what has happened in the Senate over the last week. One week ago we got these bills into this parliament. One week ago they were referred to a Senate committee for a one-day inquiry—one day for the people of Australia to contemplate this legislation that will radically alter the delivery of telecommunications in Australia for the rest of their lives.
Now the bills are back in the parliament. This morning, when there are senators wanting to speak about it to represent the people of Australia on this matter, the debate has been guillotined by this parliament, by those people over there—that gutless crew over there, those doormats over there. I wish you good luck in the next election. I wish you good luck, because you are going to need it. You have sold Australia down the river, down the creek. Seventy per cent of Australians do not want Telstra sold but, for a small grab bag of promises for Senator Barnaby Joyce’s constituents in Queensland, you have sold out everybody. You have given us one week to consider the legislation. You are a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2005-09-14,"—Thank you very much, and I welcome the good honourable gentleman to our side of the chamber—
—Acting Deputy President Hutchins, on a point of order: I am next on the speakers list. Senator Joyce is not on the list. Will we stick to the speakers list or have we gagged that too?
—It is a longstanding practice: one side of the chamber then the other side of the chamber. The Democrats have chosen to sit on the Labor side of the chamber, so they are part of that speaking contingent.

Senator George Campbell interjecting—

—How many speeches has the government had on this bill? How many opportunities? Very few.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—In fact the Labor spokesman damned the government for not allowing Senator Joyce to speak. Then, when Senator Joyce rises, the Labor Party wants to gag him. They cannot have it both ways.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I would welcome Senator Joyce’s contribution to the debate but, unfortunately, we are faced with a situation where the government and Senator Joyce have voted for a gag that ends the debate at 11.30 am. I am happy for the government to move a motion extending the time for the debate. Senator Joyce is a victim of his own party discipline. He voted for a resolution that stifled the debate. Now he wishes to jump on the speakers list. The speakers list is agreed between the parties and circulated in the chamber. The speakers list shows McEwen, Stott Despoja and Fielding. If Senator Joyce is to jump in and speak, then he denies Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Fielding their opportunities.
—Not necessarily. You’re wasting speaking time now.
—My point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that the government have overturned all the Senate procedures and this is another one—a distributed formal agreement between the parties, the speakers list, which is given to the chair. They are going to break that convention as well. According to the list, Senator Stott Despoja has the call and she ought to be given the call.
—On the point of order: it is totally outrageous that the speakers order now be broken to convenience government members who have not had the gumption to get up to speak until now. I move, according to contingent orders:
That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Stott Despoja being heard next.
 (Senator Hutchins)—I have been advised that you cannot move that because there is a point of order before the chair.
—I will move it immediately afterwards.
—I believe there is a point of order before the chair. As everybody knows, it has always been the practice to take one speaker from one side and then one from the other. The order of speaking is decided by the whips. I call Senator Joyce.
—Mr President, you have an obligation in this place to recognise that there is a crossbench. It is not one side or the other; there are three sides. Senator Stott Despoja is on the speaking list and Senator Joyce is not. It is totally contrary to all practice in this place that you suddenly come in here and give favour to a government member over a crossbench member who, according to the whips’ arrangements—
—Senator, you have made a point of order. I am ruling on that point of order. It is always the custom of the chair to take one speaker from one side and then one from the other. The last speaker was Senator McEwen on my left. I propose to take a speaker from my right, and I call Senator Joyce. I ask you to resume your seat, Senator Brown. I have ruled on the point of order. I call Senator Joyce.
—Thank you very much, Mr President. There have been a number of calls from the other side of the house that I had been gagged, so it is very important—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. You were saying that you go from one side of the chamber to the other. I happen to be on the other side of the chamber to the previous speaker and I happen to be on the speakers list. I think it would be more than appropriate for Family First to have their say in the second reading debate on this legislation.
—There has been a lot of time wasted this morning and, Senator, I am sure that you will get the opportunity, either now or in the committee stage. I call Senator Joyce.
—Thank you very much, Mr President. It is important that we get it on the record today that the decision—
—Mr President, I dissent from your ruling that Senator Joyce be heard ahead of the other senators who are listed.
—It is not a ruling. It is the right of the chair to call from one side or the other. I ask you to resume your seat, Senator Brown.

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—We are not going to have a debate on standing orders. I have called Senator Joyce and I ask him to continue with his—
—Mr President, I seek leave to move a motion that the Senate allow Senators Stott Despoja, Joyce and Fielding to give speeches in the second reading debate on the Telstra bills.
—We are now under the rules of urgency and I have no alternative but to call Senator Joyce.
—Is leave granted or is leave denied?
Leave not granted.
—I think it is very important to get on the record what the National Party wished to extract from the Telstra legislation and what we have extracted, what we have done in the last week and how the process goes on. It is very important for people to know exactly what the resolutions were that we came down to this chamber with. In Queensland we had two resolutions that were given to us. One resolution was to not sell Telstra at all, and from the 350 or so delegates at the National Party state conference it managed to attract two votes, because the people in Queensland realise the political dynamics that we have to work with and the fact that we have to go out and do the very best deal we possibly can. As such, and realising that we do not actually have every vote in the chamber, although a lot of people think we do have every vote in the chamber—and I am flattered to think that a lot of people think that I am the only senator in the chamber—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—and it is great to attract the attention from the Labor Party and the free advertising they give me. I welcome the advertising. So far we have attracted a Labor member to our side of the parliament and I congratulate him for coming across. It is very important to know that what we actually came down here to support was a five-pillar policy, which was the extraction of a deal. We made it well known and everybody knew that, if we did not extract that deal, we would not vote for the sale of Telstra. We have gone into this process and we have accomplished so much. Even in the last week we have managed to—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Who is gagging the debate now?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Come to order!
—Thank you very much, Mr President. I just want to go through what has happened in the last week, because everybody knows all the pros and cons. In the last week we have managed to have the review process of this legislation to clarify exactly what is in the $2 billion trust fund. We have got that. There was a problem with it and we have clarified that. The National Party managed to get that clarified. We have managed to get clarification of the means and mechanisms of the operation of the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee.
It was great to see in the last week the National Farmers Federation coming out in support of us, and in fact imploring me to vote for this legislation. It is great to see that there has been recognition by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts of the need to get a wider involvement in the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee group. They will now get peak industry bodies involved with it. All this is part of the work you do when you are not involved in the semantics and filibustering that is going on here but you are actually reading the legislation and working out what is wrong with it and getting it fixed—because that is what we do in the National Party. We actually read the legislation, and it is very important to read the legislation because in this chamber you are supposed to check the veracity of the legislation. All the theatrics here have amounted to nothing. Your theatrics have amounted to nothing because nobody is listening to you.
It is good to see that the National Party have extracted this deal. We acknowledge that the deal that initially went to the lower house delivered nothing for regional and rural Australia. It delivered nothing, and it is the position of leverage that the National Party has that has put so much into this legislation that it can actually deliver the services. The final question has to be this: will the people of regional and rural Australia and the people of Queensland be better off or worse off after the passage of this legislation? All the problems that are currently happening are happening under the current ownership guise. The National Party has used this position of leverage to get both the money on the table and the legislation on the table to fix the problems. That is what the National Party does. We are few in number but we managed to extract a deal and I sit here today with my colleagues proud of what we have achieved.
I know that when we were talking on the John Laws show this morning, they were proud of what we have achieved. They know that the National Party has gone into bat. They know that the National Party is a safety valve in conservative politics. They know that the National Party allows open debate and, if you are so irrelevant that the Australian people do not want to vote for you, that is not our problem. You must make yourselves relevant. You must become engaged in the debate, you must come up with rational solutions and you must become part of the solution and not just a commentator on the problems. It has become apparent that you have not even read the legislation yourselves. You had the same amount of time that we did. The National Party had to find the problems that you should have found. Why is that? Why is it that we found the problem with the $2 billion slush fund? Why is it that the National Party—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Mr President, on a point of order: screaming abuse at the speaker is totally out of order. Labor speakers receive the courtesy of being listened to. The Labor Party should cop it now and listen to Senator Joyce.
—There is too much noise in the chamber. I ask all senators to come to order.
—So the National Party had to do the Labor Party’s job on this. It had to become an effective mechanism to bring some veracity to the legislation and to make sure that we deliver what we intended to deliver. We worked very hard at that. I also thank Minister Coonan for the assistance she has given me.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—She has. Honourable senators, last night we in the National Party delivered 10 proposed amendments to the legislation to the minister, and all 10 have been agreed to. We are looking forward to such things as an independent assessor on the COT cases. We look forward to a greater connection. I can see some of the amendments here on the table this morning. That is how it works on this side. We achieve things, we find the problems and we fix them.
I want to put on the record that the National Party has extracted this deal. The National Party has gone into bat. The National Party has delivered. I will conclude with this: there is strong sentimentality towards the ownership of Telstra; I acknowledge that, and you hear about it everywhere you go. But when there is a choice between—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—If you will let me finish, someone else will get a chance to speak. If there is a choice between the sentimentality—

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—You did not get a Senate seat in Queensland, Senator Brown. There is a choice between the sentimentality of owning Telstra as it is now or having the legislation and the money in place to fix problems and to bring parity of service and prices into the future. If we have the legislation and the money in place to deliver that—which were never there when the bill was initially put through the lower house—then the National Party has delivered. It is the only party in this house that has managed to stand up for rural and regional Australia in such a way that it actually delivers.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2005-09-14,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Mr President, at the outset may I say that for the record one of my brothers is an executive in Telstra—though, as I have learned in the last few weeks, that doesn’t mean that I am not as much in the dark as everybody else when it comes to knowing what goes on in Telstra.
Family First is disappointed that the Government, which claims to be a champion of the family, is refusing to tell families how selling the rest of Telstra will affect them.
When the Prime Minister announced during the election campaign that he would take up Family First’s proposal to prepare Family Impact Statements, the public thought the idea was to benefit them.
So did Family First.
Had Mr Howard explained to Australian families that Family Impact Statements were solely for the benefit of the Cabinet, people might have thought they were not worth much at all.
Family First feels the same.
It is all very well for the Government to say ‘trust us, we are looking after families’. But Australian families would prefer to get the information and judge for themselves.
There is no point waiting around 30 years for a Cabinet document to find out whether a Government really was looking after families.
If ever there was an issue where families needed to know how they would be affected, it is the sale of the rest of Telstra.
There are certain essential things that all Australians ought to be confident they can access regardless of where they live—including quality and affordable telecommunications.
This is especially so, given the Government’s record on this issue.
I note that, last week, in defending the Government’s decision to rush legislation through the Senate, even though there is no apparent reason to do so, a number of Senators said the full sale of Telstra had been government policy for nine years.
Since then the Communications Minister has echoed this interpretation of history.
She may be right, but if she is, Australian families might think they have been misled.
Back in 1996, when the then Communications Minister Senator Alston said the full privatisation of Telstra was ‘inevitable and desirable’, the Prime Minister was quick to deny the Cabinet had any plans for a full sale.
He told the ABC’s AM program:
“We have a commitment to sell a third…Self-evidently if some people support the sale of a third of Telstra, they can vote for legislation to sell a third of it and vote against any legislation that might be submitted in 10 years time to sell any more.”
Back then, owning two-thirds of Telstra did not present a conflict of interest between being both owner and regulator, but less than 10 years later, we are told that owning 51 per cent of Telstra presents huge conflict of interest problems.
The question is whether the Government is misleading us now or was misleading us then.
A couple of years after the Prime Minister assured Australians that supporting the sale of a third of Telstra was not giving a green light to selling it all, he said his goal was to “make Australia the greatest share-owning democracy in the world.’
A year later many Australians heeded Mr. Howard’s call and bought shares in Telstra, at $7.40 each.
Many were keen to be part of this ‘greatest share-owning democracy’ and kept their shares in Telstra. And they are now paying the price.
Two billion dollars of their money ended up in a black-hole in Hong-Kong—money which would not have been lost had Telstra stuck to its knitting instead of bowing to market pressure to diversify into growing businesses and other sectors.
This sorry tale highlights a fundamental issue— whether the role of government is to run businesses or provide essential services.
Australians expect the government to provide essential services, including telecommunications, efficiently.
They do not expect them to provide those services as though they were businesses driven by the bottom line.
In the last couple of weeks we have become aware of the price we shall pay because of this.
In order to appease ‘the market’, Telstra borrowed $500 million this year, and will borrow $2 billion next year, to pay inflated dividends, presumably to prop up the share price.
Meanwhile there has been under-investment in infrastructure;
* More than 14 per cent of all lines are faulty;
* Obsolete equipment has not been replaced;
* New workers have not been properly trained;
* IT systems are not capable of handling the volumes and new services offered; and
* an additional $2 to $3 billion should have been spent over the last few years.
Telstra management predicts a growing technological divide between rural and urban Australia and even less investment in new networks and technologies.
All this while the Government has been assuring us that services are up to scratch!
If this reflects how far Telstra has deteriorated while the Government has control and people can pressure politicians to maintain standards, it does not require much imagination to work out what will happen if Telstra is completely sold off.
The Government’s response is that ownership is irrelevant and regulation provides the necessary level of protection.
The Government points to the Universal Service Obligation, as an example, but the USO does not even deal with broadband, let alone future technology.
As for regulation, who is going to trust a government, which nine years ago said a decision to sell a third of Telstra did not mean it would all be sold, to maintain its proposed level of regulation more than five minutes after it has sold its shares?
We know what Telstra wants. Its management has spelt it out in detail.
And we know the general view of the Finance Minister is that the Government should be “light-handed in their regulation”.
We know also the power of the market.
The chief executive of another former national icon, Qantas, recently made clear that, despite a record profit, more sackings were necessary, adding that he made no apologies for looking after shareholders.
Telstra management has told us who will be the biggest losers from a completely privatised company driven by market forces
It will not be people living in inner metropolitan suburbs where Telstra’s market share in some cases is less than 20 per cent.
Rather it will be people in regional, rural and remote Australia where there is little, if any, competition and where Telstra’s market share is more than 90 per cent.
Mr President, like Sir Robert Menzies I support free enterprise, not the free market. This sorry tale is a stark example of the difference between the two.
In my first speech I said that “the major parties struggle to reconcile their professed ‘family values’ with their ‘free market’ mantra.”
This incurred the wrath of some in this place, and some outside, as reflected by editorial in The Australian on August 12.
However, the views of a member in the other place proves this point.
He has said he does not think the Telstra legislation is “really a family-related bill”.
He thinks the legislation is “an economic bill”.
I disagree, and I am sure most Australian families disagree as well.
That is why in May I asked the Communications Minister for a Family Impact Statement.
I said: “I need to be shown how (selling the rest of Telstra) will benefit Australian families.’
I added that I did not want “to see this only about how it will benefit us economically. I want to be convinced that it’s a good idea.”
Mr President, nothing has changed. And I believe most Australians think the same as I do.
Australians believe the Government should use some of Telstra’s dividends to fix up its problems, keep directing some of that money into defence, pensions, health and education and still retain ownership of Telstra.
After all, it seems that what the Government’s $3.1 billion package translates to is just $275 million per year, for four years, assuming the proceeds of Connect Australia are spent over that period and $100 million a year thereafter —which is not very much when you look at all of the problems Telstra’s management has exposed.
Senators opposed might be interested to know that the Coalition did promote selling the rest of Telstra during the 1998 election.
That was the election where the Coalition lost 16 seats —hardly a ringing endorsement of its Telstra sell off.
Despite the Government’s best efforts since then, the fact is today 70 per cent of Australians have not been convinced selling the rest of Telstra is in our best interests.
The Government has failed to convince me.
Consequently I oppose the bills.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-09-14,"—In the short time remaining, I will also seek leave in a moment to incorporate my speech, but I want to put a couple of things on the record. First of all: that is how it is done. Today Senator Mc-Ewen showed how it is done, Senator Fielding showed how it is done—and they have only been here for a short period of time. Some of us have been here for almost a decade. Sixty-three of you have come in since I came to this place, and this is the most shameful day and the most shameful display I have ever seen. A guillotine is not unprecedented, but a gag on a guillotine almost is.
—It has been done before.
—Yes, I know it has been done before. Through you, Mr President, they are as bad as each other at times when they want to get their legislation through. But this is shameful. The irony of someone voting for a gag and then jumping up a speakers list that they were not even on! I hope they understand as they get more blooded in this place that there are certain conventions, that there are procedures and standing orders in this place that some of us have learnt to observe over the last decade or so. So for those new senators: it was not always thus, I can assure you. Senator McEwen is outraged by the treatment of people in this chamber today and by the guillotine, and you have the right to be, Senator McEwen, through you, Mr President. But it was not always this bad.
I put on the record that the Democrats have incorporated one speech, from our leader. We have given two speeches, and I have waited patiently on this speakers list. I have never sought to disrupt the speakers list. I have never sought for us to betray or defy the conventions by which we operate in this place. And I am appalled that some senators who should know better have sought to do this. We have absolutely quashed and gagged the debate that is before us today. This is a shameful day on two grounds. The first ground is the process—that is, a lack of substantive opportunity for debate and insufficient scrutiny of the bills. And I love people lecturing us on the bills when half the people in this place who do so probably have not read a piece of legislation, let alone a package of it, for a long time.
The second ground is the debate on the amendments. We are being told that the government has put forward amendments and that they have really done the hard work. I have forgotten what Senator Joyce said about doing the work that Labor should have done. The Democrats have amendments to put too, Senator Joyce, through you, Mr President, but we have 15 minutes to debate them in the latter stages today, if you do not count that generous hour and a half for the committee stage. So not only have we today defied every rule in the book with regard to convention, process, standing orders, tradition, the gentlemanly nature that is supposed to rule and govern this chamber, but we have left no time for the debate on this policy.
Do not, senators, come in here and try to compare this with other debates—and I have a quote of 7 September from Minister Campbell, which I do not have time to read out, trying to compare this with other debates—because this debate has not had comparable time, not in relation to speeches on the second reading debate and certainly not in relation to the committee stage. The Democrats have participated in the committee report. We have done a minority report. We have been present for all votes. We have been engaged in the debate process. We have incorporated a speech and had two speakers. Yet you still managed to gag us and to change the speaking order today. It is a shameful day. Today I am really embarrassed and upset to be a legislator in this place. But I know the tide will turn, because the Australian people are going to want a check on executive power after they see the way the mandate, so-called, has been abused and used in this place today. It is shocking. To those new senators who are culpable: I really hope that you will hang your heads in shame, because this place is supposed to be where we cherish and nurture democracy, not where we abuse it, erode it and undermine it. I seek leave to incorporate my speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
There is no rush to get this important legislation through so quickly—the Government’s majority will still be there in a year’s time.
This is one of the first clear signals from the government that it will use and abuse its majority in this place without due process and analysis.
Is this perhaps some indication of what the next two years, or longer, are going to be like—a government intent only on its own ideological agenda rather than genuine inquiry and debate.
There has been no case made that the sale of Telstra is justified—whether it be on competition, services, legal or financial grounds.
The sale of Telstra remains opposed by the overwhelming majority of Australians. Despite its claims, this Government does not have a mandate to sell Telstra—it may have a mandate to ensure interest rates don’t rise—but it does not have a mandate to sell Telstra.
Telstra provides a range of services that are absolutely vital to the national security, economic and social development of Australia.
Australians are increasingly reliant on e‑commerce and banking and for many small businesses, efficient and effective communications are critical. And high speed internet and broadband connections are indispensable for successful engagement with the modern economy.
More importantly, an affordable, reliable and efficient communication system is an essential service for our regional and remote communities—bringing together families, neighbours and communities.
Telecommunications is a service which is too important to be left to the vagaries of the market place.
Government has a necessary role in the provision of telecommunication services—the Democrats do not see Government ownership and regulation of industry as incompatible.
In fact, based on the Government’s own “Charter for the National Interest”, the Government has failed their own test.
In 1996 the Liberal and National Party policy aptly titled “Privatisation: In the Public Interest and the Public Benefit” stated that “the Liberal and National Parties believe privatisation should only occur where it is demonstrably in the public interest … Indeed there are many government functions which public interest and accountability considerations demand remain in public ownership and control.”
This Government has completely failed to make the case that the sale of Telstra is in the public interest. Instead it is intent on selling away the interests of consumers, regional and rural Australian’s and mum and dad shareholders.
If the government was acting in the public interest, it would have released the secret document Telstra handed to them in August about the true extent of its networks failures.
Instead the Government covered up the report as it would have compromised the deal done between the Liberals and the Nationals for the full sale of Telstra.
The report revealed that 14 per cent of Telstra lines have faults and that there is a gap in investment of approximately 3 billion dollars. This means there is a 3 billion dollar gap between what is occurring and what is necessary to ensure that Telstra’s network is adequate and up to scratch. How can the Government, having known the state of Telstra service and network problems, justify the full sale of Telstra as being in the interests of consumers and shareholders?
It is also deeply concerning to all Australians, as it should be to all in this place, that Telstra has dramatically reduced its focus on research and development. Staff numbers at the Telstra Research Laboratories have been cut by almost half since the early 1990s. Without continued majority ownership, without public scrutiny, Telstra will continue to reduce its overall research and development activities and re-direct what remains to propping up stock market prices.
According to comments made by Telstra Research Laboratories worker Mr Kerry Hinton: “Since partial privatisation in 1996, Telstra Research Laboratories management has reflected Telstra’s move toward Vendor Management and commodity technologies by re-focusing Telstra Research Laboratories’ research effort away from hardware to software. If Telstra is fully privatised, with its focus on short-term profit and share price, research will be further focused on “value adding” to commodity technologies because this is where the quickest and easiest profits reside.” Mr Hinton further noted that the equipment Telstra currently purchases is principally designed for North American and European markets, markets vastly different from our own. Without local expertise to ensure such equipment is either compatible or can be made compatible, to conditions in rural and remote Australia, the most affordable technologies will not be suitable for deployment outside the highly populated and profitable eastern seaboard.
Surely this should be alarming to anyone really concerned about rural and regional Australia. Privatisation will not solve these problems, it will only make them worse as the company focuses even more on profits and less on services, investments and research and development.
At the recent Senate inquiry Telstra indicated that it would be reluctant to increase its investment in infrastructure under the conditions imposed in the Telstra sale package.
It is deeply disturbing that once privatised there will no recourse to public scrutiny about serious failures in Australians largest telecommunications company.
Currently the Telstra Corporations Act provides reporting requirements to the Parliament that private companies do not have. This includes the requirement for Telstra to submit to scrutiny by Senate Estimates committees and to “requests for information” under the Freedom of Information Act. More importantly the Act provides the ability for the Minister to give certain directions to Telstra in the public interest.
Once Telstra is privatised these public accountability measures will be gone forever.
The reality is that once Telstra is fully privatised it will be a giant private monopoly—there will be no recourse to ensure it acts in the interests of all, and there will be no adequate mechanism for regulation or control.
Regional and rural Australians know full well that once Telstra is privatised, services and jobs will go just as quickly as those of the banks did when Labor privatised them—and there will be no-one to stop the decline.
Telstra remaining in majority public ownership is the only way to protect services and jobs for all Australians, particularly in regional and remote communities.
As it is, many thousands of Australians in these communities are subject to substandard services. This represents a dire threat to people’s health, safety and financial security. This is not an exaggeration—this is simply how important telecommunications are to rural Australians—to all Australians. Does anyone honestly think that privatisation will improve this situation?
As recently as July 2005 the NSW Farmers’ Association released a survey into the state of telecommunication services in the bush, with more than half of respondents reporting major problems including unreliable landline and mobile services.
The Democrats do not believe the sale of Telstra guarantees affordable and effective telecommunication services for all Australians.
This is not about deals and secret handshakes made behind closed doors—this is about the farmers in the field, the teachers in the regional schools, the doctors in our remote hospitals and families from all over Australia.
Telecommunications brings together mums and dads, brothers and sisters, families and friends. It’s our link to doctors, police, hospitals, churches, schools and businesses.
In 2001 as part of the Democrats’ election pledge—signed by those of us who faced the electorate at that time—which we signed so that the public knew exactly what they were getting, we opposed the sale of Telstra.
I am only three years through my 6 year term and I have no intention of breaking that pledge to the people who elected me. If anyone in this Chamber has any doubts that the final sale of Telstra is not in the interests of ordinary Australians—don’t let this pass. This is our last chance—once it’s gone it’s gone forever.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I am not sure of the process, but I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows:

Mr President I wish to speak against this bill and the related bills, which if passed will allow for the Full Private Ownership of Telstra. I wish to start the day’s debate by saying Labor opposes the sale of Telstra….just in case that was in doubt. We’ve voted against the sale of Telstra five times before.
What we are debating is just another example of the Government’s headlong pursuit of its extreme agenda. And in the debate so far on these bills we have had yet more evidence that this Government is out of touch with the people it claims to represent.
Mr President, on Wednesday 7 September 2005, Senator Nash said in this place that she believes “Labor do not care about the bush”. On the same day we hard Senator Mason accuse Labor of being “inner city swingers”—whatever that is , I don’t know what an “inner city swinger” is, Senator Mason obviously does—but according to Senator Mason the salient characteristic of one is, apparently, someone who never go to the bush.
It’s not a bad line, from Senators Nash and Mason. A bit hackneyed and a bit tired like the government, and completely untrue but what else would we expect. Labor takes exception to the lack of truth, just like we take exception to Senator Abetz and others on that side pretending to know anything about the plight of working people and to their pathetic insistence on using myths to justify the Government’s blind adherence to some ancient, worn out, view of the world of work.
I also take exception to being portrayed as ignorant of the concerns of rural and regional Australians when clearly it is the Government that is out of touch with the bush on the matter of Telstra.
It’s true I am not a member of the doormat faction of the Government and while the doormats might have the monopoly on being stood over by the Government, they don’t have a monopoly on going bush or speaking for the bush.
I have spent quite a bit of time in rural and regional Australia.
I know people who live less than 200kms from Adelaide who don’t have broadband or mobile phone coverage. I know that 20kms from Port Augusta—a South Australian rural city of 15000 people—your mobile phone doesn’t work. I know that in areas in the mallee region of South Australia like Geranium and on the way to Loxton in the Riverland and on the way to Port Pirie in the Spencer Gulf that you mobile phone won’t work. I’ve driven from Adelaide to Darwin several times and I can tell you there are long, long stretches of that road where your mobile phone won’t work and where it’s a really long, long way between public phone boxes.
I occasionally spend time holidaying Yorke Peninsula—a few hours drive from Adelaide. To use the mobile phone I have to go outside and climb up and down the sand dunes until I can find a spot where it will work. I don’t mind not being in mobile phone contact when I’m at the beach but the many small businesses, and farmers and permanent residents down there would probably like more certainty of access—certainty of access that this Government has had 9 long years to deliver to the regions but has failed to provide.
I think I can reliably relay the frustrations of people in the bush who are deprived of the services that are available to some, but not all, other Australians
It’s no secret that Australians don’t believe the Government’s plans to flog off Australia’s communications future will mean any more or better services for them.
Rural and regional Australians do not support the sale of Telstra because they know that once Telstra is fully privately owned they have got Buckley’s chance of getting those 4265 rural exchanges upgraded, of getting reliable landline, mobile and broadband coverage, and—so importantly- of getting the private companies to invest in future communication needs for regional Australia because…it won’t be profitable for those companies to do so and no amount of government regulation will make private companies stay in a business that isn’t profitable…just look at what has happened in the privatised energy industry in South Australia and elsewhere.
Regional and rural Australians have got Buckley’s chance of getting what they need now, with Telstra under the majority ownership of this neglectful, incompetent Government.
However what people in the bush know is that by keeping Telstra in public hands they will at least have some chance in the future of having a Government that will invest in telecommunications for them.
What are the facts of this debate?
Australians don’t won’t Telstra sold. Polls tell us consistently that 70% of Australians don’t want Telstra sold.
Australians still don’t want Telstra sold despite 9 long years of this Government trying to justify selling it
Labor opposes the sale of Telstra.
The Government will sell Telstra.
Who is best representing the wishes of Australians and who is best representing the interests of Australians in rural, regional and remote communities ?
Well, not Senator Nash and Senator Mason and their Government colleagues, certainly not Senator Joyce who promised he would look after the bush—well, at least that bit of it that is in Queensland—and now apparently has shown by his actions this morning show that it is OK to sell out the bush for a very small bag of silver, and who wimped it when he had the opportunity to support the motion to delay finalisation of these bills so that a proper consideration of them could be made.
To get back to this ancient, hackneyed myth being perpetrated by some Government Senators in the Vaile/Howard/Howard/Vaile/Costello Government—I’m not sure which it is—that Labor doesn’t care about the bush.
In the week before this legislation was put into Parliament I was approached by the Local Government Association of South Australia to for advice about what their members, and the members of the Provincial Cities Association of South Australia could do to get the Government to change its mind on the sale of Telstra.
The LGA—which represents all 68 local governments in South Australia, and the Provincial Cities Association, which represents the major regional city councils are totally unconvinced by the Government’s arguments for the sale of Telstra.
They wanted to talk to Labor politicians because despite all the Government’s assurances and bags of sweets for the Queensland doormats, South Australian rural communities aren’t convinced at all with the rhetoric emanating from the Minister for Communications, the Minister for Finance and everyone else on the other side who is hell-bent on flogging Telstra.
You might be interested to know, Mr President, that I have not always been flavour of the month with the Local Government Association and the member councils of the South Australian Provincial Cities Association. I was Secretary of the Union that represented workers in those councils and, occasionally, Mr President, I was in a situation of conflict with the management and elected members of South Australia’s rural and regional councils. I am sure I wouldn’t have been their first choice of someone to contact about Telstra.
But those regional communities are trying to get someone in this Parliament to listen to their concerns. Both the LGA and the Provincial Cities Association have motions on their books opposing the sale of Telstra …..in the case of the LGA the motion has been on the books for nearly 12 months and NOTHING the Government has said in that time has convinced the members of the LGA to rescind their motion opposing the sale of Telstra. I understand that the motion is likely to be reaffirmed at the LGA Annual General Meeting next month.
I am advised, Mr President, that the South Australian Provincial Cities Association has written expressing its opposition to the sale of Telstra to Senators and South Australian federal members of Parliament.
Some members of this Parliament have responded to the Association. When I last spoke to the CEO of the Association, he told me that Mr Wakelin, the Member for Grey, a Member of this Parliament in the other place whose electorate covers 92% of the State of South Australia, hadn’t responded to the Provincial Cities Association letter about the sale of Telstra.
Senator Helen Coonan responded, she even visited some rural and regional areas of South Australia a couple of months ago I believe. Despite her visit the LGA and Provincial Cities Association of South Australia still remain unconvinced that Telstra should be privatised.
I would like to quote from the letter that the Provincial Cities Association sent to members of this Parliament on 11 August 2005.
Before I go to the letter, Mr President, I should note that the Provincial Cities Association represents the Cities of Port Augusta, Mount Gambier, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Victor Harbour, Port Pirie, Murray Bridge and the Riverland. All up representing about 120,000 electors and the majority of rural, regional and remote electors in South Australia.
That’s Rural and regional and remote electors who deserve the same telecommunications services as everyone else in Australia.
These provincial cities areas aren’t all Labor strongholds, I will be the first to admit. I would say, and the CEO of the Provincial Cities Association, Mr Ian McSporran, said it to me himself, the elected members of those Councils represent the whole gamut of the political spectrum from ultra conservative to Labor supporters. There are probably more of them at the conservative end of the spectrum than the Labor end of the spectrum.
However they have put aside political and ideological differences—something this government can’t do—and have a thoughtful, considered and long standing opposition to the sale of Telstra.
I would like to cite some comments from that letter that the Provincial Cities Association sent to, Senators in this House in August 2005.
Insert comments from letter).
“As you are well aware, Telstra Senior Executives have already publicly indicated that they cannot meet the needs and requirements of regional and rural Australia, in having their telecommunication systems upgraded to meet what may be termed as acceptable standards.
“Despite these admissions the Government apparently continues with its ideological “sale of the farm”.
“As an example of this intransigence to acknowledge that all is not right with telecommunications outside of the major capital cities of Australia, we submit the following examples on behalf of the Provincial Cities Association:
Example 1
The January 2005 bushfire on Eyre Peninsula caused major problems with telephone services, because significant lengths of cable were strung between trees and not buried as is the norm. The disastrous size of the bushfire, and the sub standard level of Telstra services necessitated the urgent provision of mobile telephones to be provided to those affected by the bushfire, to enable a semblance of communication to be established.
When these issues were raised directly with Senator Coonan during a visit to the region ( a number of weeks ago), they were generally ignored, with the Minister talking about an upgrade of Broadband, when residents just want a more reliable telephone system.”
Another example from the letter, Mr President,
“The community of Cleve (also on Eyre Peninsula) with a population of approximately 1900 and a rate revenue of $1.4 million, has been endeavouring to get Telstra to provide a mobile telephone tower in its area at Darke Peak. Telstra has recently advised Council that no mobile phone tower will be installed unless the Council enters into a funding agreement”
What an insult to rural and regional Australians—no mobile phone service unless your Council coughs up some money. And I understand, Mr President, that Senator Coonan on her visit to Eyre Peninsula suggested that Darke Peak residents could buy themselves satellite phones! Satellite phones indeed.
No wonder the letter concludes Mr President
“As a vocal opponent of the sale of Telstra, the Provincial Cities Association of South Australia calls upon you to oppose the legislation to fully privatise Telstra, and keep on icon of our country in majority Australian Government ownership.”
And it’s not just the Provincial Cities Association that are writing their concerns in letters. Here’s another South Australian example of the scepticism about privatisation of Telstra—a letter to the editor of The Murray Valley Standard, one of South Australia’s regional newspapers, dated 30 August 2005 from a Mr Tod Cusack of Murray Bridge. Murray Bridge is a rural city of 17000 people located just 80kms kilometres east of Adelaide I know Murray Bridge quite well but I don’t know Mr Cusack, I was just interested in his letter which is a very succinct summary of this whole debate.
He says
“I am opposed to the sale of Telstra for two reasons. Firstly I live on the eastside of Murray Bridge where we have unacceptable mobile coverage; in fact it is almost non existent.
If service is bad in a major rural city, I would hate to think what it would be like in central Australia.
Secondly, the government seems hell bent on selling its assets; what happens when there is nothing left to sell?
Look at the mess power and water are in since privatisation, need I say more”.
Sadly, it looks like it is too late for rural and regional Australia. Time’s up for rural and regional Australia and its probably pointless for them to try and influence this Government because, whammo, the Bill was in the Parliament, the Senate Committee meeting to consider the Bill was set for 9 September and the reporting date was set for the 12 October and the Government is going to use its Senate majority to get the Bills passed by the end of this sitting period.
The Government has already used its majority this morning to once again subvert the proper processes of the Senate.
Unless Senator Joyce or someone else over there finds the courage to oppose these Bills, rural and regional South Australians will see their last opportunity to preserve telecommunications in Government ownership gone.
Gone, along with any semblance of Government respect for the processes of this Parliament..
Now there’s a thing I’ve learnt here in these past few weeks, Mr President, ….the contempt this Government has for the processes of Parliament.
When I was elected a Senator one of the things people would say to me is “the Senate Committee system is really good”—it is a system that holds the Government accountable, that allows for close investigation of bills that the Senate has to vote on, it gives people the chance to contemplate the impact of proposed legislation.
Well, that’s the theory. That’s the theory but when it comes to the Government’s mad rush to flog off Telstra its not the fact.
I am amazed at the arrogance of this Government.
Scrutiny of legislation reduced to a committee hearing of one day and a day and a bit to get a submission in. One day! Referred on Thursday, at the Committee for one day and a report due on the Monday.
Labor put up a perfectly reasonable alternative to the Government’s fast and furious path to privatisation. We said, refer it to the committee for a proper inquiry and delay the reporting date for a month.
But no, that’s too long. The Government says let’s forget due process and let’s get this legislation through, legislation that 70% of Australians oppose, let’s get it through with a token nod to the appropriate Senate Committee.
The Prime Minister allegedly, recently, made comments about the “disgraceful” behaviour of Telstra management
Telstra management was only telling it like it is
This abuse of power in the Senate by this Government is what I call really disgraceful behaviour.
Of course we know why the Government wants to use its Senate majority to ram this legislation through ..its because they got Senator Joyce to commit to the deal that he thought looked after his chums and the Government are worried that the more he looks at the detail of that deal, the more times he will come back with his hand out asking for more crumbs to throw to the people he says he represents in rural Queensland. And what other reports are out there about the appalling state of Telstra and the plans that Telstra has to slash up to 14000 more staff. Who will provide services to the bush then?
Senators opposite say competition will provide. Well, good luck. Most of Australia thinks you are wrong and with good reason. I wish the National Party good luck in the next election, you are going to need it
My thanks to all the Australians who have told us in this House that they want us to vote against the sale of Telstra.
Labor is listening to you however I am sure we will watch in dismay together as the arrogant, out of touch, inept Howard Government destroys Australia’s telecommunication future both in the bush and for those inner-city slickers as well.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows:

There are many Senators who have been in this chamber for many more hours than I. And some who have no doubt become slightly jaded with what at times takes place here. The process by which the inquiry into the Telstra legislation was established, is testament to that.
However, I’m sure it’s not just because I have recently come to this Chamber that I find the haste with which this legislation is being treated as astonishing.
And I’m equally sure that there are members on the opposite side of this Chamber who are principled enough, who care enough, to feel uncomfortable about the way the government is attempting to rush the Telstra Bills through.
I quote from one such colleague who recently stated in this chamber:
“...it would be nice to see debate unencumbered in this Chamber, not in the caucus room or in the joint party room. Neither of these is mentioned in the Constitution and it is a convenient appendix designed by political parties that was specifically not entertained in the Constitution”.
I ask of this Senator and others on the opposite side of the chamber—why is it—that on such an import issue—the sale of Telstra—a request for reasonable time for debate and for a real inquiry, to enable proper examination of the bills, so that interested parties and individuals have the opportunity to properly analyse the documents, form an opinion and comment on them—is not supported.
If you go to the Senate web site you will find a section titled The Role of The Senate. It says that:
The Senate’s large and active committee system serves the purpose of enabling Senators to inquire into policy issues in depth and to scrutinise the way laws and policies are administered by ministers and public servants. The Senate performs the role of the house of review and is a powerful check on the government of the day.
Well, that’s the way it’s supposed to be, but that’s not the way it’s going to be played out, if the actions of this Government during this sitting of Parliament are any indication....
Consider the facts—eight hours on one day only, is allocated for an inquiry into five pieces of legislation, which the Senate members on the Telstra Inquiry Committee only had access to on the afternoon of the day before the hearing.
Further, the witnesses that were able to attend, had only 24 hours notice of the Inquiry.
So the witnesses all of whom were busy in their daily working life, receive a telephone call from the secretariat on Wednesday afternoon advising them of the Inquiry to take place at 8am on Friday morning. They didn’t have access to the five Bills, until after Thursday lunchtime or sometime after that, at which they could only access them on the web.
So in effect, they had less than 24 hours to prepare their submissions, and make their way to Canberra to attend the Inquiry—many of them having to fly in from other states (including Sydney, Melbourne and from as far out as Goondiwindi in Queensland...
What an incredible impost to place on people you invite to have input into such an important process.
On arrival, the witnesses found they had only limited time for the hearing of evidence—and for committee members to inquire into the issues permitted under the terms of reference. And then, some were faced with the terms of reference prohibiting them from speaking about the issues they wished to comment on—the privatisation of Telstra.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission representatives had about 12 minutes to have real questions asked of them about these complex pieces of legislation.
So the Telstra Inquiry Committee was required to receive and read submissions from witnesses, prepare for and hold public hearings, consider evidence, decide on recommendations and write a report all in one working day.
Witnesses before the Inquiry raised this very concern, about not having had time to properly consider the content of the bills .. .
At the one day Claytons Inquiry—the Inquiry you have, when you don’t want a real inquiry—The Australian Telecommunications Users Group had this to say and I quote:
“As part of the statement, we note the bills were released yesterday... Given the time, we will not provide an exhaustive review from our perspective...”
From Vodafone I quote:
“In the short time that has been available, we have confined our analysis of the bills to a specific area ...”
And from the Consumers Telecommunications Network I quote:
“I note that we are the only consumer organisation represented here today. That is a huge concern....so there is definitely a need to have more time. Generally, the rule is at least four weeks for consultation when you get a new bill or discussion paper ...and generally we hear cries from industry and consumer organisations that this is inadequate. So a bare minimum at this stage would be to follow previous practice.”
And we heard—quote:
“Optus is pleased to offer these comments based upon the review of the legislation we have been able to conduct in the brief time available”.
And finally a quote from The National Farmers Federation:
“We are not taking a position on the sale until we see evidence that those problems are going to be addressed. We now have the opportunity to view the legislation, but we do not have a lot of time to do it.”
And now we know that subsequent rapid decision making by the National Farmers Federation, show they have been the latest victim to be seduced by the Howard government’s promises on the provision of telecommunications services now and into the future.
The money proposed by the government is significantly short of the amount needed to fix Telstra’s problems.
According to Telstra itself, an additional $5.7 billion will be needed to provide adequate access to broadband , including at least $2.6 billion for rural and remote Australia—and now on top everything else we’ve heard in the past few days—Telstra admits they have 4265 exchanges which are unserviceable or in need of work.
AAPT summed up an aspect of the hearing procedure in their supplementary submission saying that it was somewhat surprising how an issue of such fundamental economic significance as telecommunications services and the regulation of telecommunication services, is conducted in an environment totally free of economic discussion.
Another area missing in the analyses of this legislation.
And at the inquiry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also raised concerns saying that some process issues may merit further examination by the government so as to ensure that the model—referring to the process of a draft operational separation plan—reflects the governments intentions to have a robust set of equivalence obligations.
So even they are saying that there’s more work to be done on the legislation.
On the basis of past practice and program administration there are significant questions to be raised about the government’s capacity to ensure services are delivered where they are needed.
While we recognise that there have been some worthwhile projects funded under Regional Partnerships—there has been considerable money wasted on projects that provide little sustainable outcome for local communities, and many deserving regions, have been missed out altogether because they do not fall within the Governments radar screen.
And so there are also questions regarding the future fund, given this governments history on the Regional Partnerships debacle.
So we have opposition Senators saying there wasn’t time to scrutinise the bills prior to the one day inquiry—we have witnesses who appeared at the one day inquiry saying they didn’t have enough time to make a substantial and thorough assessment and contribution and we have correspondence from potential witnesses, with similar claims.
This is not what the people of Australia expect from their Parliament—
This is not the Australian way—The witnesses and potential witnesses were not given a fair go!...The Committee was not given a fair go! The people of Australia have not been given a fair go!
In attempting to defend the government’s actions in relation to Telstra this week John Howard said and I quote:
“This is an issue that has been debated inside the Government parties, it has been debated in the community, it has been reported into, it’s been trawled over and analysed now for, 9 to 10 years and the time has come for the Parliament to make a decision”.
The Prime Minister can’t be serious—the Telstra Bills have only been available since Thursday afternoon. Only available to the senators in this chamber, only available to the witnesses presenting submissions to the one day inquiry, only available to the public and only available to the media since Thursday afternoon.
Does the Government really believe the media would be filling air time on radio and television and dedicating columns in newspapers to this very issue, if it was old news.
The lack of available detail, the lack of opportunity for real scrutiny, the undue haste in dealing with the passing of the legislation, all combine to produce a lack of accountability to the Australian people by this government.
A privatised Telstra is all about profits, not people...and even then it doesn’t appear to be about honesty to its shareholders, as illustrated by it not being upfront about where the dividend comes from.
What is missing? What other consequences, gaps, deliberate omissions or deceptions are lurking in the legislation that the Inquiry was given only hours to consider.
The people of Australia, overwhelmingly, do not want the sale of the remaining government interest in Telstra, to go ahead.
Thousands of Australians who have taken the time to contact their parliamentarians—government and opposition—are saying categorically—they don’t want Telstra sold! Fix Telstra, don’t sell it—is the message coming across loud and clear.
But this government is not listening—It doesn’t think it needs to—it disregards the views of more that 70% of Australians that are saying, they don’t want Telstra sold!
And, according to a recent poll by the Canberra Times newspaper, they’re not listening to the 97% of Queenslanders that are opposed to the sale.
There is no urgency to rush these bills through.
What Australian’s want is affordable and accessible telecommunications across all of Australia.
Out in the community, many people think the controversy involving the availability and quality of telecommunication services is restricted to regional, remote and rural areas.
But it’s not only our remote, rural and regional areas who want this and are suffering—major cities in Australia have black spots in telecommunications—metropolitan consumers too, have issues regarding levels and provision of services.
Last year, Telstra was the subject of more than 26,000 complaints made to the telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.
And now we find out that currently 1.4 million Australians have a faulty telephone line, because Telstra has under-invested in its network.
The real life experience of many Australians is one of growing frustration with declining service quality and inability to get modern services like affordable broadband.
In my home State of South Australia, coming number eight in the Australian Communication and Media Authority’s list of worst performing exchanges is Blackwood. Blackwood is a suburb of Adelaide, just 13 kilometres from the Adelaide GPO.
And there are many people who live within 15 minutes of the city of Adelaide who do not have access to ADSL broadband.
One state member has had people come into the Electorate office
saying” I may as well live in the outback..Because we don ‘t have any better facilities”.
One constituent, who runs a tour business, with most of his business coming from overseas was told by Telstra that he will not have ADSL broadband for at least another year.
It is likely that if the issue cannot be otherwise resolved, he will need to move from the relatively new area he is living in, to an older area which is a couple of minutes away.
Constituents in the same state electorate of Torrens attended a meeting in May this year and were told by Telstra that it would be up to 3 months before ADSL broadband would be available... and now these same people are being told do not bother to apply for at least another year.
At the same meeting constituents in the suburb of Oakden 10 Kilometres from the city were told that the current demand for broadband services didn’t warrant a fixed upgrade for their suburb at this stage.
Since the government commenced its privatisation agenda, services have plummeted and prices have increased...
How can the people of Australia trust a fully privatised Telstra to look after services? We are already suffering from Telstra slashing investment as this Government moves towards its full privatisation agenda.
The services to remote, rural, regional and some metropolitan areas of Australia are inadequate. Even if the billions of dollars which lured the Nationals to the sale do eventuate, what guarantees do we have that future technological advancements will be embraced?
Under a fully privatised Telstra, what would happen if tele-medicine, remote education and other forms of e-health and e-education, beyond what we can imagine today didn’t generate the desired profit? Will Telstra be there, prepared to deliver?
Labor regards telecommunications services as essential services that should be accessible and affordable to all Australians, and has voted against the sale of Telstra on every occasion the Howard government have tried to force through the legislation.
While this Government has focused on its extreme agenda of rushing through this parliament, the legislation for the privatisation of Telstra, it has neglected real issues in the telecommunication sector.
Issue like why prices for services in Australia are among the highest in the world, and why the appropriate infrastructure has not been put in place in metropolitan as well as rural, regional and remote areas.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2005-09-14,"—I want to speak today to correct some of the false assertions that have been made in relation to women in the work force under the Howard government and outline some of the benefits the proposed work force reforms will have for Australian working women. Fifty-three per cent of the total number of jobs in Australia since 1996 have been created for women. This is a total of 911,500 jobs, compared with 768,600 jobs which were filled by men. The government’s proposed reforms will generate higher levels of job growth and work force participation, which will continue to benefit women. It has been claimed, both in this chamber and in the wider community, that the Howard government’s reforms to industrial relations have encouraged the casualisation of Australia’s work force, particularly for women. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, none of the employment figures which have been released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reflect or substantiate this claim.
The ABS social trends survey of July 2005 shows that there has been only a marginal increase in overall casual employment since the Howard government’s election in 1996. At that time, 26.1 per cent of all employees worked on a casual basis, compared with 27.7 per cent of employees today. This is a rise of less than two per cent over nine years. The substantial shift towards casual employment occurred before the government set out on its reform agenda, during the years of the accord and under the former ALP government. One example of this was the 2.4 per cent increase in casual work in the two years to 1996. Since that time, the rate of casualisation has stabilised. As well, growth in casual employment for women has been much lower than for men. The growth in casual employment for men has been 6.6 per cent since the Howard government came to office. The rise among women in the same time has been 0.4 per cent—a substantial difference.
AWAs can include a long list of quite innovative measures for women, particularly those with children or caring responsibilities, and this has emerged through agreement making. AWAs can include flexible start and finish times, time off in lieu of overtime, taking annual leave on half pay or on single days, purchased leave, innovations in caring and personal leave, paid parental leave, job share arrangements, home based work, family rooms and breastfeeding rooms, special leave, career break schemes and child-care subsidies.
I would like to take the time today to outline two South Australian examples of the benefits of AWAs to working mothers and to working women in general. People’s names have been changed, but I assure this chamber that the circumstances are genuine. The first example is a woman I will name Karen. She works for a small business in the disability services sector in suburban Adelaide which employs 22 people. Her work is demanding but fulfilling, as she provides vocational and life skills training to intellectually disabled people. Karen is 37 years old and negotiated an AWA four months ago. The agreement allows her to work flexible hours in order to attend to family matters, including care for an elderly friend who lives with the family. The flexible hours have enabled Karen to take time off work to care for her friend and to take her on hospital visits. While undertaking these tasks, Karen has been able to maintain, on average, a four-day working week on differing days according to her personal and family needs. Using this arrangement, Karen considers herself to be more likely to remain in the work force for longer, even if family circumstances become more demanding.
The second example is a person I will call Ann. She works as a full-time employee in a small South Australian business which employs 32 people. She works in a clerical capacity in the business and is one of only three female employees in the company. Ann is married but has no children and is actively involved in training and coaching sport within her local community. This requires her to organise sporting schedules and to be absent from work on at least two afternoons a week. Ann has maintained her full-time job by negotiating flexible working arrangements with the husband-and-wife partnership who own the business.
These flexible arrangements mean earlier starts some mornings or working through breaks in order to be able to leave work by three in the afternoon. Twelve months ago Ann incorporated these new flexibilities into an AWA, which has given her the confidence to use the flexibility that she had earlier negotiated on an informal basis. Ann regards her AWA arrangement as a two-way agreement that makes her more committed to the business in return for the flexibility that the business has given her and the opportunity to take part as a volunteer in sporting activities in her community. These are just two examples of the AWAs benefiting Australian women, and there are many, many more examples that are available in the community.
Despite vocal predictions to the contrary by some unions and by the opposition, allowing women to make flexible AWAs with their employers has not disadvantaged women. In fact, all of the evidence so far suggests that exactly the opposite is the case. Over 70 per cent of AWAs contained at least one family-friendly provision, or family-friendly work arrangements. Of these agreements, more than half had three or more family-friendly provisions. Female average weekly earnings in 2002 were $554. Under registered collective agreements, average total weekly earnings were $600.40. However, under AWAs average total weekly earnings were $889.20. So earnings were $600.40 under collective agreements and $889.20 under AWAs—a dramatic difference. Female employees on AWAs earned, on average, 89 per cent of the male AWA employee hourly rate of pay, far better pay equity than the 2002 gender pay disparity of 77 per cent for the work force as a whole. AWAs applying to women are also more likely to include flexible working and family-friendly provisions.
On Monday afternoon I had the privilege of meeting with a group of working women, together with the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow. It was the second opportunity I have had to meet with Sharan, and we had a productive and useful conversation. I look forward to meeting with her again. I took the time to listen to the concerns of some of those working women who came to see me in my office and to highlight my thoughts on the benefits to working women of wage flexibility. I also understand some of the issues that they raised in their capacity as workers in occupations which are in community service—very valuable occupations in women’s refuges, drug rehab centres and job skills centres—and it was a privilege to meet with them. While we disagreed on some issues, we are all as women working towards giving women the flexibility in the work force that they deserve, and I look forward to promoting the rights of working women through the changes to the workplace relations system in Australia as they come through this chamber.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Women in the Work Force</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,3,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-09-14,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Given that the minister now asserts that Venona Vata and Paulin Pali are the true identities of Mr and Mrs Kola, why were these identities recalled and cancelled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? Are the birth certificates identifying this couple as Mr and Mrs Kola false? Why was Mrs Kola released from Baxter detention centre under that identity and not as Venona Vata? Why has the department written to Mr and Mrs Kola using those identities when it apparently considered these were not their real identities? If the minister is so confident that the true identity of Mrs Kola is in fact Venona Vata, why did she write to her as Mrs Kola, as recently as 29 August 2005, in order to exercise her ministerial discretion to release Mrs Kola from detention and into the community?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mr and Mrs Kola</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-09-14,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister now indicate why her department was absolutely positive that this couple were Mr and Mrs Kola for nearly six years?
—Didn’t you listen to the answer?
—Is it the case that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs only changed that view after they failed to deport them?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mr and Mrs Kola</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-09-14,"—I thank the senator for the question. What has happened yesterday and over the earlier part of today is a very tawdry exercise in politics, where the shadow spokesperson for immigration has made very strong allegations that officers of my department have knowingly and fraudulently sought false identity documents on behalf of a couple known generally as the Kolas. I reject those allegations and have invited Mr Burke to prove his case. I understand he has tabled some documents. I have not had the opportunity to go through them, but, if they are the documents that I have seen, they do not prove the case at all.
I think it is fair to explain what actually happened. This couple arrived in Australia in 1999 on documents they subsequently claimed to be false. I am advised that they came in as Paulin Pali and Venona Vata and then said: ‘That’s not who we are; we’re someone else. We are actually Ergi and Valbona Kola, and we are ethnic Albanians, citizens of Serbia.’ So it is the couple who actually presented with two identities—the one they came in on and the one they then said was the real one. They pursued the opportunities to stay in Australia, they were denied by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, they were rejected at the Refugee Review Tribunal, and they were rejected at the Federal Court.
Then it came to the question of their leaving Australia, because unlawful noncitizens are required to do that. Travel documents were sought from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the name of Kola—the name the couple alleged was in fact their name. Bridging visas were granted to the couple so that they could make their own arrangements to leave. They signed the applications for these certificates of identity, which were lodged with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by DIMIA to assist them to leave voluntarily. The department did not specify a destination. The Refugee Review Tribunal accepted the statement that they could return to Albania and found them to have effective protection in Albania. Return to Albania was therefore an option for them, but it was a matter for them. The department did not seek to enforce their return to Serbia. The immigration department subsequently became aware of new information indicating that the new identity claims—that is, Kola—were, in fact, called into question and further inquiries were made.
The great weight of evidence is that Kola is not their true identity. Information from the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Serbia states that the Kolas are not recorded in the register of citizens in Preshevo, where they claim to have been born. Information from the Albanian authorities states that they are in fact Albanian citizens and that their true names are Pali and Vata—the names they entered Australia on. There is also corroborating evidence from Interpol that documents provided by the couple to verify their identity as Kola are false. For example, the driver’s licence that the couple produced carries a number that has more digits than those assigned to genuine licences. Further, in relation to the birth registration document the couple supplied, there is no matching record in the register of births.
Further, in relation to an identity card supplied by the couple, the registration number corresponds to an identity card number issued to another person. Given the evidence available at the time, new certificates of identity were sought in what was believed to be their true identities, because it was confirmed by the Albanian government that they were in fact Albanian. I take the opportunity to table two documents—one from Serbian authorities and one from Albanian authorities—which confirm much of what I have just said. (Time expired)

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-09-14,"—I acknowledge an interjection on my side: ‘Didn’t you listen to the answer?’ The answer that I gave made it very clear that we did not try to deport them. That did not happen. They were given bridging visas so that they could make their own arrangements to depart—that is the good faith this government expresses to most people who are found to be unlawful noncitizens—and they did not do so. The identity documents were sought in the new names because the information became available. They were referred to as the Kolas—and, in fact, still are referred to as the Kolas—because that is who they indicated they were, and we took them on good faith. That is what is written in all the files, but that does not mean that is who they are. As you well know, Senator, I could send you a letter under another name.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-09-14,"—My question is to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan.

What are the implications of such technological developments, and is the minister aware of any alternative policies for internet service delivery?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Internet Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—I thank Senator Barnett for the question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in ensuring quality telecommunications services for his state of Tasmania. As the Senate would be aware, the Howard government have consistently taken a technology-neutral and a pro-competitive approach to the delivery of broadband internet services—that is, we do not mandate any particular technology and we do not pick any particular providers. An announcement made yesterday by a Tasmanian consortium is a perfect example of why this approach is needed and why it is working. TasTel, Aurora Energy, Datafast Communications and Mitsubishi Electric have announced a commercial trial in Tasmania of broadband over powerline technology. This technology can deliver internet access over standard powerlines at theoretical speeds of up to 200 megabits per second. For the consumer, it provides the benefit of using existing electrical cabling so that every power point in a house suddenly becomes broadband enabled.
For people living in Hobart, this commercial trial means access to packages which currently go up to four megabits a second, in comparison to the commonly available ADSL packages, which range between 250 kilobits per second and 1.5 megabits per second. Access to this broadband service also allows residents to use voice over IP services, which can provide a more economical alternative to the traditional telephone. What was announced yesterday is a commercial trial, but it has the potential for a roll-out of broadband over powerlines, and the benefits are obvious. Using the existing network of powerlines as an alternative to the copper phone network is simply another way of providing competition and choice in this very important emerging market. We are already seeing a rapid growth in wireless broadband services throughout the country offering mobile as well as fixed broadband solutions. There are also satellite services available across Australia and fibre-optic and cable networks being used, particularly in greenfield sites. Most sensible observers agree that competition is the best way to ensure affordable services to all Australians irrespective of where they live.
I am asked about alternate policies and I can tell the Senate that I am aware of some. For example, I am aware of the recommendation from Labor senators just last year that $5 billion be spent to mandate obsolete dial-up internet access. So under Labor’s plan, while commercial operators were rolling out 4,000 kilobit per second services, the taxpayers would have been funding the roll-out of a 40 kilobit per second dial-up service a 100 times slower. While the Howard government is committed to targeting funding to provide broadband however it may be delivered and the roll-out of clever networks, Labor is still wedded in the past, wedded to copper wire. This government have an unparalleled track record for improving communication services for Australia and we will make sure that all Australians will continue to have access to affordable communication services irrespective of where they live.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Internet Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Sherry today relating to Telstra.
Today the opposition questioned the Minister representing the Treasurer about the extraordinary backdown that we have seen in less than 24 hours between questions which were asked and answered last night by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the release of a media statement today by ASIC. Senators will recall that the Prime Minister, at one point in question time in answer to a question, put the view that a Telstra executive should talk up the interests of the company.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Thank you, Senator Brandis; I am sure you will have your turn shortly. We have been here on previous occasions speaking about the inappropriateness of the Prime Minister exhorting Telstra executives to do something which fairly arguably was contrary to their legal obligations, which were to act in good faith in the best interests of the company. Then last night, at the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, ASIC was discussing its investigation in relation to Telstra issues. As senators will be aware, there is an investigation by ASIC into various matters associated with Telstra, including an alleged failure by some persons not to disclose issues in a timely manner to the market. This is what was the subject of discussion at the joint committee. Senator Sherry asked:
Mr Lucy, have you checked to verify what the Prime Minister said in relation to this matter in question time?
Mr Lucy, the Chairman of ASIC, said:
All matters to do with this investigation are before us. We are looking at all areas, and at this stage we really cannot comment any further.
I then asked:
Do I infer from that that the answer given by the Prime Minister is a matter that is before you?
Mr Lucy then said:
Any matter that has been mentioned publicly in respect of this Telstra issue we will consider.
Senator Sherry asked:
Including this matter?
Mr Lucy confirmed that with:
Yes, including this matter.
It was absolutely clear, and it is clear if you look at the public record that the ASIC chairman confirmed that the Prime Minister’s statement was one of the issues before it in its investigation of the Telstra matters.
—That is a gross misrepresentation—that is absolutely disgraceful, and you know that.
—Senator Chapman alleges I am not telling the truth. There is a tabled document which I am sure you can refer to, Senator Chapman.
—I’ve got that document. I can read it too. It doesn’t read like that. Shame! You’re a disgrace!
—I will take that interjection. Do you know what is a disgrace, Senator Chapman? Senator Minchin representing the Treasurer in here refusing on two occasions to rule out that either the Prime Minister or his office, or the Treasurer or his office, made any contact with ASIC prior to this media statement going out—that is a disgrace, Senator Chapman. On two occasions he was asked. He could have ruled it out; he could have said: ‘We would not nobble ASIC. This is not an issue we would have spoken to ASIC about.’ He could have ruled it out so Australians could know that there has been no political interference in the corporate watchdog. Did he do that?
Opposition senators—No.
—He was given two opportunities and another question from Senator Sherry. On any occasion did Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer, rule out that there had been any political interference with ASIC prior to the statement being issued? No, he did not. What we do have is ASIC’s media release today which states as follows:
We are also considering public comments attributed to Telstra executives and Members of Parliament that were made leading up to our investigation.
However, ASIC then goes on to say:
I can categorically state that ASIC is not undertaking any investigation of the Prime Minister ...
Most reasonable observers would think there is a slight contradiction between those two statements. On the one hand we have ASIC saying, ‘We will look at public comments attributed to various people, including members of parliament, leading up to our investigation, but we’re not going to look at the Prime Minister; we won’t look at the Prime Minister,’ and on the other hand we have got ASIC saying categorically that there will be ‘no investigation of the Prime Minister’. The jury is out on this. On what basis can ASIC make that decision? There may be a reasonable basis.
—Because there was nothing to investigate.
—If there is nothing to investigate, why is it that the Prime Minister is ruled out but every other member of parliament is in? Why is that? Why is it that the Treasurer’s representative here in this chamber refused to rule out any interference, any contact or any discussion by the Prime Minister’s office and the Treasurer’s office prior to the ASIC statement being released today? Senator Minchin could have closed this down: he could have indicated quite clearly on the public record that no such contact had occurred. He chose not to do that. He chose not to do that at a time when it is clear that ASIC’s statement and its statements last night are quite clearly at odds. (Time expired)

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-09-14,"—What we have heard from the Labor Party today in question time and this debate really compounds the disgraceful misrepresentation on this issue that began with this article in the Australian newspaper this morning. I will read from the front page article:
In an extraordinary development late last night, the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Jeff Lucy, said he was investigating all public comments in relation to Telstra, including those made by John Howard.
It goes on to talk about ASIC already investigating whether Telstra executives had kept the market informed and so on. It has been inferred from this that ASIC is investigating the Prime Minister, which is absolute rubbish. That was never indicated last night nor has it been confirmed today in this debate. The article describes it as an ‘extraordinary development’. It certainly was not anything extraordinary. It is also presented as if it were an initiative taken by Mr Lucy, as if he made some public statement. In fact, it was a comment made by Mr Lucy in response to questions asked at the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services hearing last night into its half yearly oversight of ASIC’s activities. It was not an initiative taken by ASIC in the way it was beaten up to suggest that in the article.
—We didn’t write the article.
—No, you are just compounding the felony, Senator Wong and Senator Sherry. In fact what happened in the meeting last night was that a question was asked by Senator Sherry. He asked:
... are you aware of the comments made by the Prime Minister in parliamentary question time about talking up the share price?
Mr Lucy said:
I read them.
My colleague Senator Brandis took a point of order and said:
... that is a false statement. The Prime Minister did not use the expression ‘talking up the share price’.
Senator Wong interjected and said:
It was: ‘talking up the interests of the company’.
Senator Brandis said:
He used the expression ‘talking up the interests of the company’, which is quite a different thing.
Then Senator Sherry asked:
Mr Lucy, have you checked to verify what the Prime Minister said in relation to this matter in question time?
Mr Lucy said:
All matters to do with this investigation are before us. We are looking at all areas, and at this stage we really cannot comment any further.
He then confirmed that that matter was included. So in fact ASIC was looking to verify what the Prime Minister said—whether in fact it was, as Senator Wong herself said, merely to say that Telstra should be talking up the interests of the company rather than, as had been misrepresented, talking up the share price of the company. That is the only matter that was relevant to this issue regarding the Prime Minister.
There is absolutely no investigation of the Prime Minister whatsoever. That was confirmed by what was said last night and, of course, is reconfirmed by the press release put out by ASIC this morning, which simply reinforces the fact that it is those statements that are being looked at to confirm whether the Prime Minister said what we know he said or whether it is as the media has beaten it up. This is a complete beat-up and a complete misrepresentation of the situation regarding the Prime Minister.
It has also been raised as to whether the Treasurer made contact with ASIC this morning. Of course he has made contact. He has acknowledged that he made contact because he knows very well the way the Labor Party operate in this place, the way they beat things up and misrepresent things in an attempt to damage individuals and the government. He contacted ASIC to determine what had happened last night from their point of view. As has happened in this chamber and the other chamber, he expected the issue to be raised and he expected questions to be asked, so he needed to be briefed on exactly what had happened so that he could confirm the veracity of what happened, as I have today. There is absolutely nothing in what happened last night.
I am sure Senator Brandis, who was also present at the committee last night, will subsequently confirm that absolutely nothing that happened last night suggests in any way that the Prime Minister was being investigated with regard to these Telstra issues. The only thing that ASIC was looking at was to confirm that the Prime Minister had said that Telstra should be talking up the interests of the company. The issue raised by the Labor Party today is a complete beat-up. It shows the depths to which they will sink to try to do damage to the government and the individuals in the government. It has absolutely no substantiation and it simply does not stand—
—It doesn’t stand scrutiny.
—Thank you, Senator Brandis. It is based on this dreadful beat-up in the media which completely misrepresents the circumstances of last night. It tries to create an impression that there has been some dramatic announcement by Mr Lucy on behalf of ASIC when all Mr Lucy was doing was responding to a question from the Labor Party in a committee. There is absolutely no reference to the committee hearing in this article whatsoever. It is a complete misrepresentation. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,8,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-09-14,"—What I find most interesting about Senator Chapman’s contribution is that he has confirmed that the Treasurer’s office or the Treasurer himself—that point was not clear—has made contact with ASIC this morning. Firstly, it would be interesting to know where Senator Chapman got that information from, but I do take it that he is telling the truth and that he has confirmed with the Treasurer’s office as to whether they, or indeed the Treasurer himself, have spoken to ASIC—and presumably to Mr Lucy—this morning after last night’s hearing. It is interesting that Senator Chapman knows this. It begs the question why, when my colleague Senator Wong directly asked the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer, whether anyone from the Prime Minister’s office or the Treasurer’s office had contacted Mr Lucy this morning, Senator Minchin evaded the question. He did not answer the question at all. Yet Senator Chapman has owned up and said that, yes, the Treasurer’s office did contact Mr Lucy this morning.
It is not surprising, frankly, given the revelations at the committee hearing last night when Mr Lucy was being questioned by not just Labor senators, I might say, but my colleagues opposite in respect of the investigation into Telstra. If you look at the transcript of last night, Mr Lucy made it clear that the Prime Minister was one of those being investigated in respect of this whole Telstra saga. The Prime Minister himself, Mr Howard—quite understandably, frankly, if we reflect a little bit on the history and background of what has been going on in respect of Telstra’s privatisation—is going to be checked out by ASIC, according to Mr Lucy last night.
Why is this occurring? Let us look at what has happened with respect to the Telstra share price and the government’s privatisation proposals for Telstra. This is a government in panic, in large part because the share price of Telstra has declined significantly. When T2 came onto the market the share price was around $7.40. The share price for privatisation in the budget is $5.25, and the government wants to raise some $30 billion dollars by privatising Telstra. Where is the share price today? It is around the low $4 mark. Why is it down there? In part because of the secret report that was released about the poor condition of Telstra; in part because of the comments by Telstra executives that the dividends cannot be maintained. There is a series of reasons why the Telstra share price has declined dramatically.
What does the government want to do? The government, because it wants to sell Telstra, wants to get that price back up again. It wants to get it back up at least to $5.25, because that is the figure in the budget that is needed to get that $30 billion. But the share price is significantly below $5.25. The government wants to get the share price back up because it wants to at least try and get it closer to the $7.40 that the T2 shareholders paid. The T2 shareholders, who paid around $7.40, are in a very difficult position. At this stage the share price has dropped to the low $4 mark and the future prospect for dividends is not good, as Telstra itself has said.
That is why the government has got itself into a mess with respect to the privatisation of Telstra. It is desperate to talk up the price in preparation for privatisation. It is desperate to get the $30 billion that it has put in the forward projections of the budget based on a price of $5.25. And it is desperate because of the calls—my office is getting them and I am sure the office of every other member of parliament is getting them—from T2 purchasers who are very worried about what the government has been doing and the activity around the privatisation of Telstra. That is why the Prime Minister got himself into trouble when he went into parliament and said that Telstra executives should talk up the interests of the company—in other words, talk up the price.
—No, not in other words.
—That is what it is all about, Senator Brandis. You are in big trouble on Telstra because the price has declined dramatically. That is why Mr Lucy should be investigating not just Telstra executives but the Prime Minister. And who nobbled Mr Lucy? That is what we want to know. It is a sure bet that the Prime Minister’s office and the Treasurer’s office got onto him this morning and nobbled him. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-09-14,"—Those sorts of foolish, spurious allegations could only come from the bosom of a political culture as dysfunctional, dishonest and disgusting as the Australian Labor Party. As Mr Mark Latham, their former leader, is desperate to tell us and will tell us in his memoirs to be published this weekend, it is a party unfit to govern and beyond repair. And what more would you expect when senior politicians, frontbench politicians, of the Australian Labor Party such as Senator Wong and Senator Sherry, both of whom should know better, come into this chamber and make ridiculous, ludicrous, dishonest statements?
I was at the hearing last night and I will tell you precisely what happened. What Senator Wong and Senator Sherry have not told you is that Mr Lucy was asked and prompted again and again by the Labor senators present to say that there had been some political interference in relation to the Telstra matter, in relation to the Vizard matter and in relation to ASIC’s ongoing investigations. Notwithstanding the fact that time and again Senator Wong and Senator Sherry tried to get Mr Lucy to concede that there had been some measure of political interference, Mr Lucy could not have been more emphatic and unambiguous and categorical—
—And honest.
—And honest, Senator Chapman; quite right—in saying there has not been any political intervention by or on behalf of any politician in these investigations whatsoever. That was Mr Lucy’s emphatic, unambiguous evidence, which has been misrepresented in a disgraceful fashion this afternoon. And Mr Lucy agreed with me when I said to him: ‘Would any suggestion, Mr Lucy, that there has been intervention by or on behalf of any politician in relation to these matters be either ignorant or dishonest?’ Mr Lucy said yes. Any suggestion that there has been political intervention in this investigation, according to the Chairman of ASIC, is either ignorant or dishonest. That is what Mr Lucy said. When the full transcript is available—because we have had selective quotation so far—it will be there for all to see.
What happened last night in the relevant piece of the evidence? It started with Senator Sherry misquoting what the Prime Minister had said in the House of Representatives on Tuesday last week. Senator Sherry put it to Mr Lucy that the Prime Minister had said that executives of Telstra should talk up the share price. I took a point of order and, referring to the Hansard, which was open on the laptop internet of the secretary of the committee, read what the Prime Minister in fact said, which was that executives of the company should talk up the interests of the company, not talk them down. Any honest person who read what the Prime Minister said in the House of Representatives on Tuesday of last week—that the senior executives of the company should talk up the interests of the company, not talk them down—would have found that remark utterly unexceptionable and indeed merely a layman’s rendering of the statutory duty of senior officers of corporations under the provisions of the Corporations Act.
Senator Sherry, having relented from misquoting the Prime Minister and given Mr Lucy the accurate quote, then said:

Senator SHERRY—Mr Lucy, have you checked to verify what the Prime Minister said in relation to this matter in question time?

Mr Lucy—All matters to do with this investigation are before us. We are looking at all areas, and at this stage we really cannot comment any further.

Senator WONG—Do I infer from that that the answer given by the Prime Minister is a matter that is before you?

Mr Lucy—Any matter that has been mentioned publicly in respect of this Telstra issue we will consider.

Senator SHERRY—Including this matter?

Mr Lucy—Yes, including this matter.
It is a long stretch from saying that a matter, any matter, that has been put on the public record is before ASIC in an investigation to saying ASIC has announced an investigation into the Prime Minister. But that is the lie that was bruited about by the Australian Labor Party last night. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-09-14,"—This is a fine mess that we seem to have got ourselves into. Whilst it would seem that Senator Brandis accepts the transcript that was alluded to by Senator Wong and Senator Sherry, what he neglects to quote is the press release that was put out by the Chairman of ASIC today that states:
Last evening, I advised the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services that the comments attributed to the Prime Minister regarding obligations of Telstra executives were included amongst those matters being considered.
The words from the horse’s mouth are that he advised the committee that they were included.
—You weren’t even there!
—So we can play semantics about interpreting the investigation and interrogation by the committee last evening—and you are correct that I was not there. We can play with semantics and we can have all that melodrama from Senator Brandis and Senator Chapman, but Mr Lucy himself says that he did advise the committee that the Prime Minister’s comments were included. So, if you do not like the press release that he put out, perhaps the Treasurer’s office needs to go and talk to him again and get him to put out a further statement.
How is it that the government has got itself into this mess? Most members of this chamber would remember that the Prime Minister’s comments about the obligations, according to him, on those in Telstra to talk up its value came hot on the heels of the comments of one of the famous three amigos, who said that he would not advise his mother to buy Telstra shares. That is how we have ended up in this position. We have one of the three amigos actually being honest with the mum and dad shareholders and saying that Telstra is in such a state at the moment that he would not even advise one of his nearest relatives to buy shares—a very open and honest approach. It was an approach that the government did not find to its liking, so the Prime Minister came out and said that he would prefer senior management of Telstra to talk up the value of Telstra, just like the likes of Rodney Adler talked up the value of HIH and FIA. We seem to have learnt none of the lessons we needed to learn from that royal commission and from various other investigations.
Why does the Prime Minister feel that the value of Telstra needs to be talked up? It is because in the budget papers, as Senator Sherry said earlier, the expected sale price is listed as in excess of $5 a share. Yet, as of last night when the market closed, the share price was trading at just above $4 a share. That is a marked difference—the difference of $1 that I am sure the government was counting on to pay for the slush fund that Senator Joyce is claiming all the credit for.
There is a very good reason that the market is extremely concerned about the ongoing financial return from Telstra. When you have a CEO warning about revenue falling because of the regulatory framework and the company borrowing money to pay dividends, of course the share price will fall. And an honest senior executive would therefore think that perhaps it was not advisable for significant members of his family to invest in that company at that point in time. With that situation, what has been the response of the majority shareholder—that is, until 6.30 pm this evening, the Australian people through their government? Simply put, it has been to suggest that the executives of the company should be talking up Telstra. These are irresponsible actions that should rightly be investigated by ASIC. In other words, the view of the government is, ‘Don’t highlight the potential or actual problems, just talk the company up. Talk the value up.’ It is an extraordinary way to behave for a majority shareholder or for someone who is acting on behalf of the majority shareholder. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2005-09-14,"—The issue that I would like to take up with the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts relates in particular to the dividends of Telstra. This issue, I am sure, is of particular concern to all of those small shareholders around Australia—the mum and dad shareholders—who have taken up Telstra shares in the last five or six years in particular. It was of great concern to me that, when the document was finally released, it was sent by the company secretary to the Stock Exchange. This indicated that the document was not originally intended for public release, but, once it got into the public arena, the company secretary then sent it to the Stock Exchange. What the document says is that Telstra is borrowing from reserves to pay dividends—more than $550 million in 2005 rising to more than $2.2 billion in 2006.
The Telstra board has already recognised that this kind of borrowing to pay dividends is not a sustainable policy or practice. The board is signalling very clearly that borrowing from reserves to pay dividends is not a sustainable practice and is presumably one that will not continue. It is clear that about $1.9 billion has been stripped out of Telstra in order to pay these dividends to make it look to the ordinary investor as though investing in Telstra in the long term is going to give you a reasonable return on your investment. Yet these documents that have come out have shown that, in fact, that is not the case. If this document had not come out, how were the small investors to know, other than if they had read the small print on the references to the Stock Exchange on Telstra’s future dividend policy—which, of course, did not spell out in anywhere near this detail the fact that dividends had been inflated, obviously in order to prepare for the sale and to make it look as if Telstra was a much better proposition than it actually is?
This letter to the Stock Exchange from the company secretary quotes Telstra’s chief financial officer as saying:
The final tranche of our three-year capital management program will be executed based on the flexibility of our balance sheet going forward. To ensure all shareholders are treated fairly we will continually monitor this as the regulatory and the T3 environment unfolds over the next little while.
This letter is dated 7 September. It goes on to say:
In terms of the dividend policy, the dividend guidance that we gave in the last meeting still holds. Obviously we will always as a board reassess if there is a material change in outlook going forward, but at this point in time we are not changing our guidance from August 11.
I ask the minister: in terms of the dividend outlook as a result of the sale of Telstra, what can she tell me about the guidance that Telstra has already given the Stock Exchange? They obviously want a very different regulatory environment from the one that the minister and the government are going to impose on Telstra. What impact will the government’s regulatory environment and the current legislation have on the likely dividends that Telstra will be able to pay once it is privatised? Once it is privatised, the board of directors is not going to engage in an unsustainable policy or practice—that is, borrowing from reserves to inflate the dividends that are given to shareholders. We already know that the small mum and dad shareholders lost a great deal when Telstra 2 went through, because they were led to believe, in the prospectus, that the shares were worth $7.80. Of course, they were worth half of that, as the market reflected over time.
I am concerned about this whole issue of the government talking up the sale and working with the board to give dividends that could not be justified in terms of operating profit and so on. What does it actually mean for the small mum and dad shareholders of Australia who might be tempted to buy Telstra shares on the basis of the returns over the last few years? Maybe they are not recognising that those returns were in fact unsustainable. Will the minister guarantee dividends into the future of the same percentage value, if you like, as have occurred in the last couple of years or will the minister admit to the people of Australia that the dividends of Telstra in the last few years are not likely to be repeated once it is privatised? I would really appreciate the advice the minister has on the dividend policy of Telstra. This advice I have is dated 7 September. What is your advice now, knowing what you know from the Telstra board? In terms of the regulatory environment, what is likely to be the outcome for dividends?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—Senator Milne seems to have a few concepts confused. The competitive regime and the operational separation regime, to my knowledge, do not have much to do with the dividend policy set by Telstra. Also, Senator Milne would be aware, as indeed anybody listening to the debate would be aware, that the government does not run Telstra. The government does not set the dividend policy for Telstra, and the government will not have an impact on the setting of the dividend policy going forward. It is regrettable that Senator Milne seems to have swallowed some of the misrepresentation and scuttlebutt that was in the media and, indeed, in this place last year.
Let me put on the record what the dividend policy is so that there can be no confusion about what Telstra’s position is in relation to its dividend policy and the fact that it has been public knowledge for some considerable time. The company’s constitution clearly provides that the setting of dividends is the company’s responsibility, not the government’s responsibility. The Telstra board and management, not the government, are responsible for the day-to-day management of the commercial operations of the company. Telstra has been an independent company since 1991, when it was a corporatised by Mr Beazley, and its board is responsible for the dividend policy. In June 2004, the Telstra board announced its capital management policy, stating that it was its policy to declare ordinary dividends of around 80 per cent of normal profits after tax and, in addition, the board expected to return $1.5 billion a year to shareholders through special dividends and share buybacks over the following three years. These were initiatives of the board, not the government, and reflected the board’s judgment on the most effective use of the company’s resources in the interests of all shareholders.
The government was consulted about the plan after it had been considered by the board. The government does not direct the company on the level of dividends. I am advised—and, indeed, it is common knowledge—that there are many examples where companies pay dividends that are higher than their reported profit in a particular year and so they are paid out of reserves or borrowings. My information is—and I have said this in the chamber before—that 14 of our top 100 companies are currently adopting this policy, paying dividends that exceed their latest reported annual earnings. The most well known of these would be Suncorp Metway, Alinta, Seven, Telecom New Zealand and PaperlinX.
The fact that Telstra was borrowing to pay special dividends was certainly not secret or concealed information that was simply provided to the government last month. Telstra announced last year that it would be borrowing to fund the capital management plan. At the press conference on 21 June 2004, when Telstra announced its capital management plan, Telstra chief financial officer John Stanhope said:
We will need to borrow some new money shortly to provide for the 04-05 return of capital, that new borrowing is probably going to be around $1 billion, after that I can’t comment because it will be a borrowing program over the period of the plan.
This plan received a large amount of coverage in the media. Indeed, it was noticed by Labor’s Mr Tanner, who put out a very interesting press release headed ‘Telstra gets it right’. The opening paragraph in Mr Tanner’s press release stated:
Labor welcomes today’s announcement to the Stock Exchange by Telstra that it will focus on its existing businesses and return money to shareholders.
So what the Labor Party claimed last week and has been claiming was a Telstra secret plan was in fact, for Senator Milne’s information, publicly announced a year ago—and, not only that, the Labor Party came out and welcomed it. What we have got is Mr Tanner welcoming Telstra paying higher dividends and Senator Conroy spending last week criticising the very fact of these higher dividends. Labor does not know if it is coming or going on this one, Senator Milne.
On 21 June 2004 the capital management plan announcement was followed by a large amount of media. The Age had a front story headed ‘Telstra to give back $4.5bn’. It read:
Telstra’s chief financial officer, John Stanhope, said he expected Telstra to borrow around $1 billion to provide for the return of capital ...
On 23 June 2004 Telstra issued a media release headed ‘Telstra announces international debt investor roadshow’, which read:
Telstra today announced plans to conduct an international debt investor roadshow in Europe from 2-6 July. This follows Telstra’s capital management announcement to the market ...
Indeed, it was such a secret plan to borrow to pay dividends that Telstra did a five-day promotional tour of Europe about it. Another example of Telstra’s disclosure occurred on 11 August 2005—the day ministers had the meeting with Telstra in the afternoon. Telstra had released its annual results in the morning. The directors report released that morning stated:
Net borrowing costs increased by 3.4% to $736 million in fiscal 2005, primarily due to increased borrowings to fund the purchase of our recently acquired entities, increased levels of capital expenditure, the payment of dividends and the share buy-back.
The company has made it clear to all investors, including small investors, that the current capital management policy applied for three years. The capital management policy announced in 2004 explicitly applied to three financial years only—2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07—after which the dividend payout ratio would be at 80 per cent. So there can be no suggestion that the government has misled investors into believing that a dividend payout ratio of over 100 per cent would continue past 2007. It has been a completely false assertion that on 11 August, and in the 11 August briefing document, the government was first advised that the company had changed its dividend policy. This is completely false.
The company did not announce that it had changed its policy. It is still delivering on the three-year capital management plan. As part of its annual result announcement on the morning the company stated:
As part of the previously announced three-year, $1.5 billion per year capital management program, the Board has also declared a fully franked special dividend of 6 cents per share, to be paid in conjunction with the final ordinary dividend. It is the current intention of the Board to pay a further 6 cents per share special dividend with the 2005/2006 interim dividend
This is all very much on the record and there is nothing there saying that the policy to sustain this three-year plan to pay higher dividends has been changed. But the critical part of this answer for Senator Milne’s purposes is that what happens in the future is a matter for Telstra. As far as its dividends policy goes, it is certainly not a matter for government.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech

I think the words you used were ‘affordable broadband’. That is not quite the same, though, as a guarantee from the government with regard to future pricing parity for broadband services. You understand that that is a substantive difference. The NFF believe they have received a commitment from the government, so I am seeking, in the very limited time available to us, to clarify what it is the government has said to the NFF. I am hoping that you, as the minister with carriage of this, can give us some clarity. Otherwise the NFF are going to discover that they have misunderstood the government’s position.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—I really think that it is a difference of emphasis. Certainly the outcome is very much the same. I think it does not really matter much to the National Farmers Federation how they deliver decent services, be they phone or broadband services, to their constituents in rural and regional Australia. I, as the minister, have made it very clear what our commitment has been, not only to the NFF but more broadly, although I acknowledge the NFF have worked constructively through these issues. I, for one, am very pleased not only for the NFF but for people living in rural and regional Australia. This government can stand on its extremely proud—in fact, unparalleled—record of acknowledging, where people otherwise would not be able to get these kinds of services, that not only can they get services, so they have access to services, but they are affordable because of the government’s subsidies. I am quite sure that that is how the statement that you have read out can be construed and I feel very comfortable that everyone is clear about what is being delivered, not only in terms of pricing parity but also in terms of the package that delivers broadband.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I understand and accept the point that you make, and I think I do fully understand it. HiBIS does delivers a subsidy to broadband users, but the subsidy is not the same as a guarantee from the government of future pricing parity for broadband services. I just want to be clear: you have not given the NFF a guarantee for future pricing parity for broadband. They have the HiBIS system, which delivers—but ‘in a different way’ is your argument—but there is no guarantee about future pricing parity.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—I can appreciate how you are trying to pin down why it is different, but it is not. HiBIS does deliver broadband parity; that is exactly what it does. And the NFF knows that absolute parity for broadband, for instance, is impossible, since there are so many packages and technologies that deliver it. It is absolute nonsense to be trying to deliver exactly the same kind of parity that you do for line rentals—
—Different kinds of parity.
—There are different kinds of parity. But it is a guarantee that this funding will flow. To be perfectly fair to the NFF, I think they are entitled to have said what they said. I think that makes perfect sense and it is consistent with the fact that HiBIS also delivers parity. Because you have a different product with different technologies, different mixes and different amounts that people want, or whatever they can eat in a broadband sense, obviously you have got to deliver it through a different mechanism, but their claim is correct.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-09-14,"—I want to bring the minister back to the question I asked before lunchtime about the $2 billion fund that is alleged to be there to ensure that maintenance of rural and regional areas will be maintained for telecommunications into the future. The question I asked the minister was, ‘How much, on a per annum basis, would be coming from that $2 billion in the coming year, in 10 years from now and in 50 years from now, to ensure that those services are being maintained?’ Let me make it clear that the mere idea that $2 billion is going to make up for the 14 per cent of services we know are failing at the moment is ridiculous because Telstra’s own information is that you need $2 billion to $3 billion to have been invested in by now just to catch up on the standards that are expected. The government is not going to insist on that. The government is saying there is a $2 billion fund and the interest from that will be available for the maintenance of all services, including for the 14 per cent of failed services that already exist. That is not going to happen. I think the committee and the public deserve to know how much is going to come out of that fund—that Senator Joyce and his Nationals colleagues have voted for—to have a go at fixing up a proportion of services. We know it is not going to fix up anything like all or even half of the failing services, but how much will that fund provide to have a go at fixing up some things for rural and regional services while the massive money gets poured into the big end of town and the big cities?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—It is extraordinary the way Senator Brown, in particular, and certainly some Labor senators and others, pick out the bit of information that suits them and then try to assert it as fact. Senator Brown’s question seems to be premised on Telstra’s information that they used to try to stump up in excess of $2 billion from the government for the roll-out of their proposed new broadband network, which is not consistent with information that Telstra gave to the regulator. Everyone gets to see the number of telephone faults that occur in this country, and everyone can see how quickly they are repaired, because this government has put in place a consumer framework to provide that information.
I think it is very important for those who want to participate in a telecommunications debate that they have a basic understanding of how this gets reported. It is very important not to misrepresent technical network data simply because it might suit the basis of some political argument. The 14.3 million calls about faults quoted in the Telstra document certainly does not seem to correlate with the information that Telstra has provided to the regulator, ACMA. It is up to Telstra to explain this discrepancy. I have written to them about that to reconcile the apparent discrepancy. Telstra publicly reports monthly on the percentage of services which were fault free and those numbers are monitored by ACMA. Telstra cited these figures when announcing its annual results on the same day that this other document was presented to the government as evidence that customer service performance continued at a high level across Australia. That is what they said in the morning. These numbers are publicly available on Telstra’s web site and show that, on a national average, more than 99 per cent of services were fault free in July 2005. The regulator, ACMA, publicly releases information every three months on fault repair and reports annually on actual numbers of faults.
Our focus is on providing all Australians with reliable, high-quality services. That is a reasonable objective and it is a reasonable expectation that Australians have. We achieve this by setting tough regulatory arrangements, including the USO, the customer service guarantee, the network reliability framework and, of course, price controls. The latest fault repair time performance figures show that 91 per cent of telephone faults were repaired within the customer service guarantee time frames in the last quarter. That is three percentage points higher than for the same quarter in 2004. To give Senator Brown an idea of just how much Telstra’s performance has improved in recent years, according to Telstra’s figures which are public and checked, back in 1998 when the Howard government introduced the customer service guarantee Telstra was repairing just 70 per cent of telephone faults on time. It is now up to more than 90 per cent, and the government has just delivered a package of strengthened consumer protection measures, including further improvements to the customer service guarantee and the network reliability framework designed to achieve greater repair response times.
The facts are that telephone faults inevitably occur, but when they do they are fixed quickly in accordance with the customer service guarantee. It is an interesting statistic for the Senate that, on average, a phone service will have a fault once in seven or eight years. Just picking up on Senator Brown’s question, it is very interesting that service standards, at least under this government, have remarkably and markedly improved. Subject to getting some explanation as to the reason for the discrepancy, I simply do not accept the fact that the faults that were referred to as part of Telstra’s advocacy to government are necessarily consistent. It may be that they are measuring something differently, using a different metric, and I am very interested in the answer to that.
Getting back to the other part of Senator Brown’s question, obviously the $2 billion will be available on the assent of these bills and will be deposited in a term deposit from day one whilst an investment mandate is developed. You would certainly receive from day one, when it is constituted, not less than the cash rate. As Senator Brown would know—because we have talked about this absolutely ad nauseum—the proceeds will be available to respond to those issues that have been identified as particular needs in rural and regional Australia that require investment and remediation or whatever it might be. The independent telecommunications inquiry that will be held every three years will identify how the interest on the deposit is to be paid. When I say that that is what will happen from day one, obviously there will be an investment mandate developed.
It is very interesting to note that, from my information, a very similar fund, the Queensland Investment Corporation, returns, I think, in the order of eight per cent. It would obviously be an objective that we put in place an investment mandate and investments that will ensure that the amount that is earned on the $2 billion will grow and be available for investment and use in response to the recommendations of the independent regional telecommunication inquiry.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2005-09-14,"—As a rural based Liberal senator for Western Australia, I would like to put on the record my appreciation to my fellow Liberal senators and members for the work they have done behind the scenes to ensure that rural, remote and regional Australia has adequate communications services.
—Stop abusing the committee process.
—Senator Conroy cannot have it both ways on regional communications. On the one hand, after visiting two rural centres with a committee, Senator Conroy claims he knows what rural Australia needs in terms of services but, on the other hand, he has been abusing anyone seeking to deliver those services.
—This is an abuse of the committee process.

(Senator Chapman)—Order, Senator Conroy.
—The government is chewing up the remaining, pitiful committee time that we have left.
—Order, Senator Conroy. All senators are entitled to the call during the committee stage of debate.
—This is a blatant misuse of the process.
—This is the first opportunity—
—No, it is not. You had Senator Ronaldson earlier.
—Order!
—Senator Conroy criticised government subsidies of satellite internet because, as far as Labor is concerned, if the copper wire does not reach your premises, tough luck. I would like to say to Senator Conroy that I happen to be one of those people who has been very fortunate—
—I don’t mind having a debate with you—just don’t do it in the committee stage.
—I am going to continue. As far as I am concerned, the HiBIS satellite subsidy, which in Western Australia has been taken up—
—I will see you on the adjournment later tonight, if you like. Stop wasting the time that you voted could be limited.
—Senator Conroy criticised government subsidies of satellite internet because, as far as Labor is concerned, if the copper wire does not reach your premises, tough luck.
—You are filibustering on your own gag. It is a disgrace.
—I am just trying to explain how lucky I am and how lucky my fellow colleagues throughout rural and remote Australia are.
—Do it in the adjournment or stand up in the debate.
—Senator Conroy, you know very well that all senators are entitled to contribute during the committee stage of a bill. We are dealing with the motion that the bill stand as printed. I call Senator Adams.
—Thank you. The 9,000 Australians in more rural and remote areas who enjoy satellite broadband would be abandoned if Senator Conroy had his way. So where does Senator Conroy actually stand on these issues? He does not want the government spending money on regional telecommunications but he says that they need to improve. He continually says that the government cannot sell Telstra because the phone company will leave town as fast as the banks did, but it was his own party that sold the bank. Senator Conroy said:
Given half a chance, a privatised Telstra would leave town quicker than the banks.
A bank left our town but we were rather fortunate that we had two banks that decided to stay.
What Senator Conroy fails to understand is that this government has a range of protections in place for rural and regional Australia. We have a customer service guarantee, a universal service obligation, a local presence plan and targeted funding for where the market will go. If Senator Conroy is concerned that proper protections were not in place when the Commonwealth Bank was privatised, perhaps he had better cast his mind back to those—
—On a point of order: Mr Temporary Chairman, I was just wondering if you could explain how the Commonwealth Bank has anything to do with the telco bill and whether you would like to bring her back to the actual committee stage.
Government senators interjecting—
—No, she has about 10 pages there that she is planning on reading. This is a filibuster inside your own gag, and it is a disgrace.
—Senator Conroy, you have raised a point of order. Let me rule on the point of order. Senator Adams is addressing the issue of the privatisation of Telstra, and the Commonwealth Bank was also a Commonwealth business enterprise that was privatised. I am sure that Senator Adams will be mindful of the need to make her remarks relevant to the legislation. I call Senator Adams.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is about the opportunity that you took, Mr Temporary Chairman, to make a comment on this debate while trying to chair this debate.
—I made no comment, Senator Lundy.
—You should check the Hansard.
—I made a ruling.
—No, you made some commentary first.
—I made a comment to the effect that all senators are entitled—
—You made a contribution on the debate from the chair and I think that is out of order.
—I made no contribution to the debate. I call Senator Adams.
—I will now quote from my first speech, which I delivered in the first week of the parliament. In my first speech, I said:
It is essential that the regulations set down for the privatisation of Telstra allow for rural and remote Australians to be given access to new communications technology. Australia’s wealth is created in regional, rural and remote areas, and it is important that business opportunities are not lost due to inadequate communication services.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I understand there is a standing order to do with tedious repetition—like reading out your own speech.
—I call Senator Adams. There is no point of order.
—I have experienced first hand the improvement of telecommunications services in rural and remote Australia and I want to be guaranteed that it will continue. The reason I read my speech was to be able to say to my constituents in rural and remote Australia that I have been given that guarantee. I was fortunate enough to sit on the inquiry on Friday. I have been fully informed and I am very satisfied as to where I am going. I have also today received emails about the integrity I said I would use to make informed decisions in this place. I feel I have done that and I fully support the bill.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-09-14,"—The difficulty here is that Kojonup is not being well served by Senator Adams. The problem here is that she is using a false analogy. Telecommunications services are improving in the Congo from a very low base. They are improving right around the world. The problem is that we are not getting the services that are equal to those elsewhere in comparable countries in the world and the statistics show that.
I want to go back to the minister and this fund. She has now effectively shown that there is going to be less than $160 million a year out of this fund available for the catch-up and the patch-up of the telecommunications system. It is patently short of the mark. Senator Joyce is back in the chamber. There is a $2 billion catch-up—that is Telstra’s own assessment to start off with—and with this $160 million, and it is going to be less than that, it is going to take decades to catch up the shortfall as at 2005. Then there is a whole suite of other things that Telstra will have failed to deliver. The minister gave us some figures on the complaints about faulty service that were not answered within the prescribed period. Let us hear the figures for the bush. You know that it is loaded in the bush as against the CBDs, where the fix-up rate is much higher. It is a use of figures which does not reflect the situation in rural and regional Australia.
What we do know today, what is manifestly obvious here—and this is the answer to the question that Senator Joyce should have asked but did not—is that $160 million per annum maximum will be available over the coming years to fix up a system that needs $2 billion up front to bring it up to scratch. It is not going to work. The money is not there. It is a failed prescription. Senator Joyce knows that and the National Party know that. But they have been heavied into accepting this failure under threat and coercion. The whole party has. The big wigs in the National Farmers’ Federation, the millionaires, came out yesterday.
I ask the minister to look at the figures for the people who have been forced off family farms during the Howard period if she wants to look at statistics, and add those to the mix that we are dealing with today. What a sell-out this is. What a failure this is. Surely somebody on the government side over there looked at these figures, which you now give the Senate in answer to a question from the Greens, and saw that they were manifestly inadequate.
Beyond that there is no guarantee that that $2 billion will not be dismantled in the next budget or the budget after. There is no guarantee on that money at all. We know that it is not going to get bigger. We know that in a decade or two down the line it is not going to matter a twinkle to the growing disparity between what the bush and the big end of town get in telecommunications and the servicing of telecommunications. This is a failure to defend the bush by the National Party and by those Liberals who live there, like Senator Adams, who should have had this defined and set in place now. It is not defined and it is not set in place and the sharks are circling—the sharks who are going to make money out of this are circling to rip apart—
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Chapman)—Order! Senator McGauran, interjections are disorderly. Likewise, Senator Conroy, interjections are disorderly.
—Finally, a family impact statement—Family First is missing in action. It is a flop, isn’t it? Senator Fielding came in here as the representative of family impact statements. Today he voted against a family impact statement being asked for before the final debate. Family First voted against having a family impact statement on this massive bill that affects every family in the country—end of Family First; end of its mission statement. Total failure! Flop! The minister says: ‘There was a statement. It was brought into cabinet and you cannot see it, people of Australia.’ I notice that the Treasurer said that he had not seen it either. I simply do not believe her. I do not believe the Prime Minister.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—What is extraordinary about Senator Bob Brown’s recent contribution is, firstly, that he should be so gullible; secondly, that he can be so wrong; and, thirdly, that he has failed to inform himself by not turning up to the committee. Senator Conroy, to his credit, turned up to the committee; Senator Joyce, to his credit, turned up to the committee. Senator Bob Brown did not turn up to the committee, where he could have seriously tested some of these propositions with Telstra there as a witness. He could have tested the propositions with Telstra as to how good or bad their figures were.
Instead, what he has done is swallow the line about Telstra’s faults by looking at one set of information that Telstra has put out, instead of clarifying what metric they are using and instead of looking at ACMA’s response and report. The next thing he has done is swallow the line that Telstra has been underinvesting in its network, without having a clue as to what he is talking about and without having a clue as to what money is available.
It is pretty obvious when you look at the capital expenditure that is available for this year—which I notice Senator Brown did not concede and probably does not know—Telstra told the market on the morning of 11 August that for 2005-06 it would be around $4 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2004-05. The Telstra management identified areas where it thought Telstra had underinvested in relation to its pitch to government for a contribution of some $2.5 billion.
What is important to get very straight about this is that Telstra is responsible for investing in its own network. It is not the responsibility of the Australian taxpayer to invest in Telstra’s network. It is the responsibility of the Australian taxpayer, through the government, to look at where it is necessary—because there is market failure—for there to be subsidies to ensure that all Australians, irrespective of where they live, have an opportunity to have access to affordable and available services.
We know from the deregulation of telecommunications in 1997 that competition works extremely well. We know that because the economy is about $10 billion bigger and we have more than 100 telecommunications providers. We know that, where there are reasonable populations, competition will ensure that new services are available and bundles of products are available—all sorts of options and choices are available. That is very good for consumers. But we also know that, in areas where it is simply uncommercial for telecommunication providers to operate, it is appropriate—because we think it is important that people have decent telecommunication services—that there be subsidies provided.
Working back from that, instead of accepting what Telstra suggested—upgrading its network—the government prefers a competitively neutral and a technology neutral approach. We know that combinations of solutions deliver better outcomes than simply mandating one type of technology and supporting one telecommunications provider. Otherwise, as Senator Brown would appreciate if he thought about it for a moment, you would end up remonopolising the whole of Australia, and you would not get the same degree of benefits that competition would bring.
It is certainly not correct that there will be no investment in Telstra’s network. Telstra is responsible for investing in its own network. This government will continue to look at the needs of rural and regional Australia, and the needs of those who otherwise would not get these benefits, through our targeted investment.
We know that, under the current design, Telstra gets the lion’s share of the HiBIS program money. It is certainly not correct to say that Telstra is simply limited by the investments in the $2 billion fund going forward. Obviously, Telstra will have a fair share because of its footprint across Australia and because Telstra is capable of delivering very good services. Telstra is a good company and it delivers very good services to a lot of people who otherwise would not have any. We know that they will have an opportunity to come up with these kinds of solutions—as they do now in rural and regional Australia—and to have access to the subsidies. The important point is that there seems to be some confusion here. People seem to think that somehow the taxpayer should be responsible for all of Telstra’s upgrades.
The final point is that whether or not there is underinvestment is a very moot point, with $4 billion, up from $3.6 billion, being available in 2005-06. My recommendation to Senator Brown is that if there is a committee in which you can find out this sort of information you should go to it. If you choose not to and you are going to ask me questions, please get your fundamental facts straight first.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-14,"—We now have 1¼ hours left for the consideration in detail of these five pieces of legislation. We are only on the first of those five pieces of legislation, although one is tempted to observe that perhaps the speeches to date have not gone terribly much to the specifics of the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005.
I remind the Senate and those following this debate that the Democrats have a range of amendments that go to some—only some—of the key flaws with this package of legislation. I am not naive enough to think that any of those are going to get passed in the current political environment. Clearly, the deal has been done, the brains have been switched off, all intelligent argument is now redundant and we can just do our finger pointing across the chamber and ignore what is in the interests of the public, who, one has to remind oneself occasionally when listening to debate here, we are meant to be serving in considering these issues. Nonetheless, there are amendments there and they go to improving some of the flaws with the legislation.
The amendments are to the second and third bills. At the rate we are going, we are obviously not going to get to the second and third bills. The logical place to raise those issues and seek a response from the government would be when we get to those bills—I could move the Democrats amendments then. Because of the guillotine and the way this debate—to use the term loosely—is occurring, that does not seem likely, so I will need to raise some of them here, even though that is less than ideal.
There are a few key points that need emphasising here. We have had some commentary throughout this debate in the last few days—which is all we have been allowed to have—about the bush and services to the bush. Senator Adams made a reasonable contribution before about her experience as a person who lives in rural Australia. The Democrats have been as strong as anybody about emphasising the importance of decent services to rural and regional Australia and the importance of actually taking some of the pressure off the cities by getting good quality infrastructure—including high-quality broad-band and other telecommunications services—to as much of regional and rural Australia as possible.
Just speaking personally for a minute as somebody who has lived their entire life in a range of different houses but never more than five kilometres from the GPO in Brisbane—so I suppose that counts me as an inner city person, although I do not drink lattes—there is ample evidence about massive failures in the delivery of decent quality telecommunications services, let alone at decent prices, to people in the capital cities—not just in the outer urban areas but in the middle or close to the middle of capital cities.
Whilst I am a supporter of good quality services to the bush, I do think that if we keep this blatant pork-barrelling mentality without proper equality—in a sense, it has been over the top with regard to value for money or even how best it can be delivered—there is a real risk of getting a divide going. There are millions of people in the cities who are getting appalling services from Telstra. The way the regulatory regime is currently structured—and it is not going to improve under this legislation—they are going to continue to get bad service. If you have people living in the middle of cities continually being told that there are billions of dollars—even though it is not true—going to rural areas when the services are appalling in the cities, I think you run a real risk of some resentment developing between the city areas and the country areas.
I would ask people who like to push the rural pork-barrelling approach to think of that because there is undoubtedly a growing concern amongst many in the Australian community that there are endless buckets of money being poured into various areas and various industries to prop them up for political purposes whilst other businesses, other communities and other industries in city areas are getting nothing. That is a recipe for a divided community, let alone an economically inefficient approach, and it is one that is at risk of being exacerbated by the approach here. The Democrats support the attempt to establish a regional review committee to assess how things operate over the coming few years but I do not see why it should be regional only. I do have a concern that it tilts attention even further away from addressing some of the very real, very serious problems that exist in the cities.
I would like to also mention the issue of operational separation. Perhaps if the minister has an opportunity she will respond to this. I note she clarified or corrected the answer that she gave in question time today about the ACCC and that she has actually received correspondence from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission relating to certain aspects of operational separation. I note that she also said at the time that she is still not proposing to release the letter but I do think it is incumbent on the minister that before the Senate votes on something like this we get an indication of just what the concerns of the ACCC are, what issues they are raising and how serious those concerns are so that we can have more of an informed vote. The minister said that the ACCC have said that operational separation is a ‘workable model’. That does not really seem to gel with the evidence they gave at the Senate committee last week.
Before I get fingers pointing at me and am asked why I was not there, I admit I was not there. Actually, I was there; I was at the back of the room occasionally. But Senator Allison from the Democrats was there and she was doing a good job on our behalf so I did not feel the need to cramp her style by adding my presence, although I certainly followed the proceedings. We only got six minutes per witness, so it was pretty difficult for her to make a telling contribution. But she was there and certainly she did work effectively at getting some of the information out.
One of the pieces of information that came out included the views of Mr Samuel about the operational separation model. It was actually in response to a question from Senator Brandis, who also was there. He probably got a few minutes per witness as well. He asked Mr Samuel whether or not the ACCC was satisfied with the government’s operational separation model. According to the Democrat’s minority report in the committee report, Mr Samuel said:
... there are about five outstanding issues that need to be developed. It would depend on the satisfactory development of those issues, which are quite significant issues, including compliance, investigatory powers and the like, before I could give an opinion on that.
That seems to me a pretty clear indication from the ACCC—which, remember, actually has to try to oversee Telstra’s performance in the telecommunications market—that there are significant outstanding issues about the government’s operational separation model. I know the way the government have worded this legislation—they have this blank cheque to give themselves until the end of time to sort things out—but I do think it is appropriate, particularly given that the minister has confirmed that she has correspondence from the ACCC, to at least inform the Senate prior to this vote about the nature of those concerns and how serious they are, because I believe that will be a key issue into the future.
The other aspect that has to be emphasised with operational separation is that there will be a plan put forward as to how this is going to operate. If we look at who is going to write that plan, it will be Telstra. If we look at what the obligations are with regard to that plan, it is quite clear that the minister may or may not decide to give Telstra a direction requiring it to submit a draft rectification plan if it is seen to be operating in a way that is at variance with the operational separation plan, once it is finalised. The key question that I think needs to be asked is: if Telstra contravenes the final plan, when that is finally done and which will probably take many years, will the minister give a guarantee that the government will give a direction to Telstra requiring it to rectify its actions?
Our view is that, in any case, it is an inadequate process because there is still a whole range of steps, draft rectification plans, before a final rectification plan, giving Telstra plenty of time in the meantime to wriggle their way out of things. It does not even seem clear whether or not it is automatically an obligation of the minister of the day under the law to make Telstra do anything about it if they do contravene that plan. I would appreciate it if the minister could, firstly, give more detail about the ACCC’s concerns and, secondly, say whether or not there will be a definite requirement on the minister and future ministers to act under the law if Telstra do contravene the operational separation plan.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—Firstly, I want to commend Senator Bartlett on stepping into the breach in his leader’s absence. It is an absolute mystery that Senator Allison, who is not only the leader of the Democrats but also the Democrats spokesperson—
—We are feeling smug today, aren’t we?
—Not at all. I am just interested because Senator Allison seems to have always taken such a close interest in these matters, yet Senator Bartlett has valiantly stepped into the breach. I think that should be commended. In fact, he has put forward a good argument about a number of matters and I am going to do my very best to give Senator Bartlett some answers that he can take to Senator Allison to show her how well he did.
The first point, broadly, that he raised was his concern that metropolitan areas not be left behind in the acknowledged emphasis that this government put on providing services to rural and regional Australia, for the very simple reason that that is the area where there is most need. Quite simply, it makes a big difference to how you live, work and do business if you have decent communications in rural and regional Australia. Whilst it is extremely important right throughout Australia that people have good services, from having travelled extensively around Australia I know that if people do not have those services in more remote areas it really can be a matter of life and death. The government make no apology for the fact that we think it is important that we address the market failure areas; of course, both numerically and geographically, rural and regional Australia is where the greatest preponderance of those areas are.
That is not to say that there are not some bad spots, some black spots, in metropolitan areas. But I am happy to inform the Senate that as competition develops they are certainly disappearing. Two years ago, around 900,000 households in metro areas could not access a terrestrial broadband service. I am happy to tell the Senate that that number has dropped to just 200,000, and it will continue to drop. Commercial solutions are the reason that metropolitan broadband black spots are disappearing. Telstra has invested hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading its copper network to make it ADSL enabled, and wireless broadband is now available in metro areas as an alternative solution for people who cannot get ADSL. In the next couple of months we are going to have excel enabled ADSL2 become available.
So for households that do not get a commercial solution—and we know that Telstra was prepared to invest, I think, $3.1 billion in this kind of broadband roll-out because, they said, it was commercial—the government has, as part of its Broadband Connect program, a $50 million metro Broadband Connect program. It will pay providers to connect people in that position to affordable broadband. Metro Broadband Connect will commence in January 2006. So there can be no suggestion that the government is either ignoring or not aware of issues in metropolitan Australia, because it has targeted assistance where broadband is simply not commercial. I am assuming that no-one in this Senate would support, where there is a commercial solution, doing the taxpayers’ dough on top of that. This government believes, and I would assume everyone on the other side of the chamber would support the government in this contention, that it is where there are areas of market failure that taxpayers’ dollars should be invested. That is the justification for it; you certainly cannot justify spending taxpayers’ dollars if there are viable commercial solutions providing what is required.
The other major point of Senator Bartlett’s contribution related to operational separation. About that I say that the government have developed a model that is workable and that will deliver benefits to all Australian consumers. The advantage of this particular model is that it does not unreasonably interfere in Telstra’s legitimate commercial operations. If it were to unreasonably interfere in Telstra’s commercial operations we would have a telecommunications company on our hands that simply would be unable to function.
The government’s approach to operational separation includes roles for both the minister and the ACCC. It has been developed in consultation with the ACCC—and of course my department and Telstra—over a number of months. The plan is the core component of the arrangements. The plan is under development—it still has to be developed—and this legislation puts in place the core framework. We believe it is appropriate that the minister determines what the plan should cover and approves the final plan. That is certainly not an unusual approach. It has, for example, been adopted in relation to development of the local presence plan. I have not heard anybody complaining bitterly about the fact that there is a ministerial role in the development of that. Also, the minister determines the requirements for the price control regime, and I have not heard anybody complain about that—probably because nobody realises that the minister has a role in all of these particular regulatory frameworks.
The ACCC will have a critical role to play in both implementing and enforcing operational separation. No minister is going to exercise their powers under these arrangements without taking advice. The ACCC is of course one of the key agencies that will be providing advice to government. I want to place on record that I appreciate the contribution the ACCC has made in the very constructive discussions that we have had so far. The ACCC will have the ultimate enforcement responsibility if Telstra is found to be breaching a rectification plan. It is my understanding that it is no secret that the ACCC has indicated in the past that it has concerns about the structural arrangements in the telecommunications industry but has walked away from requiring structural separation as such, as has the former opposition communications spokesman, Mr Tanner. I notice Mr Tanner is very complimentary about the government’s model.
—What?
—He is very complimentary about the government’s operational separation model. In fact, he tried to pinch it as his own idea, which I thought was very amusing. It is very flattering, I must say, that Mr Tanner is so enamoured of the operational separation model—
—Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. We are in a committee debate, which the government has guillotined so that we have less than an hour. The minister is now talking about opposition policies. We have five bills before us. We ought to be able to discuss those bills in the short time that the government has allowed us to do that.
 (Senator Kirk)—There is no point of order.
—It is abundantly clear that the Labor Party does support the fact that there needs to be operational separation. It is a plan that this government has developed. I can understand how those on the other side get a bit antsy about the fact that we have actually done it. You wimped out on not only operational separation; you wimped out on doing anything about Telstra. You corporatised it and left it stranded. You were not prepared to take the consequences. This government is finally liberating this telecommunications company from the yoke of government ownership to let it get on with providing decent services for Australians and to let it invest and grow.
At the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee hearing last Friday, the ACCC indicated that it had considered alternative models for operational separation. It also indicated that it believes there are a number of matters relating to operational separation that will need to be carefully addressed during the process of developing the operational separation plan. I agree with the ACCC. However, for the purposes of today’s debate, let me say that while the ACCC has expressed its views on operational separation—and I take those views very seriously—it has also publicly acknowledged that the model can work. The ACCC has said that the government’s proposed model for the operational separation of Telstra:
... maintained the balanced approach of the existing regulatory regime while recognising that Telstra is in a unique position through its local access network monopoly of being able to stifle innovation by frustrating its competitors’ investment plans.
For this reason, the ACCC welcomes changes which should increase transparency and equivalence in the way Telstra provides key access services to its own downstream operations relative to those of its competitors.
Clearly, we will work very closely with the ACCC in relation to issues that it has brought to us, as indeed we will on issues that have been brought to us from a number of other stakeholders, including Telstra. It is entirely appropriate, as we develop the operational separation plan, that we do so in consultation, that we take into account issues that have been raised and that we have an operational separation plan that has the intended objectives.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2005-09-14,"—I want to know if there is any reason at all why the current government ownership would be a predetermination for a better service than a fully privatised entity—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—No, I think this should be on the record. One of the key issues is what actually gets better services out to regional Australia. I cannot for the life of me think of one reason why the current ownership would get better—
—Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. I seriously implore the minister to respond. This is a question about the philosophical basis of ownership. It has nothing to do with the bills. You cannot filibuster in your own gag in the committee stage when you have given us one hour to go.
—On the point of order, with the greatest respect to Senator Conroy, there was a long discussion this morning about job losses. In light of that and a wide range of other topics that were discussed, Senator Joyce is totally within his rights to raise the matter that he is raising.
—There is no point of order.
—This is only going to be a short question, and really it does not require much of an answer. I just want to get it on the record. There is always the belief that because the government has sold Telstra it does not get a return from it. Of course it does; it gets 30 per cent of the tax profit, which is a huge return. So, if the company grows and becomes more prosperous, the potential further return from the company is immense. But I am interested to know whether there has been any scoping of what the sale price of the share might be in the future. I want to know that because a future Labor government might be in control of 51.8 per cent of the shares. Everybody needs to know whether Labor would rescind that, whether they would bring it back into public ownership. We need to know whether they would move that motion.
—You can’t ask the minister a question about Labor policy.
—I can’t answer it.
—Correct. He has asked you a question, Minister.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. Minister, are you answering?
—I am saying that I do not know what Labor’s policy is.
—The minister does not want to answer you, Senator Joyce.
—I am going to in due course.
—I am happy for the minister to take the call ahead of me to answer the question.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—I thank Senator Joyce for that very perceptive contribution, because what we have to look at when we look at telecommunications more broadly is: how can we deliver good services throughout rural and regional Australia? Back in 1997, this government set down a path of ensuring that there would be a competitive playing field that would actually deliver these services and would encourage competition to ensure that in populous areas competition would deliver the benefits that people need in choice and availability. That was the genesis of our looking at what we can do to ensure that we can actually deliver services in rural and regional Australia and non-commercial areas.
Part of deregulation was to sell Telstra, and the progressive sale of tranches of Telstra has meant that investments can be made into rural and regional areas that otherwise would be unlikely to be made—certainly in the magnitude that is being offered under this current package—if Telstra remained government owned. However, the most important thing that the government have often said inhibits us from being able to look across Australia at what services need to be rolled out to deliver competition is the fact that you cannot seriously regulate Telstra and own it. You simply cannot be the rules setter and the owner of the largest competitor in the paddock.
For all of those reasons, the government have said that, apart from the fact that it is not a good investment on behalf of taxpayers to have all your eggs in one basket—and that has been demonstrated by the volatility of the Telstra share price over the past few weeks—we think that the taxpayers’ investment in Telstra can be otherwise deployed in a more appropriate mix of investments that are going to deliver a better outcome for the economy, consumers and Australians more broadly. So, when you consider that what we are doing is encouraging competition, delivering services and encouraging investment in new infrastructure, that is really where we now look at the contemporary need to divest ourselves of our interest in Telstra. Telstra needs to be freed of the yoke of government ownership. It needs to be fast on its feet, it needs to be nimble and it needs to invest in infrastructure that will enable it to provide—
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. It is one of relevance, because the minister is just responding to a dorothy dixer put by Senator Joyce and wasting the committee’s precious time.
 (Senator Kirk)—There is no point of order.

—Senator Wong very graciously deferred to me so that I could deal with the senator’s question. I did offer to give her the call, but as I have it I wish to continue and finish my response to Senator Joyce. The new infrastructure that this government want to encourage, where we do not pick providers and do not mandate technology, will be augmented by the competition that Telstra will have to face as a private company. Telstra will need to attract investment and invest in new and innovative services, as I am sure it will. We know from what we have seen already that it is very anxious to do just that. That can only be to the benefit of consumers. But the final point is that, where the market fails, the government are determined that we will not leave Australians behind. We will ensure that those who otherwise cannot get services will be able to get telecommunications services going forward and access to reasonable services at an affordable price, irrespective of where they live.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I hope Senator Joyce listened to the answer that the minister provided, because it did not appear to me or, I suspect, others on this side that there was a cogent argument put as to why removing public ownership of Telstra was going to lead to better outcomes for regional Australia. But that is a matter for you, Senator Joyce, to consider after your many public statements.
I rise to speak briefly—because I am conscious that my fellow senators have a very short amount of time in which to debate the rest of these bills. I am one of those senators who were not permitted to speak in the debate on the second reading because this government chose to guillotine the debate of these very important pieces of legislation to prevent senators from putting our views, our party’s views and the views of our constituents in the context of the debate on the second reading. That is what is happening here today. We have a highly controversial set of legislation and a highly controversial policy issue before the chamber, and this government has chosen to run away from the debate and to gag and guillotine the debate so that in less than an hour we will have to vote on it.
—You took 10 hours.
—Senator Coonan says that we took a number of hours. So we ought, because this is important legislation about which the majority of the Australian people are with those on this side of the chamber. They do not want Telstra sold. If you want to come in here, debate your position and use your numbers, as you will, to vote on this legislation, that is your prerogative, but you should at least have the courage to have the debate and not have senators like me and others on this side and on the crossbenches prevented from speaking on the second reading of this bill—prevented from speaking on a highly controversial issue.
—You ran away from debating the bill.
—You have had a lot of time to put your points of view, Minister. Perhaps it would be appropriate for you to let some senators on this side of the chamber who have not had the opportunity to put their views to do so now. There are a couple of things that I would like to put on the public record in terms of some of the emails and communications I have had from constituents in South Australia, because the fact is that the great majority of the communications I have had as a senator for South Australia are from people from all over the state who do not want Telstra sold. They do not think services in South Australia are up to scratch, and they do not see what these bills—what the government’s package—will actually deliver for South Australians.
It is not only regional areas. I will come to some regional and rural issues in a moment, but I am conscious of the time. As I said, we only have 45 minutes and Senator Conroy very graciously has allowed me to speak despite the fact that he is the shadow minister and has barely been able to get a word in edgewise because he has had a filibuster from the other side. I have had many emails, but this one is from the outer metropolitan suburb of Marino, which is in the seat of Boothby, a government seat. It is complaining about the fact that there is no broadband connection available. Even the mobile phone connection is often flaky and subject to dropouts. This is what this constituent says: ‘It would seem that profit is still driving Telstra,’ rather than the provision of reasonable services to even many people in metropolitan areas of Australia. This is not even in an outer metropolitan suburb of Adelaide, although I suppose you could argue that it is almost outer. It does not have proper broadband connection. He says, ‘Why is profit still driving Telstra?’ Tell me, Minister: how is privatising this company going to assist with this constituent’s complaint and the many others that I have received?
My next point is for Senator Joyce’s benefit, if he has not read his email today, because he is so interested in regional Australia. Perhaps he should be listening to the South Australian Farmers Federation. They are not known, I concede, for their strong support of many Labor policies. But on this issue I think you will find, Senator Joyce, despite whatever criticism you might make of the Labor Party, that in fact we are representing the interests of the South Australian Farmers Federation. What did they say in their release today? It is headed ‘South Australian Farmers Federation: say no to Telstra sell-off’. Their release says:
The South Australian Farmers Federation does not support the full sale of Telstra by the Federal Government while rural and regional areas of this state suffer from some of the oldest and poorest infrastructure in the country. If we don’t act now, South Australian farmers will be passing on a substandard telecommunications system to future generations on the land. Ring the Federation to register your support for the campaign. We will take it to South Australia’s political representatives in Canberra …
It ends, Senator Joyce, by saying:
Selling off Telstra means selling out our country people.
These are not my words; these are the words of the South Australian Farmers Federation. This is the sort of debate that you do not want to have. That is why you have gagged the debate and why those on that side, including those who have eaten up the time in this committee stage, voted for a gag—so that you did not allow us to have this discussion. It is an outrageous misuse of power. More importantly, perhaps those on the other side who pretend to represent regional Australia should be listening to some of the constituents in South Australia who have written to me and to other South Australian senators, I am sure, indicating their opposition to the sale of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2005-09-14,"—Madam Temporary Chair, I just want—
—What are you standing up for?
—I actually want to finish the time that I did not use this morning. I would assume those opposite are not going to deny me that opportunity. I just want to clarify—
—You voted for the gag!
—Look, Penny, with the greatest respect, you just said before that we are here to debate the bills and put our views, our parties’ views and our constituents’ views—
—It is Senator Wong, actually. You might not like it, but I got elected!
—I am sorry; Senator—and that is exactly what I am going to do. Thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to speak in the Senate. It is very gracious of you. What I would like to raise again, for Senator Wong’s benefit—

Senator Wong interjecting—

—You obviously were not here this morning, Senator. I will read this out to you again so that it is on the public record—
—It is called tedious repetition; it is against standing orders. Now sit down!
 (Senator Kirk)—Senator Conroy—
—If you want to filibuster your own gag, you get what you deserve, all right?
—please address—
—You are filibustering your own gag.
—In relation to this absolutely fundamental issue about ownership, for Senator Wong’s edification, can I again indicate to her what her shadow minister has said in relation to—
—Madam Temporary Chair, I raise a point of order. I am actually seeking your guidance. Is there a standing order that prevents senators from being appallingly patronising in this chamber?
—There is no point of order.
—Is there a standing order where actually appointment to the Senate has got to be merit based? Can I again go through for Senator Wong what her own shadow minister has said in relation to this issue. He said that it makes no difference to the majority of Australians one way or the other about the ownership structure, so please don’t come in here and say it. You can have a philosophical debate, but at least know what your own party stands for. There is one other matter that I want to raise. There are others who want to speak; I respect that and acknowledge it.

Senator Bartlett interjecting—

—I did not interrupt you, Andrew. There was a long debate this morning about jobs. I am going to ask the minister a question in a second about jobs. I am going to ask her after I have made some preliminary comments, which I assume I am entitled to do, to discuss what was said about jobs over the last 24 hours—Telstra jobs. Last night the Labor Party were running around with a whisper campaign that they had found some secret document identifying massive job losses. When they were pressed overnight as to where this secret document was, they could not produce it. So they back-pedalled last night and back-pedalled this morning. We got to the stage today where Senator Conroy was saying, ‘Maybe it’s 5,000 jobs; I don’t know.’
My first question to the minister is whether she is aware that there were 24,000 jobs in Telecom cut between 1990 and 1994. In two of those years, the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for communications. I also ask the minister if she is aware that the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act was introduced into the House on 19 October 1995, passed by the House on 25 October, introduced to the Senate on 26 October 1995 and passed on 27 November. Is she aware that it was not referred to a Senate committee? Is she aware that the Qantas Sale Act 1992 was introduced into the House on 4 November 1993, passed on 11 November, introduced into the Senate on 12 November—
—Madam Temporary Chair, I raise a point of order. These questions have nothing to do with the bill before the chamber. I ask you to draw the senator back to the matters at hand. This is a point of order about relevance. What does the Commonwealth Bank sale bill have to do with the bill before this chamber right now? This is a disgraceful filibuster. You gagged us and you are now taking up the time so that we cannot even ask simple and straightforward questions or engage in trying to have some debate, when we were gagged earlier today. This is a disgrace.
—Madam Temporary Chair, on the point of order: this morning when we started the discussion there was certainly some discussion in the chamber about the loss of Telstra jobs.
—He was asking you about the Commonwealth Bank.
—He also asked about the loss of Telstra jobs.
—I’m not talking about that.
—Okay. If that is the problem, that is not an issue.
—There is no point of order. Senator Ronaldson, I draw your attention to the legislation before the committee.
—Just to finish off, I assume that the minister is aware that the Qantas sale was not referred to a Senate committee and nor was the CSL sale bill.
—Madam Temporary Chair, I rise on a point of order. This is not relevant. This is a dorothy dixer outside the terms of this bill. We have only got an hour. At least allow us to ask questions for an hour.
—There is no point of order.
—I also ask the minister, in relation to the issue of regulations and Telstra, whether she is aware of the question that I asked Telstra on Friday on their profit for this year and the previous year and whether she is aware their response was that there is about $100 million or $200 million difference in the profit—very marginal—which would put paid to the argument by Telstra that government regulation has somehow destroyed this company’s profit. I ask the minister if she could answer those questions for me.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—Before I respond to Senator Ronaldson’s questions I want to point out, and I will be extremely brief about this because I do acknowledge the time, that by the time the debate proper on the bills had begun—this is talking about the gag and the unreasonableness or otherwise of the government’s approach to this—10 hours had been taken up debating motions and undertaking general debates rather than debating the bills. They were ready to be introduced last Wednesday. It is fair to place on record that all the procedural motions, the arguments about the cut-off motions and the general hubbub meant that the time for debate is limited. But that is not of the government’s making; I had the bills ready to go last Wednesday.
—You moved the gag.
—You could have had the bills available a week ago and you could have had a general debate. That is my point. You are wrong when you say that you could not have had those bills. Had you not had all these time-wasting procedural motions, you could have. You know that obfuscation and resistance to debating these bills has gone on for hours and hours and days and days. The bills were available to be debated last Wednesday, if you had not carried on about a cut-off.
In relation to Senator Ronaldson’s perceptive questions that did relate to loss of jobs, they are important because it has been said that Senator Conroy has been running around with a nonexistent document, beating up some story about loss of jobs, and he got caught out.
—It does exist and you know it.
—Senator Conroy got caught out because he does not have it.
—I never said I had the document.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. My point of order goes to the minister misleading the Senate. Her response in question time today in fact confirmed that there was a document in existence.
—There is no point of order.
—On Senator Conroy’s interjection, he still says that a document exists, yet Telstra says that it does not. Mr Beazley and Senator Conroy were both running around yesterday implying they had some secret Telstra document or they had seen some Telstra document about job cuts and demanding that it be released. From the media yesterday, it is pretty obvious that there is no such document. They have not seen a document. Telstra informed the Australian Stock Exchange last night that the corporation has not taken any decision to cut 10,000 jobs, as stated by Senator Conroy, or 14,000 jobs as reported in the media. It informed the Australia Stock Exchange of that, obviously in response to Senator Conroy’s misinformation.
Senator Conroy is becoming a serial pest as far as the Australian Stock Exchange is concerned. It has obviously had to clarify the position or else people might think that he knew what he was talking about. Once the Stock Exchange had this information conveyed to it, Senator Conroy started back-pedalling frantically. He tells the Senate that it might not be 14,000 jobs, but it might be 8,000 jobs or 500,000 jobs. He has effectively admitted that he is making a complaint to the corporate regulator on the basis of some sort of political guess. It is inappropriate to behave in a misleading fashion like that. Labor and Senator Conroy need to stop running scare campaigns on behalf of the union and the CPSU and stop waving around press releases; they need to start focusing on a bit of sound telecommunications policy.
Labor will do or say anything to progress some agenda about job losses. I cannot believe that the Labor Party would walk in here and start talking about jobs. If we look at Labor’s record, what did we get? One million people out of work. Close to 11 per cent of people lost their jobs because Labor could not manage the economy—and Labor actually comes in here and talks about jobs. Senator Ronaldson is quite right that, under Mr Beazley’s tender regime and Labor’s mad privatisation of everything that moved, something like 24,000 people lost their jobs in telecommunications. That is a disgrace. It is an appalling record and it shows not only that Labor cannot manage telecommunications but that it cannot manage the economy either.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. What has that got to do with the bill before the minister? Will you take the dorothy dixer in question time? We have only 45 minutes left.
—You raised it.
—You are talking about the general unemployment rate under Labor; it has nothing to do with the bill, Helen. Come on, we have 45 minutes left.
—You raised jobs, not me. Getting back to Senator Conroy’s adventures of the last day or so, he has put jobs fairly and squarely in the middle of this debate and he cannot make his case and he is embarrassed. He has simply overreached, as he usually does, and he has run flat into a brick wall. Now Telstra has clarified for the Australian Stock Exchange that Senator Conroy has got it wrong. He is running around in an irresponsible fashion and he is an absolute disgrace.
John Stanhope has spoken about jobs and Telstra announced publicly that it had made redundancy provisions in August but was yet to make any decision on job cuts. It was announced by Telstra’s chief financial officer more than a month ago and it has been reported in the media repeatedly. An issue does not become a scandal simply because the Labor Party fails to stay on top of its brief and comes to something late in the day and still gets it wrong. The only thing Labor has exposed in this argument about jobs and Telstra is its own ignorance and ineptitude.
Another very important point that Senator Ronaldson raised was about regulation. Regulation is really part of this debate, Senator Conroy, and I feel compelled to respond to Senator Ronaldson. It is true when you look at it that Telstra’s profits do not appear to have been impeded by the existing regulatory regime. I think you would have to say if you compare last year’s profit and the profit they announced a couple of weeks ago—$4.4 billion—that they could not have been severely constrained by the existing regulatory regime. When you look at claims that Telstra are overregulated I think they are a bit overstated. Australia has a very balanced and specific regulatory framework which contains the same elements that you get in most countries. It is an access regime that will ensure that there can be new market entrants and that they can get access to essential services provided by the incumbent telecommunications company. That is all about the ULL—and I distinctly recall Senator Conroy asking me a question about the ULL in the earlier part of that debate—and the rules to tackle allegations of anticompetitive conduct, which is also an important part of it. There are price controls and specific consumer safeguards like the USO.
Telstra’s very high degree of both vertical and horizontal integration is, I think, of itself evidence that the existing regime is not too tough and that it does need operational separation. If you look at the situation overseas then you can see that in Australia we have got a very benign regime. In fact, experts who advise on these matters say that Australia’s regime is benign. In Australia the regulator does not have powers, for instance, to force divestment or separation of companies, although I think that that is something Mr Tanner urged on Telstra some years ago and then abandoned it as a loony idea. Telstra is not prevented from operating in any part of the market and it has probably the most integrated telecommunication business in the world, with platforms across fixed line, mobile, a directory business and a pay TV business. In the first instance it is expected that access prices are settled through commercial negotiation as opposed to those being fixed by the regulator, so the costs of providing the USO are shared by the whole industry. In other countries, including the UK, the incumbent is expected to absorb the entire cost of providing the USO.
Finally, in response to Senator Ronaldson—because I do note the time—this regime has served us well. We know that the economy is $10 billion bigger and that small business is $2 billion better off through the deregulation of the telecommunications regime. We know that we have got over 700 ISP providers, over a hundred telecommunication providers, and a vibrant and emerging telecommunications market. We are going to put in place these enhancements to the competition regime that will be good for competition, good for the economy and, as Mr Samuel said in response to a question, good for Telstra. It will be good for consumers and it will certainly be good for the economy more broadly.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I have a question to put to the minister, but before I do I would like to say a couple of things about the disgraceful situation we are confronted with in the Senate today. As a new senator I have been astounded by the arrogance displayed by the Howard government in bringing these matters on in this way. Indeed, we have seen an early signal of what is to come. Under this government the role of the Senate as a legitimate house of review, a check and balance on executive decision making, will be treated with contempt.
In the last week we have seen a government prepared to only go through the motions, allocating one day in front of a legislation committee for five bills surrounding a $30 billion taxpayer asset. Today we have seen a government that, once it placates its black-sheep senator, moves the guillotine debate to gag the voices of senators and states that are bitterly opposed to this push. Why? Just in case Senator Joyce wanders off again. Having done this, it moves to gag the debate about whether we should have a debate. And now we have this farce. It is disgraceful and the Australian community deserves better.
Senators are not small elements of one great big Liberal rubber stamp. They are here to make sure that the bills that pass into law are robust, legitimate and do not have unintended consequences. You cannot do that with one day before the legislation committee. You cannot do that if you gag the debate on these bills in such a shameful way. I firmly believe that there are many more risks posed by the proposals before us than benefits. With majority government ownership, Telstra has a duty to consumers, and where things are not up to scratch the government wears the blame—and there is plenty of blame for this government to wear. However, make no mistake: a privatised Telstra will be driven by shareholder interests at the expense of consumers. It will be profits before phone calls, bottom lines before basic services, and percentages before people.
We have had a taste of this over the last few years, with ever-increasing service and line rental charges, while actual services in many parts of the country are declining. It is a sad irony to be paying so much more for so much less. To a degree, that is why the government is restricting analysis and debate on this matter. It thinks it can win the vote; it knows it cannot win the argument on telecommunications services in Australia. We have said repeatedly over the last few days that these bills cannot and will not stand up to scrutiny. No amount of diversion, clouding or downright misinformation from the government will change the fact that Telstra’s services should be fixed and the 51.8 per cent of the company that remains in government hands should stay in government hands. The government knows it, and the last thing it wants is to be shown up, as it would have been through a full debate in this chamber.
The government’s arrogance and risks to the community aside, this move also begs the question: what is the rush? Is there a sale planned this weekend? Are we issuing a prospectus next week? Are we even looking at flogging Telstra off this year? ‘No, we are not,’ say the Prime Minister and Senator Coonan. ‘We will wait till the price is right.’ I stand here today to argue that the cost is wrong. The cost is wrong on many fronts.
I live south of Hobart, the capital of Tasmania. I commute 20 minutes from my home to the Hobart CBD. In that 20-minute trip it is possible for me to experience major drop-outs in mobile phone reception. This is within 20 minutes of the centre of Hobart, on one of the busiest highways in Tasmania’s south. One, in particular, occurs at the top of the southern outlet and still within the greater Hobart municipality. ‘Okay,’ you might say, ‘perhaps the beautiful green rolling hills of Tasmania are getting in the way; perhaps the trip up the southern outlet momentarily interrupts what is otherwise the top-quality telecommunications service you would expect in a state capital city.’ But no—far from it.
Take a trip up the Brooker Highway, the main arterial road into Hobart from the north, and you will find the same thing: black spots—more black spots than you will find on a Dalmatian. As a tradesman at Austins Ferry explained to one of my state colleagues, his business is suffering because of the mobile phone drop-outs he has to deal with. This is at a time when we are dealing with skills shortages in traditional trades. There is plenty of work but, increasingly, no way of reaching the worker. Or take my family home in Leslie Vale as an example. On a good day, a mobile phone conversation is available if I face south. On a bad day, if I put my head out the window I might be able to get some mobile phone reception. Tasmania is suffering from black spot fever, and that is just in mobile services. It is ridiculous. It should be fixed and the government should be held accountable. It should be fixing Telstra, not flogging it off.
Mat Rowell, the Chief Executive Officer of the Tasmanian Council of Social Service, was reported today in the Mercury newspaper as saying:
... recent Tasmanian research showed many outlying residents could not get mobile coverage at their homes ...
Dial-up services were often too slow and regularly dropped out and ... there were instances where residents had bought CDMA phones after Telstra maps showed they would get better coverage, only to later discover this was not the case and they were then left with a phone that could not be used.
This is a shocking indictment of this government’s mismanagement of the nation’s telecommunications infrastructure. Tasmania deserves more than this. If we look at the in-ground technology that underpins Tasmania’s economy and innovative ICT businesses, the story is even worse. The fixed line network in Tasmania is in an ever-deteriorating state. One of the major problems associated with Telstra service delivery in Tasmania is the state of the copper network in the ground. There are cables known to have faulty pairs, giving rise to noisy circuits and unreliable and insecure services to Tasmanians. There are cables in the ground known to be major breakdowns waiting to happen. There are even major cables in the ground that are full and have no spare capacity, for which there are no remedial works in place or plans for upgrades. It is a joke.
Then there is the great con of pair gains. For those not familiar with the concept, a pair gain system is a small switching system that allows an existing telephone line to provide service to multiple customers. Pair gains were meant to be a stopgap measure in Tasmania, providing additional telephone services where cable constraints existed, but instead they became par for the course. Because pair gains were meant to be an interim measure, they have a range of limitations for telephone users. The most common arrangement is 15 or 16 customers sharing five telephone lines in the exchange: a six-by-15 or a six-by-16 pair gain. This means that if more than five of the 15 or 16 people want to use the phone at the same time, the sixth customer and any customers beyond that will get an engaged signal when they pick up the phone. Whilst I am far from an expert on telecommunications infrastructure, it is fairly apparent that congestion problems and no dial tone problems will be more prevalent where lines are shared.
Let us put a human dimension on this for a moment. One case in particular that I am aware of involves a young woman in Chigwell who has an asthmatic son. She regularly picks up the phone to be met with no dial tone due to the widespread pair gains in her street. Aside from the worry this causes her, she is of course paying for a full phone service and line but is potentially receiving only one-third of a service. What do the government say to this woman and the thousands of others around Australia in similar situations? They say, ‘We will flog it off, we will make some cash and then, presumably, we will line up next to you saying it is not good enough and the phone company should do more, but we as a government are powerless to act against market forces.’
Telstra makes all sorts of claims about broadband being available in a majority of suburbs or centres across Tasmania, but it will not tell you that hundreds of these centres still have huge broadband black spots. Telstra claims its technology is not capable of reaching these black spots, but that is only partly true. In Canada, for example, broadband reaches twice the distance it does in Australia. Why? Canada invested in better technology than Telstra did. This aside, at a time when Telstra has posted an annual profit of over $4 billion, mums and dads in Hobart suburbs cannot even access ADSL services, let alone anything more advanced. ADSL is simply jazzed-up copper wire, yet even if you live in some areas close to the centre of Hobart and therefore to an exchange, such as Fern Tree or Mount Nelson, you still cannot access ADSL. Compared to the rest of the world, Telstra’s broadband ADSL service is the equivalent of tin cans and string, but at least in some parts of Hobart you can access it. Once you travel outside the city, things only get worse.
But beyond this plan to sell Telstra, and the spin the government puts out, there are those living in far-flung places who have an equal right to expect quality telecommunication services. We live in the age of communication. We are surrounded by an ever-increasing array of technological tools to help us in our daily lives and we should all expect to be able to access them. A fully privatised Telstra would be even less likely to extend the benefits of new technology to regional and remote Australia. You only have to look at the way Australian banks have pulled back to the cities to see that there is not a lot of money to be made by private banks or telcos in the bush.
My questions to the minister are these: what contingency measures are in place to improve the state of Tasmania’s failing telecommunications infrastructure, and what guarantees, if any, did Tasmanian Liberal senators seek for improving telephone access and services in the state as the government made its move to fully privatise Telstra? Further, how much of the Telstra slush fund will be spent in Tasmania, a state without National Party representatives?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-09-14,"—In contributing to the committee stage of the debate, I do not think the historic significance of this occasion should pass without being noticed, because if shortly this bill is read a third time then this will probably be the last occasion in Australian history on which a major Commonwealth trading corporation will have been denationalised. I believe that 14 September 2005 will go down in history and be remembered by historians of future generations as a red-letter day in the development of the Australian economy.
Today brings to a culmination, at the instance of the Howard Liberal government, a series of progressive public policy measures to denationalise industry, which first began with the Menzies Liberal government. When the 19th parliament was elected in 1949, the first Liberal government began the process of denationalising the Australian economy. It began by denationalising the Commonwealth Whaling Commission. Who could believe in this day and age that two generations ago the Commonwealth ran a nationalised whaling corporation? Later on in the 19th parliament, the great parliament elected in 1949, the Menzies government denationalised AWA— Amalgamated Wireless Australasia—Commonwealth Oil Refineries and the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation. There were others as well but those are four that come to mind. Each of those enterprises, which had through the socialist doctrine of the time fallen into public ownership—the most inefficient way of holding and conducting those enterprises—moved into private ownership and prospered. When the Commonwealth Whaling Commission was denationalised and the shares in it were taken up by private capital, it became the foundation of a—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. Just to be consistent, I do not think the Commonwealth whaling organisation is relevant to this debate.

(Senator Ferguson)—What is your point of order?
—My point of order is one of relevance.
—Can I speak to the point of order?
—Yes, you can.
—As I often do, I am trying to put this legislation into an historical context.
—There is no point of order.
—The denationalisation of the Commonwealth Whaling Commission in 1950 by the first Liberal government, the Menzies government, laid the basis of a prosperous industry, which today, in more environmentally sensitive times, we no longer support, but for decades it was a prosperous industry in private hands. The denationalisation of Amalgamated Wireless Australasia in 1950 laid the foundation—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I would like to have some explanation from you as to how this issue of the AWA even gets near to the issue of relevance of the bill before the chamber. This is a filibuster. It is outrageous. They are using up time; they are preventing the opposition from genuinely questioning the minister about issues relating to this bill. It is an absolute disgrace and history will judge you, Senator Brandis! It will judge you!
—Senator Campbell, resume your seat. There is no amendment before the chair and we are debating the whole bill in committee. There is no point of order. I call Senator Brandis and I remind him of the bill that we are debating.
—The denationalisation of that industry provided the foundation for one of Australia’s most prosperous industries today—the commercial radio industry. The argument we have heard from the opposition in relation to the Telstra bills is that they will destroy telecommunications in Australia. Yet, if you look at every Commonwealth corporation that has been denationalised by both Liberal and Labor governments over the course of the last 55 years—a course of history brought to fulfilment and culmination on this historic evening—in every case the denationalisation of that industry, the placement of its capital into private hands and the discipline of the market, has been the foundation of its prosperity. So it came to be with the denationalisation of Amalgamated Wireless Australasia. It was similarly the case when, in the 19th parliament, Commonwealth Oil Refineries Ltd was denationalised. Does anybody seriously suggest that the introduction of private capital into the oil refineries—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. You did give a commitment to five minutes, George.
—Senator Conroy, that is not a point of order.

Senator Bartlett interjecting—

—I do not have long to go, Senator Bartlett. The denationalisation of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Ltd likewise provided the foundation for a rich, prosperous oil refining industry in this country—which, had it remained tied up in government hands and not been subject to market discipline, would not have happened. Finally, there is Comalco. People think of Comalco today as a company traded on the stock exchange, but Comalco was the acronym of the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation. In those days, in the 1940s, courtesy of the Labor Party, then in the thrall of their socialist doctrines, refining of aluminium was regarded as something which should be done by the government, not by private enterprise.
The interesting point to make is that, when each of those enterprises—the Whaling Commission, Commonwealth Oil Refineries, Comalco, AWA and several others that I cannot remember at this moment—were denationalised, the denationalisation of those industries by act of parliament was opposed by the Labor Party in the Senate. Senator Conroy, if you care to check the Hansards of 1950 and 1951, you will see the same tawdry, predictable arguments that are being made by you and your colleagues today about the denationalisation of Telstra were being made about those enterprises, too. History is against you, Senator Conroy. You were wrong then and you are wrong about it today.
—The ghost of Ben Chifley.
—The ghost of Ben Chifley might stalk the Senate, Senator Mason, but fortunately the shade of Robert Menzies stalks the Senate in a more illustrious form this evening. When this bill is passed, it will bring to fulfilment and glorious completion 55 years of history—55 years in which my side of politics has been on the progressive side. We have led the argument and we have set the agenda. Our approach was followed by the Hawke and Keating governments but there has been some recalcitrance and recidivism, sadly, by the modern directionless Labor Party which Senator Conroy is embarrassed to have to apologise for in the chamber this evening. Today is a great day for free enterprise and a great day in Australian history. Having made those preliminary remarks, I have a question for the minister.
—On a point of order: the Senate would well be aware—and this should be a lesson for Senator Joyce—that, having gagged us and having indicated, with only 15 minutes to go—
—What is your point of order?
—The senator promised that he would speak for five minutes. He cannot even keep his word for one second.
—Senator Bartlett, resume your seat! There is no point of order.
—I have 15 minutes, as all other senators do, but I did indicate informally to Senator Conroy that I expected to be only about five minutes—and I will be if you allow for the time taken by all of the interjections and the frivolous points of order. I finished my preliminary remarks on the point of free enterprise and the competitive effects of this progressive legislation which brings to fulfilment 55 years of Australian history. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I ask the minister: having regard to the evidence of Mr Graeme Samuel, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to the Senate committee which met for eight very full hours last Friday—without Senator Bob Brown or Senator Bartlett—does the minister have any observations to make to the Senate in relation to Mr Samuel’s evidence in which he indicated the ACCC’s support for the operational separation model adopted by the government?",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-14,"—I am conscious of the time, and I do thank Senator Brandis for his contribution. As I said a little earlier in this debate, the ACCC has said that it regards the government’s model as a workable model. In fact, the ACCC will be working with the government to develop one. In relation to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill 2005, I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 14 September 2005.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-14,"—If ever there was an indication of how worthless this government’s word is, we have had it from Senator Brandis. As he said on the record, he gave an indication—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order.
—And he will not even give me the two minutes to speak. They made a mistake and left two minutes for us—and they are even trying to gag that.
—Resume your seat, Senator Bartlett. There is a point of order.
—Yes, there is a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. I have been reflected on by Senator Bartlett. Senator Bartlett has accused me of breaking my word. That allegation is false and it is unparliamentary and I ask you to correct him.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! I have been asked to rule on a point of order. It was a debating point. There is no point of order.
—We have had a perfect example that their word does not even last a minute—let alone what it is worth after the legislation is passed. If ever we needed an example that ideology is driving this, not public good, we had the speech from Senator Brandis: privatisation good, public ownership bad; four legs good, two legs bad. They could not give a toss about the public. They do not care what the impact is—they have got their grand, ideological zealotry implemented. Of course, you have forgotten about Australia Post.
—Ideology is driving this for the public. It is called free enterprise, Senator Bartlett.
—Look at them. He is going off his tree—‘Privatisation has won, hurrah! Bad luck for the public. Bad luck for the facts.’ You are so keen to show how good it is you have gagged debate on any attempt to question what the consequences will be. Not only have you prevented the only opportunity of questioning the minister and reduced it to three hours, you then filled up have of that time with dorothy dixers and filibustering. It is a red letter day for privatisation and it is a black letter day for democracy and for the Senate’s time honoured role of scrutinising the government. And you of all people who have had the hypocrisy to say that the Senate will still do its job properly have been shown to be—

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-14,"—After all the fire and brimstone of the guillotined Telstra debate we now come to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Bill 2005. The bill before the Senate provides for the establishment and operation of the government’s proposed Australian technical colleges. Labor’s position on the Australian technical colleges is clear: we believe they duplicate existing world-class programs and infrastructure in our TAFE colleges and schools. We believe that the government should be increasing its investment in what is already in place and working—building on what we already have rather than reinventing the wheel. But Labor will not stand in the way of the technical colleges. Any action is better than the Howard government continuing to do nothing, and Labor will support the bill in the parliament.
Our support for the bill should not be mistaken for uncritical and unquestioning support of the technical colleges proposal. Labor question the motivation for the technical colleges, and we have many questions, which have not been answered by the government, about their implementation. Those are questions we were unable to hear answers to after public hearings before the Senate inquiry into this bill were cancelled—yet another display of arrogant misuse of power by this government in the chamber today.
Australia’s skills crisis needs action now, and not in 2010, 2011, 2012 or whenever these colleges will finally produce their first qualified tradesperson. The lack of skilled workers has already emerged as a critical issue for the Australian economy. It is a crisis of the Howard government’s own creation, a crisis born of their disregard for adequate investment in Australia’s skills base during their nine long years in office. Australia has a shortage of skilled workers because the Howard government has massively cut education and training investment since coming to office. A recent report by the OECD revealed a damning lack of investment in our skills base. The report revealed that over the last decade Australia has had one of the largest declines in public investment in universities and TAFE of any OECD country. Australia dropped by 8.7 per cent, while the majority of our competitors increased their investment. Australia is one of only seven OECD countries to reduce government funding for tertiary education per student between 1995 and 2001. Since 1997, there has been a declining percentage of the year 12 cohort going on to TAFE or university.
The government’s priorities in this area are all wrong. Figures uncovered by the Senate estimates process reveal that seven out of the 10 companies that received the most taxpayer funding between 1998 and 2004 through the government’s new apprenticeship employer incentives are employing only 0.6 per cent or less of their new apprentices in the traditional trades. The government’s top priority should be training new apprentices in the traditional trades and other areas of skill shortage, and not subsidising salaries in companies that do not provide training in areas of skill shortage. Nine long years of Howard government incompetence have created a skills crisis that is threatening Australia’s economic performance. The Howard government missed the opportunity to reform Australia’s education and training system to address skills shortages. From the time it was elected it has confused cutting education investment with real reform. It is no wonder that a shortage of skilled workers is hurting Australian businesses and families.
Warnings about Australia’s skills crisis are being shouted by everyone from the Reserve Bank to the OECD. Our economy needs action now. A report on Western Australia’s skills needs conducted by Monash University and released a few weeks ago pointed to the alarming need for an immediate 30 per cent increase in apprentice commencements in the mechanical and fabrication trades and a 15 per cent increase in the electrical trades. The report said that in Western Australia alone an extra 20,000 workers will be needed every year until 2010 to meet employment demand. The strong demand for extra skilled workers is being felt right across the country, yet the technical colleges will not produce their first qualified tradesperson until 2010 at the earliest, and that is only if the colleges are running next year. The minister ducks and weaves every time he is asked how many colleges will be open next year.
This government should be training more Australians now in areas of skill need. Instead, all the key indicators of skills development are pointing backwards. This government has presided over the most significant drop in a decade in the number of Australians in training. There were 122,000 fewer people in training in 2004 than in 2003. That is a seven per cent decline in the last year alone. The number of new apprentices in training also fell by four per cent during 2004. The latest figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show that apprentice cancellations and withdrawals are at a record high, up a massive 61 per cent since March 2001. Most disturbingly, cancellations and withdrawals by those in trades, and related workers, are up a staggering 54 per cent since March 2001—all this at a time when businesses are crying out for more qualified tradespeople.
Completion rates for traditional apprentices have been in decline under the Howard government. Forty per cent of people who commence an apprenticeship do not complete their training. These declines are the product of a sustained neglect of skills development during the nine long years of this Howard government. As soon as the Howard government took office, it slashed funding for vocational education and training. In 1996 and 1997 $240 million was slashed from the VET budgets. In the 1997-98 budget, the government abolished the stand-alone National Skills Shortage Strategy. In 1998 the so-called ‘growth through efficiencies’ policy effectively froze Commonwealth VET funds, resulting in a loss of growth funding estimated at around $377 million over the 1998-2000 period.
The misnamed Skilling Australia’s Workforce legislation, which was recently considered by this chamber, contains no significant new money for the funding of VET in conjunction with the states and territories over the next 3½ years. At the same time that the government was cutting and freezing funds, businesses were crying out for more skilled staff. We all know there has been a major shortage of TAFE places. These matters are a direct result of the Howard government’s education and training policies. This skills shortage has developed under this government’s watch. It cannot pass the buck and it cannot shift the blame. This government must own up to its own failings and incompetence.
Now we have before the Senate the matter of the Australian technical colleges. The idea was dreamt up on the run during the last election campaign and announced with scant detail. Only now is the government figuring out how the colleges will be implemented. In July the government announced out of the blue that it is increasing the number of technical colleges to 25. The government has now decided to fund two technical colleges in Adelaide instead of one. Clearly, Labor welcomes the extra college. More effort in skills development is always welcome. But, whilst it added on an extra college, the government has not increased funding to the technical college program. That can only mean one thing: less funding for every individual technical college.
The implementation of the policy is turning into yet another Howard government mess, because, without an immediate increase in the technical college funding pie, every area that has been promised a technical college will receive less money. Minister Hardgrave’s announcement of the extra college in Adelaide is yet more evidence that the technical college program was dreamt up on the run and is changing day by day. The Pilbara, Port Augusta, Western Sydney, Gosford, Lismore, Warrnambool, Dubbo, Queanbeyan and Sunshine Coast regions have all been left out of the Howard government’s announcement, despite being promised a technical college in the 2004 election campaign. These forgotten regions will now have to wait until after the next election for a technical college to open.
These colleges, the Prime Minister said in his election announcement, were designed to accelerate national skills development in traditional trades. If the government definition of accelerated skills development means waiting until 2010 for a handful of the colleges to produce their first qualified tradesperson, I would hate to see this government take its time. The government’s confusions and contradictions reveal a lack of proper thought in the original policy which has seen that policy unravel during implementation.
The government has been rendered breathless by its repeated exhortations that these colleges would not be able to charge fees or run at a profit. It has been forced to find a position after a shambolic performance during question time in the House last year, when the Prime Minister, Minister Nelson and Minister Hardgrave all gave different interpretations of the government’s policy regarding the fees to be charged. But the truth finally slipped out when Minister Nelson admitted in June that private training providers associated with these colleges will be able to make profits. This admission follows comments made by the Australian Council for Private Education and Training in relation to technical colleges. They said:
It would need to be a commercial arrangement ... where there needs to be the opportunity to cover costs and have a return for the operator ...

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-09-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The tabled documents that I wish to speak to tonight are the Australian Taxation Office Super Co-contribution Quarterly Report, on the operation of the government co-contribution scheme during the quarter 1 April 2005 to 30 June 2005, and the Super Co-contributions Annual Report for the financial year 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The co-contribution scheme which was introduced by the Liberal government for the period under consideration was up to a dollar of government contribution matching a contribution by the employee. The first point I will make is that the co-contribution scheme that this government has introduced is a pale imitation of Labor’s original co-contribution scheme, which was a matching scheme of three per cent and three per cent, phased in over a number of years. Labor’s original scheme would have delivered a much greater level of benefit to all Australian employees through their superannuation. It would have had an important impact in the form of benefits to the future retirement incomes of all Australians, as well as lifting savings in this country. Savings are negative and have been for the last five years in the household sector at least.
The Liberal government, in the run-up to the election in 1996, committed to maintaining Labor’s co-contribution scheme of three per cent and three per cent. But you have to look at the fine print when you look at a Liberal government promise, because they reserved the right to vary the method of the contribution. They then kept the funding—$4½ billion in the 1996 budget—in the forward estimates and in 1997 decided that they would not deliver the scheme. They replaced it with what was called a savings rebate, which lasted for six months or so, and used the difference in the revenue—billions of dollars—to assist in delivering income tax cuts as part of their GST package in the run-up to the 1998 election.
The other comment I would make about the process here is that this is a report prepared under the legislation by the tax office, and there is a requirement to do that. What I find interesting, and a further highlight of government arrogance, is that most of this report, not all of it, was dropped to the media—sorry, some of the media—on Sunday afternoon by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough. He selectively dropped elements of this report to the media. I know that because one of the journalists rang me on Sunday afternoon and provided me with a copy of this document—albeit one with a couple of tables missing. I find it a little interesting that the law requires the tax office to report to the parliament, but on Sunday night we had the minister selectively dropping to some media a copy of most of this document. As I said, the government’s arrogance and their contempt for parliament is highlighted yet again by them not allowing the document to be presented, as required by law, by the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody.
The other interesting aspect to the document I obtained on Sunday night—the selectively leaked document circulated by the minister, Mr Brough—is that a couple of tables are missing. It is interesting, because the tax office were unable to identify the total number of beneficiaries, running to about 605,000, and were unable to identify the spouse income, as required by law, of some 233,000 persons. The document also shows that almost 12,500 people who received a contribution have spouses whose income was greater than $100,000. It is a certainty that there are some millionaires in that category. Why on earth should a scheme be providing for the spouses of millionaires? That is very poor public policy. In the opinion of the Australian Labor Party, the scheme does need some adjustment where you have spouses with a very high income. We will be exploring this and other issues in terms of what we see as some inadequacies of this scheme.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Taxation Office</title>,DOCUMENTS,23,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-09-14,"—I want to make a few remarks this evening in relation to the summit currently taking place at the United Nations headquarters in New York, which Prime Minister Howard is attending. This is a meeting that will be crucial to the future of the UN; crucial on very many levels that are perhaps not appreciated in what is occasionally fairly superficial media attention—by necessity, as it is a very complex process. The meeting is also going to provide an opportunity to reflect on and examine progress towards the global Millennium Development Goals. Those goals, broadly speaking, of eradicating poverty, hunger, disease and gender inequality and of achieving universal education, health and environmental sustainability are an international responsibility in which Australia plays a significant role.
Today’s announcement by the Prime Minister of plans to significantly increase our overseas aid budget to $4 billion by 2010 is an important step forward by Australia in assisting those, particularly those in our region, who need it most. I note from events in the chamber today that not everybody is prepared to welcome and acknowledge the importance of that announcement. I certainly do so this evening, and I am disappointed with those who continue to carp and not recognise the important step that this is. The announcement represents a doubling of our aid funding from 2004 levels, and it will, in an appropriate fashion, involve significant conditions to strengthen governance and anticorruption measures.
Australia as a nation has a long tradition of giving international assistance, particularly in our region, the Asia-Pacific. It is also fair to say that Australia has traditionally been of the view that trade and investment liberalisation is also a very important way of reducing and removing poverty in developing nations. It does, in many cases, provide a longer term solution than short-term direct foreign aid possibly can. Australia, through the Cairns Group, supports efforts in the WTO Doha Round to eliminate agricultural export subsidies to significantly reduce trade distorting domestic support and remove barriers to market access. All of those initiatives, if fulfilled, will substantially benefit developing nations.
The paper which has come out of the UN today does not respond to all of those things as positively as some in the international community may have hoped, but it is fair to say that it has made some progress. As I understand it, at one stage it was thought nothing would be produced, so it is good to see some result. I am pleased to note the positive response that the Prime Minister’s announcement in relation to the increase in ODA funding in Australia has received from many in the aid sector in this country. It is important to note that that aid will be targeted in our region, where half of the world’s poor currently live.
Additionally, I think it is important to note that our support continues to be felt on the ground in the communities that need it most. I want to cite a few examples of our effective interventions in that regard. Today the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Billson, announced that we will contribute a further $1 million to the World Health Organisation to support their new national polio immunisation campaign in Indonesia, which is part of protecting over 24 million children from polio—in particular, the very vulnerable who are less than five years of age. We also, for example, support significant programs of debt relief. We spearhead that with a $110 million contribution to the HIPC, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, initiative. We have also committed to 100 per cent debt relief to all countries that qualify for the HIPC initiative. Nicaragua and Ethiopia, for example, fall into that category. In other arenas, we contribute to debt relief through our membership of the Paris Club of bilateral supporters. We have really played a very important role in ensuring a better deal for Indonesia there. We strongly support the development of a debt sustainability framework by the World Bank and the IMF.
I think we also have a human touch in much of our international aid provision through practical and direct programs. Many of us in the chamber have the opportunity to hear much about those through our involvement in the committee process in the parliament. For example, there is the provision of basic teaching and learning resources to 4,000 primary teacher trainees in Papua New Guinea; support for the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre in providing the centre which trains anti-domestic-violence committees across that country; and assistance in the prevention of up to 35,000 child deaths a year through the community based Integrated Management of Childhood Illness program and the national vitamin A program. They are all very important, very direct and very practical.
I want to make further reference to the progress we are making on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, which were adopted in 2000. AusAID recently released a very interesting and impressive document, entitled ‘A global partnership for development’, which charts the progress of the Australian government towards achieving the MDGs. It is optimistic and positive, and it is about improving the world.
We take very much a whole-of-government approach to development. This means that we want all of our departments and agencies where relevant to take account of the needs and interests of developing countries in the evolution of the global economy. That whole-of-government approach is one we adopt in a number of areas—in trade, in investment, in labour mobility and in dealing with corruption, drug trafficking, people trafficking and so on. What that enables us to do is provide well-targeted and effective aid; look at things like the appropriate debt relief I have referred to already, as well as things like duty-free and quota-free market access to goods from the least developed countries; and promote and support global economic growth and, as I referred to earlier, more liberalised world trade.
That aid program has established strategic partnership agreements between AusAID and Treasury, the AFP, the Attorney-General’s Department, the Department of Finance and Administration, the Public Service Commission and the Department of Health and Ageing and so on. All of those relationships are very important to effective delivery of whole-of-government responses. Those agreements outline shared goals and coordination arrangements for programs and projects, particularly in the Pacific. One very good example of that is the work that is done through the RAMSI Special Coordinator’s Office in the Solomon Islands. That involves senior officers from DFAT, Defence, AFP and AusAID working together.
One might ask oneself what the story is with aid and the Department of Health and Ageing. They consult with AusAID, for example, on health related issues, including, as I understand it, the Asia regional zoonotic diseases initiative and the South Pacific Senior Health Officials Network. It is all useful input, advice and engagement. I think that is a very positive part of our response in the region.
We recognise that the MDG blueprint, the whole-of-government approach, is not the be-all and end-all and it is not always the way to go. So, for example, we have taken a different approach in Indonesia with reconstruction post-tsunami. We have established the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development there. For the reconstruction and development of fragile states, that might not be the correct approach either. We recognise that and we are flexible about the approach that we take across portfolios. We are also working, as I said before, on trade, investment and labour mobility. We look at corruption and other transboundary concerns, as I think you would describe them, like HIV-AIDS, drug trafficking and people-trafficking, which invariably cross several government portfolios as well.
The OECD Development Assistance Committee, which reviewed our aid program in 2004 and with which I had the pleasure of meeting at that time, commended our whole-of-government approach to development, noting in particular the essential complementarity, if you like, of our aid, foreign, trade and agriculture policies and the way they work together. The OECD definition of policy coherence for development is the promotion of mutually reinforcing policy actions across government to support development. It recognises that poverty reduction and sustainable development do require much more than aid.
That brings me effectively back to the point where I began. Australia’s approach involves more than aid. But, most importantly, with today’s announcement we have recognised the very important engagement that we have in this region and made that very significant financial increase in our commitment. Our aid program works with whole-of-government partners to invest directly in specific MDG areas. There are a number of those, ranging through health, education and water and sanitation. There is the government’s commitment, for example, to fighting HIV-AIDS and particularly our commitment and funding for the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Later this year we will see the release of the government’s white paper on aid, which will provide further guidance and analysis of the effectiveness of our aid program. I look forward to parliamentary input into that process.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Overseas Aid</title>,ADJOURNMENT,24,1,speech
