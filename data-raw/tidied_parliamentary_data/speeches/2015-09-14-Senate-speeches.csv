Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (10:02):  I seek leave to make a short, two-minute personal statement. 


Leave granted.




Senator LAMBIE:
  Today I referred journalist Stephen Drill to the Press Council of Australia for investigation after he interviewed and posted a video of my son for the Herald Sun and other Murdoch media websites.


Unlike Mr Drill, my purpose in publicly disclosing controversial personal information about my son was to protect and persuade him to voluntarily accept ice detox and drug rehabilitation, because we do not have involuntary detox in this country. It was a risk; however, I felt I had no other option open to me because he was in grave danger. It worked. Early last week, my son contacted me and agreed to treatment, which I immediately organised with the help of a barrister and the staff of Teen Challenge, a national organisation that specialises in drug rehabilitation.


Everything was going smoothly until Mr Drill contacted my son and interviewed him last Friday. When Mr Drill conducted his interview, my son was vulnerable, drug affected, with diminished capacity and part of an official drug rehab program, having signed a Teen Challenge document two days earlier. As part of this Press Council investigation, I would like Mr Drill to explain why, after the interview, my son chose to leave home again and stop his rehabilitation process.


There may be other journalists who are tempted to copy Mr Drill and use the public interest excuse to chase my son for an interview. My message is simple: interview him by all means, but only after he is rehabilitated and back in control of his actions and thoughts. I will deal with the criticism that I am bad parent and a worse politician then. Because, if you chase him or any other ice addict at this stage of their rehabilitation, you are endangering their recovery and acting as a mouthpiece for a dangerous drug addiction that will do anything and say anything in order to be fed and nourished.


The bottom line is that my son would have been in rehab today if Mr Drill had not contacted him.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:04):  This bill is proposing some sensible amendments to the Water Act to cut buybacks from farmers to 1500 gigalitres, and I support that. However, I have moved two amendments which I think I should explain once again for the benefit of the chamber.


The first amendment will counter water hoarding by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. As the law currently stands, the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder is required to hold and store water even when environmental watering plans have been fully utilised. My amendment removes the ban on selling water that is excess to environmental needs by removing a requirement to retain water if it can be stored for a future accounting period. 


This idea, I believe, is supported by the National Party—certainly by the Victorian Nationals leader, Mr Peter Walsh, former water minister in Victoria. I do not see why it should not be supported at least by the Nationals in this place.


The second amendment that I am proposing increases the total water that can be used by farmers in the basin by around one per cent. This is a modest change that will benefit farmers and not threaten the environment. The increased water for farmers is achieved by reducing water use reduction targets listed in the Basin Plan.


The government argues these sorts of amendments will fall out of their current review process, and we should not proceed with them now. Quite frankly, I think that amounts to the government saying, 'We want our name on these measures, not your name, Senator Leyonhjelm.' I do not accept that. We have a responsibility in this parliament to promptly amend Commonwealth law when a clearly beneficial change is before us. We should not delay in the hope that bureaucratic committee processes will come up with something sensible in a timely way.


These amendments do not threaten environmental outcomes, and additional water will also be available to farmers who wish to purchase it at a reasonable price. They will improve the Basin Plan and deliver practical benefits to basin communities and the environment. It will also send a signal to the basin communities that we, in this place, feel their pain and are not indifferent to their trials.


The inquiry I am chairing will recommend more substantial reform but, in the interim, these measured and modest amendments signal a resolve to improve outcomes and reduce the uncertainty of necessary water reforms. I do intend to call a division on these amendments.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (10:07):  I have already spoken briefly to Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments but, given it is a new day of the Senate, I will touch on them again. At the broad level, the point that I would make in terms of the government's opposition to these amendments—and it is one that I reflect upon, having been for most of the time of this government the responsible minister for water and the Murray-Darling Basin and for a good period of time in opposition previously the responsible shadow minister—is that a careful management approach is required across the basin. It is not just careful management in balancing water use between economic needs and environmental needs but also in balancing the expectations between those whose communities depend upon the river system for their sustainability and those of course who live alongside the river system and, in a different way, whose communities depend upon the health of the river system—that balance between water users' need for water, and tourism and activities and others' need for a healthy river.


So there is a need to balance the environmental and economic outcomes. There is a need to balance those community expectations and then there is a need to make sure that, in doing it, you actually are achieving support and agreement amongst the five different jurisdictions that have a role in relation to the operation of the Murray-Darling Basin system and, in particular, the Basin Plan.


That is not to say, Senator Leyonhjelm, that your issues are not worthy of merit. But it is to say that, in this instance, process—much as process frustrates you at times and, to be honest, it frustrates me at times—is important if we are to hold what is a delicate arrangement together for the health of the river and the communities who rely upon it. And it is important that we do work through with the states and territories any changes to the Water Act, rather than simply bring them in and risk the support of the states and territories for the overall operation of that act.


I have given the commitment that the government will, of course, be responding to the Water Act review, which was commissioned last year and finalised last year. It provides some important recommendations in relation to how trading by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder could be amended, and it presents those recommendations in a careful and nuanced way with a number of conditions about how such trading amendments could be enacted. I do to note in relation to your amendments as they relate to the carryover of water that carryover is an important function for any environmental water holder, just as carryover rights are important for irrigators. In terms of establishing an environmental water holder what we have is a human intervention, a governmental intervention, in trying to best replicate and best optimise environmental outcomes in what is now a highly regulated river system.


The Murray-Darling, particularly the southern connected system, never outside of major, major flood events, flows freely. It is a highly regulated system in which there are active interventions made to determine what an appropriate level of flow is in terms of managing the risk to property, managing access to water for irrigators and managing water quality, particularly in the southern parts of the system. With such a regulated system, to try to best replicate environmental actions, the Environmental Water Holder was established to hold irrigation licences, like any irrigator, and to be able to then use those licences in a way that can optimise environmental outcomes. To be able to do that, the Environmental Water Holder needs to be able to make decisions in some years to not use those allocations and to load them up for use in another year in order to best replicate some of those environmental flows and to get an optimal environmental outcome.


So, in terms of your overall package of amendments, there are areas where the government has concerns about the nature of the amendment and there are other areas where we are sympathetic but do need to go through the proper processes. I appreciate your passionate interest and your representation for some of the communities of the basin, the communities whose passions and views I am very familiar with. I am eager to continue to work, as the government is, with you, with the crossbenchers, with the committee and with the opposition, who have continued a history of bipartisanship in this policy area, to ensure that future changes to the act, just as those that the Senate, I trust, will agree upon today, are delivered in a way that continues support for the Basin Plan and water reform in Australia, rather than risks jeopardising support for it by any of the different stakeholder groups.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (13:11):  It gives me great pleasure to continue my remarks on this particular piece of legislation, which I began remarking on just over a year ago. I make it very, very clear that we are not sacrificing environmental standards; I want to be very, very clear on this. We are not altering our government's solemn promise—our solemn commitment—and the long history of coalition governments' commitment to high environmental standards and environmental integrity. We are improving it. We are creating an easy system—one system instead of two complex ones. We are asking this: if there are nearly 250,000 applications lodged each year and just 400 are seen by the federal government, then why should there not be a streamlining of processes to create a more effective and efficient system?


Our states and territories will have to step up. They will need to ensure that their environmental protection laws are of a high standard and that there is a synergy across our nation, where some state governments—and I am thinking in particular of certain Labor governments' environmental approval standards around particular mining practices over the past decade—could have done with little leg-up. I hope that is why the opposition will be supporting our moves to ensure that state governments' environmental protections are going to be significantly increased as a result of stepping up to this legislation's hopes.


Some states have already begun working on how to improve their environmental legislation, but it must be noted that our government is not sacrificing environmental standards for a simpler system. The federal environment minister will still retain the right to have the final call in the assessment or approval of a project and may even be able to suspend or cancel the agreement if it is an extreme example. We are not fully relinquishing power; we are simplifying it. That has to be the key message here.


We are implementing a comprehensive assurance framework that will ensure that we have a transparent system. We want the environmental information to be public so that the broader community—including the Greens; it is great to have three of them in the chamber today—can be part of the monitoring processes involved. We are proposing audits during transition stages and then every five years, as well as consistent reviews of agreements and new reporting mechanisms.


Furthermore, we want an escalated dispute resolution process, where only the necessary questions will be asked so that we can be called to address extreme issues. The states and territories themselves have fully supported this. Every state and territory has signed up to the one-stop shop because they understand what Australian businesses and projects—and the significant amount of local jobs associated with that investment into Australia and particularly into regional Australia—stand to gain from a much simpler process.


A project that stands to gain is one in my home state of Victoria. With the Port Phillip channel we can see a classic example of how overly complex our system is. The Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project was specifically examined by the Productivity Commission. There are over 70 pieces of environmental legislation and policy relevant to the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. Do not worry, Madam Acting Deputy President—I know you have a strong interest in environmental legislation, but I will not go through all 70. I will name just a few. The key regulatory frameworks governing this project are the Victorian 1995 Fisheries Act, the Victorian 1975 National Parks Act, the Victorian 1978 Crown Land (Reserves) Act, the Victorian 1988 Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, the Victorian 1975 Wildlife Act, the Victorian 1989 Water Act, the Victorian 1994 Water Industry Act, the Victorian 1994 Catchment and Land Protection Act, the Victorian 1958 Land Act, the 1997 Victorian biodiversity strategy and the 2002 Victoria’s native vegetation management: a framework for action. It can cost a major but necessary project like the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project $25 million—that is a lot of jobs—to meet these regulatory requirements. It can mean as many as 4,000 meetings, a 1,200-page report, and being subject to 1,200 state conditions, 300 Commonwealth conditions and as many as 800 subconditions. 


The Productivity Commission heard that one company needed to employ—wait for it—50 new staff over two years just to meet the environmental standards. Jobs should be created in the process of building the projects rather than in the administration of them. In the same report, the Productivity Commission recognised that this is ridiculous, stating:


Australia’s federal system of government, where responsibilities for matters (such as environmental protection) span all levels of government, gives rise to overlap and duplication, which the Commission considers can be greatly reduced without lowering the quality of environmental outcomes.


That is the key phrase here. What the Productivity Commission recommended, and what the government has studiously sought to implement with this legislation, is that we get rid of the overlap and duplication but do not compromise our environmental outcomes. First and foremost we will not compromise them. I believe that this legislation goes to the very heart of ensuring that that can occur. Some of the states and territories are going to have to work very hard to make sure that their environmental protections are up to standard. Do not forget that the federal environment minister does have the power to intervene if deemed necessary. What we are getting rid of is that overlap and duplication.


If you are parties that represent bureaucrats or the majority of white-collar workers, then you would want to see paper-pushing jobs protected rather than the jobs of working-class Australians who will be building projects like the channel deepening project in my home state of Victoria and who will be building dams around Australia—the projects that are subject to these overlaps and duplications between the state and Commonwealth environmental legislation frameworks when it comes to protecting our national environment. The significant problem with overlaps is that they cause delays in the process. Getting approval by state and federal governments on the 70 pieces of legislation would not have been a timely process for the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. An assessment of the federal government's Office of Best Practice Regulation found that the savings from implementing a one-stop shop could be more than $420 million. That is a cost incurred purely because of delays.


The Productivity Commission also looked into the implications of delays, examining two different scenarios of delays—one and two years respectively. It found that by 2025 Australia's real GDP would be 1.5 per cent higher, or $32 billion higher in today's dollars, if the average delay in project approvals were reduced by one year. This GDP gap would increase to 2.4 per cent, or $51 billion in today's dollars, if the average delay were reduced by two years. That has got to be good for us. It has to be good for either side of this Senate to have billions more dollars to dedicate to education, to health and to ensuring that the taxpayer's dollar is targeted to those in the very greatest need, whilst at the same time ensuring projects worth billions of dollars are employing many more Australians. Over the 12 years from 2014 to 2025, the cumulative real GDP gains would be $160 billion and $280 billion respectively. 


Although I do not expect the Labor Party to know this, a major infrastructure project should run on time. I have so many examples from my home state, including the desalination plant, but I will not go through them because I will run out of time—and I have so much more to say on this legislation. Infrastructure projects should run on time. As a federal government, we are often asking the same environmental questions that state governments have already asked. Why not streamline the process? Infrastructure is so crucial, especially in areas like Port Phillip. It provides employment, stimulates investment and offers benefits to the wider community. All these processes, forms and applications are restricting Australia's future growth. It is not just major projects that have been impacted by these unnecessary processes. Farmers and people in regional areas have to adhere to these complex systems. They cannot afford to hire 50 new staff to help them out. The National Farmers' Federation has fully supported our decision to move to a simpler process, claiming:


Navigating regulatory requirements in relation to environmental approvals is difficult and cumbersome.


The NFF identified that there are too many duplicated processes, especially for irrigators. They identified that, because of requirements for rural water authorities to provide information and data to state and national irrigators, irrigation farmers bore—pardon the pun!—an enormous cost that was passed on directly to them. Just at the Commonwealth level, rural water authorities are required to report information to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, to the Bureau of Meteorology, to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and to the National Water Commission. Each regulator requires similar information to be provided in different formats for different timescales. These are just the Commonwealth requirements. These irrigators still need to report to the state government.


Why are we imposing such costs on those who cannot afford it when we are asking for information similar to that which state governments already request? How can a local farmer provide employment in community or supply the community with goods when they must pay additional costs to meet environmental standards? We would like to see a much simpler process. The NFF have provided us with advice saying:


… the one-stop shop model must address not only those areas where there is direct overlap of Commonwealth/State regulation. Full harmonisation is required so that the current ambiguity created by different Commonwealth and State regulations can be clarified.


It is interesting that the Australian farming and business community today has come out reiterating its support for the one-stop-shop approach to environmental approvals. The important reforms are strongly supported by the farming and business community, including the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, the Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers' Federation, the Property Council of Australia and the Urban Development Institute of Australia. They state that:


… one of the biggest drags on Australia's international competitiveness is lengthy and costly delays in securing project approvals. 


These delays stem from the duplication of Commonwealth and State processes and impact a wide range of industry sectors, including agriculture, minerals, oil and gas, property and construction.


… … …


The Commonwealth Department of the Environment has reported that Australia's average time for project approvals is 37 months. 


The Productivity Commission reports that even a one-year delay in a project costs $51 billion. Wouldn't we like to have an additional $51 billion in our economy, flowing through to business and workers? They further state:


The Department has also shown that implementing the One-Stop Shop for environmental approvals would provide economic benefits to Australian business in the order of $426 million every year.


That is a lot of jobs and that is a lot of people employed as businesses can stop paying for paper pushers, when they can streamline that process of getting environmental approval through for their projects. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Instead of paying for paper pushers to get the same environmental outcome, you know what they can do? They can employ more Australians. That is what I want to see. You would think, as a former union organiser, that that is exactly what you would like to see too—more Australians employed, building those massive infrastructure projects, wealth-generating projects, so that our nation can go from strength to strength without any decrease in our very strong track record as a nation of protecting our very, very unique and very, very precious environment. Nobody wants to see the level of environmental integrity decreased in this country, but what we want to do is ensure that our businesses and our farmers are as internationally competitive as they can be, because that means that they are going to be employing more Australians. You would think that that would be a good thing, but no—those opposite are not interested in assisting businesses to employ more Australians.


Reducing the duplicative processes will bring a substantial economic benefit over a wide period of time. I commend to the Senate: what we want to see is one application, one assessment, one approval process and one decision; not the multidimensional confusing and expensive model that currently exists. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  We want to create an economic efficiency that Julia Gillard could never achieve. It was her idea; we are just trying to bring it to conclusion, Senator Cameron. We believe that governments have a responsibility to the wider community as well as to the environment, which we protect. This bill is here to ensure that the integrity of our environmental standards is maintained whilst looking out for our economy and community. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  You once supported it. We believe that by streamlining the process, projects like the Port Phillip deepening project will have to face fewer hurdles, ensuring they can reduce costs. We want to stimulate investment. (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-09-14,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:27):  I rise proudly to oppose the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 and to rebut some of the rubbish that we have heard spouted in this chamber by the previous speaker, who is trying to claim that this will not have any deleterious environmental impacts whatsoever. In fact, this is all about doing over environmental protection in this country and thereby ensuring that the rights of big mining, big property, big developers, big forestry, the big dam builders and the big frackers are prioritised over the rights of our ecology, which ultimately underpins the rights of future generations in this country. 


Make no mistake: this is all about ripping off future generations and denying them the opportunities for prosperity that we are so lucky to have in our lifetimes. This is undoubtedly a massive step backwards in environmental regulation and environmental protection in this country. What we are talking about here is the government proposing to hand the power to protect the precious places of Australia—the ecologies and all of the creatures and plants that rely on those ecologies—over to state and territory governments, who, quite frankly, have an absolutely appalling record of environmental protection.


To illustrate what I am talking about, I want to go to a story about something that happened in Tasmania during my time in the Tasmanian parliament. This is in relation to the pulp mill proposed for the Tamar Valley by the company formerly known as Gunns Limited. Gunns are in administration at the moment, and I am very pleased about that. When they were a publicly listed company they submitted their proposal for a toxic pulp mill in the beautiful Tamar Valley in northern Tasmania. They submitted it to the peak planning authority in Tasmania, then known as the Resource Planning and Development Commission—now known, I should state for completeness of the record, as the Tasmanian Planning Commission. The then Resource Planning and Development Commission undertook a reasonably comprehensive, it has to be said, assessment of Gunns Limited's pulp mill. However, it became clear towards the end of that process—this information became public because I put in freedom of information requests to the RPDC—that they were moving towards a finding that Gunns Limited's pulp mill proposal was 'critically non-compliant', as stated by the RPDC.


What happened then? The head of the Department of Premier and Cabinet made a phone call to Gunns Limited. They tipped Gunns Limited off that the RPDC was in the process of concluding that Gunns Limited's pulp mill proposal was critically non-compliant. We then had some toing and froing between senior levels of government—by that, I mean then Premier Paul Lennon and the then CEO of Gunns Limited, John Gay. As a result, the project was ripped out of the hands of the RPDC and instead subjected to an extremely dodgy, extremely unacceptable parliamentary approvals process. I will not go into the many, many deficiencies of that process, but suffice to say that moved it from a supposedly independent planning authority into a highly politicised environment within the Tasmanian parliament. We saw bullying, we saw intimidation and we saw lies told to the Tasmanian parliament by the proponents. We saw consultants to that process who abjectly failed to conduct themselves in anything like an impartial way. As a result, disappointingly for Tasmania, parliamentary approval was granted, with only the Greens and a few brave members of the upper house willing to stand up for proper process and to stand up for the Tasmanian environment.


I place that on record because this is the kind of attitude to environmental protection and the kind of attitude at the political level in Tasmania that you are proposing to reward by handing over certain powers and authorities through the processes of this legislation. Let me be clear about this: Tasmanian governments have starved for resources environment departments and other assessing authorities in Tasmania. The honourable exception to that was in the four years between 2010 and 2014, when the Greens did ensure that extra resources went into some of these areas. But, apart from that period, state governments of both Labor and Liberal persuasion have starved bureaucracies in those areas of resources. There is simply no way, in Tasmania at the very least, where my expertise lies, that assessments can be done comprehensively and adequately, particularly of major projects where there is political interest, because I simply do not trust the Labor or Liberal parties in Tasmania to not politically interfere in the assessments of those projects as they so corruptly did in the assessment of the Gunns Limited pulp mill.


We know that there are a number of deficiencies in the legislation currently before us. One of the most frightening aspects of this legislation is in the area of the approval powers. These changes do not actually reduce duplication, which is the furphy that has been peddled in relation to this legislation. What they basically do is give authority to state and local governments to tick off on many projects which simply should not proceed because of their impact on the ecology and therefore on the welfare of future generations. It has to be clearly stated here that the current system is a separation of powers and responsibilities; it is not a duplicate system. As I said, this is the big furphy here. It is entirely reasonable to separate out powers and responsibilities—it is what happens in a federation. What is not reasonable is to describe a separation of powers and responsibilities as duplication, because that is not factually accurate.


This bill, very disappointingly so, will allow state and territory governments—and, extraordinarily, local councils—to make decisions about matters of national and, in some cases, international environmental significance without any expert advice from federal government departments. Again, this is another step in the ongoing emasculation of Commonwealth government departments that are there to protect the environment and to deliver intergenerational equity in this country.


I want to make the point about local governments that there are local governments in Tasmania that have less than 5,000 ratepayers in their municipality. They have trouble assessing carports, let alone the difficulty they are going to have assessing larger, more potentially environmentally destructive projects. So when you struggle, because of your very low rate base, to deal with applications for house extensions, for the building of decks, for garage extensions and carports, you are certainly going to struggle on major, more environmentally impactful projects.


So, unfortunately, what we are dealing with today in this Senate is a bill that will basically allow Commonwealth standards not to be reflected in state laws, and that alone makes a mockery of the claims that standards will be upheld. This is all about reducing protection for the environment. How do we know that, and how do we know that we have had an effective admission from the government that that is the case? It is because they talk about 'jobs, jobs, jobs' as their highest priority, they talk about efficiencies, and, in the context of this legislation, they talk about savings from what they describe as 'pen-pushers'. Well, one person's pen-pusher is another person's environmental protector.


Alone of the parties represented in this place, the Greens understand very deeply that we need to protect our ecological processes. We need to protect our climate. We need to protect our environment, for the benefit not only of all the humans and all the creatures on the planet now, but in fact for future generations. Apart from anything else, this bill clearly fails the intergenerational equity test. So, clearly, this bill should not proceed through this chamber of the Australian parliament.


Now I want to address something that the government, as I understand it, has claimed here, when they say, 'We've got some draft agreements coming down the line with the states, and don't worry—we've got call-in powers in those draft agreements.' We need to understand, as my colleague Senator Waters said in her contribution, that this is in fact a highly prescribed test for when the Commonwealth minister can have a state of mind where he or she 'knows' that something problematic is going on at the state level and call it back in. But it has to be before the state has already issued the approval. So the question quite correctly posed in this context by Senator Waters is: how on earth is the Commonwealth minister going to know that something problematic is going on at state level before the approvals are issued? Of course, the only answer to that question is that it will be somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible for the Commonwealth minister to know. So we are not satisfied at all with those call-in provisions, particularly as state governments right now—and I will speak again from my experience in Tasmania—are quite frankly prepared to do or say anything to get developments up in their state. And it does not matter to them that those developments compromise the environment or future generations, because that is outside the electoral cycle that is the only thing that the current state government in Tasmania is focused on. They are focused every day—as are the Labor and Liberal parties in the Australian parliament—primarily on one goal, and that is: winning the next election. And this legislation is abundant proof of that and fits very squarely within those strategic imperatives.




Senator Cameron:
  I suppose you'll never have that problem.




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Cameron suggests that the Greens will never have that problem, and I can respond by saying that it is my experience in the Greens that we genuinely ask ourselves the question: 'What are people in 50 or 100 years going to think about the decisions that we make today?' and I am proud that we ask ourselves that question on a regular basis—very proud indeed.


In the short time that is left to me in this debate, I also want to talk about prosperity in the context of environmental protection and environmental remediation. You can see Tasmania as a classic example where, as to our protected areas—those areas where, as a state parliament, and, at times, as a Commonwealth parliament and, in fact, at times, as far up as the United Nations—we have said, 'No; there are certain things that you cannot do in some of our higher-status protected areas, like our World Heritage area and like our national parks.' We have said: 'No, you cannot develop in those areas, if you are a private developer; you cannot log in some of those areas or mine in some of those areas.' And look at our tourism industry now. Do you know what the primary driver of that is? This is from Tourism Tasmania research. Do you know what the primary reason is that people make a decision to visit Tasmania? It is our wilderness. It is nearly double the next most relevant reason why people choose to visit Tasmania. It is our protected areas that are underpinning our tourism boom at the moment. We have gone from a time when the then Liberal Premier Robin Gray described the Franklin River as 'a brown, leach-ridden ditch' to a time now when our wilderness areas and our protected areas are underpinning the fastest-growing industry sector in Tasmania. I remind members that, when the Greens were predicting over previous decades that tourism was going to be one of our foundation economic sectors, we were laughed at loudly by the Labor and Liberal parties of the day.


This choice between jobs and environmental protection that is put to the Australian people so often by particularly the conservative side of politics is a false one. We do not have to make that choice because there are many circumstances in which environmental protection, extended out to environmental remediation, can generate many, many thousands of jobs in this country—and it has. This is not about jobs; this is about developers. This is about the big mining companies that this current government is so beholden to. It is about the big forestry that certainly the Tasmanian government is so beholden to. It is about the big frackers and a range of other people whose primary objective is to profit from environmental destruction.


One day—and it will be a great day when this occurs—there will be a majority of members in this chamber who actually understand that it is a false choice we are presented with between jobs and environmental protection. They will understand that environmental protection and environmental remediation go hand in hand with prosperity and meaningful work. They will understand that, rather than allowing developers to run rampant over our environment, destroy our ecology and compromise opportunities and prosperity for future generations, it is the job of this parliament to stand up for environmental protection in Australia and make sure that our children and grandchildren get a fair crack at the prosperity that so many of us are lucky to have today.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:47):  It is a pleasure for me to enter into this debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 following a speaker from the Greens political party and from Tasmania, no less. You only have to think of what the Greens political party, with their Labor allies, did to the economy of Tasmania over the last 10 or more years to realise that the ideas and visions of the Greens political party in the things that they convinced the Labor Party in Tasmania to be part of have just decimated the economy of that state and made it a completely mendicant economy, relying on—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(

  What a pity. The Senate will have to be the poorer for not having my arguments—

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",Ind.,2015-09-14,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (13:51):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 because this bill finalises the implementation of the Australian government's one-stop shop policy. You will know, Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, that for a very long time I have been committed to reducing bureaucracy. The Australian people deserve a fairer, more effective means of dealing with the issues that they face. By removing the bureaucracy—the multiple steps that people have to go through to achieve decent outcomes—we are enhancing not only the productivity but also the effectiveness of our government and the private sector. Make no mistake—




Senator Canavan:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I believe the clock has been reset during that process.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  I think you are correct, Senator Canavan. Senator Bernardi, please sit down while I seek the guidance of the Clerk. Order! Senator Bernardi, we would like to hear your full 20 minutes.




Senator BERNARDI:
  It is just as well that I had a 22-minute speech prepared. I was going to cut some out. I am absolutely delighted to be speaking on this bill. As I was saying, reducing bureaucracy and regulation of course enhances the operation of government while reducing the cost of government, but it also enhances the private sector by getting meaningful outcomes—positive environmental outcomes, as well as business outcomes. By consolidating the various bodies that have previously dealt with these questions into what is colloquially known as the 'one-stop shop' policy we are going to be on a winner. 


The bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure that existing bilateral agreements with each of the states operates efficiently and effectively. Madam Acting Deputy President, I would hate you to be under any illusion that I do not believe that in our federation states should be free to pursue the issues that are of importance to their constituents. I do firmly believe that government that is closer to the people often better reflects their determinations—whether that comes down to, say, local government where communities can have their issues resolved or state governments. I do believe firmly that they have an important role to play. But the federal government also has a very important role to play and in this case it is about streamlining environmental assessments and approvals. It removes unnecessary duplication; it means effectively that you do not have to fill in the same forms again and again and speak to multiple bureaucrats to resolve the same sort of issue. It removes unnecessary duplication between the Australian government and the states and territories.


I make this point to the Senate: the Office of Best Practice Regulation has estimated that the full implementation of the one-stop shop policy in regard to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 2014 would save businesses over $426 million per year. That is money they can put towards employing more people and investing and developing their businesses. As they make more money, they will pay more tax. It is a win-win-win—a $426 million triple bottom line win there. We will all be familiar with the BAEconomics report, which was commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia. They estimate the reform will add $160 billion to national output by 2025 and create 69,000 jobs across the whole economy. Let me remind the Senate that the Abbott government is all about jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs and increasing productivity—




Senator Cameron:
  Whose job? Tony's job—Malcolm is coming!




Senator BERNARDI:
  so Australia is better off and better prepared for the future. That is why this bill is so important. It is another step along the way towards greater efficiencies, more jobs, more productivity and making Australians much better off. But do not take my word for it; the BAE report said exactly that. The Office of Best Practice Regulation, whom we all respect, said it exactly that. This important reform will not only have a direct economic benefit, it will also maintain high environmental standards.


I challenge anyone in this Senate to have more regard for the environment than I. I am absolutely committed to a sustainable environment, because I am interested in the next generations, as so many of us are. There will be no compromise on high environmental standards. We are simply looking for opportunities to increase the productivity whilst maintaining high environmental standards. That is why the high standards of the EPBC Act will be incorporated into state approvals processes. What more could you ask for? You will get increased productivity and the high standards of the EPBC Act into the state approvals processes.


Thanks to the fierce lobbying of those committed environmentalists like myself, the absolute and fundamental principle of this reform is that our high environmental standards will be maintained. One of my colleagues may have said this previously: no state or territory will be accredited under the one-stop shop unless they meet the standards set out in the Australian governments' Standards for Accreditation of Environmental Approvals under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As a result of that absolute pledge that no state or territory will be accredited under the one-stop shop program, we have already seen some states and territories lifting environmental standards. That is what this federal government does—it lifts the states and territories to perform at a higher level; it lifts productivity; it creates jobs; it creates hundreds of millions of dollars in increased productivity; and it delivers billions and billions of dollars of extra output for Australia. It does all that by simply removing the bureaucracy that was created by the other side of the chamber. 


This is a one-stop shop that has the triple bottom line: it has $426 million in savings for businesses; it will add $160 billion in national output by 2025; and it will create 69,000 jobs across the whole economy. That is the triple bottom line for the economy—and it will have a massive win for the environment, because we are already lifting the standards. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I hear the interjections on the other side, and it galls me to think that somehow they are opposed to higher environmental standards and increased economic output. It galls me, and I regret that I only have four seconds in which to conclude my response—


Debate interrupted.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-09-14,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (13:11):  It gives me great pleasure to continue my remarks on this particular piece of legislation, which I began remarking on just over a year ago. I make it very, very clear that we are not sacrificing environmental standards; I want to be very, very clear on this. We are not altering our government's solemn promise—our solemn commitment—and the long history of coalition governments' commitment to high environmental standards and environmental integrity. We are improving it. We are creating an easy system—one system instead of two complex ones. We are asking this: if there are nearly 250,000 applications lodged each year and just 400 are seen by the federal government, then why should there not be a streamlining of processes to create a more effective and efficient system?


Our states and territories will have to step up. They will need to ensure that their environmental protection laws are of a high standard and that there is a synergy across our nation, where some state governments—and I am thinking in particular of certain Labor governments' environmental approval standards around particular mining practices over the past decade—could have done with little leg-up. I hope that is why the opposition will be supporting our moves to ensure that state governments' environmental protections are going to be significantly increased as a result of stepping up to this legislation's hopes.


Some states have already begun working on how to improve their environmental legislation, but it must be noted that our government is not sacrificing environmental standards for a simpler system. The federal environment minister will still retain the right to have the final call in the assessment or approval of a project and may even be able to suspend or cancel the agreement if it is an extreme example. We are not fully relinquishing power; we are simplifying it. That has to be the key message here.


We are implementing a comprehensive assurance framework that will ensure that we have a transparent system. We want the environmental information to be public so that the broader community—including the Greens; it is great to have three of them in the chamber today—can be part of the monitoring processes involved. We are proposing audits during transition stages and then every five years, as well as consistent reviews of agreements and new reporting mechanisms.


Furthermore, we want an escalated dispute resolution process, where only the necessary questions will be asked so that we can be called to address extreme issues. The states and territories themselves have fully supported this. Every state and territory has signed up to the one-stop shop because they understand what Australian businesses and projects—and the significant amount of local jobs associated with that investment into Australia and particularly into regional Australia—stand to gain from a much simpler process.


A project that stands to gain is one in my home state of Victoria. With the Port Phillip channel we can see a classic example of how overly complex our system is. The Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project was specifically examined by the Productivity Commission. There are over 70 pieces of environmental legislation and policy relevant to the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. Do not worry, Madam Acting Deputy President—I know you have a strong interest in environmental legislation, but I will not go through all 70. I will name just a few. The key regulatory frameworks governing this project are the Victorian 1995 Fisheries Act, the Victorian 1975 National Parks Act, the Victorian 1978 Crown Land (Reserves) Act, the Victorian 1988 Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, the Victorian 1975 Wildlife Act, the Victorian 1989 Water Act, the Victorian 1994 Water Industry Act, the Victorian 1994 Catchment and Land Protection Act, the Victorian 1958 Land Act, the 1997 Victorian biodiversity strategy and the 2002 Victoria’s native vegetation management: a framework for action. It can cost a major but necessary project like the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project $25 million—that is a lot of jobs—to meet these regulatory requirements. It can mean as many as 4,000 meetings, a 1,200-page report, and being subject to 1,200 state conditions, 300 Commonwealth conditions and as many as 800 subconditions. 


The Productivity Commission heard that one company needed to employ—wait for it—50 new staff over two years just to meet the environmental standards. Jobs should be created in the process of building the projects rather than in the administration of them. In the same report, the Productivity Commission recognised that this is ridiculous, stating:


Australia’s federal system of government, where responsibilities for matters (such as environmental protection) span all levels of government, gives rise to overlap and duplication, which the Commission considers can be greatly reduced without lowering the quality of environmental outcomes.


That is the key phrase here. What the Productivity Commission recommended, and what the government has studiously sought to implement with this legislation, is that we get rid of the overlap and duplication but do not compromise our environmental outcomes. First and foremost we will not compromise them. I believe that this legislation goes to the very heart of ensuring that that can occur. Some of the states and territories are going to have to work very hard to make sure that their environmental protections are up to standard. Do not forget that the federal environment minister does have the power to intervene if deemed necessary. What we are getting rid of is that overlap and duplication.


If you are parties that represent bureaucrats or the majority of white-collar workers, then you would want to see paper-pushing jobs protected rather than the jobs of working-class Australians who will be building projects like the channel deepening project in my home state of Victoria and who will be building dams around Australia—the projects that are subject to these overlaps and duplications between the state and Commonwealth environmental legislation frameworks when it comes to protecting our national environment. The significant problem with overlaps is that they cause delays in the process. Getting approval by state and federal governments on the 70 pieces of legislation would not have been a timely process for the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. An assessment of the federal government's Office of Best Practice Regulation found that the savings from implementing a one-stop shop could be more than $420 million. That is a cost incurred purely because of delays.


The Productivity Commission also looked into the implications of delays, examining two different scenarios of delays—one and two years respectively. It found that by 2025 Australia's real GDP would be 1.5 per cent higher, or $32 billion higher in today's dollars, if the average delay in project approvals were reduced by one year. This GDP gap would increase to 2.4 per cent, or $51 billion in today's dollars, if the average delay were reduced by two years. That has got to be good for us. It has to be good for either side of this Senate to have billions more dollars to dedicate to education, to health and to ensuring that the taxpayer's dollar is targeted to those in the very greatest need, whilst at the same time ensuring projects worth billions of dollars are employing many more Australians. Over the 12 years from 2014 to 2025, the cumulative real GDP gains would be $160 billion and $280 billion respectively. 


Although I do not expect the Labor Party to know this, a major infrastructure project should run on time. I have so many examples from my home state, including the desalination plant, but I will not go through them because I will run out of time—and I have so much more to say on this legislation. Infrastructure projects should run on time. As a federal government, we are often asking the same environmental questions that state governments have already asked. Why not streamline the process? Infrastructure is so crucial, especially in areas like Port Phillip. It provides employment, stimulates investment and offers benefits to the wider community. All these processes, forms and applications are restricting Australia's future growth. It is not just major projects that have been impacted by these unnecessary processes. Farmers and people in regional areas have to adhere to these complex systems. They cannot afford to hire 50 new staff to help them out. The National Farmers' Federation has fully supported our decision to move to a simpler process, claiming:


Navigating regulatory requirements in relation to environmental approvals is difficult and cumbersome.


The NFF identified that there are too many duplicated processes, especially for irrigators. They identified that, because of requirements for rural water authorities to provide information and data to state and national irrigators, irrigation farmers bore—pardon the pun!—an enormous cost that was passed on directly to them. Just at the Commonwealth level, rural water authorities are required to report information to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, to the Bureau of Meteorology, to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and to the National Water Commission. Each regulator requires similar information to be provided in different formats for different timescales. These are just the Commonwealth requirements. These irrigators still need to report to the state government.


Why are we imposing such costs on those who cannot afford it when we are asking for information similar to that which state governments already request? How can a local farmer provide employment in community or supply the community with goods when they must pay additional costs to meet environmental standards? We would like to see a much simpler process. The NFF have provided us with advice saying:


… the one-stop shop model must address not only those areas where there is direct overlap of Commonwealth/State regulation. Full harmonisation is required so that the current ambiguity created by different Commonwealth and State regulations can be clarified.


It is interesting that the Australian farming and business community today has come out reiterating its support for the one-stop-shop approach to environmental approvals. The important reforms are strongly supported by the farming and business community, including the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, the Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers' Federation, the Property Council of Australia and the Urban Development Institute of Australia. They state that:


… one of the biggest drags on Australia's international competitiveness is lengthy and costly delays in securing project approvals. 


These delays stem from the duplication of Commonwealth and State processes and impact a wide range of industry sectors, including agriculture, minerals, oil and gas, property and construction.


… … …


The Commonwealth Department of the Environment has reported that Australia's average time for project approvals is 37 months. 


The Productivity Commission reports that even a one-year delay in a project costs $51 billion. Wouldn't we like to have an additional $51 billion in our economy, flowing through to business and workers? They further state:


The Department has also shown that implementing the One-Stop Shop for environmental approvals would provide economic benefits to Australian business in the order of $426 million every year.


That is a lot of jobs and that is a lot of people employed as businesses can stop paying for paper pushers, when they can streamline that process of getting environmental approval through for their projects. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Instead of paying for paper pushers to get the same environmental outcome, you know what they can do? They can employ more Australians. That is what I want to see. You would think, as a former union organiser, that that is exactly what you would like to see too—more Australians employed, building those massive infrastructure projects, wealth-generating projects, so that our nation can go from strength to strength without any decrease in our very strong track record as a nation of protecting our very, very unique and very, very precious environment. Nobody wants to see the level of environmental integrity decreased in this country, but what we want to do is ensure that our businesses and our farmers are as internationally competitive as they can be, because that means that they are going to be employing more Australians. You would think that that would be a good thing, but no—those opposite are not interested in assisting businesses to employ more Australians.


Reducing the duplicative processes will bring a substantial economic benefit over a wide period of time. I commend to the Senate: what we want to see is one application, one assessment, one approval process and one decision; not the multidimensional confusing and expensive model that currently exists. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  We want to create an economic efficiency that Julia Gillard could never achieve. It was her idea; we are just trying to bring it to conclusion, Senator Cameron. We believe that governments have a responsibility to the wider community as well as to the environment, which we protect. This bill is here to ensure that the integrity of our environmental standards is maintained whilst looking out for our economy and community. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  You once supported it. We believe that by streamlining the process, projects like the Port Phillip deepening project will have to face fewer hurdles, ensuring they can reduce costs. We want to stimulate investment. (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-09-14,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (13:27):  I rise proudly to oppose the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 and to rebut some of the rubbish that we have heard spouted in this chamber by the previous speaker, who is trying to claim that this will not have any deleterious environmental impacts whatsoever. In fact, this is all about doing over environmental protection in this country and thereby ensuring that the rights of big mining, big property, big developers, big forestry, the big dam builders and the big frackers are prioritised over the rights of our ecology, which ultimately underpins the rights of future generations in this country. 


Make no mistake: this is all about ripping off future generations and denying them the opportunities for prosperity that we are so lucky to have in our lifetimes. This is undoubtedly a massive step backwards in environmental regulation and environmental protection in this country. What we are talking about here is the government proposing to hand the power to protect the precious places of Australia—the ecologies and all of the creatures and plants that rely on those ecologies—over to state and territory governments, who, quite frankly, have an absolutely appalling record of environmental protection.


To illustrate what I am talking about, I want to go to a story about something that happened in Tasmania during my time in the Tasmanian parliament. This is in relation to the pulp mill proposed for the Tamar Valley by the company formerly known as Gunns Limited. Gunns are in administration at the moment, and I am very pleased about that. When they were a publicly listed company they submitted their proposal for a toxic pulp mill in the beautiful Tamar Valley in northern Tasmania. They submitted it to the peak planning authority in Tasmania, then known as the Resource Planning and Development Commission—now known, I should state for completeness of the record, as the Tasmanian Planning Commission. The then Resource Planning and Development Commission undertook a reasonably comprehensive, it has to be said, assessment of Gunns Limited's pulp mill. However, it became clear towards the end of that process—this information became public because I put in freedom of information requests to the RPDC—that they were moving towards a finding that Gunns Limited's pulp mill proposal was 'critically non-compliant', as stated by the RPDC.


What happened then? The head of the Department of Premier and Cabinet made a phone call to Gunns Limited. They tipped Gunns Limited off that the RPDC was in the process of concluding that Gunns Limited's pulp mill proposal was critically non-compliant. We then had some toing and froing between senior levels of government—by that, I mean then Premier Paul Lennon and the then CEO of Gunns Limited, John Gay. As a result, the project was ripped out of the hands of the RPDC and instead subjected to an extremely dodgy, extremely unacceptable parliamentary approvals process. I will not go into the many, many deficiencies of that process, but suffice to say that moved it from a supposedly independent planning authority into a highly politicised environment within the Tasmanian parliament. We saw bullying, we saw intimidation and we saw lies told to the Tasmanian parliament by the proponents. We saw consultants to that process who abjectly failed to conduct themselves in anything like an impartial way. As a result, disappointingly for Tasmania, parliamentary approval was granted, with only the Greens and a few brave members of the upper house willing to stand up for proper process and to stand up for the Tasmanian environment.


I place that on record because this is the kind of attitude to environmental protection and the kind of attitude at the political level in Tasmania that you are proposing to reward by handing over certain powers and authorities through the processes of this legislation. Let me be clear about this: Tasmanian governments have starved for resources environment departments and other assessing authorities in Tasmania. The honourable exception to that was in the four years between 2010 and 2014, when the Greens did ensure that extra resources went into some of these areas. But, apart from that period, state governments of both Labor and Liberal persuasion have starved bureaucracies in those areas of resources. There is simply no way, in Tasmania at the very least, where my expertise lies, that assessments can be done comprehensively and adequately, particularly of major projects where there is political interest, because I simply do not trust the Labor or Liberal parties in Tasmania to not politically interfere in the assessments of those projects as they so corruptly did in the assessment of the Gunns Limited pulp mill.


We know that there are a number of deficiencies in the legislation currently before us. One of the most frightening aspects of this legislation is in the area of the approval powers. These changes do not actually reduce duplication, which is the furphy that has been peddled in relation to this legislation. What they basically do is give authority to state and local governments to tick off on many projects which simply should not proceed because of their impact on the ecology and therefore on the welfare of future generations. It has to be clearly stated here that the current system is a separation of powers and responsibilities; it is not a duplicate system. As I said, this is the big furphy here. It is entirely reasonable to separate out powers and responsibilities—it is what happens in a federation. What is not reasonable is to describe a separation of powers and responsibilities as duplication, because that is not factually accurate.


This bill, very disappointingly so, will allow state and territory governments—and, extraordinarily, local councils—to make decisions about matters of national and, in some cases, international environmental significance without any expert advice from federal government departments. Again, this is another step in the ongoing emasculation of Commonwealth government departments that are there to protect the environment and to deliver intergenerational equity in this country.


I want to make the point about local governments that there are local governments in Tasmania that have less than 5,000 ratepayers in their municipality. They have trouble assessing carports, let alone the difficulty they are going to have assessing larger, more potentially environmentally destructive projects. So when you struggle, because of your very low rate base, to deal with applications for house extensions, for the building of decks, for garage extensions and carports, you are certainly going to struggle on major, more environmentally impactful projects.


So, unfortunately, what we are dealing with today in this Senate is a bill that will basically allow Commonwealth standards not to be reflected in state laws, and that alone makes a mockery of the claims that standards will be upheld. This is all about reducing protection for the environment. How do we know that, and how do we know that we have had an effective admission from the government that that is the case? It is because they talk about 'jobs, jobs, jobs' as their highest priority, they talk about efficiencies, and, in the context of this legislation, they talk about savings from what they describe as 'pen-pushers'. Well, one person's pen-pusher is another person's environmental protector.


Alone of the parties represented in this place, the Greens understand very deeply that we need to protect our ecological processes. We need to protect our climate. We need to protect our environment, for the benefit not only of all the humans and all the creatures on the planet now, but in fact for future generations. Apart from anything else, this bill clearly fails the intergenerational equity test. So, clearly, this bill should not proceed through this chamber of the Australian parliament.


Now I want to address something that the government, as I understand it, has claimed here, when they say, 'We've got some draft agreements coming down the line with the states, and don't worry—we've got call-in powers in those draft agreements.' We need to understand, as my colleague Senator Waters said in her contribution, that this is in fact a highly prescribed test for when the Commonwealth minister can have a state of mind where he or she 'knows' that something problematic is going on at the state level and call it back in. But it has to be before the state has already issued the approval. So the question quite correctly posed in this context by Senator Waters is: how on earth is the Commonwealth minister going to know that something problematic is going on at state level before the approvals are issued? Of course, the only answer to that question is that it will be somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible for the Commonwealth minister to know. So we are not satisfied at all with those call-in provisions, particularly as state governments right now—and I will speak again from my experience in Tasmania—are quite frankly prepared to do or say anything to get developments up in their state. And it does not matter to them that those developments compromise the environment or future generations, because that is outside the electoral cycle that is the only thing that the current state government in Tasmania is focused on. They are focused every day—as are the Labor and Liberal parties in the Australian parliament—primarily on one goal, and that is: winning the next election. And this legislation is abundant proof of that and fits very squarely within those strategic imperatives.




Senator Cameron:
  I suppose you'll never have that problem.




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Cameron suggests that the Greens will never have that problem, and I can respond by saying that it is my experience in the Greens that we genuinely ask ourselves the question: 'What are people in 50 or 100 years going to think about the decisions that we make today?' and I am proud that we ask ourselves that question on a regular basis—very proud indeed.


In the short time that is left to me in this debate, I also want to talk about prosperity in the context of environmental protection and environmental remediation. You can see Tasmania as a classic example where, as to our protected areas—those areas where, as a state parliament, and, at times, as a Commonwealth parliament and, in fact, at times, as far up as the United Nations—we have said, 'No; there are certain things that you cannot do in some of our higher-status protected areas, like our World Heritage area and like our national parks.' We have said: 'No, you cannot develop in those areas, if you are a private developer; you cannot log in some of those areas or mine in some of those areas.' And look at our tourism industry now. Do you know what the primary driver of that is? This is from Tourism Tasmania research. Do you know what the primary reason is that people make a decision to visit Tasmania? It is our wilderness. It is nearly double the next most relevant reason why people choose to visit Tasmania. It is our protected areas that are underpinning our tourism boom at the moment. We have gone from a time when the then Liberal Premier Robin Gray described the Franklin River as 'a brown, leach-ridden ditch' to a time now when our wilderness areas and our protected areas are underpinning the fastest-growing industry sector in Tasmania. I remind members that, when the Greens were predicting over previous decades that tourism was going to be one of our foundation economic sectors, we were laughed at loudly by the Labor and Liberal parties of the day.


This choice between jobs and environmental protection that is put to the Australian people so often by particularly the conservative side of politics is a false one. We do not have to make that choice because there are many circumstances in which environmental protection, extended out to environmental remediation, can generate many, many thousands of jobs in this country—and it has. This is not about jobs; this is about developers. This is about the big mining companies that this current government is so beholden to. It is about the big forestry that certainly the Tasmanian government is so beholden to. It is about the big frackers and a range of other people whose primary objective is to profit from environmental destruction.


One day—and it will be a great day when this occurs—there will be a majority of members in this chamber who actually understand that it is a false choice we are presented with between jobs and environmental protection. They will understand that environmental protection and environmental remediation go hand in hand with prosperity and meaningful work. They will understand that, rather than allowing developers to run rampant over our environment, destroy our ecology and compromise opportunities and prosperity for future generations, it is the job of this parliament to stand up for environmental protection in Australia and make sure that our children and grandchildren get a fair crack at the prosperity that so many of us are lucky to have today.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:47):  It is a pleasure for me to enter into this debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 following a speaker from the Greens political party and from Tasmania, no less. You only have to think of what the Greens political party, with their Labor allies, did to the economy of Tasmania over the last 10 or more years to realise that the ideas and visions of the Greens political party in the things that they convinced the Labor Party in Tasmania to be part of have just decimated the economy of that state and made it a completely mendicant economy, relying on—

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",Ind.,2015-09-14,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (13:51):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014 because this bill finalises the implementation of the Australian government's one-stop shop policy. You will know, Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, that for a very long time I have been committed to reducing bureaucracy. The Australian people deserve a fairer, more effective means of dealing with the issues that they face. By removing the bureaucracy—the multiple steps that people have to go through to achieve decent outcomes—we are enhancing not only the productivity but also the effectiveness of our government and the private sector. Make no mistake—




Senator Canavan:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I believe the clock has been reset during that process.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Lines
):  I think you are correct, Senator Canavan. Senator Bernardi, please sit down while I seek the guidance of the Clerk. Order! Senator Bernardi, we would like to hear your full 20 minutes.




Senator BERNARDI:
  It is just as well that I had a 22-minute speech prepared. I was going to cut some out. I am absolutely delighted to be speaking on this bill. As I was saying, reducing bureaucracy and regulation of course enhances the operation of government while reducing the cost of government, but it also enhances the private sector by getting meaningful outcomes—positive environmental outcomes, as well as business outcomes. By consolidating the various bodies that have previously dealt with these questions into what is colloquially known as the 'one-stop shop' policy we are going to be on a winner. 


The bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure that existing bilateral agreements with each of the states operates efficiently and effectively. Madam Acting Deputy President, I would hate you to be under any illusion that I do not believe that in our federation states should be free to pursue the issues that are of importance to their constituents. I do firmly believe that government that is closer to the people often better reflects their determinations—whether that comes down to, say, local government where communities can have their issues resolved or state governments. I do believe firmly that they have an important role to play. But the federal government also has a very important role to play and in this case it is about streamlining environmental assessments and approvals. It removes unnecessary duplication; it means effectively that you do not have to fill in the same forms again and again and speak to multiple bureaucrats to resolve the same sort of issue. It removes unnecessary duplication between the Australian government and the states and territories.


I make this point to the Senate: the Office of Best Practice Regulation has estimated that the full implementation of the one-stop shop policy in regard to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 2014 would save businesses over $426 million per year. That is money they can put towards employing more people and investing and developing their businesses. As they make more money, they will pay more tax. It is a win-win-win—a $426 million triple bottom line win there. We will all be familiar with the BAEconomics report, which was commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia. They estimate the reform will add $160 billion to national output by 2025 and create 69,000 jobs across the whole economy. Let me remind the Senate that the Abbott government is all about jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs and increasing productivity—




Senator Cameron:
  Whose job? Tony's job—Malcolm is coming!




Senator BERNARDI:
  so Australia is better off and better prepared for the future. That is why this bill is so important. It is another step along the way towards greater efficiencies, more jobs, more productivity and making Australians much better off. But do not take my word for it; the BAE report said exactly that. The Office of Best Practice Regulation, whom we all respect, said it exactly that. This important reform will not only have a direct economic benefit, it will also maintain high environmental standards.


I challenge anyone in this Senate to have more regard for the environment than I. I am absolutely committed to a sustainable environment, because I am interested in the next generations, as so many of us are. There will be no compromise on high environmental standards. We are simply looking for opportunities to increase the productivity whilst maintaining high environmental standards. That is why the high standards of the EPBC Act will be incorporated into state approvals processes. What more could you ask for? You will get increased productivity and the high standards of the EPBC Act into the state approvals processes.


Thanks to the fierce lobbying of those committed environmentalists like myself, the absolute and fundamental principle of this reform is that our high environmental standards will be maintained. One of my colleagues may have said this previously: no state or territory will be accredited under the one-stop shop unless they meet the standards set out in the Australian governments' Standards for Accreditation of Environmental Approvals under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As a result of that absolute pledge that no state or territory will be accredited under the one-stop shop program, we have already seen some states and territories lifting environmental standards. That is what this federal government does—it lifts the states and territories to perform at a higher level; it lifts productivity; it creates jobs; it creates hundreds of millions of dollars in increased productivity; and it delivers billions and billions of dollars of extra output for Australia. It does all that by simply removing the bureaucracy that was created by the other side of the chamber. 


This is a one-stop shop that has the triple bottom line: it has $426 million in savings for businesses; it will add $160 billion in national output by 2025; and it will create 69,000 jobs across the whole economy. That is the triple bottom line for the economy—and it will have a massive win for the environment, because we are already lifting the standards. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I hear the interjections on the other side, and it galls me to think that somehow they are opposed to higher environmental standards and increased economic output. It galls me, and I regret that I only have four seconds in which to conclude my response—

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:00):  Yes, the Prime Minister does enjoy the confidence of his cabinet. The reason that he enjoys the confidence of his cabinet is his policy delivery for this nation—policy delivery be it on MH17 or MH370, be it on border protection, be it on stopping the carbon and mining taxes to ensure that we can have jobs for the future or be it on the free trade agreements that are promising wealth generation and job creation like we have not seen in this country for a long time. That is why the Prime Minister enjoys the confidence of his cabinet and of the party room. What I do know is that Mr Shorten does not enjoy the confidence of 21 years worth of former ACTU presidents in Mr Hawke, in Mr Ferguson and in Mr Crean in relation to his unprincipled stand on the China free trade agreement—an agreement that will see huge potential for our home state of Tasmania and indeed the state of Western Australia, 47 per cent of whose exports go to China. Yet the Labor Party has the audacity to campaign in Western Australia against the free trade agreement.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to all questions without notice asked today.


I just cannot help but make comment about Minister Abetz's answer to me when I asked him about the leadership qualms and what support the Prime Minister has. He said something about me being the only one who seems to be talking about it. I do not know what planet Senator Abetz has been on lately, but, crikey, that is all we have heard about for nearly the last 18 months—it has been absolutely unbelievable. It is incredible. This side of the chamber even had a leadership spill, and they said it was just gossip columnists. I never saw Dennis Shanahan from The Australian as a mad left-wing gossip columnist. But the leadership is all we have heard about since February this year. They can hang their heads really low, but they actually had a leadership spill. In all the history of leaderships spills in this nation, who would have thought that the Prime Minister would have beaten a vacant chair 61 votes to 39! They are an absolute embarrassment. I keep looking at those opposite, but they will not look me in the eye. This is all we hear about. This government is an absolute shambles.


As this mob found out, it is very easy when you are in opposition, but once you get into government you actually have to govern; you have to do things. It was all right being in opposition, when they could just make the stupid announcements and the stupid statements that they did for the six-year tenure of the last government. To go to even more questions that we need to ask, I want to relate a couple of quotes to the Senate. The first is from August 2009, from the Prime Minister, who at the time was the Leader of the Opposition. He said, 'We can be grown-up government in a way that our opponents just can't.' Okay, they can be grown-ups. In June 2010, Mr Scott Morrison—sorry, I do not know what seat he is from—tweeted that 'Labor leadership chatter is all about a government sacking itself for its own poor performance.' All we get in chatter now, through Twitter and through the newspapers, is about that lot over there. No-one is talking about the Labor Party; it is all about this lot in government. How quickly they forget. In August 2010, Mr Abbott said: 


I think leadership is knowing what you want to achieve and then purposefully and sensibly taking steps to achieve it, remembering always that you have got to bring people with you—


sorry, I am trying not to laugh—


if you are seeking to be a successful political leader.


Anyone who goes through a ballot with an empty chair and still leaks 39 votes—it is just incredible. 


The worst part is that this lot over here say it is just Twitter chatter and gossip columnists. The reason they are being written about, the reason they are talking about themselves, is that we know that there are a significant number of that lot on that side of the chamber, and in the other house on the government benches, that are talking to reporters. They are actually feeding the reporters. Reporters do not make this up. Reporters do not sit there and think, 'How can I be mischievous and make up allegations of a leadership challenge?'


I will tell you what is even better about this, Mr Deputy President—it is not better; it is an absolute embarrassment of our nation—they imploded after about three months of winning government. They have been an absolute disaster and embarrassment for this nation. They cannot look me in the eye. Have a look at them. None of them can. They are looking down pretending to be reading. The best part, which I am absolutely loving about this, is that, in the chatter coming through the papers, they are actually naming who they are going to kill off. They are actually naming who the rising stars are. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  We are embarrassed about you. Look me in the eye and I will say we're embarrassed about you.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, remain in your seat.




Senator STERLE:
  Let me tell you lot over there: if you are ever called a rising star, put your head between your legs and kiss your backside goodbye, because that is the kiss of death, I am telling you. There are one or two of them over there whose names are appearing. I will tell you what else they will be doing. They will be sitting there thinking: 'You absolute beauty. I can see myself going up this greasy pole on the way up because I am being mentioned in the paper, so my bike is up for sale.' The fourth estate do not make this up.


I want to quote one more thing to that lot over there who are getting all excited about their names being in the paper for promotion. 




Senator Williams:
  Where's my name!




Senator STERLE:
  You are like me, Senator Williams—you are all right, mate, because you are not trying to climb the greasy pole. I say to that lot over there that, on the way up, you should take note of every set of toes you tread on going up the greasy ladder for promotion, because I will tell you what, you lot who are mentioned in the paper: on the way back down, I can guarantee you that those toes that you trod on all the way up the ladder will be connected to the legs that hold up backsides that you are going to need to kiss on the way back down. And we are making this up! You lot are an absolute embarrassment. (Time expired)

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (15:07):  I just find it quite humorous that many of those on the other side who were key film stars in The Killing Season—do you remember The Killing Season?—



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  No, Senator Sterle, you did not get a run.



Senator Sterle interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Sterle, you are not in your seat.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I did not get a gig, and I am sure Senator Sterle did not get a gig, in The Killing Season, but many did. But it is quite amazing how we spend so much time and so much of taxpayers' money in this chamber—on what? On politics. What about looking at the real issues?


We had several questions from our side, today, on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. What does it mean to rural Australia? Quite amazingly, a few weeks ago I hosted two fellers, one from China and one from Hong Kong, who stayed at my farm for two days. We went to the Inverell abattoirs. That is a great business, exporting beef, employing 850 people. When you live in a town with a total population of 12,000 people, and 850 are employed at the local abattoir, that is a big employer—it is the biggest in the district. Of course it is not only about employing people; they are actually going to the cattle sales and bidding on the stock, and now we have record prices for our cattle. Those people from China and Hong Kong said to me, 'We just want to buy what is grown in Australia.' We have a reputation: a clean, green image of good, safe food. They want to buy our wine. They want to buy our dairy products: we are flying fresh milk into China, and it is retailing for up to $8 a litre, which is just tremendous for the dairy industry. And of course this free trade agreement is removing 95 per cent of the tariffs on imports into China within four years. The wine industry has had a terrible oversupply of wine for many years, and I know people who have been pulling their grapevines out—what a tragedy. Now the market is there.


But there are some people in here who cannot see the forest for the trees. They are simply blinded. I will tell you what blinds them: it is a mob called the CFMEU. They blind them with money. The figure mentioned today was $6 million. And this is to the Greens, I might add; it is not just to the Australian Labor Party. The CFMEU is throwing money at the Greens, and they will take it from anywhere—from Mr Graeme Wood of Wotif; he gave $1.58 million; that was the biggest donation in the political history of Australia.




Senator Abetz:
  Which they withheld from the public.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Yes, exactly. I had to laugh at Mr McKim's speech when he said that there are all these wealthy people who do not own stores and do their business on the internet. How many hotels and how many motels did Mr Graeme Wood own? I would guess: zero. But he was smart—he got on the internet and set up a business, and, when he had made all the money, what did he do? He palmed off the biggest donation in political history in Australia since Federation—and to who? To the Australian Greens, for the 2010 election. That is why Mr McKim's maiden speech was so ironic when he looked at how the Greens were treated.


But I will come back to the subject of answers to questions. We are an exporting nation: 70 per cent of our beef is exported. I have mentioned Bindaree Beef in Inverell. They were telling me that, in December 2012, they sent six containers of beef to China. In December 2013, they sent 60 containers of beef to China—a 10-fold growth in 12 months. And it just keeps coming, as people want to buy our products.


I was critical about Australia when we removed our barriers and tariffs. I was a pig farmer. My brother and I worked pretty hard to build our piggery. We mixed 120 tonnes of cement—and in cement mixers, mind you, instead of bringing a truck in; we could not afford it. We set up our piggery. And then the Labor Party in government allowed the importing of pig meat. It did not do us a lot of good. I was critical, because we had removed all our barriers to trade—there were no quotas and virtually no tariffs—and now we are going around the world and picking them off one by one.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will just disregard the interjections from the other side, Mr Deputy President; I can hear where they are coming from, so they are worth disregarding totally.


So the situation is: we are getting them to remove their barriers, their tariffs and their quotas, and that is getting us back to a more level playing field. And I do welcome the low Australian dollar, which is also making us more competitive and bringing in more money, especially into the wealth-creating sector of our nation: rural and regional Australia, where the wealth—the primary product—actually originates from. I cannot understand why those opposite are against this. Bob Hawke is not. Bob Carr, the former senator and former trades minister, is not. All the Labor premiers are not. So who has got it wrong? Just the mouthpiece of the CFMEU—that is what Mr Bill Shorten is. You are just the mouthpieces of the trade union movement.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:12):  I also rise to speak to the motion to take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today, in particular to take note of answers to questions to Senator Abetz around the Prime Minister's leadership. I have to say that Mr Abbott's leadership is well on display out in Canning in the by-election. Just a few weeks ago, just to show how chaotic and dysfunctional the government is, at the start of this campaign, they were throwing any money at that campaign—$1 million the Liberals started to spend out in Canning, to shore up the job of the Prime Minister. Well, it just shows how bad they are at economics, because that $1 million somehow is already being spent, but they now want to get rid of the Prime Minister. So initially the Canning by-election was all about the Prime Minister's job, and now they have spent $1 million in Canning to shore up the Prime Minister's job—the same Prime Minister, the bloke, who they want to get rid of. 


Mr Hastie is the Prime Minister's hand-picked candidate, parachuted into the seat of Canning. He cannot even name the main street in Armadale. He does not know it is called Jull Street. He cannot even name the main street.


Mr Abbott continues to behave more like the bullyboy behind the school shed than the Prime Minister of this country, and a swing in Canning on Saturday will be as a direct result of the Prime Minister's leadership. That is why they are so nervous about what is going on in Canning. A million dollars—imagine that! It is probably a record in terms of the spend at a by-election.


But what is wrong with the Prime Minister of the country? He seems to be able to manage to insult everyone. There was the appalling laughter we heard last week at the disgraceful joke told by Mr Dutton, and the comments about people's habits about keeping time, laughed at by the Prime Minister.


Mr Dutton got up and made an apology because somehow he was caught by a microphone. Any leader would say, 'When you make a mistake, own it.' But neither the Prime Minister nor Mr Dutton have stood up and apologised for those appalling comments they made. That, to me, demonstrates the arrogance of the Abbott government. It shows how out of touch they are that they think they can stand there at such an important occasion and make those appalling jokes. Who, really, do they think they are? Then it took another two days before Mr Dutton made that ridiculous apology—an apology because the microphone was on.


But Mr Abbott has a record of insulting people as well. What about the famous comment when he insulted Aboriginal people, particularly in Western Australia, for living in remote communities? He said that that was somehow a 'lifestyle choice'. What about when he showed his hopeless understanding of foreign investment when he said in answering a question at an economic conference in Melbourne that Australia owed its existence to former foreign investment by the British government in the then unsettled or scarcely settled great south land? That was another ignorant statement that refused to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also showed his lack of understanding of foreign investment. And there have been numerous insults to women over the last couple of years. There was the famous one when he said,


What the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing is that if they get it done commercially it's going to go up in price, and their own power bills when they switch the iron on, are going to go up.


Is that what we expect of the Prime Minister of this country? Is it any wonder there are hardly any women in the cabinet? This is a man who is clearly out of touch.


Today, his leadership is under challenge not this time by the backbench but by his own hand-picked ministers. They are all starting to turn on him. At the end of the day, like the Prime Minister, there is only one job they are interested in protecting and that is their own. Firstly, they were shoring up Canning with $1 million to protect the Prime Minister.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-09-14,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:17):  I too rise on the motion to take note of answers, including the one on leadership. I want to talk about leadership. I was just listening to Senator Lines make the most absurd statements about Andrew Hastie, the Liberal candidate for Canning. I have rarely met a more honourable man or woman who has served this country with such great distinction. I would love those opposite to go and stand in that man's shoes or in the shoes of any of the other members of the SASR and see what they do to serve our nation with distinction. If you want to see leadership, go and see what those men and women do to serve our country.


If those opposite want to talk about money in Canning, let's talk about the hundreds of unionists they have pulled in from all around the country and the millions of dollars that have come in to pay those unionists to intimidate local Canning residents. Let me tell you about Canning. I have been doorknocking in Canning. In fact, I was there with Ken Wyatt last weekend. We were in Kelmscott. Let me tell you: Andrew Hastie understands the local area. People are absolutely thrilled to have somebody to replace Don Randall—who they loved—who will stand up and fight for them. They are thrilled to have somebody like him, because ultimately it is not about the CFMEU and it is not about those opposite; it is about the people of Canning and who they have to represent them.


Let's talk about the leadership of the Prime Minister of this country. Senator Sterle talked about leadership and good government. Let me talk about one of the other responses from Minister Cash on border protection. Let's have a look at what good government looks like and what she was talking about. The protection of our national borders is one of the primary responsibilities of every government.




Senator Sterle:
  Linda, what about Abbott?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Instead of just talking about it and passing rude comments over the chamber and making highly personal comments across the chamber, as I have been subjected to again today by Senator Sterle, who seems to have something to say—




Senator Sterle:
  Do you support Abbott?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  let's have a look at it. In six long years under the government of those opposite, Australians witnessed the devastating effect of their weak border protection policies. They lost control of the borders. I will tell you what good leadership does not look like. It does not look like an $11.6 billion budget blow-out on unauthorised arrivals. Fifty thousand people were dehumanised and commoditised by people smugglers in trying to come to this country. That is not good government. Eight hundred boats flooded our shores and, most tragically of all—




Senator Sterle:
  Do you support Abbott?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Sterle, you might laugh at this, but 1,200 people drowned and experienced most horrific deaths in our waters. Where were you then?




Senator Sterle:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. There was no way known I was smiling about the tragic drowning of people. Senator Reynolds is misleading those listening. That is an absolute insult. I was not.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle has indicated that he has taken offence at something you have said, Senator Reynolds. If you wish to clarify that, I will give you the call.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I will happily clarify that. When I was talking about these issues, Senator Sterle was sitting there very clearly smiling at me. He may not have smiled when 1,200 people drowned as a result of their border protection policies—




Senator Sterle:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I was smiling because we were talking amongst ourselves and then Senator Reynolds went into the tragic drownings and accused me of smiling about that, which could not be further from the truth. She is misleading the Senate. I did not smile about the tragic drownings of asylum seekers.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think Senator Reynolds has indicated that she did not accuse you of smiling because of that, Senator Sterle. That is correct, isn't it, Senator Reynolds?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Yes, it is.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Reynolds, for clarifying that. You have the call.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Let's talk about good government and losing control of the borders. Not only did it directly result in 1200 people drowning—the most horrific and horrendous deaths—but it also completely undermined our humanitarian program, which we also lost control of. What else did bad government from those opposite look like? It started the building the detention centre revolution with over 17 detention centres built to accommodate the loss of control and the people who flooded into this country. Most shamefully, not only were there 1200 deaths and no candlelight vigils for those 1200 people who died in our waters, but there were 8000 children who went into detention under those opposite—nearly 2000 at one time. That is not good governance. 


What does good government look like? We attained it; we taken the tough actions; we have regained control of our borders; we have had not a single death at sea; and not a solitary boat arrival for well over 12 months. Not a single person has been commoditised and dehumanised by people smugglers in that time in trying to get here. We are releasing the majority of children from detention; the majority have already been released. All children from Christmas Island have now been released—the children whom those opposite put in detention. That is not good government! This is good government. Almost all the detention centres that Labor opened have been made redundant. If those opposite do not think that closing detention centres, stopping people dying at sea and regaining control of our borders do not constitute good government, then I, quite frankly, do not know what is. It is no wonder that the country is in such a mess when you were in government—




Senator Gallacher:
  You can't even mention Abbott's name.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-09-14,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:23):  I am just recovering from what was a shemozzle of a performance from those opposite. I have to say that this idea, this notion, this suggestion from question time that somehow there is a small, targeted media campaign designed to undermine this government and that this is a fantastic government that is doing this great work and that is loved by the Australian people could not be further from the truth. This is a government that is falling apart before our very eyes. This is a government that is sinking like a canoe—




Senator Gallacher:
  Up the creek!




Senator DASTYARI:
  It is falling apart at every instance. What do we see? We saw last week a leaking to News Ltd journalists—The Daily Telegraph, a fantastic publication, I may point out—of a hit list from senior government sources of who is in and who is out. I was pretty shocked to see the Leader of the Government in the Senate on that hit list. I was pretty shocked and horrified and pretty disappointed, I have to say, that his colleagues would put him on that list. There were people on that list who surprised all of us. This is no conspiracy on the fringes. This is no ABC/Fairfax campaign running against the government—I believe the term used was 'jihad', but inappropriately. Six out of eight ministers who were contacted by Fairfax journalists talked about the idea of the inevitability of a leadership coup. What did we get on the weekend? The gold quote of the year from a government MP: 'Say it to my face and I will smash his in.' 'Say it to my face and I will smash his in.'


Dysfunction and disorder—a government that has completely fallen apart before our very eyes. They turn around and say, 'It's all gossip. It's the glitterati.' These are their own members of parliament, their own ministers, their own cabinet talking about their cabinet. I say to those opposite: if that is what you think of your own government, imagine what the people out there are thinking of your government right now. They go on about gossip columnists and attack them. They say that it is only at the fringes. Well, I have to say that I do not believe that Laurie Oakes is some kind of fringe-dweller. I do not think Laurie Oakes is that kind of journalist. If you saw what Laurie Oakes said on the weekend or the news reports last night, they have such little faith in their own government and such little faith in their Prime Minister that there is actual talk of a leadership spill this week. They just cannot trust the bloke to go out there and destroy their electoral prospects simply to retain his own job. The question has to be: whose job is he actually trying to protect?




Senator Lines:
  His own.




Senator DASTYARI:
  It's not the jobs in the car industry—they have gone. Not the jobs of any South Australian when it comes to shipbuilding; they have gone. Not the jobs in manufacturing; not the jobs in new technologies; not the jobs when it comes to climate and other new possibilities. No, there is one job this Prime Minister is focused on—that is his own and, frankly, he is not doing a very good job of protecting that job, either.




Senator Gallacher:
  He is a wrecker.




Senator DASTYARI:
  We have a by-election on the weekend. We heard a fantastic speech from Senator Reynolds who went on about what an incredibly strong and brilliant candidate the Liberal Party has. I do not know Mr Hastie; I have not met Mr Hastie. Senator Reynolds' comments were quite inspirational, but you would have to ask yourself: if they have such a fantastic candidate in the seat of Canning, why are they copping 10 per cent swings? Who are the people voting against him? It is not the local candidate; the candidate is superb—that is their word, not mine. For such a superb local candidate, there is one person they are voting against, and that is the Prime Minister of Australia. The question is this: what is going to happen this week? Is Mr Turnbull going to put up or shut up? Is the Prime Minister so confident in his own position that he is prepared to spill? We kept hearing those others talking about Mr Simon Crean when it came to the free trade agreement. Maybe they need a Simon Crean themselves to step up and make it all happen. (Time expired)

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-09-14,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (15:29):  I rise on the motion to take note of responses given by Senator Abetz to questions that I asked him today. The simple facts of this matter, as far as we know them, are abundantly clear. We know that under the handbook, which is the amended constitution of the Liberal Party of Australia, Tasmania division, at the time the then state director, Mr Damien Mantach, fraudulently misused his Liberal Party credit card in Tasmania—an offence for which he was effectively sacked. We know that, under part 71H of the constitution, there was a Tasmanian member of the House of Representatives and of the Senate elected by and from the Tasmanian members of the federal parliamentary party and we know that that person was Senator Abetz. We also know that, when Senator Abetz was first questioned about this matter a few short weeks ago, he ran for cover by suggesting that it was a matter for the organisational wing of his party in Tasmania when, in fact, he was part of the organisational wing of the party in Tasmania by virtue of his position on the state executive committee, which is responsible for the affairs—these are the words of the constitution—of the division.


After being called out on that matter, Senator Abetz then had to attempt to answer some other questions from the media. At that time he basically stated, or claimed, that no sum of money was mentioned at the briefing that he received at the time in relation to Mr Mantach's offence. If someone came to anyone in public office and said, 'We've got to tell you there are some dodgy dealings around a company credit card,' what is the first question that any responsible person would ask? You would ask, 'How much are we missing off the credit card?' But Senator Abetz is asking the Australian people to believe that he did not ask the obvious question: how much was missing off the credit card that belonged to the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party of Australia? Quite frankly, I do not believe that he did not ask that—either he is misleading or he is grossly incompetent. He cannot have it any other way—




Senator Dastyari:
  He could be both.




Senator McKIM:
  Or he could be both. As Senator Dastyari quite correctly points out, he could be both misleading and grossly incompetent.


But the matter gets worse for Senator Abetz because we now know that what transpired is that Mr Mantach went across and was employed by the Liberal Party in Victoria. He is alleged to have defrauded the Liberal Party of Victoria of $1.5 million. They apparently did not know about Mr Mantach's issues in Tasmania. Senator Abetz knew, on his own admission, that there were irregularities in relation to Mr Mantach and his use of the credit card in Tasmania, but somehow that information was not properly communicated to the Liberal Party in Victoria. At the very least, Senator Abetz owes an apology to his Victorian Liberal colleagues and to the party members in both Tasmania and Victoria for treating them like mushrooms.


The other matter that Senator Abetz has to come clean about in the Senate—and I will be raising these issues further as we move through the rest of this sitting year—is that, on his own admission, he knew the real reason that Mr Mantach left his position in Tasmania but he allowed the lie, that Mr Mantach left the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party for personal and family reasons, to stand for seven years. He made no attempt at all to correct the erroneous record for seven long years, and that says an awful lot about his capacity as an office holder in the Liberal Party.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-09-14,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (15:38):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance. You only have to look at the title to know what is happening this week and put it in context: this Prime Minister, his leadership, has been an abject failure. The Prime Minister has consistently failed the Australian people over the last two years, during which this shambolic excuse for a government has been in office. It goes back to the disaster that was the 2014-15 budget, which is still with us today as the government continuously tries to reintroduce and pass some of those savage and unfair measures that have been rejected by this parliament numerous times. The coalition, the Prime Minister, just does not get it. 


One of the first acts of this government was to bring down a budget that was inherently unfair, full of cuts and wrong priorities. The last two years of Mr Abbott's leadership have been littered with failure, broken promises and bad calls. There was the introduction of the $100,000 university degree, through which Mr Abbott planned to deregulate fees. There was not a word before the election about that one. There were cuts to the ABC and SBS, which he made a point of saying he would not cut funding to. But, lo and behold, we find out after the election that that is exactly what he went about doing. There were cuts to the pension, leaving pensioners who are struggling with less in their pockets. 


The government has also tried to force young people to live on nothing for six months which, thankfully, was rejected by this parliament. Just a week ago Mr Abbott tried to pass the same unfair bill but tried to drop it to a month, to see if they could get by with a month. Thank goodness that was also rejected. Their persistence and commitment to unfair policies that hurt those students who can least afford it is impressive if not shameful. Not only were these measures rejected by the parliament, they were also broken promises. Mr Abbott specifically promised not to do the very things that he has tried to do in his first unfair budget.


We saw a $30 billion cut to education and a $50 billion cut to health and hospital services. In doing this, the cruellest part was aimed at forcing the states to ask for an increase in the GST due to the shortfall they would face. Mr Abbott is playing a political game with the states on this. He is playing with the health and education of our families, because he is too weak to tell Australians that his true intention is to raise the GST. Notwithstanding, Mr Morrison is out of the blocks, today, talking about how the states should raise their GST; perhaps Mr Morrison should have a short word in the ear of Mr Abbott. I suspect it is a tin ear, because he certainly has not listened to any of his frontbenchers or his backbenchers.


He tried to bring in a GP tax every time you visit a doctor, undermining our universal healthcare system, and is trying to bring about the Americanisation of health care, which is being done without a mandate.  He talked so much about a mandate during the last government. He is silent about the mandate of late. It is not in the best interests of Australians, which is the truth of it. During the public debate on the GP tax we saw numerous examples of people having stopped going to their local GP, as they thought the tax was in place. This leads to directly impacting on the health of Australians not to mention the importance of early intervention for certain medical conditions. All this is being put in jeopardy with mere propositions of the GP tax—the awful effects of this we would have had if Mr Abbott had got his own way and passed this draconian policy.


One of the highlights of Mr Abbott's leadership was the knighthood of Prince Philip. He introduced knighthoods after they were abolished decades ago. Yes, it is a little unfair of me to bring it up again but it is staggering how anyone could have thought that would work in the public domain. So who is the first person to be acknowledged with this anachronistic honour? Prince Philip. Not only does he bring back knights and dames but he gives it to Prince Philip—who is living in the UK—and does not give it, firstly, to an Australian. That is Mr Abbott acting alone. His call; his leadership. That is who he chose. It was a bad call not to consult with your cabinet colleagues. I have no doubt that his cabinet colleagues would have said, 'No mate, that doesn't cut it in the Australian community.' Equally, there are many deserving Australians who do need recognition, but not through a knight or a dame.


Another one of his captain's picks was Bronwyn Bishop. It finally came undone. The fact that he could not see that selecting someone so partisan and resistant to embracing the independent stance required of the Speaker's office does demonstrate a lack of judgement. Once again, the truth of it is that he did not trust his colleagues to allow them to make the selection for such an important position; he thought he would do it himself. He chose, again, another bad call that blew up in his face and further eroded the coalition's standing.


Mr Abbott failed again on the question of same-sex marriage. Whatever your view on the subject, he had so little confidence in his own backbench that he refused to give them an opportunity to even discuss the topic in their party room. For months, with mounting pressure, he had to be dragged kicking and screaming to allow an opinion to be expressed by his colleagues. A true leader is not afraid of his team's opinions. You ought to consult and listen. A real leader faces it and deals with it—but not Mr Abbott.


The cost of Mr Abbott's second-rate version of the National Broadband Network has blown out by $15 billion, and we are now paying more for an inferior service. It is extraordinary. In particular, the plight of Australians living in regional and rural parts of our country is highlighted by this government's failure to give adequate access to the NBN.


And let's look at Mr Abbott's economic credentials. The deficit has doubled since the coalition has been in power. After campaigning relentlessly to bring an end to the apparent budget emergency, Mr Abbott has made it worse. The MYEFO forecast a budget deficit twice as large as it was in the PEFO, when Labor was in office. It put paid to Mr Abbott's rhetoric before the election and since. Unemployment is up from 5.8 per cent when Labor was in office. It is now 6.2 per cent. That is 800,000 people unemployed, the highest number in more than 20 years.


What we have seen over the last two years under Mr Abbott is a lack of leadership: this government is not being led by a leader; this government is floundering around. It is a government making bad, stupid mistakes and embracing decisions which with common sense you would shy away from. Mr Abbott is a leader who has lost the trust and confidence of the Australian people as a result of his broken promises, bad 'captain's picks' and the gaffes that he continually makes. He has lost the confidence of his cabinet colleagues. Leadership speculation has been unfolding over the weekend and today—and it will be unfolding for the rest of this week. But it ought to be about trying to find a leader for the coalition—someone who actually can lead a government of any persuasion—because, at the moment, they are leaderless. They have a failed leader running this country at the moment, and some on the backbench and in the cabinet room see that and want to change. It is not up to this side to give you advice about change, but let me tell you that it is up to us to hold you to account. A government should be delivering good policy outcomes for the Australian people, and we have not seen any of that.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",Ind.,2015-09-14,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:48):  It is remarkable and shows a lack of any prescient foresight to ask Senator Ludlam to lead a debate about the failure of leadership. Senator Ludlam, when he was the Minister for Agriculture, was responsible for virtually shutting down Australia's cattle export industry, which decimated the livelihoods of farmers and absolutely decimated our relationship with Indonesia. One of the hallmarks of this government is that it has rebuilt international relations that were a disaster under the previous government. Whether it be Indonesia or our relationships right around the world, this government, led by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has a record of achievement, a record of mopping up the spills of the previous chaotic governments.


When we were elected, the Prime Minister very clearly said he was going to get rid of the carbon tax, get rid of the mining tax, stop the boats, stop the drownings at sea and work hard to rebuild our budget and our economy. And he has delivered on this. He stopped the boats. He stopped the 1000-plus deaths at sea that occurred under Labor and the Greens, who washed their hands and said, 'It's not our fault, it's not our responsibility, it can't be done.' But Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his team stopped the boats. It is a credit to him. One of the most humanitarian things that any government can do is to stop the senseless sacrifice of men, women and children on the perilous seas through poor policy making.


We also said we would stop the carbon tax to save the families of Australia $500 a year because it was not going to have any impact on the environment, it was merely a new tax impost for the government of the day. So how can it be a failure of leadership to deliver on what you promise? We said we would stop it, and we got rid of it.


And what about the mining tax? The mining tax was supposed to pay for a whole range of other schemes that Labor had implemented. But, of course, it collected next to no money. Only Labor and the Greens could implement a tax that actually cost more than it raised. It was one of the most inept pieces of public policy legislation, and it describes very accurately and succinctly just how hopeless things were under the chaos and dysfunction of the previous government.


True leadership is about having a vision for the country, and Prime Minister Abbott has demonstrated that in spades. He wanted to reduce the other side's budget deficit—and that is exactly what we have committed to doing—from $48 billion to around $7 billion in five years. And it was, of course, all about jobs because it is not much use having any other benefits unless you have a job or the opportunity to have one. There have been 335,000 additional jobs created under the policies led by Prime Minister Abbott. And 163,000 of those new jobs have been created so far in 2015.




Senator Carol Brown:
  There's the Prime Minister's job!




Senator BERNARDI:
  That is an average of 23,000 per month, for those who are struggling with the mathematics on the other side—23,000 new jobs every month and they are still complaining.


Importantly in that, it is worth noting that female workforce participation is at record levels.




Senator Carol Brown:
  In the cabinet!




Senator BERNARDI:
  There are over 171,000 more women in jobs than at any time since the 2013 election. These are good figures, and they are figures that are absolutely important to the welfare and benefit of this country.




Senator Ludwig:
  How are you voting in the spill?




Senator BERNARDI:
  Mr Deputy President, I will not be distracted by the jeers and the jibes from those on the other side. They have nothing to add to this discussion. They have nothing to add because they are all fluff and wind—that is how I would describe them.


They are the anti-jobs mob. They are the anti-leadership mob. They are already the mob that have no idea what they are going to take into the next election. Mr Abbott, of course, wanted to be known—and is known—as the infrastructure Prime Minister. He has a $50 billion infrastructure program to improve road and rail links. They are going to reduce travel times and support economic growth. Mr Abbott was in my own state of South Australia—a state, might I say, that is struggling under the yoke of 16 years' worth of Labor rule—this morning, pledging to support infrastructure and road and rail links, to reduce travel times and to support economic growth.


And, of course, Mr Abbott pledged to be the lower-taxing Prime Minister. What has he done? He has implemented tax cuts for small business, under the stewardship of the small business minister, Mr Bruce Billson, a man who has taken a passion for small business into cabinet—a place where the other side never had it. Small business is the engine room and the driver of employment and growth in our economy.


And whilst we are focusing on ridding regulation and bureaucratic bungling from small business, interfering with them creating jobs and making a business for themselves, those on the other side are all full of enquiry into the political intrigues of the day. This is where their focus is completely wrong—absolutely and completely wrong! Whilst they are focused on the minutiae, we are looking at the big picture and implementing a program that will see Australia prosper for decades to come under the stewardship of the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott.


I must also bell the cat here, because despite all the achievements that we have already enacted in getting the budget back into the black and making government smaller, funding for local hospitals is up by over 25 per cent over the next four years and funding for schools is up by 28 per cent over the next four years. That is because Prime Minister Abbott and his team are committed to local hospitals and to local health, and they are committed to the highest standards of education. Of course, with new childcare subsidies, working families with incomes of just over $65,000 and under $170,000 will be around $30 per week better off. These are important advancements for the families of Australia—better-educated children, better health care and assistance with child care affordability.


But there are broader concepts that the Abbott government has been leading the way in. And I have to suggest that one of the most important things that we can do is to stamp out and to root out corruption in the governance of the militant trade union movement, which is impacting on our progress in this country. There has been a royal commission established into trade union governance on the back of the cover-ups for Mr Craig Thomson. Do you remember him, Mr Deputy President? Mr Craig Thomson was the disgraced former member of the previous government, who embezzled a whole bunch of money from his union. They protected him and refused to drag him before the courts. But now he has been convicted.


There is also evidence of corruption in the trade union movement—of coercion and all sorts of shenanigans going on. None of this would have been uncovered without the insistence of Mr Abbott to get a good deal for the workers of this country. Because if you are not fighting for the workers you are fighting against them. And we are fighting for them. We are saying, 'If your union dues go into a union then they should be used appropriately.'


We have also dumped Labor's bank deposit tax. Do you remember that one, Mr Deputy President? That was when you put money in the bank and they were going to tax you on it. And when you took money out of the bank they were going to tax you on it—on the interest that you earned—because Labor are the big taxers. We have dumped that under the leadership of Mr Abbott. And we have also looked much further abroad. We have looked at the white paper on Northern Australia—we have released that. That is a comprehensive plan to unleash the economic potential of the region.


These are only a few—a few—of the many achievements of Mr Abbott in leading the government. It is not to say that leading any organisation—but particularly the nation—is not without challenge. And where those challenges have been thrown down we have handled them with aplomb. We have dealt with the vicissitudes of public life—the highs and the lows—and we have managed to keep ploughing on for the benefit of the people of Australia. It is absolutely imperative that we continue on the program, and we cannot afford to allow a Labor government to sneak back into power under the guise of falsehoods and misleading impressions. That is why we should be proud of this economic record— (Time expired)

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:58):  Well, 10 minutes is a long time in politics, isn't it, Senator Bernardi? We are debating the point here that in a little while may be academic—because we will know that at four o'clock, won't we, when Mr Turnbull has a media conference, as I understand it. It just shows the old adage still stands.


Of course, the Prime Minister—if in fact he is the Prime Minister in the not-too-distant future—has failed to show leadership in this country. I do not have time to go into all those matters; I will stick mainly to my specific portfolio areas.


The Prime Minister came into being the Prime Minister, saying that he was going to be the Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs. But one of the key constituencies that he has failed are, in fact, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. One of his first moves in his first budget was to cut over half a billion dollars' worth of funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples—cutting the heart out of key programs and cutting the heart out of some very important Aboriginal health funding.


Then, of course, he has presided over bringing a whole lot of programs from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander portfolio into Prime Minister and Cabinet, and he has put in place the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. The strategy is so bad that we have had to refer it to a Senate committee inquiry—and the committee is still undertaking that work. We know that many essential services have been cut. Because of the mistakes that were made, the gaps have been identified, and some of those have been filled, but you cannot cut half a billion dollars worth of Aboriginal funding without having very significant impacts on the delivery of services and supports.


Then we had the broken promise to introduce a justice target into Closing the Gap targets. The Prime Minister has presided over a situation in Australia where there are ever-increasing rates of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. He has failed to address that, failed to put in place justice reinvestment and, as I said, failed to put in place a justice target, which could then lead the rest of the country in addressing justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We have not seen any movement on implementing the over 21-year-old recommendations around deaths in custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


Here we have a government that has been intent on having a go at the most vulnerable in our community. Who can fail to draw the link when there are headlines on the front pages of the tabloids that, yet again, demonise people with disability and those on disability support pensions and then, all of a sudden, on the same day, an announcement by the government on a crackdown on people with disability trying to survive on disability support pensions? I do not think anybody in this country would deny a distinct link between those outrageous headlines and more attacks on people with disabilities.


One of the most egregious attacks was on the young people of this country. The Prime Minister started off his term, in fact, attacking young unemployed people, saying that they were couch-surfing and content to live at home. He followed that up with another outrageous budget cut in which he tried to force young people under the age of 30 to exist on nothing for six months. He redefined the age of young people and tried to make them survive on thin air. He said, 'By the way, while you're surviving on thin air, try to find 40 jobs at the same time.' When that was destined for certain defeat in this very place, the government changed tack and decided that they were only going to deny people income support for four weeks—actually, make that five weeks, because that was on top of the ordinary waiting period. That, fortunately, was also rejected just last week—thank goodness. But, not content, the government say that they are going to bring it back again. Where is the Prime Minister's leadership to say, 'Actually, we got that wrong. We apologise to the youth of Australia. We are going to now support you and not try to demonise you.'


Climate change has to be one of the vast areas of his failed leadership. In fact, his leadership was with climate deniers. He proudly put on a tinfoil hat to tilt at windmills and to have a go at wind turbines, and he supported the comments about how beautiful coalmining is. (Time expired)

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:03):  It looks like we might be on a unity ticket here because, just as we start this debate, Mr Turnbull is outside calling for a leadership spill. As I understand it, Ms Bishop might be as well. So we may be on a unity ticket. It might be the only unity ticket that this failed Prime Minister would actually keep. It is great to be on a unity ticket with most of the Senate today.


Let us go through the reasons we are at this point and the reasons for this matter of public importance, because they are very important to remember as we talk about the Prime Minister's failed leadership. This has come about not just because he runs around eating raw onions; it is not just because he reintroduced knights and dames and that a knighthood went to Prince Philip; it is not just because he appointed Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker; it is not just because he hung on to a 'rolled gold' paid parental leave scheme, which he was forced to abandon before now launching attacks on the current scheme; and it is not just because the 'Prime Minister for women' has largely left women out of his cabinet. It is not just because of all that. It is because this Prime Minister has failed the community. He failed them when he made those promises during the election campaign in 2013. He promised not to cut health, not to cut education and not to make any changes whatsoever to the GST. It is because of these and many more promises that the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, made to the people of Australia that we have come to this position now. We have come here to talk about Mr Abbott's failed prime ministership and his failed leadership.


But Mr Abbott cannot be held solely responsible for all of these broken promises and the faith that he has broken in the community. Each and every one of those ministers in this government must be held accountable. That includes Mr Turnbull, who has failed to deliver on the NBN. The NBN has blown out, he has underdelivered, it has cost more and it has taken longer. We have a second-rate NBN, and Mr Turnbull has delivered it. The community want their government to work for them. They do not want a government that is only about itself. For so long, it appeared that the only thing Mr Abbott was concerned about was trying to ensure that blue ties were the order of the day.


This government and Mr Abbott have failed in relation to the Australian economy. They are failing to provide jobs. Confidence is down. The national accounts show economic growth of 0.2 per cent for the quarter and seasonally adjusted GDP growth of two per cent. The June quarter results were disappointing, and they came on the back of other poor figures. This is the biggest quarterly decline in living standards since the global financial crisis, and that is because we have had a Prime Minister who is now under attack by some of his own ministers when they have had a hand in what has been occurring in this country. They have had a hand in what has been occurring, but he is now under attack because of his failed leadership. Too often, it has been about the Prime Minister's own position; it has not been about Australian workers, it has not been about Australian families and it has not been about keeping faith with the Australian community.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-09-14,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:08):  It is an interesting time to be talking about leadership. If you want to look at successful leadership then look at the leadership shown by this government around issues such as border protection. Let us look at the key things around border protection, from a humanitarian perspective, under the previous government: deaths at sea and children in detention. When the Howard government left office there were no children in detention. When the Rudd and Gillard governments came to office and implemented their policies we saw an almost open-door approach that has resulted in over 1,000 people dying. The poor quality of leadership—the lack of leadership—led to people dying and to 1,900 children in detention in July 2013. Do not forget that figure: over 1,900 children in detention, because of a lack of leadership from those on the opposite side.


Under this government we have seen—using the same Defence Force, the same departments and the same coast watch—determined and consistent leadership that has provided the kind of policy direction, consistency and support to those men and women who are serving on Operation Sovereign Borders to regain control of our borders. It has not been easy, but it has been done, and it has been done safely. And, most importantly, it has been done effectively. Because the same people were in the departments and the same equipment was available, the difference has been leadership. Commitment as well as a consistency and a certainty of purpose has driven that outcome. And that outcome means not only that there have been cost savings as a result of shutting down detention centres and not having to fly people on charter flights. We also heard the Assistant Minister for Immigration today talk about the fact that, unlike the $12 billion cost blow-out under the Labor Party, there have been savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars as we have been closing centres and not having to send flights.


But, importantly, the fact that we have been able to close down those detention centres and regain control of our borders has meant that we have had the capacity to show leadership on a world stage as the crisis in Syria has unfolded. People in this Senate will know that I spoke a couple of weeks ago about the Intelligence and Security Committee delegation I was part of, to the US, the UK and France, where we heard brief after brief about the dangers of the situation developing there with the millions of displaced people, both internally and externally, in refugee camps—about the very real humanitarian threat to those people as well as the issue of people increasingly starting to move in an uncontrolled manner into Europe. As that has accelerated in the past couple of weeks, on the world stage what we have seen from this government is true leadership. Not only is it about replacing our existing refugee intake but an additional 12,000 places have been made available by this government. That is leadership. If you compare that figure with that of other nations, it is more than the US's. The UK is taking a slightly numerically greater number, but that is over a number of years. If you look at the funding that is being applied, Australia is not only one of the most generous nations in actual dollar terms but, most importantly, unlike some countries that have pledged large amounts but have then not actually paid the money, Australia has made sensible and targeted commitments and followed through. That leadership is making a difference for the people in those camps—in Jordan, in Turkey—and for the people who are living in Lebanon, including those who are not necessarily in camps.


We are also seeing leadership in that it is not just a knee-jerk reaction, saying 'Come one, come all.' It is about looking at the fact that there are people involved in a conflict that is based on sectarian issues. There is a large Sunni population and a Shiah population who have been in conflict with each other for many years, and sometimes it flares to the surface. But look at the people who have been consistently oppressed. If you look at the numbers of the Jewish population, the Christian population and the Druze population in that part of the world, they have decreased dramatically over the last decade. Even if one day there is a peace of some sort that is resolved in that part of the world, with whatever happens with Daesh or whatever happens with the Assad regime, even if they can somehow with their supporters in Russia and Iran or in Saudi Arabia or other countries reach some kind of long-term peace, the issue for these persecuted minorities is that they will still not have a place. 


It is a documented fact that Christians are now the most persecuted religious group in the world. There are a number of studies that demonstrate this fact. It is leadership from this government that says we recognise that everyone, regardless of their creed, is suffering right now, in the short term. But in the medium to long term, who has no options in that part of the world? Who has no medium- or long-term future in that part of the world? It is leadership from this government that has secured our borders, given us the capacity to take additional people, made the Australian public trusting of a government who can secure their borders and enabled us to reach out to bring in the most persecuted, the most needy, and not only give them a safe haven in the short term but also provide the leadership to give them a meaningful settlement program that will give them a future. It is a leadership that brings communities in Australia, the diaspora of the Orthodox churches and others, together to provide the support for these people so that when they come here they can settle in this nation and build a new life for themselves and their children. 


Long-term leadership is about statesmanship. It is not just about the next election. It is about having an eye on the next generation. There are a number of steps that this government has taken which show true long-term leadership. (Time expired)

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2015-09-14,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:16):  Today I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, the Prime Minister's failed leadership. Quite frankly, Australians are sick of this self-indulgent BS. The average unemployment rate is 6.2 per cent. In Victoria it is 6.1 per cent and in South Australia it is 7.9 per cent. These figures concern me. They concern me more than today's MPI stunt. I do not make any excuses for the current Prime Minister or former prime ministers but I would like to point out that I do not hold the other two prospective candidates in any higher regard, namely Mr Turnbull and Mr Shorten. Instead, I think we as a parliament should stop bickering about the Prime Minister's leadership and instead focus on our country and our people.


When I think about failures in government, I think of Manus Island, I think of the fact that no contracts were signed for the building of our submarines or our frigates under the previous governments, I think of the loss of the car industry and I think of the fact that governments of all persuasions have not established a sensible Australian procurement policy. When it comes to determining whether a Prime Minister has failed, I would prefer to let the ultimate judge be the Australia people at election time, not faceless men who have moved up the party-political ranks through deals and delusion. 


Today, let me speak about how the office of Prime Minister has failed over successive governments, both Labor and Liberal. In my working life alone, I have seen the car manufacturing and heavy industry shrink. We had Nissan and we had Mitsubishi; we still currently have Ford, Toyota and Holden. I have seen the demise of Massey Ferguson, Vickers Ruwolt, and Jacques, the industrial engineering group. I have seen the breakup of BHP and its divisions. BHP was a conglomerate of engineering and manufacturing, oil and gas—from Rheem hot water services to Waratah farm fencing, and structural steel for our bridges and our buildings. The steel industry is currently in crisis because of materials dumped on our shores. Emerging economies across the world are trying to build and maintain a manufacturing base, while we are letting ours go to rack and ruin. Many nations look upon Australia with contempt in the knowledge that we have a car industry yet we are bidding it good-riddance.


Our governments, of all persuasions, seem to be all talk. One would think, with the amount of white and green papers coming out of this place, that government might be able to advance Australia's interests—but I guess that would just be naive. When I have CEOs and presidents of large multinational companies coming into my office and telling me that their company is reluctant to further invest in Australia because of the consistent chatter about leadership—whether it be Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott or Malcom Turnbull—I wonder what the hell is going on. Sometimes I think Australian industry might be better off if parliament did not sit and politicians just kept their mouths shut. As I said in my maiden speech:


If we are not making decisions that make the lives of Australians better, then we should at least make sure we do not make them any worse.


Currently we have a tsunami of job losses approaching us from the demise of the automotive and component manufacturing sectors. We are on the verge of delivering hopelessness, despair and a lack of self-esteem, self-worth and self-respect to tens of thousands of Australians. People are asking us to stop bickering and get on with the job of managing the country for the benefit of all Australians. Our economy is currently hostage to commodity prices, peaks and troughs, and we seem to be a country that is unwilling to add value and to strive to provide meaningful employment for all Australians. 


Only this afternoon I was speaking to a chap who, during his 40-year working life, started a company in the 1990s. The company exported to the world and they currently still do. He said:


We, as a nation, no longer have the ability to do non-ferrous metal extrusion in this country.


For those of you who do not know, non-ferrous materials include metals like copper and alloys like brass. We cannot do that very basic thing on our own shores.

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2015-09-14,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (16:21):  I too rise to speak on this matter of public importance, the Prime Minister's failed leadership. No prime minister has ever let down the people of Australia and the people of the Northern Territory as badly as Mr Abbott has, and he is being challenged, right now, because of it. Mr Abbott's leadership has been two years of unfairness, broken promises, negativity, fear and loathing. 


On some levels, the Prime Minister seems to have offended most of the country. In Mr Abbott's world, women seem to do nothing but iron clothes, Australia was empty before the First Fleet arrived and Aboriginal people living on their traditional lands is just a lifestyle choice. Mr Abbott's world is full of misunderstanding of the people he was elected to govern. He thought Australians would put up with a Medicare co-payment, $100,000 university degrees and a knighthood for Prince Philip. The reactions of Australians have shown the Prime Minister just how out of touch he is. They have shown him that they will not put up with unfairness, fearmongering or ministers who mislead.


I want to tell the Prime Minister—if it is still Mr Abbott!—how he has hurt Territorians and why the Northern Territory will not put up with him any longer. By the sound of it, neither will his own cabinet. The people of the Northern Territory and the whole of northern Australia are smarter than the coalition give them credit for. Contrary to what Mr Dutton thinks, we do not operate on 'Cape York time' or 'Territory time'. The people of the Northern Territory have suffered under the double whammy of the woeful—I repeat: woeful—Country Liberal government in the Northern Territory and the Abbott government here in Canberra. The woeful Country Liberal government in the Northern Territory have become a laughing stock in Australia, and I will tell you why, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams—because we have had 14 cabinet reshuffles, 2½ chief ministers, four treasurers, and four members who have defected, all in the space of three years. You could not make that up if you tried. 


Territorians have been slugged by the Abbott government's cuts, delays and incompetence. Much of the funding under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy is needed in the Northern Territory, but it was cut in half; half a billion dollars for Aboriginal services across this country have been ripped out of the IAS. People in the Northern Territory bush and outstations have been let down by this government. Health, education and nutritional organisations have all been hurt. Legal aid services have suffered and face continued uncertainty. Hundreds of people are wondering whether they will have a job in the coming months, the next six months or next year. Hundreds face the possibility of having to represent themselves in court because of the funding cuts. Childcare centres have closed, school attendance is not getting any better and homelands face closure under the CLP and the coalition government. The people of the Northern Territory have been let down by this government. Since coming into office in 2012, the Northern Territory Country Liberal government has been characterised by division, chaos and lies. 


Since coming into government in 2013, the Abbott government has made it worse for the people of the Northern Territory. The cost of living has gone up. Power and water prices have gone up. Unemployment is up. There are big delays to all kinds of government programs and infrastructure projects. 


Under these two governments, there have been two major delays. One is to the Palmerston hospital, which is now years behind. The member for Solomon in the other place promised her electorate that the construction of the hospital would start in 2014. It is almost the end of 2015, and nothing has started. The other is the children's wing at Royal Darwin Hospital, which is also now not going ahead, again thanks to the total lack of commitment to the health of Territorians from both the CLP and the federal coalition government. 


The Abbott government failed on school funding. Labor committed to proper schools funding in the Northern Territory. The Abbott government backed down on Gonski funding, and the CLP has slashed teachers like you would not believe, including support staff across Territory schools. Class sizes are up and workloads for teachers are up. It is no wonder that the people of the Territory are turning their backs on Mr Adam Giles and Mr Abbott. They have failed to take notice of the very real struggles faced by everyday Territorians. They are completely out of touch with Territory communities.


This is all occurring against the backdrop of constant talk about the development of northern Australia. Labor support the meaningful development of northern Australia. We support sustainable economic development in the Top End. We support increased employment opportunities for Aboriginal people and all Territorians. But how can the Abbott government honestly say that they are taking Northern Territory development seriously when they are slashing and burning their way through the north? They talk about great big, new projects, but guess what, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams? Not a single new project in the Top End has been delivered by the Abbott government, not even projects started by the previous Territory and federal Labor governments, like the Palmerston hospital and the children's wing at the Royal Darwin Hospital, as I said before, which have both been delayed. The member for Solomon has failed to lobby the Prime Minister to move any of this forward; and, if she did lobby him, she too has failed miserably. The people of Lingiari are fortunate to have my colleague Warren Snowdon to stand up for them here in Canberra. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about Mrs Griggs. 


It is not just the Prime Minister who has failed the people of the Territory; most of his cabinet have too. The Treasurer, Mr Hockey, told Australia that poor people do not drive cars, at a time when Territorians were paying more for fuel than people anywhere else in Australia. Mr Pyne has slashed education funding while the Northern Territory struggles to catch up with the rest of Australia in our education standards. And, on Friday, Mr Dutton referred to 'Cape York time' as if he thinks northern Australia is behind the times. He seems to think that the north cannot keep up. This represents a major problem in the Abbott government, and we are seeing things unravel today. They simply do not have the respect of northern Australia. They do not trust that the north of Australia can look after itself. It makes a complete mockery of their so-called commitment to northern Australia, as I have previously said.


Mr Tony Abbott's leadership lacks compassion and creativity—and love from his own party, by the sound of what is happening right now. Every time he is asked about his government's record to date, he starts telling us about the things he has stopped, banned or pulled down. He has not created anything good that Australia can feel proud of. He is a wrecker, not a builder. 


This government has failed the people in the north. Territorians are sick and tired of the broken promises, chaos and dysfunction that have just gotten worse since Adam Giles and Mr Abbott took over. The member for Solomon has failed to protect Darwin and Palmerston from her boss in Canberra. The CLP have failed to deliver for Territorians since they were elected in 2012. 


The Prime Minister's failed leadership has cost the Territory jobs and perhaps cost him his own job. It has cost money. It has cost us health and education outcomes. The end cannot come soon enough.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-09-14,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:29):  Clearly there are momentous events occurring outside of this chamber right now. With all due respect to Senator Peris, I think the Australian people would expect a more considered contribution in that event than simply the stale talking points and sound bites from a staffer's or opposition leader's written speech. One of the problems we have had in Australian politics over the past few years is the rise of Blackberry politics, if you like—that we all tend to simply read points off our mobile phones that are emailed to us in the morning—and I think the Australian people can see through it. I think the Australian people realise it and we are all suffering because of it.


Today I want to start with a bit of history. I was reminded on the weekend by Minister Barnaby Joyce. He is a student of history himself. He gave a speech to the National Party convention and quoted Ecclesiastes: There is Nothing New Under the Sun. I certainly think that what we are experiencing today is nothing new under the sun as well. Barnaby wanted to quote Roman history and I want to do so too, but it is a very different part of Roman history. I am not sure if Senator Ryan is a student of Roman history, but, Senator Ryan, you might remember that there was a particularly handsome emperor called Commodus, otherwise known as Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator. Commodus was a disaster as an emperor. He was a tyrant and an evil one at that, and the empire was in a mess when he was subjected to his fate by the Praetorian Guards. They installed a guy called Pertinax. Pertinax promised the Praetorian Guards a large sum of money, but he never came through with that, so the Praetorian Guards dealt with him and he was gone. The problem was that they did not have a replacement. Instead of simply choosing the best person for the job, the Praetorian Guards established an auction at the time.




Senator Wong:
  Why don't you mention Tony Abbott? This is about Tony Abbott.




Senator CANAVAN:
  You might learn something, Senator Wong. You had best listen up.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order on my left, Senator Wong! Things were going very well until you interrupted.




Senator CANAVAN:
  The Praetorian Guards set up an auction. They decided to say to the Roman people, 'You decide. Whoever can pay us the most amount of money can become emperor,' and that is what happened. There was an auction between a guy called Sulpicianus, who was the father-in-law of Pertinax, and Didius Julianus. Sulpicianus started the bidding at 5,000 drachmas, but eventually Didius Julianus won at 6,200. It was an unbecoming act for the empire. It was effectively a standing auction on who could be emperor. Unfortunately, I think something is happening with the Australian body politic as well at the moment, because we are being subject to a bidding process through polls and popularity, not through the policy consequences of what we are doing. It is an unbecoming process and it is not one that I think the Australian people hold us in high regard for doing. If we continue to enter into this cycle and continue to be slaves to an announcement of polling results every fortnight, the Australian people will continue to think less of us every time.


In my view, we should seek to re-establish trust in this chamber and in the other chamber and in this parliament—a trust that has deteriorated and been downgraded in the past eight years. We have become fat and lazy and complacent on a couple of decades of very good government. Now we—and I think all political parties have been subject to this in the past few years—have failed to show that leadership, that constancy, that consistency and that stability that the Australian people expect of us. We will not restore our trust until we can rekindle and refine what we had not that long ago.


I am standing at the Whip's chair. I am a National Party senator and I am very proud. I want to make comment on other political parties, but I am very proud that the National Party has had 12 leaders in 95 years. While those leaders have gone through great tumult and change through decades, there has been a very reliable element of constancy, stability and certainty from the National Party and, before that, the Country Party. When you read National Party history, there is a great story. After Earle Page lost the leadership, Archie took over briefly, but there was a bit of tumult at the time and there was a leadership spill between John McEwen and another gentleman whose name escapes me—he never became leader. John McEwen tied the leadership with this guy in 1939, I think. They could not break the tie, so they installed Arthur Fadden as a temporary leader, but then, of course, World War II broke out—




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I appreciate that these are wide-ranging discussions, but the MPI is on the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott—the current Prime Minister's failed leadership. He has not touched on that for some time.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, there is no point of order. This is about leadership and Senator Canavan is drawing an analogy. Continue, Senator Canavan.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. As I was saying, John McEwen lost that leadership battle and Arthur Fadden took over as a temporary leader. He was eventually made permanent during World War II because of the war. Arthur Fadden remained leader until 1957. So McEwen was one vote away in 1939 and did not take over as leader until 1957. As somewhat of a conservative, I do perhaps miss the patience that might have been shown by a different generation. I think the Australian people also share some frustration with the level of self-centredness and selfishness that sometimes leaders display in this place. I can only speak for my own contribution in this place, but I will always try to live up to the example that we should be putting the Australian people first with every decision we make.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator CANAVAN:
  We should not just be putting the Australian people first; we should be putting the future of our country first, the future of our nation first, and protect our future generations with an example that demonstrates our ability to run this country in a way that is respectful and consistent over many decades.




Senator Wong:
  Forgot to mention the Prime Minister!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, I bring to your attention standing order 197 and foreshadow to you that I am a little less tolerant of interjections than some others who sit in this chair.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, I am speaking. I bring to your attention that interjections are disorderly. We will now move along.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No, we will now move along. I bring to your attention that interjections are disorderly, and please do not answer me back. Is that clear? We will move along.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator Canavan:
  Give it a rest, Penny.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! We will move along.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, order!

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right! Senator Canavan! Do you have a point of order, Senator Wong?




Senator Wong:
  I was only making the point that you were chiding me but allowing Senator Canavan to interject across the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  If we had a little time we would have a session on that. We are going to move along now, and I ask that senators respect the chamber. Interjections are disorderly. We will continue. I shall now proceed to the consideration of documents. The documents are listed on page 4 of today's Order of Business. Are there any ministerial statements?

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (STANDING) BILL 2015


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) is Australia's national environment law and is amongst the most stringent in the world. It provides a legal framework to facilitate sustainable development, while protecting nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities, migratory birds, heritage places and water resources.


Over fifteen years, the Act has provided certainty for projects and ensured protection of the environment. 


Since coming to government we have undertaken a careful reform process through:


1. Establishing a One-Stop Shop for environmental assessments with all states and territories.


2. Approval of projects with a construction or resource value of over $1 trillion. Many of these projects and much of this value was the result of clearing the backlog of projects in some way deferred or delayed by the previous government.


3. Reduced approval timeframes by up to 50%.


This has meant that not only do we have world class environmental standards, we have world class administration. Our reforms are about protecting the integrity of the EPBC Act.


However, a major threat to the administration of the EPBC Act has emerged recently. This is the direct Americanisation through the use of litigation to ""disrupt and delay key projects and infrastructure"" within Australia and to directly ""increase investor risk"".


This is an unprecedented new development in Australia, drawing the worst features of the American litigation industry into Australia.


Currently we see actions in state courts against three major Galilee basin projects, which the Queensland Government is now defending. The intention and reality is that major resource projects and infrastructure are similarly subject to challenge in federal law.


I refer to the following quote from a former Labor Treasurer in today's Brisbane Courier Mail:


""....green activism had increased the costs of developing a mine by up to 10 times.""


""....a development that took just over a year in 2008 would now take up to five years as companies get weighed down by litigation.""


""I agree with everything the Federal Government is doing.""


Contrary to the intentions of the EPBC Act, the federal law is now being used to ""disrupt and delay"" infrastructure. The strategy is almost completely disconnected from concerns which were the intended purpose of the EPBC Act.


In 2011 a number of organisations produced a document expressly setting out a plan to ""disrupt and delay key projects and infrastructure"". It expressly set the goal of ""increasing investor risk"" in Australia.


The groups who helped develop the document included Greenpeace, the New South Wales and Queensland Environment Defenders Office, Lock the Gate, Beyond Zero Emissions, Get Up, the Mackay Conservation Group and the Australia Institute among others. 


Interestingly, the trade union United Voice was also involved in the document's production.


The document's strategy was simple – as outlined on page three – 


""to 'disrupt and delay' key projects and infrastructure while gradually eroding public and political support for the industry"".


After outlining the six elements of the strategy which focused on increasing investor risk and costs, section 4.1 discussed litigation.


 ""Legal challenges can stop projects outright, or it can delay them in order to buy time to build a much stronger movement and powerful public campaigns. They can also expose the impacts, increase costs, raise investor uncertainty, and create a powerful platform for public campaigning.""


The express objectives include:


1. ""Mount legal challenges to the approval of several key ports, mines and rail lines.


2. Run legal challenges that delay, limit or stop all of the major infrastructure projects (mines, rail and ports) that have been identified as a high priority in the strategy.""


This is undoubtedly contrary to the intent of the EPBC Act which was to create certainty based on stringent environmental assessments. Indeed the EPBC Act was created to provide certainty for the environment and for project proponents.


It is very clear that the EPBC Act was not intended to be used to ""disrupt and delay key projects and infrastructure"".


The document then outlines in detail how tactics can be imported from the United States. Page 11 clearly states:


""Traditionally, environmental organizations have tended to employ ""projects officers"" with a research, policy and advocacy focus or campaigners who design and lead campaigns themselves. 


This is in stark contrast to the organizing model widely (and successfully) in the US where ""community Organizers"" support grassroots leaderships and Organize communities to build and express their own power.""


The objective is clear – it is to design a community organising model that adapts the ""US organizing techniques to an Australian context."" Let us be clear about what this represents.


This is not some community based grassroots campaign. 


This is a US-style top-down litigation approach which expressly seeks to use third party involvement in US style litigation to ""disrupt and delay key projects and infrastructure."" 


What we have seen to date is a well funded and coordinated strategy to frustrate the careful consideration of the EPBC Act approval process which is by any measure one of the most stringent in the world.


This is the explicit Americanisation of environmental campaigning with its focus on tying up projects in legal challenges where the goal is not to win, but to disrupt and delay.


Therefore we are seeking to bring the EPBC Act standing provision in-line with the broad Commonwealth standing provisions so as to ensure that it is those with a genuine and direct interest in a matter who have the right to standing and to protect their interests under section 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (ADJR Act).




The need to normalise the EPBC Act



Section 487 of the EPBC Act sets out an extended standing far beyond the Commonwealth ADJR Act provisions. 


In particular, the section enables individuals, organisations or associations who have, at any time in the two years immediately prior to the decision in question, engaged in a series of activities in Australia or an external territory for protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment, to commence proceedings for judicial review under the ADJR Act.


This provision of the EPBC Act was well intentioned; however it has now become the basis for the Americanisation of the Australian justice system. It allows virtually any person or group to bring a lawsuit, regardless of whether they are adversely affected or even near a project. This is out of step with Commonwealth law and has provided a legal loophole for activists to exploit.


Lawsuits that are designed purely to delay a project, increase costs and increase uncertainty for investors, and create a platform for campaigning, undermine the intention of the EPBC Act to provide a process with both high standards and certainty for assessing proposals.


It is informative to note that Dr Moss Cass, Minister for the Environment in the Whitlam Government, oversaw the introduction of the legislation which preceded the EPBC Act. In this legislation, there was no special treatment for environmental groups. 


When passing that legislation, Dr Cass stated in his second reading speech that the government had decided not to have wide standing provisions. He noted difficulties in the United States arising from its environmental impact assessment due to ""too frequent a resort to the courts"".


Twenty years later, the then Government in good faith gave environmental groups greater rights to intervene. This provision has now been distorted by bringing and threatening lawsuits designed only to delay and frustrate proponents. We now need to reinforce the purpose and intention of the EPBC Act, while preserving legitimate rights.


Section 5 of the ADJR Act sets the standard definition for Commonwealth law regarding who can make an application for judicial review as any aggrieved person. An aggrieved person includes a person whose interests are adversely affected by the decision.


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015 (the Bill) will repeal section 487 to normalise the EPBC Act in line with the standing provisions of the ADJR Act. 


This is exactly the same standing as the National Crime Authority Act 1984.


Exactly the same standing as the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002.


Exactly the same standing as the Biosecurity Act 2015.


Exactly the same standing as the Australian Energy Market Act 2004.


Exactly the same standing as the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988.


The EPBC Act standing provisions were always intended to allow the genuine interests of an aggrieved person whose interests are adversely affected to be preserved. This will continue to be the case.


The EPBC Act standing provisions were never intended to be extended and distorted for political purposes as is now occurring with the US style litigation campaign to ""disrupt and delay key projects and infrastructure"" and ""increase investor risk"".


Changing the EPBC Act will not prevent those who may be affected by a project from seeking judicial review. It will maintain and protect their rights. However, it will prevent those, with no connection to the project, other than a political ambition to stop development, from using the courts to disrupt and delay key infrastructure where it has been appropriately considered under the EPBC Act.


Conclusion


Since coming into government we have applied the highest environmental standards. We have halved the time for environmental approvals and cleared the backlog of projects left by Labor. 


We have approved over $1 trillion in projects and established a One-Stop Shop for environmental assessments. All while maintaining environmental standards.


Indeed, the World Heritage Committee not only reversed the direction we inherited of the Great Barrier Reef being on the 'watch list' with a direct path to being placed on the 'in-danger list', it lifted the Great Barrier Reef back to the highest rank of World Heritage listing and praised Australia as a global role model only seven weeks ago.


With this Bill we are seeking to restore certainty to the EPBC Act, prevent the Americanisation of Australian trial litigation, while reaffirming the sanctity of EPBC Act processes and the ongoing rights of genuinely concerned landowners and other similar parties.


I commend the Bill to the House. 


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (20:33):  Just a few months ago, Mr Turnbull, who this afternoon mounted a challenge to the PM, was backing in the PM. On the 7.30 Report in March he described the PM as having 'many strengths' and of being an 'intelligent' and a 'brave man'. Mr Turnbull went on to say:


The Liberal Party is at its strongest when the leading figures in the party ... are seen to be as close as possible.


How could you trust someone who on the one hand says the Prime Minister has many strengths and on the other hand makes the comments about the Prime Minister that Mr Turnbull made today, just a few months later, saying the Prime Minister 'has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs'? How do Australian voters, particularly the voters in Canning, work out what the truth is—the first comments by Mr Turnbull or the second comments? What is the truth? That is what Canning voters want to know.


What does Mr Turnbull believe in? Well, here are some hints. In his first speech he said, 'When things do not succeed, it's about getting up and having another go.' There is nothing here about changing your policies; just grinding on and on with the same old, tired message. On business, Mr Turnbull said:


We need to ensure that no regulation and no compliance burden is imposed on business unless it is absolutely necessary and the policy objective cannot be achieved in any other way.


But of course, when it comes to trade unions and indeed employer associations, it seems that Mr Turnbull was prepared to overlook this strong sentiment and vote for regulatory burden. Just a few weeks ago, on ChAFTA Mr Turnbull said:


All reform necessarily involves winners and losers—but in the ChAFTA context the winners overwhelmingly outnumber the losers.


The losers in ChAFTA are Australian workers. Those are whom Mr Turnbull is talking about here. Such contempt from potentially the next Prime Minister for Australian workers and Australian jobs! We have seen it all before. There is nothing new here.


Today in his 'I'm going to challenge' announcement, Mr Turnbull extolled the virtues of John Howard and his good cabinet. Remember, this was the cabinet of Work Choices, the cabinet whose policies were so harsh that the Prime Minister lost his seat. Mr Turnbull wants to go back to that style of cabinet. 'That's what we need to go back to,' he said—the cabinet of Work Choices. The parallels are there between the communication and mistruths on Howard's Work Choices and the mistruths and outright lies on ChAFTA in Mr Abbott's cabinet.


Quite frankly, I cannot see the difference between the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, and the challenger, Mr Turnbull, and I doubt very much that the voters in Canning can see that difference either. There has been nothing about policies from Mr Turnbull, the man who backed in all of the budget cuts of the Abbott government. Apparently—according to Mr Turnbull—we just need another leader. There is nothing about new policies.


On the Canning by-election, after spending a million dollars shoring up the Prime Minister's job, the Liberal party has now decided—or at least Malcolm Turnbull has decided—that the million dollars is not money well-spent and that what is needed here is a change of leader. How out of touch are both Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull to just disregard the spending of a million dollars so far on Canning? I wonder if hordes of staff are standing at shredders right now shredding the campaign material for Canning which featured the Prime Minister. Indeed, will they have time between now and Saturday to design and print new material with a potential new leader? Why would voters of Canning vote for a party that topples its leader, that topples the Prime Minister of Australia?


Apparently, Mr Turnbull believes that it will improve their chances in Canning and that they do need to ditch the leader. He has said:


From a practical point of view, a change of leadership would improve our prospects in Canning …


I wonder what the Liberal candidate is saying out there in the seat of Canning. I know firsthand that when I speak to voters in Canning what they do not like are the policies of the Liberal government. No matter who the leader is, it is the policies out there.


How would Mr Turnbull manage the economy, when under his ministerial leadership the NBN has blown out by $15 billion? This explosion in cost will ultimately deliver a slower NBN. Seriously, do we really need another failed minister as the next Prime Minister?


On the harsh, cruel budget cuts of the past, Mr Turnbull's message was clear. It is all in the selling of the message, he has said in a simple six-point plan that he spelt out at the Brisbane Club a couple of months ago, and he has said similar in his challenge today:


A style of leadership that respects the people's intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it.


There it is once again: no policy change, just a change in how the message is delivered. Mr Turnbull's six-point plan starts like this: government must take action, including highlighting problems clearly and repetitively. It must explain the need for reform. He sets that out very clearly. The Abbott government has done this over and over, and guess what? It is not the explanation of the message that is the problem; it is the message itself.


In step six, the last step, Mr Turnbull says you 'identify the losers'. That is what he said at the Brisbane Club. You identify the losers—those that will lose from change—and, to the extent possible, assist them to adjust. He said in ChAFTA that there are winners and losers. Do you remember that? How out of touch and arrogant of Mr Turnbull to simply assert that all you need to do once you have put forward the other five steps of your six-step plan is to assist them—presumably the public and the voters of Canning—to adjust: adjust to health cuts, adjust to cuts in education, adjust to $100,000 degrees, adjust to cuts in income, adjust to higher costs at the doctor, adjust to a freeze on superannuation contributions, adjust to cuts to the pension, adjust to longer waiting periods for benefits, adjust to a failed climate change policy, adjust to no science minister and savage cuts to the CSIRO, adjust to no housing minister and savage cuts to the capital component of homelessness funding, adjust to cuts in penalty rates, adjust to cuts to working conditions in their Fair Work Amendment Bill currently before the Senate.


At every turn, the attack on working Australians, young people, university students, trade unions, pensioners and families from the Abbott government is fully endorsed by Mr Turnbull, who thinks that all you need to do is have a six-point plan to sell your message. All this is from a failed opposition leader who showed Australians then that he was out of touch and arrogant. All of this is from the challenger to the Prime Minister. There is nothing about a change in policy. Australian voters, particularly those in the seat of Canning, have seen through this and they just want the Liberal Party out of office as soon as possible.
