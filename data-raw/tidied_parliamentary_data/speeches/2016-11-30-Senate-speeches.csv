Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:09):  I seek leave to amend amendment (1) on sheet 8026, which is currently before us, by inserting after '29 November 2018' the words 'expressions of interest' and the words 'be awarded', so it would now read: 'before 29 November 2018, submit expressions of interest, tender for and be awarded building work funded, whether directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority'. To assist senators I have circulated a revised sheet 8026, which does include this amendment.

(aa) matters required or permitted by this Act to be prescribed by the regulations; or

The first two clauses of these amendments are something that Senator Hinch has worked on. I commend him for it. They relate to broadening the scope of the objects of the bill, to add the words 'encouraging youth employment with an emphasis on engaging apprentices,' which is a very worthy objective, and I think it puts a focus on the bill.


I will spend more time speaking in relation to examination notices and AAT oversight. These amendments maintain the current administrative oversight for the use of coercive powers. An Administrative Appeals Tribunal presidential member will be required to issue the examination notice, rather than the ABC Commissioner as the current bill allows. This is a safeguard against any misuse of coercive power. Other associated provisions from part 3, chapter 7, have also been incorporated.


These amendments addresses some concerns about the coercive powers in this bill, although I note that coercive powers are used in other pieces of legislation with the ACCC, ASIC, APRA, but it is important to note that the coercive powers are not new. In 2012, under the former Labor government coercive powers were retained, with safeguards, for the FWBC. One of those safeguards was oversight by the AAT, which required an AAT presidential member to issue the examination notice.


These amendments also clarify that a person who is the subject of an examination notice does have the right to a lawyer. There have been countless times when I have heard senior members of the opposition say that this bill takes away the right to legal representation. The text of clause 61(4) of the current bill states :


A person attending before the ABC Commissioner, or before an assistant, as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c) may be represented by a lawyer if the person chooses.


It seems pretty clear that there is a right to legal representation. However, to make it abundantly clear, these amendments will change the wording to read:


The person may, if he or she so chooses, be represented at the examination by a lawyer of the person's choice.


I think we can all confidently say that, without a doubt, someone who is the subject of an examination has the right to legal representation and to choose their own lawyer. There are also amendments to ensure that the AAT presidential members appointed to issue examination notices continue to do so when the ABCC is established. I am very happy to answer any questions in respect of these amendments.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:14):  I am just beginning to wonder why this government, for three years, held a position of moving from the Fair Work Building Commission act to the bill that they have here, which has been amended, amended, amended and amended again. Why did we have these three years of rhetoric about the need for all these changes in the Fair Work Building Commission when we are really back to the legislation of the Fair Work Building Commission.


We support this amendment. We would rather go back completely to a position where workers get a fair go in this country and you do not have the code denying workers access to negotiate on reasonable terms and conditions in the building industry—the same rights that workers in every other industry in this country have and are being denied to building and construction workers. I just do not get it. I just do not get this government. There were three years of saying, 'This is absolutely essential to restore law and order in the building industry,' and then they cave-in—anything to get a win; anything to get a position where they can say at the end of the period, 'We have got our ABCC bill through parliament.'


This is not the ABCC bill that the extremists in the coalition want. This is not the ABCC bill that the Abbott crew would want. This is still a bad bill, but they have been pulled back so much that it is an absolute embarrassment for them from where they were with the hard-nosed rhetoric that they were on about. We will support this amendment, but we will be continuing to push a proposition that workers should be able to negotiate and bargain on the same issues as every worker in the country—that is, including building workers. They should have the right to negotiate and bargain on exactly the same terms and conditions as every other worker in the country.


Senator Xenophon, there are the statements that both you and Senator Hinch have made about the worst public servant in the country, Mr Nigel Hadgkiss. I hope that the government starts to listen about having a biased person there. We should just get that fixed. We will support this, but we have other amendments as well.

Regulations made by the Governor‑General for the purposes of a provision of the old Act referred to in column 1 of the table that are in force immediately before the transition time continue in force after that time as if the regulations were rules made by the Minister for the purposes of the provision of the new Act referred to in column 2 of the table.

(j) details of the number, and type, of matters for which examination notices were issued under this Act.


(7) Clause 21, page 23 (line 31), omit ""character."", substitute ""character; and"".


(8) Clause 21, page 23 (after line 31), at the end of subclause (3), add:


(c) will uphold the APS Values set out in section 10 of the Public Service Act 1999, including by performing his or her functions in an apolitical manner and acting impartially and professionally.

(10) Clause 28, page 25 (after line 29), at the end of subclause (1), add:


(c) if the Commissioner fails to perform his or her functions with impartiality as between all categories of building industry participants.


These amendments that I move with my colleague Senator Hinch relate to the functions of the ABC Commissioner, to reporting obligations and issues of termination and appointment. I want to make this absolutely clear: this amendment makes some changes to the language contained in the current bill.


Clause (16) of the bill will be amended so that the functions of the ABC Commissioner's function, to the extent that it is possible, are carried out in an impartial manner across all building industry participants. Clause (20) of the bill will be amended to include additional reporting requirements in the annual report. This amendment will increase transparency and accountability and also require the annual report to include details of compliance activity against building employers—something that is not done now. The level of accountability under the current framework as proposed is not satisfactory, and I am pleased the government is prepared to agree to these extra accountability and transparency measures.


Clause (21) of the bill will be amended to include a requirement for the ABC Commissioner to uphold the Australian Public Service values set out in section 10 of the Public Service Act 1999 and expressly states that the ABC Commissioner will perform his or her functions in an apolitical manner and will act impartially and professionally. Clause (28) of the bill will be amended to include an additional ground of failing to act impartially between all categories of building industry participants.


I have said what I have had to say about the importance of impartiality. These amendments actually do something about it. They actually give a remedy if someone is behaving egregiously and in a partial manner that is not being fair to all building industry participants. I commend these amendments that I move with my colleague Senator Hinch.

Maybe the commissioner will now have to get a diary.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:23):  We need to understand what is going on here with the Building Code. We do just need to reflect on the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Act may not be perfect—that would be our starting point—but it does give protection to people's rights at work. I would even say it is a step to making Australia a fairer place. That is why we just need to consider what is going on with this amendment and with the Building Code in that context. The essence of the Fair Work Act does say that employees and employers can bargain about their conditions for their workplace. The really important aspect of it is that once they reach agreement those conditions have the force of law. That is the centrepiece and that is what the government is essentially trying to knock out—to absolutely destroy how industrial relations work. That is why we need to identify that essence of the Fair Work Act.


Let's remember what we achieve when we have that act in place, and what can end up having the force of law behind it: the hours of work, supporting apprentices and the issue of casualisation—one of the biggest problems facing the workforce in Australia. And then there is the contracting out that is going on. There are so many areas of our working conditions that are negotiated and that is why we need to ensure that this amendment is supported.


As a matter of basic principle, if an agreement complies with the Fair Work Act, that should be enough. The Fair Work Act already has a number of strict requirements about what can and cannot be in agreements. A Fair Work Commissioner is required to vet every agreement before it is approved and ensure it complies with the laws. That is why the Greens support the amendment and we urge that the Senate does so.

The first two clauses of these amendments are something that Senator Hinch has worked on. I commend him for it. They relate to broadening the scope of the objects of the bill, to add the words 'encouraging youth employment with an emphasis on engaging apprentices,' which is a very worthy objective, and I think it puts a focus on the bill.


I will spend more time speaking in relation to examination notices and AAT oversight. These amendments maintain the current administrative oversight for the use of coercive powers. An Administrative Appeals Tribunal presidential member will be required to issue the examination notice, rather than the ABC Commissioner as the current bill allows. This is a safeguard against any misuse of coercive power. Other associated provisions from part 3, chapter 7, have also been incorporated.


These amendments addresses some concerns about the coercive powers in this bill, although I note that coercive powers are used in other pieces of legislation with the ACCC, ASIC, APRA, but it is important to note that the coercive powers are not new. In 2012, under the former Labor government coercive powers were retained, with safeguards, for the FWBC. One of those safeguards was oversight by the AAT, which required an AAT presidential member to issue the examination notice.


These amendments also clarify that a person who is the subject of an examination notice does have the right to a lawyer. There have been countless times when I have heard senior members of the opposition say that this bill takes away the right to legal representation. The text of clause 61(4) of the current bill states :


A person attending before the ABC Commissioner, or before an assistant, as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c) may be represented by a lawyer if the person chooses.


It seems pretty clear that there is a right to legal representation. However, to make it abundantly clear, these amendments will change the wording to read:


The person may, if he or she so chooses, be represented at the examination by a lawyer of the person's choice.


I think we can all confidently say that, without a doubt, someone who is the subject of an examination has the right to legal representation and to choose their own lawyer. There are also amendments to ensure that the AAT presidential members appointed to issue examination notices continue to do so when the ABCC is established. I am very happy to answer any questions in respect of these amendments.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-11-30,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:14):  I am just beginning to wonder why this government, for three years, held a position of moving from the Fair Work Building Commission act to the bill that they have here, which has been amended, amended, amended and amended again. Why did we have these three years of rhetoric about the need for all these changes in the Fair Work Building Commission when we are really back to the legislation of the Fair Work Building Commission.


We support this amendment. We would rather go back completely to a position where workers get a fair go in this country and you do not have the code denying workers access to negotiate on reasonable terms and conditions in the building industry—the same rights that workers in every other industry in this country have and are being denied to building and construction workers. I just do not get it. I just do not get this government. There were three years of saying, 'This is absolutely essential to restore law and order in the building industry,' and then they cave-in—anything to get a win; anything to get a position where they can say at the end of the period, 'We have got our ABCC bill through parliament.'


This is not the ABCC bill that the extremists in the coalition want. This is not the ABCC bill that the Abbott crew would want. This is still a bad bill, but they have been pulled back so much that it is an absolute embarrassment for them from where they were with the hard-nosed rhetoric that they were on about. We will support this amendment, but we will be continuing to push a proposition that workers should be able to negotiate and bargain on the same issues as every worker in the country—that is, including building workers.

Senator Xenophon, there are the statements that both you and Senator Hinch have made about the worst public servant in the country, Mr Nigel Hadgkiss.

Regulations made by the Governor‑General for the purposes of a provision of the old Act referred to in column 1 of the table that are in force immediately before the transition time continue in force after that time as if the regulations were rules made by the Minister for the purposes of the provision of the new Act referred to in column 2 of the table.

 (South Australia) (10:19):  by leave—I, and on behalf of Senator Hinch, move amendments (1) to (10) on sheet 8011 together:


(1) Clause 16, page 20 (line 11), before ""The ABC Commissioner"", insert ""(1)"".


(2) Clause 16, page 20 (before line 12), before paragraph (a), insert:


(aa) promoting the main object of this Act (see section 3);


(3) Clause 16, page 20 (after line 20), after paragraph (b), insert:


(ba) ensuringbuilding employers and building contractors comply with their obligations under this Act, designated building laws and the Building Code;


(4) Clause 16, page 21 (after line 7), at the end of the clause, add:


(2) In performing the functions referred to in subsection (1), the ABC Commissioner mustensure that the policies and procedures adopted and resources allocated for protecting and enforcing rights and obligations arising under this Act, designated building laws and the Building Code are, to the greatest extent practicable having regard to industry conditions based on complaints received by the ABC Commissioner, applied in a reasonable and proportionate manner to each of the categories of building industry participants.


(5) Clause 20, page 23 (line 7), omit ""year."", substitute ""year; and"".


(6) Clause 20, page 23 (after line 7), at the end of subclause (2) (before the note), add:


(d) details of:


   (i) the number, and type, of matters that were investigated by the ABC Commissioner during that quarter or year in relation to building employers; and


   (ii) the cost, during that quarter or year, of each such investigation; and


(e) details of the following, both in total and in relation to each category of building industry participant:


   (i) the number of proceedings commenced in accordance with this Act in that quarter or year;


   (ii) the cost, during that quarter or year, of those proceedings (including legal expenses); and


(f) details of the number, and total cost, of such proceedings finalised in that quarter or year; and


(g) details of the legal expenses incurred during that quarter or year as a result of enforcement action undertaken by the ABC Commissioner; and


(h) details of industry conditions, during that quarter or year, based on complaints received by the ABC Commissioner during that quarter or year; and


   (i) details of activities that the ABC Commissioner has undertaken during that quarter or year to monitor the compliance of products used in building work with relevant Australian standards published by, or on behalf of, Standards Australia;


(j) details of the number, and type, of matters for which examination notices were issued under this Act.


(7) Clause 21, page 23 (line 31), omit ""character."", substitute ""character; and"".


(8) Clause 21, page 23 (after line 31), at the end of subclause (3), add:


(c) will uphold the APS Values set out in section 10 of the Public Service Act 1999, including by performing his or her functions in an apolitical manner and acting impartially and professionally.


(9) Clause 28, page 25 (line 29), omit ""incapacity."", substitute ""incapacity; or"".


(10) Clause 28, page 25 (after line 29), at the end of subclause (1), add:


(c) if the Commissioner fails to perform his or her functions with impartiality as between all categories of building industry participants.


These amendments that I move with my colleague Senator Hinch relate to the functions of the ABC Commissioner, to reporting obligations and issues of termination and appointment. I want to make this absolutely clear: this amendment makes some changes to the language contained in the current bill.


Clause (16) of the bill will be amended so that the functions of the ABC Commissioner's function, to the extent that it is possible, are carried out in an impartial manner across all building industry participants. Clause (20) of the bill will be amended to include additional reporting requirements in the annual report. This amendment will increase transparency and accountability and also require the annual report to include details of compliance activity against building employers—something that is not done now. The level of accountability under the current framework as proposed is not satisfactory, and I am pleased the government is prepared to agree to these extra accountability and transparency measures.


Clause (21) of the bill will be amended to include a requirement for the ABC Commissioner to uphold the Australian Public Service values set out in section 10 of the Public Service Act 1999 and expressly states that the ABC Commissioner will perform his or her functions in an apolitical manner and will act impartially and professionally. Clause (28) of the bill will be amended to include an additional ground of failing to act impartially between all categories of building industry participants.


I have said what I have had to say about the importance of impartiality. These amendments actually do something about it. They actually give a remedy if someone is behaving egregiously and in a partial manner that is not being fair to all building industry participants. I commend these amendments that I move with my colleague Senator Hinch.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:23):  We need to understand what is going on here with the Building Code. We do just need to reflect on the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Act may not be perfect—that would be our starting point—but it does give protection to people's rights at work. I would even say it is a step to making Australia a fairer place. That is why we just need to consider what is going on with this amendment and with the Building Code in that context. The essence of the Fair Work Act does say that employees and employers can bargain about their conditions for their workplace. The really important aspect of it is that once they reach agreement those conditions have the force of law. That is the centrepiece and that is what the government is essentially trying to knock out—to absolutely destroy how industrial relations work. That is why we need to identify that essence of the Fair Work Act.


Let's remember what we achieve when we have that act in place, and what can end up having the force of law behind it: the hours of work, supporting apprentices and the issue of casualisation—one of the biggest problems facing the workforce in Australia. And then there is the contracting out that is going on. There are so many areas of our working conditions that are negotiated and that is why we need to ensure that this amendment is supported.


As a matter of basic principle, if an agreement complies with the Fair Work Act, that should be enough. The Fair Work Act already has a number of strict requirements about what can and cannot be in agreements. A Fair Work Commissioner is required to vet every agreement before it is approved and ensure it complies with the laws. That is why the Greens support the amendment and we urge that the Senate does so.

I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill is the key element of a broader package of measures to implement the Government's working holiday maker reform package.


This Government has been committed to getting the policy right on working holiday makers. It is important that our agricultural sector receives certainty.


The Government will therefore today put forward a bill which will propose working holiday makers pay 15 per cent tax on their earnings from the first dollar they earn up to $37,000, after which ordinary marginal tax rates will apply.


The Government thanks Coalition Members and Senators for their constructive contributions in resolving this matter as well as Senate crossbenchers with whom the government has reached agreement to deal with this matter.


Working holiday makers are an important source of Australia's international tourism and a key source of seasonal labour in regional areas, particularly in the agriculture, horticulture, tourism and hospitality sectors. 


We have listened to stakeholders about declining numbers of working holiday makers in areas that rely on their seasonal labour. The Government wants to ensure that we have the workforce to meet these seasonal labour needs. 


As a result of our negotiations in the Senate, this Bill will set the tax rate to apply to working holiday makers at 15 per cent from their first dollar of income up to $37,000, rather than the 32.5 per cent announced in the 2015‑16 Budget. Ordinary marginal tax rates apply after $37,000. The new tax rate will apply from 1 January 2017.


Taxing working holiday makers at 15 per cent tax from the first dollar of income up to $37,000 is internationally competitive in terms of after tax income. Even after taking cost of living differences into account, this change will mean that after-tax incomes for working holiday makers in Australia are considerably higher than key competitor countries, such as New Zealand, Canada and the UK.


This Bill gives both working holiday makers and employers certainty about the tax arrangements that will apply. 


The Turnbull Government's package of reforms to working holiday maker arrangements addresses stakeholder concerns about the taxation of working holiday makers and makes other changes to increase Australia's attractiveness as a destination for backpackers, while being conscious of its impact on the budget. 


Full details of this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-11-30,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:42):  The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Bill 2016 (No. 2) is bad policy for agricultural producers in this country. Let us be very clear about this. There have been plenty of heroes in this place hunting headlines, trying to come in at the last minute and do a deal. For the government, I am not sure; for agricultural producers, I am not sure. This is a 15 per cent headline rate for backpackers. Most backpackers in this country do not pay tax at the moment because they deem themselves to be residents for tax purposes. That is a situation that has worked very well for this country's agricultural producers, and it has been good for backpackers. This government has now put a new tax on backpackers of 15 per cent from the first dollar they earn through to $37,000. Let us be really clear about this. This is not a reduction in the tax rate. For all effective purposes, this is a new tax on backpackers.


Go across the ditch, across the Tasman to New Zealand, and backpackers pay a rate of around 12 per cent from the first dollar that they earn. It might sound on the surface that 15 per cent is pretty close to that and that it is competitive, but that is not the case, and let me tell you why. Backpackers in this country also pay 10 per cent of their salary into superannuation, the same as any other worker. This government is going to claw back 95 per cent of that 10 per cent of superannuation. So, for all effective purposes, that is another 9½ per cent tax on top of 15 per cent. So let us do the maths: around 24 per cent is the tax rate that backpackers are going to pay in Australia. Remember at the back of your mind that, at the moment, most of them are not paying tax in this country. These are some of the lowest paid workers in Australia, who fulfil a very important role for Australian industry. We want them to come here for their working holiday, we want them to work hard and we want them to spend their money in the tourism industry while they are here seeing this beautiful country.


It is a win-win relationship, but now, thanks to a stubborn Treasurer who is penny pinching, trying to raise revenue, we now have a new tax on backpackers which is effectively 24 per cent—twice what they pay over in New Zealand. And if anybody does not think the Kiwis are going to capitalise on this, they are living under a rock. This is a competitive situation to get labour in this country. So let us be very clear about this: this is not a good deal for agricultural producers. This is not a good deal for backpackers. This is bad policy, and the Senate should reject it. This is not about getting a political win for Mr Barnaby Joyce and Mr Scott Morrison. Some of the farming groups have been running around—the National Farmers' Federation—cheerleaders for the Liberal-Nationals party, saying, 'Take 19 per cent' and, when that did not happen, 'Take 15 per cent', because they think it is a good deal for the government, because they are trying to help the government out.


Well, we are trying to help agricultural producers, and we want to see this bill rejected and a competitive tax rate put in place to help Australian producers and help backpackers. The Greens will not be supporting this, and we have a second reading amendment. I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


"", but the Senate is of the opinion that the increase in the tax payable on superannuation to 95 per cent which is contained in Superannuation (Departing Australia Superannuation Payments Tax) Amendment Bill 2016 should not be proceeded with."".


That would give an effective tax rate for backpackers that is much lower than the one that is being proposed.

That the report from the committee be adopted.


In doing so, I will explain to the chamber what just happened. Labor—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  Senator Cameron is getting very excited about himself here! The hubris is unbelievable, because he thinks the government got stuffed. No, the people who got stuffed today by the Labor Party, the Greens, Senator Hinch and Senator Culleton are the farmers of Australia. What Labor, the Greens, Senator Culleton, Senator Hinch and Senator Lambie have done today is vote for Wayne Swan's 32.5 per cent tax rate for nonresident foreign workers, because that is the tax rate that will apply if this vote in the Senate chamber today stands.


Labor, the Greens, Senator Hinch and Senator Lambie have voted for a higher tax than what the government was prepared to do. The government has been absolutely reasonable. Against our better judgement, we proposed to compromise down to an income tax rate of 15 per cent. That is absolutely reasonable. Last week Senator Hinch voted for 19 per cent. Last week Senator Culleton voted for 19 per cent. But the government compromised further because we understood there was a consensus in this chamber for a 15 per cent tax rate.


Now the chamber has chosen to vote for a 32.5 per cent tax rate because—let me make it very clear—the government in the House of Representatives will not be accepting this request for amendments. The government in the House of Representatives will reject that request for amendments, this bill will come back to the Senate and there will be a final opportunity for the Senate to decide whether they want a 32.5 per cent tax rate from the first dollar earned or whether they want a 15 per cent tax rate—whether they want a 17.5 per cent tax cut for foreign workers or whether they want a 22 per cent tax cut for foreign workers. The government has said there is a limit to how much further we are prepared to cut taxes for foreign workers because we understand that, given the budget is in deficit and given the unsustainable spending growth trajectory that we inherited from Labor, every time we cut taxes by more for foreign workers it means that we have to increase taxes by more or cut spending by more for Australians.


Labor has been quite up-front. Labor wants lower taxes—even lower taxes—for foreign workers and it wants higher taxes for Australians saving for their retirement and higher taxes for Australian small businesses. Labor has been quite transparent, but I am quite surprised that Senator Culleton and Senator Hinch would decide to go for Wayne Swan's 32.5 per cent income tax rate from the first dollar earned instead of going for the much lower 15 per cent tax rate.


So, with those few words, and not wanting to hold the Senate up any longer, I will just confirm for the Senate that the government will not be accepting these requests in the House of Representatives—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Well, then you wear it!




Senator CORMANN:
  Here we have the hubris again from Senator Collins. The hubris: 'You'll wear it.' No, the Labor Party will wear this like a rose of crowns, the Greens will wear it like a rose of crowns and Senator Culleton, Senator Hinch and Senator Lambie will wear it like a rose of crowns because they will be held responsible. On offer today was a 15 per cent tax rate. Instead, the Labor Party went for the 32.5 per cent tax rate.


I understand the Labor Party is a high-taxing party. The Labor Party might still have some fondness for the Wayne-Swan-introduced 32.5 per cent tax rate for income earned by foreign workers in Australia, so maybe this is just a cunning ploy and some of these other senators have been sucked into this cunning ploy by the Labor Party. But let me be very clear: this vote today by the Senate was a vote against the farmers' best interests. Everybody knows that even at 19 per cent our tax rate here in Australia is internationally competitive. Our tax rate is internationally competitive, and holiday-makers coming to Australia are better off earning money in Australia than they would be for the same amount of money earned in New Zealand, in Canada or in the United Kingdom. Even after that—even though the 19 per cent tax rate was internationally competitive—in order to facilitate a consensus in this chamber, the government went that further step. Quite frankly, we were not all that keen to go that further step—that is a matter of record—but the Senate is now saying: 'Actually, even though there would've been a majority for 19 per cent last week, no, we're not even going to accept the lower 15 per cent. We're going to go for 32½ per cent instead.' That is what they call in the classics 'cutting off your nose to spite your face'.


But this, obviously, is now not resolved. If it does not get resolved by the Senate in a form that is acceptable to the government, it means that the 32.5 per cent Wayne Swan tax rate from the first dollar earned by nonresident foreign workers will apply, and everybody in this chamber knows that, consistent with relevant cases in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and consistent with relevant guidance by the Taxation Office, that is actually the law of the land right now.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (12:47):  Today is a hallmark day for me. I have spent my three years in this place endeavouring to expose the Labor Party and the Greens and a couple of others for their hatred of the bush and farmers. And what you have just done today—we have seen you do before in 2011—with the legislation on the backpacker tax is right up there with the suspension of the live cattle trade. You see if it does not play out over Christmas. You have just put thousands of farms, small producers, people in the service industries and people in the beef industry in a terrible position because you know—and we do not want this fraud to go without being exposed—full well that 10.5 per cent taxation is not on the table. It has never been on the table. It was not on the table today and it will not be on the table in the future. This bill is going to come back to this place at 15c and it will have to lay on the table until our farmers in their thousands have called you—and I will devote my entire Christmas break to stirring this up—until you have had hundreds and hundreds of calls each, as they share with you what their Christmas is like when their fruit remains on the trees, when their small crops remain in the fields, when processing cannot occur and the service industries cannot operate and when all of those resorts up and down our coast and in your states cannot operate. I notice a lot of you do not come from my place, and to the few that do, I will tie this stinking, rotten, dead kangaroo around your throats in Queensland. I will make sure that every Queenslander knows that senators from Queensland supported this legislation to send these businesses to the wall at 32½c.


And do you know what the insidious thing is? That your defence to this has been that somehow this was the government's backpacker tax. Well, you know full well that the greatest treasurer ever to live, Mr Swan, introduced this in 2012 with the support of the Greens. This is the Greens-Labor coalition backpacker tax—make no mistake about it. To use the words of Mr Keating: 'It is law. L-A-W.' This is not something to be fiddled around the edges with; this is the current tax rate for foreign nationals. And what the Greens would have us do—let me just concentrate there for a moment—is put them in a position where the foreign nationals can come into this country, just come in from I do not know where—Syria, Iraq, New Zealand, where if you like. What one of the speakers for the Greens did the other day was, when you get to that question for tax purposes, mark off that you are a resident. The Greens promoted fraud in a speech the other day. We found out why: because the speaker has these backpackers working on his grape farm and two of them are living at Mum's.

  Well, he needs to get on the phone to Mum now and get the rent for the next three months. He needs to get on the phone and tell Mum to put an ad in the paper to get himself some new tenants because these people are going at 32½c.


I have to tell you—this place—you know what? People out there are sick to death of all of us. They are sick to death of their parliament and all of this crap that goes on with politics. They want us to get on with the job and that is exactly what we did. The government went out and took 1,760 submissions from industry, the farm sector, the service sectors sector and the tourist sector.


We took some independent advice on it and we settled on 19c because that is what they wanted. You senators have come in here and said, 'My farmers in Tasmania are ringing me every day.' We had an audacious statement from Senator Whish-Wilson, who told us that he spoke to every farmer in Tasmania. How ridiculous is that!

We have just seen Senator Culleton, who is from One Nation and from the bush and has been fighting for farmers, send his neighbours to the wall. That is what he has done today. One Nation is divided. It is an empty vessel now. It is finished. Culleton is one of the Labor Party or maybe one of the Greens.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  'Senator Culleton'—my apologies.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. Please extend the courtesy expected by the chamber.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Put a global 'Senator' before any senator's name I say so we do not have this problem! We have a serious situation on our hands—




Senator Cameron:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I know debates are wide ranging, but to treat the Senate in the way in the way that the senator has done now is just unacceptable. He cannot be so flippant about what he is doing. He should actually treat the chamber with some respect.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, I do remind you of the requirement for all acting deputy presidents to observe the standing orders. I do remind you as an acting deputy president to observe the courtesies expected by the President.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I do respect that. I apologise to the chair for any difficulty that I have created. But I will tell you what: you know you are on the money when Senator Cameron gets up every two minutes to interrupt the thrust of your speech! I have had three interruptions. That is a record for me. Senator Cameron has been interfering, but it will not make any difference because, until this tax rate is settled, every time I come into this place I will talk about this issue. They have to have it branded on their foreheads in the Labor Party and the Greens.


Senator Culleton, Senator Hinch and others: you have ownership of this. This was your tax. This is your tax. The power rests with you to bring it back to a reasonable rate. It is less than what the sector wanted, less than what the agriculture industry wanted and less than what the farmers wanted. It is down four per cent.



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Senator Brown, you need to spend a bit more time reading up on the results of inquiries. I will bet you London to a brick that no-one on the other side has even read the results of the inquiry that was done in the lower house to provide this 19 per cent tax rate.


This is exactly the same as the cessation of the live cattle trade, only it is going to affect more small businesses in the bush. It is going to affect many more than in the live cattle trade. In effect it is up in the north and it flows down through the trade and the market into the south. This is going to affect thousands of small businesses, including mum-and-dad operations at Stanthorpe, Warwick, Laidley and the Lockyer. That is the food bowl of my home state.


The only good thing to come out of this is that in all of these areas the Labor Party will never ever get another vote—not as long as they breathe. The Greens already do not get a vote there. As I said the other day, when the Greens get up and speak in favour of farmers and agriculture, farmers everywhere break out into a big sweat. They really do. They break out into a big sweat. They have a Bex and a lie down and wonder what they have just seen. That is what they are going to find today. You people opposite have crippled these small businesses.




Senator Carol Brown:
  You have!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No, it is you people. This is your tax. This is a Labor tax of 32½c and you have just reinforced it today through your actions in this chamber. You do not care about what happens in the bush. Senator Brown does not have a bloody clue about what happens there, and she certainly does not care about what happens there.


This is a devastating decision in this place. This is a devastating economic decision. I see you sitting there, Senator Cameron, with that grin you have. I tell you what: I will get the farmers to take the grin off your dial when they start to contact your office. You will need to put extra staff on. You have brought the economy of these small businesses to a standstill.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, you have a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  Again, Senator O'Sullivan should actually not threaten a senator in this place. His behaviour during this debate has been absolutely disgusting and he should be called to order.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  All I have heard is Senator O'Sullivan encouraging electors to ring senators' offices, so I do not think there is a point of order there.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Democracy at work, it is! Fancy! You are going to have to take the calls of some angry constituents in relation to the decision that you take today.


I will close. This is going to come back from the House. There is going to be no acceptance for a 10½c tax. That has the support of all in government, including the National Party. I say that before this group starts to bleat about it. Think about it. We are their people. We live for them, and we support this decision of the government. So those opposite should not start during question time and at other times to suggest that there is some division or fracture within this government. There is none. We are as one on this. I have nothing else to do now in my office as a senator but get this fixed. I will work hard with my colleagues. There are 22 National Party people and many, many Liberal senators and members who will go into the Christmas break now and devote every part of their resources to making sure that every small business in the bush and every economy understands that this is the decision of those opposite decision from start to finish. They made it, and they will have to live with the consequences.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2016-11-30,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:02):  I have some further information in relation to a question I took on notice from Senator Siewert on Monday. Senator Siewert asked, in her primary question, if there had been an increase in the number of disability support pension cases at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal over the past two years. I can inform the senator that in 2014-15, prior to its amalgamation, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal received 6,138 lodgements for first-tier review of disability support pension matters. In the same year, the AAT received 1,253 lodgements for second-tier review. In 2015-16, the amalgamated AAT's Social Services and Child Support Division received 6,525 lodgements for first-tier review, and its general division received 1,427 lodgements for second-tier review. Senator, as you will see, there was a slight increase in the number of disability support pension cases lodged with the AAT or its predecessor, the equivalent tribunal, over that period.


In your first supplementary question, Senator Siewert, you asked how many cases have been reviewed by the AAT and how many have been successfully repealed. In 2014-15, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal finalised 5,554 first-tier reviews. In 16 per cent of those reviews the original decision was varied or set aside. In the same year, the AAT finalised 1,108 second-tier reviews. In 18 per cent of those reviews the original decision was varied or set aside. As you will see, Senator Siewert, the successful appeal rate in that year was a little over 16 per cent. In 2015-16, the AAT finalised 6,310 first-tier reviews. In 17 per cent of those reviews the original decision was varied or set aside. In the same year, the AAT finalised 1,265 second-tier reviews. In 19 per cent of these reviews the original decision was varied or set aside. In that year the successful appeal rate was about 18 per cent.


Finally, Senator Siewert, you asked how many people have had to appear before the AAT without legal aid advice due to a lack of resources or access. I can inform you that the majority of applicants seeking review of DSP decisions are self-represented and that this is consistent with the deliberately informal and accessible nature of the AAT. In other words, most commonly parties before the AAT do represent themselves—that is the way the AAT was set up, to promote the informal administration of administrative review.


The AAT holds statistical information regarding applicants who appear unrepresented on review; however, those figures do not include persons who may have had an appointment with a legal aid solicitor as part of legal advice schemes that operate in the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It may well be that among that number of people there were some who had sought advice from legal aid before they appeared for themselves, but the AAT does not collect those figures.


In 2014-15, 4,473 or 81 per cent of applicants who appeared before the AAT on first-tier review of DSP matters were recorded as not having a legal representative for the review. In the same year, 87 per cent of applicants who appeared before the AAT on second-tier review of DSP matters were recorded as not having a legal representative for the review. In 2015-16, 4,890 or 77 per cent of applicants who appeared before the AAT on first-tier review of DSP matters were recorded as not having a legal representative for the review. In the same year, 89 per cent of applicants who appeared before the AAT on second-tier review of DSP matters were recorded as not having a legal representative for the review.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2016-11-30,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (Senator Canavan) and the Minister for Employment (Senator Cash) to questions without notice asked by Senators Gallacher and Cameron today relating to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and to labour market testing.


I do this reluctantly, Madam Deputy President, particularly after hearing the comments of Senator Leyonhjelm about South Australian politicians and the gratuitous attack that he launched on my home state of South Australia. But I feel I must talk on the issue and that I must respond to some of the things that have occurred in the last few hours in respect of legislative changes in this place.


This morning we saw the Nick Xenophon Team supposedly put water ahead of workers' rights by supporting the so-called ABCC legislation. Of course, as you would know, Madam Deputy President, they have made life very much harder for people who work in the building industry in this country.


But I do not want to focus specifically on that issue, rather on the so-called deal that the Xenophon group got in exchange for voting for this legislation. What the deal seems to be is that it will reduce working conditions for building workers by supporting the ABCC in return for a better deal on water in South Australia. Of course, being a South Australian, I am all for a better deal on water for South Australia—particularly for the Murray-Darling Basin. But let's look at the deal that Senator Xenophon got.


What did he get? Well, the deal is that water will now be discussed at future meetings of COAG. I will repeat that: water will now be discussed at future meetings of COAG. That is the deal that Senator Xenophon and his team got in return for reducing the conditions of building workers in this country. What I think South Australians actually wanted from Senator Xenophon and the other members of the Australian parliament was water, not words. They wanted more water, not more words. I am afraid that what we have from Senator Xenophon and his team is simply words and not water.


What sorts of things could you have got if you were in the position of Senator Xenophon and his team to negotiate this? You could have got an agreement on when the 450 gigalitres of environmental water was going to start flowing down the River Murray. You could have got some sort of agreement on the time frames for improving irrigation and water retention strategies along the River Murray. But what did Senator Xenophon and his team get? They got a promise of discussion on water at COAG. No practical results, no implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and no real and effective outcomes in all of the discussions that Senator Xenophon had.


We asked the question of Senator Canavan today—through Senator Gallacher, a great South Australian senator—and referred to comments made this morning by Senator Birmingham, in particular in relation to the role of Minister Joyce. Has he been sidelined in all of this process—this fantastic discussion that is going to take place at COAG meetings? The answer that Senator Birmingham gave this morning was, 'Nothing has changed'. And that is exactly right! As a result of Senator Xenophon and his team's agreement to reduce the working conditions of building workers as a result of the ABCC legislation, nothing has changed in respect of water.


Former Senator Barnaby Joyce and now Deputy Prime Minister Joyce will continue his role as water minister, he will continue his attacks on South Australians getting a fair share of the water system and he will continue to ensure that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is not implemented. (Time expired)

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2016-11-30,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:12):  It is indeed the festive season, so I would like to begin by extending my congratulations and, indeed, the congratulations of all coalition senators, to those political interns who have been running the opposition Senate question time tactics committee over the last few weeks!




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  A very good point!




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. There is still one more question time, but it is revealing that at a time when there is no shortage of issues confronting our nation that Labor senators on that side seek to confuse and whip up a bit of a fear campaign. Indeed, they try to trawl over an issue such as the Bell Group litigation, only to end up with it all over their faces.


What we have seen this week is the modern Labor Party in bed with big unions. We only have to go back to the Bell Group litigation and the scandalous affairs that rocked the WA Labor government in the eighties to see the danger that arises when big Labor gets into bed with big unions. If there is some time available to me I will come to that point and the findings of that royal commission, which fired a shot across the bow of the modern Labor Party in the late 1980s and in the 1990s.


But let me get to the issue—let me get to the suggestion from Senator Cameron this afternoon that somehow there was this grand conspiracy on the part of the coalition to let foreign workers run amok in our country. It is just a boldfaced lie.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  And why is that? Why is it a lie? You could have read in The Daily Telegraph, Senator Dastyari, Senator Carr and Senator Bilyk, exactly why that is a lie.



Senator Dastyari interjecting—


Senator Dastyari, I know that you know what I am about to say. You know that I am about to talk about McDonald's. You know that I am about to talk about Clive Palmer—




Senator Dastyari:
  Stop bringing McDonald's in here!




Senator SMITH:
  You do, don't you? So let me talk about McDonald's and let me talk about Clive Palmer. The Daily Telegraph article of 29 November makes it crystal clear. I am reading exclusively from page 4 of The Daily Telegraph. It says:


The former Labor government approved more than 800 visas for Chinese workers to fly into Australia and work at a mine linked to magnate Clive Palmer.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  What? This is the Labor government?




Senator SMITH:
  It is, and there is more, Senator Macdonald. It is hard to believe, but there is more:


The Daily Telegraph can reveal more than 850 Chinese nationals were given the green light to work at the Sino Iron Project on 457 visas between 2008 and 2013.


At its peak there were 374 people on 457 visas working on the mine with 372 of them Chinese.


MCC Mining (WA) Pty Ltd … was contracted by CITIC Pacific to undertake the procurement for the site.


Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was employment minister during a portion of the period when the 457 visas were approved—


at the expense of Australian workers. If you were generous, Senator Macdonald, you might well think that is an isolated incident—a one-off. If you were being generous, you would have been too generous because only the day before in The Daily Telegraph it says under the heading, 'Shorten's foreign visa policy is fried', that Shorten—that is, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten—is attempting to whip up some kind of foreign worker backlash by acting tough on people arriving here on 457 visas. It goes on to say that it emerges that Labor's previous Gillard government, in which Shorten was workplace minister, oversaw a huge increase in the number of foreign workers' 457 visas which were extended even to those working at the likes of McDonald's, KFC and Hungry Jack's.


It is not my place to lecture the modern Labor Party about its industrial relations history, but what is shameful is that the modern Labor Party has drifted so far away—I do not mind; I am big enough to say this—from its foundations and its legacy of genuinely looking after workers' interests and rights. They should be ashamed of themselves.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2016-11-30,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:17):  We were greeted today with yet another example of how this government says one thing and does another. This was the result of a question Senator Cameron asked Senator Cash about the contradictions in her statements about the approach this government was taking to 457 visas and the statements that she had made as the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. She actually moved an instrument to remove labour market testing with regard to 457 visas as a result of four free trade agreements.


So we have a situation. We have the Prime Minister today making some statements in response to some amendments that were moved last night in the Senate with regard to 457 visas. The Prime Minister has made, I think, two important contributions today. The first was that he has failed to rule out that Senator Brandis will be appointed overseas for a diplomatic post. The urgers, the cheer squads and the apologists within the right-wing press might in fact applaud that move. What they will not applaud is the Prime Minister's second statement today, which was to support a Labor Party amendment which was carried in the Senate last night with regard to 457 visas. The amendment that was moved by Senator Cameron made the observation, in terms of a proposition with regard to the Building Code, that a person should not be employed in undertaking building work unless:


(a) the position is first advertised in Australia; and


(b) the advertising was targeted in such a way that a significant proportion of suitably qualified and experienced Australian citizens and Australian permanent residents (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958) would be likely to be informed about the position; and


(c) any skills or experience requirements set out in the advertising were appropriate to the position; and


(d) the employer demonstrates that no Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident is suitable for the job.


This is an extraordinary, sweeping amendment which the Senate has agreed to and which the government has accepted.


Of course, that is part of a pattern that has been established in recent times with this government. It is prepared to maintain a position with regard to its economic program, but is now prepared to entirely abandon that if it thinks it can get a vote through the Senate on a bill which essentially been so hollowed out that it bears no real resemblance to the position of the ABCC bill that has been put to this parliament over the last three years. We now have a situation where we essentially have a bill that has the same title but a very different proposition. I think that this is particularly the case with regard to what we see with the procurement question. Nearly $60 billion worth of government procurement right across the whole of government is now being fundamentally rewritten as a result of the interventions in this Senate on this particular matter that I think are very worthwhile.


What has surprised me is that the extreme right-wing elements in the Liberal Party clearly do not understand what they have been drawn into. The cheer squad from the IPA has not got a clue what the implications of these measures are. Of course, the right-wing Murdoch press will froth at the mouth when they understand the full scope of the changes. It is all in the interests of getting a vote in this chamber to smash building workers. This is the Faustian pact which, very disappointingly, from my point of view, has been accepted. Their people are prepared to trade off important questions with regard to manufacturing with the human rights and civil rights of building workers. That is a disappointment to me even if the policy objectives with regard to that I would fully support. It might shock some people on the other side of the chamber that a person like me would support that, but it goes to tell them how far they have gone in their desperate measures to secure a majority here.


So we have a situation now with regard to 457 visas and procurement that this government has essentially accepted a Labor Party agenda in a desperate bid to secure a majority across these benches so they can find the necessary numbers to belt up building workers. There is a tragedy in the fact that the government feels there is some political advantage in undermining the working conditions of building workers, but it is an irony that a government so conservative and so right wing has been obliged to accept such a far-reaching interventionist agenda in a desperate bid to secure its program.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-11-30,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:22):  Before I address the substantive part of the motion, could I just say in response to Senator Carr that the Senate in its wisdom last night adopted a bill that will help workers in the construction industry. It will attack some people in that industry, and they are the union thugs, the bosses who control the ACTU, who do nothing for the workers. Some of the sanctimonious claptrap I heard last night in the debate—particularly from Greens senators, who for some reason filibustered all the way through the night—was that the bill was about a reduction in safety standards. It has nothing to do with safety standards; it has everything to do with returning law and order to the building and construction industry and getting a fair deal for workers in the industry. 


I will move on to the subjects of today, which deal with 457 visas in one case and the Murray-Darling Basin in the other. In relation to 457 visas, Labor should never raise this. As Senator Smith said before me, there were 850 Chinese workers in Australia on 457 visas under Labor's watch and another 374 the next day. The list goes on and on. There are, in fact, fewer workers under 457 visas in Australia now than there were in the days of the 'workers party'—the Australian Labor Party. The most outrageous and well-known of the 457 workers arrived during the time of the Labor government when Ms Gillard was the then Labor Prime Minister of Australia. She imported a 457 worker from Scotland into Australia to run her office. I do not think she did any market testing at the time. I do not think she offered the position to Australian supporters of the Labor Party. She was so bereft of any loyalty or competence in the Labor Party that she had to import someone on a 457 visa to run her office. This just demonstrates that, under the legislation, which was introduced by the former Labor government in 2013, the range of exemptions to labour market testing effectively allowed for anything to happen. It is a fact that, under the Labor Party's labour market testing provisions, an independent review on the integrity of 457 visas found that labour market testing was completely ineffective. This legislation was introduced by Mr Shorten and the Labor government. So anything the Labor Party says about 457 visas can only be taken as a comedy contribution to the Senate. 


On the Murray-Darling Basin question, Labor mouths the words about problems there, but unfortunately they never listen to the answers given here. They never listen to the truth about the matter. They never even read the documents and the written answers to questions on notice by the government about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The government has said time and time again that it is committed to the delivery of the plan. Senator Canavan in question time today reiterated that on several occasions, as he has done several times during question time this week. In spite of the government's assurances, in spite of the government explaining in detail what it is all about, the Labor Party continue, as is their norm these days, to make allegations that are patently false in the hope that some lazy journalist will pick them up and run with them as a factual story. This government, unlike the Labor government before it, has nothing to be embarrassed about on its administration of 457 visas or the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:27):  I rise to take note of the answers to questions that were asked today in question time, particularly the first two questions asked by Labor senators. I want to touch on issues regarding the use and misuse of 457 visas, particularly the issue of market labour market testing. The answer that was provided by the minister was largely around the notion that says: 'It's all going to be okay, even though labour market testing has been removed, because you can trust me; you can take my word for it.' I think that is a very worrying trend and a very worrying direction for us to be heading in with this policy. We have seen time and time again in recent debates in this chamber the misinformation, incorrect information, spin and slant being placed on what is being said. I worry very much that when we start removing protections like labour market testing it ends up becoming a race to the bottom, and that is not a good place for any of us to be. 


I specifically want to draw the attention of this chamber to the concerns that we need to have when the minister tells us that we can take her word for it when looking at the situation with the ABCC and the unintended consequences that may or may not now result from the passing of that legislation. We heard from Senator Carr how deal after deal was cut and concession after concession was made in a desperate bid to get this legislation through. We read in the papers that there were random negotiations on matters that had nothing to do with the ABCC legislation, yet those deals were done. 


I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the work of the Australian Services Union and the United Services Union, in particular, in trying to limit the scope of what was already a bad piece of legislation. The ABCC bill should not have been passed on its own merits, but the bill itself was made even worse by the minister's failure to clarify the scope of this legislation and what this legislation would mean—to clarify the scope of who would and would not be included. I draw the attention of the chamber to a letter sent on 30 May this year from Mr Robert Potter, at the time Acting National Secretary of the ASU, to Minister Cash, specifically asking whether or not employees in the construction industry in local government would be included and whether or not employees not in construction but in local government—we are talking about librarians, council workers—would be captured by the ABCC. There was no response from the minister, no response at all—not even the courtesy of sending a letter back. We have strong, powerful, important unions—that have been going out of their way to stand up for the rights of their members—unable to get any type of clarification on what the consequences of this legislation would be. The reality is that, perhaps, the government does not even know how far this legislation will reach.


I acknowledge the work of the National Secretary of the ASU, Dave Smith; the Acting Assistant National Secretary, Robert Potter; and the New South Wales Secretary, Graeme Kelly, as well as the many other ASU and USU officials across the country. I hope that when clarification is finally provided on the scope of this legislation we do not find a situation where council employees are being dragged into this. It is bad enough that construction workers are going to be treated as second class citizens; it would be even worse if that were extended to council employees as well. Frankly, when we look at the Building Code and the opportunities for review we need clarification. Unfortunately, the opportunity was not taken by the government to do it at this point. But, certainly, at a minimum, they need to remove the potential for council employees to be dragged into this mess.

Senator McGRATH:
  The department investigates potential breaches of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and takes compliance action where an action has had, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on national heritage places. The department works cooperatively with the Western Australian government to investigate actions impacting on national heritage places.

Leave granted.




Senator WATERS:
  I move the motion as amended:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


(i) the study by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies published this week shows that 67 per cent of corals in a 700 km swathe of reefs in the northern region of the Great Barrier Reef have died after the Reef's worst ever mass bleaching event,


(ii) mass coral bleaching is worsened by human-induced global warming,


(iii) Climate Action Tracker has assessed Australia's climate pollution reduction targets and clean energy policies as 'inadequate' to meet our fair share of action to stop dangerous global warming, and


(iv) the latest government figures show that Australia's climate pollution is increasing rather than decreasing; and


(b) calls on the Government to save the Great Barrier Reef, and the communities and workers which rely on its health, and help stop dangerous global warming by taking rapid action to cut pollution and build clean energy.

Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government is taking strong action on climate change. We have ratified the Paris Agreement and committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent compared to 2005 levels by 2030. This ambitious target is in line with the actions of other countries. Our landmark Reef 2050 plan is a 35-year plan to ensure the reef is protected for future generations. The Australian and Queensland governments are jointly investing $2 million over 10 years to improve reef health. The coalition government is taking leadership in managing the transition to a lower emissions economy including through COAG.

  It seems as though everybody wants to move to have some kind of inquiry into this.

The Labor Party is saying that it is going to have a look at this in the tax avoidance inquiry. The Greens have had advice from the parliament that that is inappropriate given the terms of reference. 


We do not understand why Labor will not support this motion. It seems as though it wants to shoehorn gas royalties and the PRRT into the corporate tax inquiry, which will not look at this. These companies pay no tax, not because they are avoiding tax but because the laws we have put in place allow it. Our resources tax regime is completely broken, but it seems as though Labor does not want to take the opportunity to fix it. Perhaps it is because previous Labor ministers have gone to work for the oil and gas industry. We need to get to the bottom of this. The references committee we are proposing will do that.

Leave granted.




Senator BACK:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I will confine my remarks, in case there are others who wish to speak on other topics before the time expires. The committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Alex Gallacher, brought this report down late last year. The report records the fact that this year is the 50th anniversary of Australia's diplomatic relations with Mexico. We regard it as a critically important report, which went into our economic, cultural and other links with that country. There were 13 recommendations, and I am delighted to note that the government has either noted, supported or accepted 12 of the 13—and, indeed, they are correct when they say they did not support the 13th because time has moved on and it was no longer necessary.


I would like to comment for just a few moments on those recommendations the government supported. We recommended that the government work closely with Australian businesses to raise awareness of risks and particularly benefits of doing business in Mexico and to dispel exaggerations of risks with regard to security and corruption in that country. The government of Mexico has worked very assiduously to try and overcome those elements that have previously given it a reputation of being a corrupt place to work. I visited Mexico in January of last year and was particularly impressed by the diligence and the industry of the people I met in the hard-rock mining and oil and gas space, particularly, and I am pleased to see the government has supported that recommendation No. 4.


The fifth recommendation, which the government accepted, was one in which we urged our government to work together with Australian universities and institutions to review the accreditation of Mexican qualifications, so that we could achieve mutual recognition of qualifications by 2020. We are already seeing the benefits of the New Colombo Plan involving Asian countries. We will see some 50,000 graduates study at least a semester, if not a year, in Asia within the next 10 years. One of the recommendations was that we urged the Australian government, in funding and continuing to fund the New Colombo Plan, to extend it, given the benefits that accrue to the students themselves, the institution at which they study and the institution once they return home.


The relationship between Australia and Mexico was really brought home to me when I was invited to the geological survey of Mexico down at Pachuca. I was shown maps of the metalliferous states and territories of Mexico, those which are sufficient for mining companies and others to be able to use to examine the possibility of exploration in Mexico. The director-general very proudly turned to me to tell me that the software that had allowed them to develop those maps and that technology had been provided to them by Geoscience Australia and the CSIRO.


The sixth recommendation, again supported by the government, was that our government allocate additional funding to promote Australian vocational education services—VET sector services—in Mexico. Again, we have a tremendous opportunity for Australian institutions of higher education and in the VET sector to work with those in Mexico to improve standards. Internationally, as we know, Australia has developed an enviable reputation for not just the calibre and the quality of our higher education and VET sectors but the willingness of the Australian higher education and VET sector to share our expertise around the world. A very, very quick illustration of that: when I met with the executives of Pemex, the Mexican government owned oil company, they told me that Pemex was in the act of setting up a Pemex university so that their students in the oil and gas sector could get a focus of understanding. As a result of that visit that I made in January last year, Austrade has hosted a visit to Western Australia and Queensland in which UWA, Curtin University and Queensland University have, in fact, had the opportunity to discuss with Mexicans where they might be able to have that involvement. The recommendation that was not accepted was one in which we urged that there be a wider opportunity in Mexican cities for students wanting to come to Australia to study, to undertake medical examinations prior to being granted visas. In its explanation back in its response, the Australian government has noted that, in fact, there is an adequacy now of locations and medical personnel who can undertake those works.


In the same space—trying to make immigration easier between the countries—we recommended that our Department of Immigration and Border Protection review the current student visa provisions to reduce processing times for Mexican students, and you can see the obvious reason why. Again, the government supported the recommendation that we encourage research collaboration between Australia and Mexico and that more resources be devoted to that purpose, and we have seen enormous opportunity in the past. I hope we do in the future actually see closer collaboration between the two.


The 11th recommendation, again supported by the government, was for further allocation of resources to Austrade to raise awareness of the significant value-chain opportunities in the Mexican automotive sector. And I spoke earlier in this chamber today about the fact that, whilst our vehicle manufacturing industry is coming to a close, the Mexicans understand well the quality and extent of our vehicle component manufacturing industry. They manufacture three million vehicles a year, moving up to five million vehicles a year by 2020. And so we have already seen seminars in Adelaide and Melbourne where Australian vehicle component manufacturers have had an opportunity to meet through Austrade with Mexican suppliers to see where we can further those particular opportunities. I certainly commend Senator Gallacher, particularly for his work in emphasising the need to do that.


The final one that I will address myself to is, in fact, the final recommendation, again supported by the government, and that is that Austrade be encouraged to work with the Export Council of Australia to develop a suite of practical, user-friendly tools to assist Australian small to medium enterprises, especially service companies, to understand and utilise the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. It may not be in the form that was intended—the TPP is not going ahead—but I have certainly had preliminary discussions with the trade minister and I will be continuing to urge the government to examine options for increasing free trade between Australia and Mexico in not only agricultural and viticultural products such as wine and other agricultural products but also barley and oats, for example. Also, the Mexicans want to export a greater number of avocados into Australia—I hope it has got nothing to do with those terrible drinks that they were plying me with, tequila and others!


But, nevertheless, the opportunity exists in our mining sector in your state and mine. They know very well the calibre and capacity of the Western Australian hard-rock mining exploration industry and they want to tap into it. Of course, if we can develop free trade arrangements with them, we can reduce tariffs and we can eliminate tariffs all to the good. So I do thank the government for its response and, again, I commend my colleague, Senator Gallacher, for the work he did in chairing that committee.


Question agreed to.

Australian Government response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report: Australia's relationship with Mexico


October 2016




INTRODUCTION



On 20 August 2015 the Senate referred the matter of Australia's relationship with Mexico to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2015.


The Committee's Terms of Reference required it to report to the Parliament with particular reference to:


a. Mexico's continued elevation in the global geo-political and economic order and its implications for Australia;


b. opportunities for enhanced relations, including the potential for increased bilateral engagement and also through jointly held memberships such as the G20, APEC, OECD and MIKTA;


c. potential opportunities for enhanced trade and investment ties, in particular those emanating from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP);


d. scope for increased collaboration in the education sector and the potential for extending scholarship programs to Mexico;


e. scope for increased trade and commercial exchange in the resources sectors with particular reference to hard rock mining and the Oil & Gas sector in the Gulf of Mexico;


f. scope for cross investment and joint ventures in Australian and Mexican infrastructure projects; and


g. any other related matters.


The Committee delivered its report, containing 13 recommendations, on 2 December 2015.



AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE



The Australian Government has considered the Committee's report and provides the following response to its recommendations.







Recommendation 1



The Committee recommends that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and Biosecurity Australia assign high priority to the import risk analyses for Mexican agricultural goods such as avocados, table grapes and limes currently awaiting import risk analysis. If the analyses cannot be concluded before the end of 2016, the committee requests a written explanation outlining the reasons for delay and providing an expected date of completion for each product.








The Government notes the Committee's recommendation.


The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) has focussed its resources on Mexico's highest market access request priority which is table grapes. DAWR released the draft report for the non-regulated analysis of existing policy for table grapes from Sonora, Mexico, on 13 January 2016 for a 30 day stakeholder consultation period. The draft report and related documents are available on the DAWR's website. Five submissions were received on the draft report, including from Mexico's National Plant Protection Organisation and four Australian state government agriculture departments (Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales). DAWR will consider all stakeholder submissions received before issuing a final report.


As work is ongoing for Mexico's highest priority import risk analysis request, in addition to work on priority import requests from other key markets, work is not being conducted on avocados or limes at this time. Once table grape considerations are finalised, next priorities will be considered in consultation with Mexico.







Recommendation 2



The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, working with Mexican authorities, develop a strategic plan for the establishment of direct flights between Mexico and Australia by 2020. The strategic plan should incorporate consultation with airlines, tourism industries in both countries, and ANZMEX and should be presented to the Parliament before December 2016.








The Government notes the Committee's recommendation.


The Government has already put in place all of the regulatory framework needed for direct flights to commence between Australia and Mexico. It is now up to airlines to make commercial assessments as to whether to commence direct flights.


Specifically, air services with Mexico are enabled by a treaty-level Air Services Agreement signed in 2010. Under current air services arrangements, airlines can operate direct flights between Australia and Mexico.


As the legal framework is already in place, the Government considers that a decision to operate direct air services between Australia and Mexico is one to be made by airlines based on commercial imperatives.


While there are currently no direct air services between Australia and Mexico, both Qantas and Virgin Australia have code-share arrangements on flights between the United States and Mexico.







Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that the Australian government work to grant Mexican travellers eligibility for the eVisitor visa before the end of 2016. If this is not possible, the Committee requests a written explanation outlining the reasons for delay and providing an expected date of completion.








The Government notes the Committee's recommendation.


eVisitor (subclass 651) was created to support arrangements Australia negotiated with the European Union. As such it has been available only to citizens of European Union countries, Andorra, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland, and the Vatican City, and it was not envisaged that it be extended to any other countries.


Mexican passport holders can apply online for a Visitor visa (subclass 600), and have been able to do so since May 2014. The Visitor visa allows people to visit Australia for both tourism or business visitor purposes, and its validity period can be longer than the eVisitor (subclass 651).


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is also, as part of a broad, strategic review of the visa framework, considering ways in which the Visitor visa framework could be improved for all nationalities in the long-term, including Mexico. It is, however, unlikely that additional countries will be added to the eVisitor eligibility list as a result of this review.







Recommendation 4



The Committee recommends that the Australian government work with Australian businesses to raise awareness of the risks and benefits of doing business in Mexico and to dispel exaggerations of risk with regards to security and corruption in Mexico.








The Government supports this recommendation and wishes to advise the Committee that measures along these lines are already being undertaken.


In respect of risks regarding security, prior to travelling to Mexico Australians are strongly encouraged to read the travel advice provided on the Smartraveller website by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is recommended that all overseas travel, including to Mexico, be registered on Smartraveller.


Providing practical and timely information to Australian businesses regarding business conditions in Mexico including security and corruption issues is a priority for Austrade. In order to do this effectively Austrade maintains a number of valuable local relationships with key risk consultants including Control Risks, Emerging Markets Political Risk Analysis (EMPRA) and the major accounting firms. In addition, Austrade regularly consults with the independent think-tank, the Mexican Institute for Competition (IMCO) on a range of 'rule of law' issues.


Austrade also provides information on doing business in Mexico online at http://www.austrade.gov.au/Australian/Export/Export-markets/Countries/Mexico/Doing-business


The Australian Embassy in Mexico City, including the Trade Commissioner, maintain regular contact with Australian industry bodies, relevant chambers of commerce, State and Territory Governments, and other stakeholders to raise awareness of opportunities and challenges in the Mexican market and to dispel any unfounded concerns. A range of social networks (including Facebook and LinkedIn) are also utilised to communicate major developments in Mexico.


Reports, such as 'Mexico: Gateway to the Americas', which was released in February 2016 by the Export Council of Australia will also assist to raise awareness of the risks and rewards of conducting business in Mexico. Previous governments have also sought to raise business awareness of Mexico. For example, as long ago as 2002 the Council on Australia-Latin America Relations in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade released the publication ""Doing Business in Mexico"".







Recommendation 5



The Committee recommends that the Australian government work together with Australian universities to review the accreditation of existing Mexican qualifications and achieve mutual recognition of qualifications by 2020.








The Government accepts this recommendation in principle.


In Australia, the recognition of overseas qualifications for study and employment purposes is decentralised. Each education institution and professional recognition authority establishes its own policies and processes for qualifications recognition, including the establishment of mutual recognition arrangements. Professional and industry bodies, registration and licensing authorities, state and territory governments and employers are responsible for the recognition of overseas qualifications for employment purposes, which usually involves the assessment of overseas qualifications and skills against the standards required for employment in the relevant occupation in Australia. The recognition of overseas qualifications for study purposes is under the remit of Australian education institutions which are autonomous entities that determine their own policies for admission and recognition.


The Government will continue to work through the Department of Education and Training (DET) with recognition organisations to have transparent, equitable and timely assessment arrangements in place. DET will continue to provide information and support services through the Country Education Profiles (CEPs), an online qualification recognition tool designed to help relevant authorities to recognise overseas higher education and postsecondary technical and vocational educational qualifications. These profiles provide non-binding information on the comparability of overseas qualifications from around 130 countries, including Mexico. Recommendations on the comparability of overseas qualifications are based on in-depth analysis of a range of quantitative and qualitative education indicators.


DET has also committed additional resources to expanding education cooperation with Mexico. In August 2014, DET appointed an Education and Science Counsellor to Latin America. This led to the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding in Education, Research and Training in April 2015 with Mexico, and a joint education committee is being established.


Activities undertaken and underway with Mexico to increase mutual understanding and awareness of qualifications frameworks and recognition arrangements include:


hosting an official from the Mexican Ministry of Public Education, in August 2015, to help increase their understanding of Australia's qualification framework and recognition arrangements; and


sharing best practices and increasing mutual understanding in 2016 through occupational standards by hosting the APEC Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Project with Mexico (and the other Pacific Alliance countries). The project will build skills in the area of transport and logistics and include developing occupational standards as well as equipping trainers with new skills through the new International Skills Training TVET training and assessment course.


The first meeting of the joint working group and agreement on joint activities will both take place in 2016. Work will include building on the qualification framework and recognition activities already undertaken as well as joint activities to support greater cooperation in education between Australia and Mexico.


The Government also places considerable importance on bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations, with free trade agreements such as Trans-Pacific Partnership providing opportunities to deepen engagement in education and training between countries like Australia and Mexico. These agreements are also valuable in supporting the recognition of qualifications internationally and can play a role in providing trained professionals with more transparent and predictable operating conditions in overseas labour markets.







Recommendation 6



The Committee recommends that the Australian government allocate additional funding for initiatives to promote Australian VET services in Mexico.








The Government supports this recommendation and wishes to advise the Committee that measures along these lines are already being undertaken.


The promotion of Australian vocational education and training (VET) services is a priority for Austrade's office in Mexico, along with the recruitment of Mexican students for study in Australian institutions.


Austrade's overarching strategy across Latin America is to position Australia's research, education and training expertise in specific sectors such as energy, mining, agri-food, water and health—sectors that are a priority for governments in the region and in which Australia has world-leading capability not just in human capital development but also across equipment, technology and services. In Mexico, opportunities in the advanced manufacturing sector are also relevant.


Austrade's office in Mexico has identified significant demand for skilled workers and for industry-led competency-based training systems, and is exploring opportunities for Australian VET providers to be involved in the delivery of training using Trans National Education (TNE) models, particularly in the oil and gas and agri-food sectors.


Significantly, this year the Council of Australia Latin America Relations (COALAR) is funding the Australian Council for Private Education & Training (ACPET) to undertake a mission to Mexico in order to scope opportunities for Australia's VET sector in Mexico. This mission is scheduled to take place in the final quarter of this financial year with the support of Austrade's office in Mexico. It follows a previous visit in 2014 by TAFE Directors Australia and should be most effective in unlocking opportunities for Australian VET providers.







Recommendation 7



The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade consider whether there is scope to extend the New Colombo Plan to include Mexico as a destination country.








The Government notes the Committee's recommendation.


The New Colombo Plan is a signature initiative of the Government that aims to lift knowledge of the Indo-Pacific in Australia by supporting Australian undergraduates to study and undertake professional experiences in the region. It was inspired by Australia's experience under the original Colombo Plan, where over a 30 year period, thousands of students from neighbouring countries came to study in Australia.


Australia's geographic region is the focus of the New Colombo Plan as it is crucial to Australia's future economic, trade and diplomatic interests. The 38 current eligible study locations, encompassing South Asia, North Asia, South East Asia and a number of Pacific Island countries, provide a strong and coherent regional focus for the program.


The New Colombo Plan is still at a relatively early stage of implementation and 2015 was the first year of the full roll-out of the program. Student numbers are still scaling up. The Government is of the view that it is preferable to embed the program in its current form before considering major changes, including to the geographic scope of the program.


At the same time the Government is committed to increasing the number of Australian students studying overseas globally and continues to make a significant investment in supporting undergraduate, postgraduate and vocational education and training (VET) students to study overseas, through Endeavour Mobility Grants.


The Government, through the Department of Education and Training (DET) offers three programs that support student mobility to Mexico which provide short-term study for Australian VET students, short-term and semester study for Australian higher education students, and semester study for students from Mexico (to study in Australia).







Recommendation 8



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection appoint additional panel physicians in key Mexican cities to reduce delays to international student medical examinations.








The Government does not accept this recommendation.


Presently, there are three panel sites in Mexico that conduct immigration medical examinations for Australia-bound clients including Mexico City, Guadalajara and Ciudad Juarez. Approximately 1,500 cases were completed by the three panels in the Programme Year 2014-2015—an increase of about 300 cases from the previous financial year and easily accommodated within the current capacity.


Each panel site comprises panel physicians and radiologists and is deemed to have sufficient capacity to undertake additional cases, particularly during the student peak periods as well as utilising locum panel doctors during peak periods. No delays in appointments are currently experienced with all clients being seen generally within a few days and the ability to take same day appointments if urgent.


Historically panel services were provided in three other locations: Mexicali, Merida and Monterrey. However, the low volumes in these sites (for instance before removal in 2012 Monterrey undertook only five medicals in a six month period) meant quality standards were not complied with and significant concerns arose around integrity issues. To maintain standards a minimum number of medicals is required which is deemed to be at least 150 per doctor per annum. Furthermore Australia utilises an eMedical platform that is costly for panel physicians to have in place and each additional panel member raises the support costs for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.







Recommendation 9



The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection review its current student visa provisions to reduce visa application processing times for Mexican students.








The Government supports this recommendation and wishes to advise the Committee that measures along these lines are already being undertaken.


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection conducted a comprehensive review of the Student streamlined visa processing arrangements during the 2014-15 programme year. Following this review, the Government announced on 16 June 2015 that it intended to introduce a simplified student visa framework (SSVF) from July 2016. The SSVF is expected to make the visa application process simpler to navigate for international students, including those from Mexico.







Recommendation 10



The committee recommends that the Australian government actively encourage research collaboration between Australia and Mexico and that more resources be made available to Australian universities and research institutions to facilitate this collaboration.








The Government supports this recommendation and wishes to advise the Committee that measures along these lines are already being undertaken.


The Government is actively engaging with Mexico to increase mutual understanding of each country's research systems, identify strengths and opportunities, and raise awareness of programmes to support international cooperation in research.


Since the appointment in 2014 of a new Education and Science Counsellor in Latin America, interested Government departments collaborated to facilitate the signing in 2015 of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Australian Academy of Science and the Mexican Academy of Sciences to support cooperation between Australian and Mexican researchers.


Steps have also been taken to promote awareness of the substantial funding already provided by the Government to support research, including international research collaboration. This includes the research funding provided to universities, including for the International Postgraduate Research Scholarships, and to publicly funded research agencies like the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation, as well as the funding which the Government makes available through the competitive grants processes administered by the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.


Through DET, the Government provides Research Block Grants (RBGs) to universities to support the indirect costs of Australian competitive grants, end user research and research training. RBG funding is not tied to specific funded projects, allowing universities to make strategic decisions on their research investments, including international collaboration. RBG funding also includes the International Postgraduate Research Scheme, which provides funding for international postgraduate students to work in areas of research strength in the Australian higher education sector.


DET also administers OS-HELP which is a loan available to eligible students enrolled in a Commonwealth supported place who want to undertake some of their study overseas. OS-HELP can be used for a range of expenses such as airfares, accommodation, and other travel or study expenses.


DET is also raising awareness of the Endeavour Scholarships, Fellowships, and Mobility Grant programmes in Mexico. These programmes provide opportunities to nurture international education and research collaboration through student, academic, professional and research exchanges.


DET is also working regionally, including through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) which includes Mexico, to promote greater international research collaboration in the Asia Pacific region. The Australian Government launched the Australia-APEC Women in Research Fellowship in 2015. Up to 10 fellowships per year are offered for female post-doctorate researchers to work in partnership with an Australian education institution to undertake a research project. One Mexican was awarded a fellowship in the first round to undertake research into the drought tolerance of plant species at the University of Technology Sydney.


In addition, to boost research collaboration across the region, DET hosted the Australia-APEC Researcher Mobility Workshop in Jakarta in December 2015 to bring together government officials and university leaders from APEC economies to explore ways to support increased mobility of researchers, and enhance research innovation. This workshop yielded a number of suggestions for future work and Australia, through DET, has the support of APEC economies to lead two further projects—one on collecting information on the scale and scope of researcher mobility in the APEC region and one on researcher integrity. DET will continue to work with all APEC economies on collaborative projects and activities.


In July 2016, a representative of the Australian Government's Australian Research Council (ARC) travelled to Latin America visiting a number of countries, including Mexico, and met with senior government officials and university representatives to provide in-depth information about how the Government supports research and evaluates the quality of research at Australian universities. Discussions also addressed opportunities for the support of international research collaboration available under ARC funding schemes.


Many stakeholders in Mexico, including the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), the Mexican Academy of Sciences, and the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, indicated interest in identifying potential Australian partners for research collaboration and acquiring a greater understanding of the methodology underpinning the Excellence in Research for Australia evaluation process. Follow up activities are underway.


The Government has a clear commitment to growing international cooperation in education and research and diversifying Australia's global engagement by building relationships with key Latin American countries, including Mexico. The Government will continue to actively collaborate with Mexico to increase mutual understanding of education and research policies, systems and reforms and to support the development of institutional partnerships and scholar, academic and researcher exchanges.







Recommendation 11



The Committee recommends that additional resources be allocated to Austrade to raise awareness of the significant value chain opportunities in the Mexican automotive sector (and advanced manufacturing more broadly) and assist Australian suppliers of OEMs and automotive aftermarket to quickly and effectively engage with the Mexican automotive market.








The Government supports this recommendation and wishes to advise the Committee that measures along these lines are already being undertaken.


Given the size of Mexico's advanced manufacturing sector, the identification of business opportunities for Australian companies in its automotive and aerospace industries and in advanced manufacturing value chains more generally is a major priority for Austrade's office in Mexico City in 2015-16 and beyond.


In the automotive sector, Austrade is targeting opportunities for Australian suppliers to OEM manufacturers and to the automotive aftermarket, and is working closely with key industry stakeholders such as the Federation of Automotive Parts Manufacturers (FAPM), the Australian Industry Group (AiGroup), the Victorian Government, ProMexico (Austrade's Mexican counterpart) and the Mexican Business Council for Foreign Trade, Investment and Technology (COMCE).


In April 2016, Austrade will team with AiGroup to conduct a trade mission to a major automotive show and to tour the key industrial states in the Bajio region of Mexico, in order to meet major automotive suppliers and key Government officials who are central to supporting foreign investment in the sector.


In aerospace, Australia has significant niche expertise across the value chain, particularly in component manufacture and in maintenance, repair and operations (MRO), and this expertise aligns neatly with Mexico's position as a regional aerospace manufacturing hub. Austrade is focusing on potential opportunities in this sector with a view to organising a trade mission in FY 2016-17.







Recommendation 12



The Committee recommends that additional resources be allocated to the Australian diplomatic and Austrade posts in Mexico, particularly the provision of additional specialised staff to assist Australian small to medium enterprises wishing to enter the Mexican market in the wake of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.








The Government notes the Committee's recommendation.


The Government is committed to ensuring that Australian businesses, and particularly small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), are fully aware of, and able to capitalise on, business opportunities that emerge as a result of free trade agreements such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). This will be a focus for Australia's diplomatic mission and the Austrade office in Mexico and in other TPP signatory countries in the lead-up to and following implementation of the agreement.


In the absence of additional staff, which is a resourcing question, Australia's diplomatic mission and the Austrade office in Mexico City will reprioritise the work of existing staff to assist Australian business to take advantage of opportunities provided under the TPP.







Recommendation 13



The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade work with the Export Council of Australia to develop a suite of practical, user-friendly tools to assist Australian small to medium enterprises, especially service companies, understand and utilise the Trans-Pacific Partnership.








The Government supports this recommendation.


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) work closely together to inform and prepare industry for the implementation of all free trade agreements entered into by Australia, including the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). In the lead-up to implementation of TPP, DFAT and Austrade will work closely with the business community, including relevant industry bodies, on a program of activities to raise awareness and encourage utilisation of the agreement once it has entered into force. These activities are likely to include information seminars and workshops both onshore and offshore, as well as practical tools to assist SMEs to capitalise on business opportunities that result from the TPP in Mexico and in other signatory countries.


Further, DFAT will be providing input and assistance to the Export Council of Australia (ECA) in the development of its series of ""trade policy workshops"" to be held in May in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. The workshops are intended to be practical and informative about how businesses can use FTAs including the TPP.


In respect of Austrade's broader relationship with the ECA, it is important to note that Austrade has provided significant support to the ECA in the development of a landmark report 'Mexico: Gateway to the Americas' that was released in February 2016. Austrade expects this relationship will continue to flourish given the rising importance of the market for Australian businesses.




Australian Government response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report: Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016 [Provisions]







October 2016





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Senate pass the bill.


The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016 was passed by both Houses of Parliament on 12 September 2016 and received Royal Assent on 16 September 2016.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources continue to consult with Research and Development Corporations and representatives of the agricultural industry as it implements the regulatory and administrative framework associated with the measures contained in the bill.


The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources has commenced the consultation process and in August 2016 engaged Callida Consulting to develop a set of business requirements that will inform the design of levy payer registers. Callida Consulting has conducted targeted stakeholder workshops across Australia to understand how people interact with the levy system, and how levy payer information might be consolidated without adding unnecessary regulatory burden.


The department is also developing guidance material that will set out expectations regarding appropriate use of the data, including its disclosure by a research and development corporation to a third party, where approved by the department's secretary.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources table a response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee's report tabled in June 2015: Inquiry into the industry structures and systems governing the imposition and disbursement of marketing and research and development levies in the agriculture sector.


The Australian Government response was tabled on 5 May 2016.




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE INQUIRY INTO THE PRACTICE OF SPORT SCIENCE IN AUSTRALIA





Introduction



On 16 May 2013 the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee (Committee) commenced an Inquiry into the Practice of Sports Science in Australia. The Inquiry focussed on:


1. the current scope of practice, accreditation and regulation arrangements for the profession


2. the role of boards and management in the oversight of sports scientists inside sporting organisations


3. the duty of care of sports scientists to athletes, and the ethical obligations of sports scientists in relation to protecting and promoting the spirit of sport


4. avenues for reform or enhanced regulation of the profession, and


5. any other related matter.


The Inquiry was prompted by the introduction of proposed amendments to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act 2006 and followed on from the release of the findings of the Australian Crime Commission's investigation into organised crime and drugs in sport (Project APERIO). The investigation found serious unethical behaviour by registered and non‑registered support staff within sporting clubs which potentially endangered the health and welfare of athletes. The Commission noted:


""Sports scientists are now influential in professional sport in Australia, with some of these individuals prepared to administer substances to elite athletes which are untested or not yet approved for human use""1.



The Inquiry received 21 submissions and conducted a public hearing in Canberra on 12 June 2013. The Committee tabled its final report on 23 July 2013. The Committee made four recommendations while thirteen recommendations were made by Committee member, Senator Di Natale.


The Government acknowledges the work of the Committee in undertaking the Inquiry and appreciates the contribution of the many stakeholders who made written submissions and/or appeared as witnesses at the public hearing.


The Government recognises the fundamental importance of maintaining the integrity of sport, and ensuring the individual health and welfare of players is protected at all times. Sports themselves play a central role in achieving these outcomes.




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO INQUIRY
'
S RECOMMENDATIONS



It was the view of the Committee that the Government's response to the Inquiry's recommendations should wait until the finalisation of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority investigation into allegations of doping in Australia's professional sports. The Government has respected that recommendation. It is now unlikely there are any remaining matters from the investigation that would have a significant bearing on the Government's response to the Committee's recommendations.


The Australian Crime Commission's report highlighted the risk of engaging athlete support persons who operate outside a sport's rules or with little regard to a person's health and well‑being. While the vast majority of athlete support persons work ethically and professionally and make significant contributions to sporting success, the consequences of inappropriate conduct by a few can be far reaching.


Since the Senate Inquiry, there have been a number of developments in the Australian sporting landscape that relate to the Committee's recommendations. These include:


an increased focus on integrity matters by national sporting organisations, including the formation of dedicated integrity units in a number of sports, ensuring more effective governance and management processes including in relation to engagement of athlete support persons and revised supplements use policies;


amendment of Australia's anti-doping legislation in 2014 to align with the revised World Anti-Doping Code, with changes coming into effect from 1 January 2015. The amendments included the introduction of the new 'prohibited association' anti‑doping rule violation which seeks to prevent proven doping facilitators from working with athletes, and


enhanced education on integrity issues and ethical decision-making in sport across the sporting sector, including on-line education modules, dedicated integrity forums, and specific programs within sports.


The Government has incorporated these developments in considering its responses to the Committee's recommendations.




Recommendation 1





The Committee recommends that the federal government consider developing a statement of ethics that would apply to all Australian participants in sports.





Government Position: AGREE, noting initiatives undertaken since the Inquiry to promote ethical behaviour in sport.



The involvement of Australians in organised sport is critically linked to the values that sport promotes and the health and lifestyle benefits sport delivers. It is expected the outcome of a sporting contest is based on ability, experience, determination, and fair play. Athletes and administrators are expected to abide by rules and behave ethically.


The Australian Sports Commission works closely with the Australian Human Rights Commission, state and territory departments of sport and recreation, anti‑discrimination and human rights agencies, the NSW Office of the Children's Guardian, and the Australian and New Zealand Sports Law Association to promote Play by the Rules2. Play by the Rules provides comprehensive guidance on issues of ethics in sport, highlighting the importance of fair, safe and inclusive participation across all levels of the sport sector.


Between March and May 2015, Play by the Rules, the Australian Sports Commission, the National Integrity of Sport Unit, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority and all state and territory departments of sport and recreation collaborated in the delivery of Safeguarding the Integrity of Sport forums around Australia. The forums addressed issues of anti-doping, match fixing and the use of supplements and image‑enhancing substances, based on an ethical decision-making framework.


These principles should be embraced in the codes of conduct that apply within organised sport and in the operation of programs and activities delivered by sporting organisations to their members.


The Committee's recommendation for a statement of ethics should be considered in the context of subsequent initiatives to promote ethical behaviour in sport. In particular, Play by the Rules fulfils this recommendation.




Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends that tertiary institutions offering sports science courses include topics on ethics, which should refer to the duty of care of sports scientists to athletes and the importance of protecting athlete health and welfare.





Government Position: AGREE IN PRINCIPLE



Evidence before the Committee indicated most people involved in sports science behave ethically and work to protect athlete health and welfare. Nevertheless, athletes must be able to be confident the people providing them with specialist performance assistance are doing so with athlete health and welfare foremost in mind. It is appropriate that training and assessment on ethics and duty-of-care should form part of undergraduate studies in those professions in which expertise is used to advance sports performance.


Appropriate training in ethics in tertiary institutions is incorporated into considerations of Recommendation 4.




Recommendation 3





The Committee recommends that sporting organisations and/or clubs provide all athletes entering professional and/or high
‑performance sports programmes with specific training on sports ethics, integrity issues and their rights and responsibilities in relation to their long-term health and welfare.





Government Position: AGREE



Sporting organisations and clubs have an obligation to athletes and support persons to provide information on their rights, roles and responsibilities in terms of protecting the integrity of sport. This includes educating members about the standards of ethical behaviour, and need to protect long-term personal health and welfare.


Athletes have a similar obligation to be aware of and understand their rights and responsibilities.


To the extent the Government may meaningfully contribute to this outcome, there are a number of existing resources that support the recommendation.


The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Sports Science Sports Medicine Best Practice Principles is a practical guide to assist boards and senior management of sporting organisations in performing their oversight function in relation to sports science and sports medicine practices.


The National Integrity of Sport Unit, within the Department of Health, has launched an anti-match-fixing e-learning education program on the threat of match-fixing to help sports organisations to educate players, coaches and officials. The National Integrity of Sport Unit, in collaboration with the Australian Sports Commission, has also released an 'illicit drugs in sport' e-learning education program designed to inform sports people on the dangers of illicit drugs to their health and sporting endeavours.


The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority hosts an anti‑doping e-learning education tool, developed for the Australian sporting community, to provide education on key areas of anti-doping such as prohibited substances and methods, therapeutic use exemptions, doping control and whereabouts.


The National Integrity of Sport Unit and Australian Sports Anti‑Doping Authority have developed an e-learning ethical decision making course that includes modules on anti‑doping, match-fixing and illicit drugs. Further, teacher lesson plans on sports integrity matters have been developed for use in the national Health and Physical Education curriculum.


The Australian Sports Commission, National Integrity of Sport Unit and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority delivered Safeguarding the Integrity of Sport forums focusing on ethical dilemmas facing sport and providing participants with a framework to address these issues.




Recommendation 4





The Committee recommends that detailed consideration by the Australian Government of introducing new regulations for sports scientists in Australia be delayed until such time as the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority and/or the Australian Crime Commission have finalised their current investigations into the alleged use of drugs in Australian sport.





Government Position: AGREE



The Australian Crime Commission's Organised Crime and Drugs in Sport report highlighted the potential dangers in engaging athlete support persons prepared to operate at ethical margins and with disregard for an athlete's health and well‑being. While the majority of athlete support professionals act ethically and professionally, the consequences of inappropriate behaviour by a few can be severe and far-reaching.


The key issue in the Inquiry was whether the practice of sport science requires some form of governance to improve industry standards and counter the risks identified in the Australian Crime Commission report. Two approaches were given detailed consideration:


Registration—a formal scheme underpinned by legislation, or


Accreditation—a less-formal scheme run by industry and governed by quality assurance.


Implementing a registration scheme for sports scientists would involve excessive regulation for what is a small, specialised and dispersed profession. This option carries a significant administrative burden for Government and industry, and would be inconsistent with the Government's broader deregulation agenda.


In preference, the Government supports the operation of an effective industry‑based accreditation scheme. Such a scheme would ensure an athlete receives professional advice which is ethical and focused on health and well-being. Such a scheme should:


ensure a sport scientist is properly qualified and has contemporary ethical standards training;


encourage sport scientists to continue professional development and improve their skills;


provide athletes, employers and the public with a common understanding of what is meant by the term 'sport scientist' and confidence that services are being delivered by reputable people, and


provide a mechanism for taking action against individuals who behave unethically or corruptly.


Critical to this scheme is placing an obligation on employers to ensure only appropriately qualified individuals are engaged, codes of conduct observed, and appropriate action taken when breaches are identified.


The main employers of sport scientists are national sporting organisations, sporting clubs, the Australian Institute of Sport, state institutes and academies of sport and universities. Sports scientists would also be qualified to work in other health-related sectors such as injury rehabilitation and health promotion. Placing the obligation on employers to ensure only accredited sports scientists are employed involves a co-ordinated approach.


The Australian Institute of Sport is the largest employer of sport scientists in Australia. As it is part of the Australian Sports Commission, the Institute will be expected to only employ sport scientists who meet the appropriate accreditation standards.


State and territory institutes and academies of sport operate under the auspices of state and territory governments. The National Anti-Doping Framework is a non-binding agreement between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments to align domestic anti‑doping efforts through a set of agreed principles and identified areas for cooperation. This existing relationship between jurisdictions provides a platform for seeking a unified approach to the employment of accredited sports scientists in all institutes and academies of sport.


The Australian Sports Commission is the body responsible for the provision of Australian Government funds to Australia's national sporting organisations to develop sporting excellence and increase participation in sport. The Australian Sports Commission administers funding to individual sports through 'sport investment agreements'. These agreements underpin collaboration between the organisations by specifying those activitieseach is required to carry out along with measures of performance.


The Australian Sports Commission reviews the performance of national sporting organisations through the 'annual sport performance review' process. The outcomes of the review process identify themes or critical actions, including Australian Sports Commission support, to enhance the capability of sports. The review model is intended to balance certainty and continuity of funding with the need to achieve accountability for the Government's investment.


The proposed accreditation scheme would fit within these arrangements. National sporting organisations should adopt and observe the AIS Sports Science Sports Medicine Best Practice Principles.The employment of accredited sports scientists sits within the first of the Principlesand is therefore contained within the terms of each sport investment agreement. The operational detail of such a scheme will be a matter for the Australian Sports Commission as part of its standard review process and national sporting organisation obligations under their individual sport investment agreements. While the Australian Sports Commission will assess whether the accreditation of a sports scientist meets the required standard, the actual process for accreditation will need to be delivered from within the sports sector.


In its report, the Committee referenced the role of Exercise and Sports Science Australia in Australian sport. Exercise and Sports Science Australia is recognised as a peak organisation for exercise and sports scientists and the allied health profession of exercise physiology. Exercise and Sports Science Australia has administered a sport and exercise physiology accreditation system since 1996 and has now developed a tiered system of accreditation for sports scientists based on qualifications, practical experience and proficiency in meeting certain standards.



The standards address the uncertainty about the scope of the profession by defining the practice of sport science. Exercise and Sports Science Australia has also developed a grandfathering arrangement for accrediting experienced sports scientists and arrangements for maintaining accreditation standards over time. Exercise and Sports Science Australia has consulted with sports organisations, Sports Medicine Australia and the Australian Institute of Sport in the development of professional standards for sports scientists.




GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS BY SENATOR DI NATALE





Recommendation 1





The Committee recommends that the federal government consider developing a statement of ethics that would apply to all Australian participants in sports.





Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends that tertiary institutions offering sports science courses include topics on ethics, which should refer to the duty of care of sports scientists to athletes and the importance of protecting athlete health and welfare.





Recommendation 3





The Committee recommends that sporting organisations and/or clubs provide all athletes entering professional and/or high
‑performance sports programmes with specific training on sports ethics, integrity issues and their rights and responsibilities in relation to their long-term health and welfare.



Senator Di Natale's recommendations 1-3 repeat Committee Recommendations 1-3.




Recommendation 4





Senator Di Natale recommends that the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport (DRALGAS) conduct a feasibility study into Exercise & Sports Science Australia
'
s ability to administer a national system of sports science accreditation. In conducting this study, DRALGAS should consider the findings of both the Australian Crime Commission
'
s report on organised crime and drugs in sport and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority
'
s ongoing investigation into drugs in sport. Exercise and Sports Science Australia


must be capable of developing and implementing a tiered system that:





requires minimum qualifications or relevant demonstrated experience;





offers specialisation in relevant disciplines;





is relevant and of value to the profession and employers; and





is capable of achieving widespread uptake.



The Government notes the Exercise and Sports Science Australia submission to the Inquiry and its role as a body representing and advocating for university trained exercise and sport science professionals.


Since the completion of the Inquiry, Exercise and Sports Science Australia has developed an industry-based accreditation scheme for sports scientists. On this basis, a separate feasibility study is not required.




Recommendation 5





Senator Di Natale recommends that, subject to the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport
'
s feasibility study and its consideration of the Australian Crime Commission
'
s and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority
'
s findings:





Exercise & Sports Science Australia (ESSA) should be recognised and promoted as the single national accrediting body by all sporting employers in Australia; and





where an individual is hired by an employer in a sports science role, they must be able to demonstrate that they hold current ESSA accreditation as a sports scientist. This must be demanded by employers to prevent rogue individuals from 
'
code-hopping
'
.



The Government response to the Committee's Recommendation 4 addresses this recommendation.




Recommendation 6





Senator Di Natale recommends that accreditation as a sports scientist should be a condition of ongoing employment. If an individual
'
s accreditation is rescinded by the accrediting body following a breach of its code of conduct or an individual does not satisfy the re-accreditation requirements, the individual
'
s employment with the sporting organisation should be terminated. Employers should actively confirm the accreditation status and level of the personnel they employ in sports science roles on an annual basis, by formally requesting confirmation from the accrediting body. The accrediting body should ensure that it has the resources and processes in place to respond to these requests in a timely way.



The Government response to the Committee's Recommendation 4 addresses this recommendation.




Recommendation 7





Senator Di Natale recommends that, following the establishment of a widespread, tiered system of accreditation for sports scientists in Australia, the government should consider including relevant sports science disciplines in the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme.



The Government response to the Committee's Recommendation 4 addresses this recommendation.




Recommendation 8





Senator Di Natale recognises the need for publicly accessible information about substances and practices impacting on athlete health and wellbeing. The Senator recommends that the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport consider forming and promoting an independent advisory group. The utility of an independent source of advice would be to provide up-to-date, independent information for athletes, parents, sporting organisations, peak bodies and coaching staff.



The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority has a legislated responsibility to provide education on anti-doping. This education material covers most aspects of anti‑doping including general information on health effects:


the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority online course which is freely available


website


face to face education services


outreach stands at sporting events



Check your Substances online with GlobalDRO.


Athletes can access additional resources such as:


the World Anti-Doping Agency website and associated resources which include a range of toolkits for coaches, teachers, medical staff, and the online course Athlete Learning Programme about Health and Anti-Doping (ALPHA);


a Safe Guarding Integrity website developed by Play by the Rules which raises the awareness of drugs in sport, supplements and match fixing at the sub‑elite and community level;


the website www.playingclean.com.au which was developed by Curtin University, and


 the Australian Institute of Sport's Playbook provides athletes with access to the above-mentioned resources.


The Government response to the Committee's Recommendation 3 also provides details of existing resources.




Recommendation 9





Senator Di Natale recommends that the Australian Sports Commission
'
s 
Sports Governance Principles
 and 
AIS Sports Science Sports Medicine Best Practice Principles 
be:





recognised as promoting best practice principles;





adopted and adhered to by Australian sporting organisations; and





periodically reviewed to ensure that they strike the right balance between strengthening integrity measures and respecting the rights and best interests of athletes.



The Australian Sports Commission first published Sports Governance Principles in 2002 and Mandatory Sports Governance Principles in 2013 to promote and guide national sporting organisations to follow best practice governance. These principles were updated in 2012. The Mandatory Sports Governance Principles were introduced in 2013 and updated in 2015.


The 23 highest funded national sporting organisations are required to comply with the Commission's Mandatory Sports Governance Principles as part of their sports investment agreements. National sporting organisations outside these sports are benchmarked against these Principles. Included in the Mandatory Sports Governance Principles is the expectation that national sporting organisations adopt and observe the AIS Sports Science Sports MedicineBest PracticePrinciples.


The Australian Sports Commission monitors the performance of every funded national sporting organisation against the best practice principles through the Annual Sport Performance Review process.




Recommendation 10





Senator Di Natale recommends that the Minister for Sport makes publicly available information about the role, composition and progress of the Australian Sports Integrity Network.



The Australian Sports Integrity Network provides a vehicle through which member sporting organisations can work with Government to coordinate responses to sport integrity issues. Network members meet regularly to discuss integrity issues including but not limited to doping, manipulation of results, organised crime connections and illicit drug use.


The Network currently has over 20 members.


The National Integrity of Sport Unit hosts a Network members' website which acts as a resource for stakeholders to access up-to-date information, including integrity tools, education, contacts and research.


In addition, the Jurisdictional Sport Integrity Network and Committee of Australian Sport and Recreation Officials (CASRO) facilitates collaboration between Commonwealth, state and territory governments on sport integrity issues.




Recommendation 11





Senator Di Natale recommends that where a qualified medical practitioner is employed by a sporting organisation or team, the medical practitioner be required to approve any decision relating to athlete health and welfare including the use of supplements. Further, a sport scientist should be required to consult with an organisation or team
'
s medical officer regarding supplements as appropriate.



The Government recognises the important role doctors play in maintaining the health and welfare of athletes. Under the AIS Sports Science Sports Medicine Best Practice Principles, national sporting organisations should have:


a written Supplementation Policy approved by the organisation's Supplements Panel;


aMedication Policy, approved by the organisation's advising medical practitioner to oversee the use of prescription and over-the-counter medication by athletes, and


anInjection Policy, which prohibits athletes from self‑injecting and individuals other than a medical practitioner administering injections to an athlete.


The Australian Sports Commission's Mandatory Sports Governance Principles state Boards should adopt and observe the AIS Sport Science Sport Medicine Best Practice Principles. Through the Annual Sports Performance Review, the top 23 funded national sporting organisations are assessed against the AIS Sport Science Sports Medicine Best Practice Principles while other sports were benchmarked against these principles.


Sporting organisations have been reinforcing the role of doctors in protecting the welfare of athletes.


If a sporting organisation does not provide a medical officer to support the athletes, the athlete should seek the advice of a qualified medical practitioner.




Recommendation 12





Senator Di Natale recommends that where supplements are used within national sporting organisations, those organisations consider encouraging only the use of supplements classified as Group A in the Australian Institute of Sport Sports Supplement Programme.



The AIS Sports Supplement Framework builds on the expertise and resources developed during the implementation of the AIS's Sports Supplement Program from 2000 to 2013.


The Sports Supplement Framework was developed following consultation with key stakeholders in the Australian sports system, particularly via the 2013 AIS Supplement Summit. It provides elements around provision, education, research and governance for Australian sporting organisations to inform the development of appropriate sports supplement programs and guidelines.


The Government response to the Committee's Recommendation 3 notes the range of educational material made available to athletes and support persons since the Inquiry.




Recommendation 13





Senator Di Natale recommends that national sporting organisations consider:




implementing central registers of supplements in use by teams/clubs; and




making this information publicly available.



The AIS Sports Supplement Framework addresses this issue. Whether this information should be made publicly available is a matter for the national sporting organisation.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (18:07):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to better align the interests of life insurance advisers and consumers. 


In doing so the Bill acts on this Government's response to recommendation 24 of the Financial System Inquiry, the root and branch review, commissioned by this Government in late 2013.


Specifically the bill addresses the current conflicted remuneration of life insurance advisers who typically receive high up front commissions in many cases between 100% and 130% of premiums(and low trails of 10%) which incentivises policy replacement where there is no consumer benefit.


The life insurance sector is vital for our community. Life insurance provides essential financial security to Australians and their families at their time of greatest need. 


However, the life insurance sector can only fulfil this role in an effective manner when consumers have confidence that they are being placed into products appropriate to their circumstances.


Conflicted remuneration was prohibited by the Future of Financial Advice reforms in 2012 however life insurance sold outside of superannuation was exempt.


Subsequently three reports have considered remuneration structures for life insurance advice and the impact on consumers, namely ASIC's review of retail life insurance advice, the Financial System Inquiry (FSI) and the industry commissioned Trowbridge report.


The ASIC review found unacceptable levels of poor quality advice and a high correlation between poor advice and upfront commissions, including high lapse rates where consumers are 'churned' through products. Specifically, 45 per cent of cases reviewed involving high upfront commissions failed to meet the relevant legal standard for financial advice.


Subsequently the industry commissioned Trowbridge Review recommended a package of reforms, including a significant reduction in upfront commissions to limit incentives for advisers to inappropriately replace life insurance products or 'churn'.


Further, the Financial System Inquiry recommended a move to level commissions, where the commission is the same for each year of the policy. 


The Government asked industry to respond to these reviews and I want to publicly thank them for their constructive engagement and hard work in developing the agreement that underpins the reforms introduced in this Bill. This Bill shows what can be achieved when government, business and the community work together to improve consumer outcomes.


In particular I wish to thank the Association of Financial Advisers, the Financial Planning Association of Australia and the Financial Services Council. Each organisation has compromised and in working together have developed a reform package that will benefit life insurance customers through the provision of more appropriate advice and promote the long‑term sustainability of the industry.


This Bill removes the exemption from the ban on conflicted remuneration for advice on life insurance products and provides ASIC with the power to determine acceptable benefits payable for these products.


Under this approach, advisers will be able to receive commissions as long as the requirements set by ASIC in its legislative instrument are met. This will involve meeting two main requirements.


Firstly, there will be a cap on the size of allowable commissions. ASIC will have the power to lower these commissions, from around 100 to 130 per cent today to a maximum of 60 per cent from 1 January 2020. Ongoing commissions will be capped at 20 per cent from 1 January 2018.


Secondly, these remuneration arrangements will include 'clawback' provisions, under which part or all of the upfront commission will need to be repaid if the policy is cancelled or the premium reduces in the first two years. The Bill gives ASIC the power to create an instrument which covers acceptable clawback amounts. 


The Government acknowledges that the final form of the instrument is a matter for ASIC, as the independent regulator.


It is important to note however that there are no caps nor clawback arrangements for policies sold via level commission or on a fee for service arrangement as these arrangements are less likely to result in an incentive to provide inappropriate advice to consumers.


The Government has continued to listen to feedback raised by industry and key stakeholders during consultation on the life insurance reforms. 


Firstly, the Government has moved from a three to a two year clawback period in response to concerns about ongoing business viability.


Secondly, the Government has amended the commencement date of the reforms to 1 January 2018. This will enable the Government to remove the generous grandfathering that was available under FoFA, which allowed advisers to continue to receive conflicted remuneration for the length of their enterprise agreements plus an additional 12 months.


The Government wants these reforms to start as soon as possible and to apply equally to all advisers, whether they own their own small business or are employed by a major bank. To achieve this, the reforms will commence 12 months after the entire reform package is settled. This will provide advisers with 12 months to renegotiate their collective agreements to be consistent with the new legislation.


The Bill also enables the regulations to ensure that sales of life insurance that do not technically involve advice are captured by the reforms. The intention of this regulation making power is to ensure that all life insurance distribution channels are treated equally under the law and to maintain the integrity of the reforms by providing a flexible mechanism to address avoidance mechanisms in the future.


These legislative changes strike the right balance between protecting consumers and recognising the need for ongoing business viability and industry stability.


The Government believes that consumer interests will be best served by a competitive life insurance sector that delivers products appropriate to consumer needs and includes both small and large participants. 


Being such a significant reform to the sector, the Government understands that it is important for business to have time to adapt to this change. That is why there are transitional provisions which scale down the maximum permissible upfront commission over three stages. 


ASIC will undertake a review of the reforms in 2021. If this Review does not identify significant improvement in product churn and the quality of advice, the Government will move to mandate level commissions, as was recommended by the Financial System Inquiry. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2016-11-30,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (19:30):  The ugly hypocrisy and gross duplicity of the left side of politics is exposed on a daily, if not hourly, basis. But rarely is this ugliness and grossness so brazenly and vividly displayed for us as on the occasion of the passing of Cuba's brutal communist dictator, Fidel Castro, a dictator who personally oversaw the imprisonment, torture and murder of thousands of his own fellow Cubans, who witnessed up to 20 per cent of his own population flee his cruelty and barbarity, who, through his manic insistence of implementing failed Marxist dogma, condemned his people to lives of poverty and who, despite the poverty of his people, amassed fortunes for himself and his family. Such are the characteristics of a man that the morally bankrupt Left are now eulogising. Be it the hapless Secretary-General of the United Nations, who described the brutal dictator as 'a social reformer'. Really? And we as a nation pay hard-earned taxes—or, indeed, borrowed money—to sustain such an organisation. Or be it senior Labor frontbencher Senator Kim Carr, who eulogised this murderous tyrant with a silly tweet suggesting Castro was an 'extraordinary 20th century figure'. Really? Possibly, we should be thankful that he was not an ordinary 20th century figure, as that would have meant that most leaders would be anticipated to perpetrate horrendous carnage against their own people and impoverish them whilst enriching themselves. So much for Labor being the workers' friend.


Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon's comments were sadly, and boringly, predictable. But, really, how do the Greens seriously eulogise a man as a hero who imprisoned people because of their sexuality? They hail such a man as a social justice giant yet with a straight face and all the righteous indignation they can muster condemn those of us who seek to give the people a democratic vote in a plebiscite on whether to change society's foundational institution: marriage. For five long decades, at the end of a gun barrel, Fidel Castro terrorised and oppressed the Cuban people.


The life story of Armando Valladares, recounted in his book Against All Hope, should be compulsory reading for all those that are seeking to pay tribute to the life of the Fidel Castro. Valladares was imprisoned and tortured for 22 years under Castro and, interestingly, as a young man Valladares actually supported the revolution but quickly became disillusioned. For eight of the 22 years he was imprisoned, he was forced to sit naked in a cell without facilities and often without water. And yet the UN Secretary-General tells us Castro was a 'social reformer'. Valladares, in his book and in speeches that he has given since his release, has really shone a light on this very dark regime. Allow me to quote certain segments. For example:


Each night, the firing squad executed scores of men in its trenches. We could hear each phase of the executions, and during this time, these young men—patriots—would die shouting … Every night there were shootings. Every night. Every night. Every night.


Valladares, still early in his sentence, was offered the chance at political rehabilitation but refused to comply. He was sent to an even more brutal prison, as he recounts:


I spent eight years locked in a blackout cell, without sunlight or even artificial light. I never left. I was stuck in a cell, 10 feet long, four feet wide, with a hole in the corner to take care of my bodily needs. No running water. Naked. Eight years. All of the torture, all of the violations of human rights, had one goal: break the prisoner's resistance and make them accept political rehabilitation. That was their only objective.


And this great man, who we should be celebrating rather than Fidel Castro, withstood that for 22 years.


But yet, predictably, the ABC's coverage of Castro's death was straight out of the Left's intellectually bereft handbook. You know the type of bankruptcy, Madam Acting Deputy President: the dishonesty to which we have become accustomed from the ABC, who described him as a 'noble leader', airbrushing aside as of no consequence the sense of relief felt by the substantial expat community population that had fled his brutality. The EU President, the Canadian Prime Minister and others were all, in a similar vein, celebrating Fidel Castro's life, and yet, when you see and hear the story of Armando Valladares, you see the reality.


The good news in all of this is the overwhelming repulsion felt by so many freedom-loving people around the world. The Canadian Prime Minister has now been parodied and, quite rightly, ridiculed for his eulogy with a new hashtag on Twitter—#trudeaueulogies—which are mostly very witty but expose the outrageous nature of his initial eulogy from which he has now, thankfully, at least partially resiled. But whilst the Labor and Greens leadership fail to dissociate themselves from the grotesque eulogies of Senators Carr and Rhiannon we can only assume that the leadership of those two parties endorse and support those ugly eulogies, which in turn should serve as a timely reminder for all freedom-loving Australians who do genuinely believe in human rights why those parties should never be entrusted with the government of our nation.
